       "        'Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days. If you want to make sure\\xa0you’re finding a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out\\xa0EnergySage. EnergySage is a free service that makes it easy for you to go solar – whether you’re a homeowner or renter.

       "        'The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air\\xa0Mokes\\xa0make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?'],\n",

       "        'Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico\\xa0is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

Environmental Protection Agency\\xa0officials were not aware of the collapse until\\xa0contacted by the\\xa0Windsor Star\\xa0on Wednesday.The Windsor Star’s story about the spill is dated Thursday December 5.The site contains nuclear materials because during the Manhattan Project, the plant was used to help construct the atomic bomb. After World War II, uranium rods were constructed there. It is rated high for residual contamination.Canadian member of parliament Brian Masse believes the incident should be investigated by the International Joint Commission and the US and Canadian governments. Masse said:An immediate study should be conducted on the dangers presented to the Detroit waterways and Great Lakes region. Forty million people use the Great Lakes for drinking water, and the ecosystem is already fragile. Any potential threat should be investigated immediately on both sides of the border.Photo: Nick Brancaccio/Windsor StarRenewable Independent Power Producers has officially opened a 1.2-megawatt solar facility near Willow, Alaska, which is north of Anchorage. It is the state’s largest solar farm and is expected to come online this month.The solar farm took two years to build and has more than 3,000 panels. “The farm will sell its energy to the Matanuska Electric Association at wholesale cost,” according to KTVA.The farm is expected to produce enough energy for 200 homes and offset 2 million pounds of carbon dioxide annually. (For perspective, in 2019, the estimated population of Alaska is 735,720.)According to the Associated Press, “The Alaska Energy Authority’s Power Project Fund loan program provided about half of the project’s $1.5 million funding, while the rest came from private capital.”The Wyoming Industrial Siting Council has approved a 277-turbine wind farm on the border of Albany and Carbon counties, according to the Associated Press. (Yes, I think it’s amusing that a wind farm is going into a county called Carbon.)The developer, Canada-headquartered BluEarth Renewables, is required to prioritize locals for jobs, and also provide bonding of $33.1 million for decommissioning and reclamation.The project is expected to employ 400 workers during peak construction in 2022. Construction is estimated to cost around $1 billion. It will take about 19 months to build the wind farm.Australia’s ABC reports that of the country’s more than 9 million homes:The majority rate below three stars for energy efficiency under the Nationwide House Energy Rating System (NatHERS). NatHERS data is not the most comprehensive but it does show that the energy performance of older Australian homes is well below that of newer properties.A zero-star rating means the ‘building shell does practically nothing to reduce the discomfort of hot or cold weather” while 10 stars indicate the “home may not need any artificial cooling or heating to keep you comfortable.’Those residents who suffer the most as a result of a poor NathHERS rating are renters — landlords simply don’t see the benefits. Rental properties are less likely to have insulation, window treatments, and solar panels.In November, 40 housing and charity organizations renewed calls for state and federal governments to require minimum energy efficiency standards for rental properties.In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree this year.Photo: Nadine Shaabana/Unsplash'],\n",

Natural gas may not be as toxic as coal, but it is still very much a fossil fuel. And it’s natural gas that’s driving up carbon emissions this year.Authors of the Global Carbon Project attributed this year’s rise in emissions to natural gas and oil growth, which offsets the falls in coal use.According to AFP:“We see clearly that global changes come from fluctuations in coal use,” said Corrine Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, an author on the Carbon [Project] report.“In contrast the use of oil and particularly natural gas is going up unabated. Natural gas is now the biggest contributor to the growth in emissions.”“Compared to coal, natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel, but unabated natural gas use merely cooks the planet more slowly than coal,” said Glen Peters, research director at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research.Yesterday, the Natural Gas Supply Association, a trade association that represents Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Cabot, and Southwestern Energy, unanimously announced that they are in favor of a carbon tax.The Houston Chronicle says the association “broadly supports putting a price on carbon while also eliminating existing regulations on carbon and delivering revenues not to government but directly to American consumers.”If you want an overview of how natural gas is extracted and used, watch this video from Student Energy:The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed to weaken regulations on mercury emissions and fine particulates from coal-fired plants.Six economists said that the EPA’s proposed rollback ignores healthcare costs. Weakening regulations could save coal plants a few billion dollars total, while costing the public tens of billions in healthcare costs.Reuters reports:“Instead of weighing all the costs against all the benefits, the EPA is cherry picking,” said Yale University’s Matthew Kotchen, who released a report on the agency’s proposal with the other economists. “They pulled the biggest public health benefit off the scale.”Several of the authors of the report, including Kotchen, were on the EPA’s Environmental Economics Advisory Committee that was part of the agency’s independent science advisory board for 25 years.The authors are now on the External Environmental Economics Advisory Committee, an independent group that says it provides nonpartisan advice on EPA programs.Germany will close all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2022. But where will the waste go? Or more specifically, where does one store 28,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste for 1 million years?France supports nuclear energy as green energy, but Germany opposes it. This very real quandary might have something to do with that stance. As we previously wrote in Electrek, “Nuclear has no scientific evidence for waste treatment, and that’s why it was not initially included.”Germany decided to close all of its plants after Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011.Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants are currently being stored in containers in temporary storage sites across the country, where they can cool down, which will take decades because they’re so hot.Germany wants to locate a permanent nuclear cemetery that would be at least 1 km underground. The location must be extremely stable geologically — no earthquakes or water flow.Once the storage location is chosen, it will be sealed sometime between 2130 and 2170.Here’s the mind-blower from CNN:Communications experts are already working on how to tell future generations thousands of years from now — when language will be completely different — not to disturb the site.Nate & Hila are, in their words, “a duo of emcees/writers/performers who create ecological, sociological, and philosophical songs, videos, and live shows.” Nate Oglesby’s day job is teaching Latin language and Greek civilization at City College of New York. Hila Perry is a performance artist from New York and Tel Aviv.They made this fun 4.5-minute-long video with a serious message and 20 ideas about how to transition into green energy.

       "        'US and European insurers are now refusing to cover coal, yet the Independent reports that UK banks are still loaning money to finance new coal plants (in addition to many other global banks). Throw in new Energy of Secretary Dan Brouillette’s rather bizarre statement this week that “coal has a bright future,” and it’s apparent that the demise of coal isn’t going to be entirely straightforward.Further, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to weaken regulations on mercury emissions and fine particulates from coal-fired plants. But six economists say the EPA is ignoring the fact that weakening the regulation would cost billions in healthcare.Of the EPA’s proposal to weaken coal-plant regulations that would cut down harmful emissions, Reuters reports:“Instead of weighing all the costs against all the benefits, the EPA is cherry picking,” said Yale University’s Matthew Kotchen, who released a report on the agency’s proposal with the other economists. “They pulled the biggest public health benefit off the scale.”Several of the authors of the report, including Kotchen, were on the EPA’s Environmental Economics Advisory Committee that was part of the agency’s independent science advisory board for 25 years.The authors are now on the External Environmental Economics Advisory Committee, an independent group that says it provides nonpartisan advice on EPA programs.So the scientists feel it’s bad for both the environment and for health. And it looks like the insurance companies are getting the message. Whether it’s because they truly want to fight climate change, or recognize that it’s not good business to insure a dying industry remains unclear, but they’re pulling out.The number of insurers withdrawing cover for coal projects more than doubled in 2019. US companies have joined European companies, leaving Lloyd’s of London and Asian insurers as the holdouts.“Most coal projects cannot be financed, built or operated without insurance,” reports the Guardian.On Monday, the day the UN climate summit launched in Madrid, Insurance Enterprise Risk Management held a conference called Insurance & Climate Risk EMEA 2019 in London. One of the sessions was called, “2019 Scorecard Feedback on Insurance, Coal, and Climate Change.” It was due to cover:Meanwhile, the Independent (being a British paper) named and shamed UK banks who are still lending to coal, with almost £25 billion ($32 billion) going to coal plants. It reports that Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Royal Bank of Scotland provided funding after the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement was adopted.All four of those banks are on the Netherlands-headquartered NGO BankTrack’s 2018 list of private banks who are still lending to coal, and the UK leads in coal bank loans in Europe. The top 6 on that list are all in Asia, with the US’s Citigroup coming in at No. 7. (Click on the link above to see the entire list.) China dominates the underwriting, at 72.6% — although that went from $127.6 billion in 2016 to $66 billion in 2018.Let’s look at this from a purely financial perspective for a minute. Coal plants are shutting down like crazy in the US and Europe, insurance companies are quickly pulling away from insuring them, and scientists have declared that coal costs an absolute fortune in healthcare costs.On the US front, on September 17, Electrek\\xa0reported that US coal shipments are at its lowest level in 36 years. And on October 29, Electrek\\xa0reported\\xa0that the US’s largest private coal company filed for bankruptcy.And yet the world’s private banks — even though the amounts are shrinking — are still lending to a dying industry. It’s a given that it’s terrible for the planet and its people. But how is that smart business?']],\n",

       "0     Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle ...  \n",
       "1     The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister ...  \n",
       "2     Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs.

       "3     VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features.

Natural gas may not be as toxic as coal, but it is still very much a fossil fuel. And it’s natural gas that’s driving up carbon emissions this year.Authors of the Global Carbon Project attributed this year’s rise in emissions to natural gas and oil growth, which offsets the falls in coal use.According to AFP:“We see clearly that global changes come from fluctuations in coal use,” said Corrine Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, an author on the Carbon [Project] report.“In contrast the use of oil and particularly natural gas is going up unabated. Natural gas is now the biggest contributor to the growth in emissions.”“Compared to coal, natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel, but unabated natural gas use merely cooks the planet more slowly than coal,” said Gl...  \n",

Throw in new Energy of Secretary Dan Brouillette’s rather bizarre statement this week that “coal has a bright future,” and it’s apparent that the demise of coal isn’t going to be entirely straightforward.Further, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to weaken regulations on mercury emissions and fine particulates from coal-fired plants. But six economists say the EPA is ignoring the fact that weakening the regulation would cost billions in healthcare.Of the EPA’s proposal to weaken coal-plant regulations that would cut down harmful emissions, Reuters reports:“Instead of weighing all the costs against all the benefits, the EPA is cherry picking,” said Yale University’s Matthew Kotchen, who released a report on the agency’s proposal with the other economists. “They pulled the b...  \n",

       "array(['Montgomery County, Maryland, will be the US East Coast’s first county to ban natural gas in new buildings.Montgomery County will require all new construction to only use electric energy equipment. Montgomery County, which is just north of Washington, DC, has a population of just over 1 million, so this is an impactful decision for the region.That means specifically that all new buildings in the county will need to go electric for heating, hot water heating, and cooking from the end of 2026. However, income-restricted housing and schools will have until the end of 2027.The Montgomery County Council backed the gas limits with a 9-0 vote, and the county executive is expected to sign off on Bill 13-22, “Comprehensive Building Decarbonization.”About half of the county’s emissions come from buildings, so environmental groups welcomed the decision. Mike Tidwell, director of climate change public policy advocate group CCAN Action Fund, said about Bill 13-22 on November 17:Our safety and health will benefit from a move to all-electric buildings, and we will be doing our part to address climate change.Unsurprisingly, the natural gas industry isn’t as enthusiastic. E&E News reports:Representatives from Washington Gas Light Co., which distributes gas to over a million customers in Montgomery County and the Washington area, said the ban focused on electrification “while dismissing other proven opportunities for decarbonization,” like mixing hydrogen into the natural gas system.“We urge the Council to consider a more holistic approach to decarbonization, one that puts affordability, reliability, resiliency, and security at the forefront,” wrote the company in a July 26 filing to the County Council.Electrification brings higher upfront costs to developers but lower operating costs in the long run.Only two West Coast states, California and Washington, have banned\\xa0the sale of all new\\xa0natural gas-fired heaters and water heaters by 2030.Here in Ontario, Canada, despite relatively cheap electricity, it’s still much more expensive to heat homes electrically than with natural gas. So the assertion of lower long term cost for electricity would be incorrect here. And I doubt it’s true in Maryland, either.To date, no East Coast state has passed a natural gas ban. Massachusetts has a program that allows up to 10 cities to enact a natural gas ban, and New York State is considering one.Read more: The largest electric school bus fleet in the US just launched in MarylandPhoto: Pixabay on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

NODE’s designs are sometimes referred to as the “IKEA of houses,” and their houses are designed to be built quickly — by four people in two weeks — and inexpensively.Node offers options such as solar panels, composting toilets, and water collection and storage. Further, it uses recycled denim, sand, and recycled glass for insulation.And another neat thing about Node houses, besides being eco-friendly and user-friendly? They’re beautiful.

The storied brand has just unveiled two new electric bicycles in the Bianchi T-Tronik line: The T-Tronik C-Type and T-Tronik T-Type.The new models, designed as city bikes and touring bikes respectively, make use of Shimano E6100 mid-drive motors to provide electric assist.That motor is rated for 250W of continuous power and provides a maximum of 60Nm of torque, placing it near the middle of the range of mid-drive power levels available from major e-bike drive system manufacturers. The bikes reach a top speed under electric assist of 25 km/h (15.5 mph), which is the maximum allowable speed under European e-bike laws. Riders can still pedal up to higher speeds, but the motor will not provide assist past the 25 km/h electronic limit.For energy storage, the bikes come paired with a 417 Wh battery produced by the major e-bike battery manufacturer Phylion.

The 49-pound two-wheeler comes in at just 16 x 33 x 25-inches when completely folded up.A 400Wh battery provides between 40 to 80 miles on a single charge depending on your speed. There are four different power modes to choose from that can serve up to 250% of the power from a typical human. It tops at 20mph thanks to its lightweight and aerodynamic design that is made for riders as little as five feet tall. Tern is using Kickstarter to fund its latest creation but it already has an impressive network of 125 dealers in the United States. A pledge of $3,100 will deliver a Vektron eBike in April if all goes to plan.Electric bikes let you e...</td>\n",

       "1     The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister ...   \n",

It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs.

After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features.

Riders will be able to receive turn-by-turn GPS directions and manage device features like messaging or music playback. Additionally, the built-in sensors are designed to track a variety of fitness data.Both models are made from Toray carbon fiber frames with the road bike weighing in at 18-pounds while the larger mountain version is listed at nearly 27. This is largely due to its SR Suntour XCR Air fork on the front and additional components made for rough terrain. LeEco has yet to release final pricing information on these two models.
