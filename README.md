## Description
The goal of this project is to create a classifier that can distinguish between Eletrek articles about Tesla, e-bikes and green energy. The classifier will take in a text input of an article and output a prediction of which category the article belongs to.

To achieve this, the project will use a machine learning algorithm to train a model on a dataset of labeled articles. The labeled dataset will include articles that are about Tesla, e-bikes or green energy. The model will be trained to learn the features and patterns that distinguish between these three categories of articles.

The machine learning algorithm that will be used for this project could be any number of algorithms, including but not limited to decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), or neural networks.

Once the model is trained, it will be evaluated on a separate set of test data to ensure that it is able to generalize to new, unseen articles.

The final product will be a Python script that takes in an Eletrek article as input and outputs a prediction of whether the article is about Tesla, e-bikes or green energy. The script can be used by Eletrek to help automate the process of categorizing their articles and to improve the overall efficiency of their editorial workflow.
