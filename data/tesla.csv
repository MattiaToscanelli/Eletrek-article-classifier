2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/03/23,"Tesla has launched new extended service warranties for its electric vehicles that can be purchased straight from its mobile app.
Like combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles have two main warranties – the vehicle (or bumper-to-bumper) warranty and a powertrain warranty. For electric vehicles, the latter is for the battery pack and electric motor.
Tesla has a leading powertrain warranty for eight years or 192,000 to 240,000 km (120,000 to 150,000 miles), depending on the model. As for the vehicle warranty, it’s fairly standard, meaning four years or 80,000 km, whichever comes first. Tesla has occasionally offered extended vehicle warranties.
Today, the automaker has launched a new offering, and it is selling it directly through its mobile app:
As noted, the agreement is for a period of two years or 25,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
Here is the pricing for each different model:
Here’s the full vehicle extended warranty agreement:
Bottom line is - if tesla thought this would cost them more in repairs than they make in profits, they wouldn't offer this.  They're doing this because they think its overpriced and they'll win out on the deal.
Over the years, I had three Tesla vehicles go off vehicle warranty, and I currently have two of them. I had very little issue with them and certainly nothing that would cost anything close to those amounts.
If it’s something you are worried about, you are probably better off putting that same amount in a savings account. Most likely after two years when this warranty expires, you would still have some, if not all, of that money.
That said, everyone should decide for themselves what is best for them, and that’s why it is great to have the option.
One thing that is a bit concerning is the inclusion into the mobile app. I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla starts sending out notifications to sell them at times, especially if it needs some money at the end of a quarter.

2023/03/23,"Tesla told employees that it expects to lose the full $7,500 federal tax credit on its cheapest electric car because the batteries come from China.
Since January, some electric automakers have been enjoying a surge in demand thanks to the new federal tax credit program for electric vehicles coming into place.
Tesla has been the biggest winner since its buyers completely lost access to the tax credit years ago after the automaker hit 200,000 deliveries in the US.
For the last three months, eligible buyers in the US could get a $7,500 tax credit on all Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, which are the automaker’s two cheapest and most popular models.
However, we knew that things would change by the end of March.
When the new tax credit program was announced, it included requirements for battery production in North America and battery material sourcing in countries with free trade agreements with the US in order to get access to up to half of $7,500 credit.
But the guidance on how these requirements would work was not released in time for the new tax credit coming into effect in January, and therefore, they were waived until the second quarter.
By then, the IRS has been expected to release detailed guidance about how those requirements will be accounted for.
Now Electrek has learned from sources familiar with the matter that Tesla has communicated to employees that it expects the IRS to release the guidance any day now, and the automaker expects to lose the full credit on the Model 3 Standard Range – its cheapest vehicle.
I just bought a model y last night for delivery this week. There is inventory now for immediate delivery. 52k price + taxes and fees. I will refi if I can get a better rate than Tesla fi. With California rebate and federal there is $9500 to $15000 in rebates possible! 
I'm sure MY prices will come down a bit as production ramps this year, but with those tax credits it is a great deal for me. 
Hopefully Tesla unlimited charge at night for $30/mo plan is available this summer. 
The Model 3 Standard Range is built in Fremont, California, in the US, but its battery pack is using LFP battery cells built in China.
The communication to employees appears to have been done to prepare buyers of those vehicles, as the access to the full credit could change if delivery is done on April 1 rather than March 31 – pending official guidance.
As for Tesla’s other Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in the US, they are expected to retain access to the full tax credit as they are using battery cells built by Tesla or Panasonic in Nevada, California, or Texas.
The battery material sourcing might be more of an issue, but Tesla appears confident that it won’t be the case as a large percentage of its battery materials are sourced from countries with free trade agreements like Australia and Canada.

2023/03/22,"Tesla Model 3 used prices are now down 21.5% since last year’s peak. On average, the used price of Tesla’s cheapest vehicle is down by more than $11,000.
Due to the high demand and short supply of new EVs, used EV prices went up at an impressive rate last year. At one point last year, used Tesla Model Y prices went out of control and started to sell at higher prices than new Model Y vehicles.
But used prices finally started to come down in December as Tesla started to offer discounts at the end of the quarter. They have continued to come down over the last few months, particularly after Tesla implemented massive price cuts throughout its entire lineup and the new federal EV tax credit came into effect.
iSeeCars has been tracking used car prices and reports that the national average has fallen 4.7% over the last six months, and the Tesla Model 3 is leading the pack:
The latest iSeeCars.com analysis found used car prices have continued to fall over the past year, down 4.7 percent from September and 8.7 percent from a year ago. The Tesla Model 3 had the biggest price drop in the last 6 months, down 21.5 percent since September 2022.
Here are the leaders in price drops for used vehicles over the last six months:
They are only going to fall even lower as there are more and more of them on the used market. Tesla had an artificially high used resale value due to scarcity. That is no longer the case, new or used for Tesla. 

Add in HW4 for new vehicles and the addition of radar again they'll take another big hit. Who wants years old tech when a new one has the latest? Throw in IRA rebates for new, there is another hit to used market. 
However, the Model 3 doesn’t look so bad in the year-over-year comparison, where it is down 19.3%, which is similar to many other premium vehicles:
Most car buyers can’t afford a new car and turn to the used car market, which is a critical part of the auto industry.
When it comes to electrification, we always focus on the new car market since that’s what is needed to transition the industry, and it’s also what feeds the electric used car market, which is still a pretty young one. But it is growing fast and starting to be more exciting.
Last year, things got out of control, but you can now find some decent used electric cars these days. It’s not easy, but it’s doable. As for Model 3, I think you will start seeing some decent deals next year as more cars come off their leases.

2023/03/22,"Tesla has promised to plant double the number of trees that it will remove as part of the deforestation effort to build Gigafactory Mexico.
There are a lot of eyes on a piece of land spanning 4,200 acres just outside of Monterrey since Tesla confirmed its plan to build a gigafactory there.
Not much is known about the plant yet, as information has only been slowly released through Tesla and government officials. The massive size of the piece of land secured by Tesla was confirmed; it is twice as big as the land Tesla acquired for Gigafactory Texas.
The government confirmed that Tesla plans to spend about $5 billion to build the factory, which is going to employ 7,000 people directly and much more indirectly.
We also have a better idea of Tesla’s timeline for the factory. Tom Zhu, Tesla’s head of automotive and the person in charge of gigafactories, added that his team plans to build the factory at a record pace like Gigafactory Shanghai, which went from breaking ground to production in about nine months.
But Tesla first needs the permit to proceed and there have been indications that it could be issued as soon as this month.
Like with other Tesla gigafactory projects, it is expected that there could be some pushback from an environmental perspective, mainly due to the area’s deforestation needed to build.
This has been an issue for Tesla at Gigafactory Berlin and slowed down the process.
So I'm working with the translated text as listed above: ""Tesla will arrive by setting an example. I spoke with its director and he guaranteed me that they will reforest the area of Santa Catarina, where the gigafactory will be installed, with double the number of trees required by law on 1,600 hectares of land.""

What is the number required by law? The headline makes it seem like they will double the number of trees they are cutting down, but obviously that was not what stated (unless I'm missing some other number outside the quote).

This is a nice first step, but this sort of seems like this is Tesla throwing a bone to environmentalist rather than actually preserving the environment. I know certain sacrifices must be made to make overall improvements in the quest of sustainability and preservation, but unless the law is written in a way that has a meaningful number of trees (and the law makes native trees to the area a priority) then we could be left with sterile ornamental trees that provide little to none of the benefits that an actual native habitat provides. I just hope the Mexican government isn't missing the forest for the trees.
But it looks like Tesla is being proactive with Gigafactory Mexico as Samuel García, Governor of Nuevo Leon, announced that Tesla told him it has a strong reforestation plan:
. @Tesla llegará poniendo el ejemplo. Hablé con su director y me garantizó que reforestarán la zona de Santa Catarina, donde se instalará la gigafactory, con el doble de árboles requeridos por la ley en 1600 hectáreas de terreno.
Here’s the tweet’s translation: 
Tesla will arrive by setting an example. I spoke with its director and he guaranteed me that they will reforest the area of Santa Catarina, where the gigafactory will be installed, with double the number of trees required by law on 1,600 hectares of land.
This should go a long way in appeasing concerns with the deforestation that is going to be required to build Gigafactory Mexico.
There’s no new information about the timing for the permit, but it’s clear Tesla is ready to move fast.

2023/03/21,"Tesla is taking delivery of another of the world’s largest press at Gigafactory Texas, and it is again expected to be used for Cybertruck production.
Last year, Idra, the maker of Tesla’s large casting press, teased a new 9,000-ton Giga Press that would take the prize as the largest in the world. Considering Tesla’s relationship with Idra, it was rumored that the new machine would be for the automaker.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has since confirmed that the machine is going to be used for the Cybertruck body at Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla’s investment in larger cast parts has been extremely successful so far. The automaker managed to produce the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle, and it is doing the same with the front underbody. This greatly simplifies the manufacturing process and reduces costs.
Following the success of the integration of large casting technology, several other automakers are reportedly looking to follow in Tesla’s footsteps. Idra reported last year that half a dozen other automakers are currently in talks to adopt the technology, but it could take years before they can integrate it into any vehicle programs.
But as for Tesla, the automaker is already moving into a wider integration of the technology, including with the Cybertruck, which is going to have even larger single-casting parts.
""In January, Tesla was spotted taking delivery of the massive 9-ton casting press, the biggest one in the world. Over the last few months since the delivery, Idra has been teasing the preparation for the shipment of another 9-ton press and obviously, Tesla was rumored to again be the client.""
""The automaker also has a few 6-ton Giga Press units for Model Y production at the same factory.""
""At this point, it’s not clear if both 9-ton Giga Press are going to be needed…""

Don't you even do a quick look before publishing? In five references to the ""Gigapresses"" you correctly state capacity of 9,000 tons for the first and then you are off by a factor of 1,000 on the next four.
In January, Tesla was spotted taking delivery of the massive 9-ton casting press, the biggest one in the world. Over the last few months since the delivery, Idra has been teasing the preparation for the shipment of another 9-ton press and obviously, Tesla was rumored to again be the client.
Today, we can confirm that the new press is indeed for Tesla and that it has arrived in Texas. Cybertruck Forum user Greggrtruck found the bill of lading that confirms Tesla is the client and that it has arrived at the port of Houston:
The new Giga Press is bound for Gigafactory Texas in Austin. Once it is installed, Tesla is going to have the two largest presses in the world. They are both expected to be used for Cybertruck production. The automaker also has a few 6-ton Giga Press units for Model Y production at the same factory.
Tesla aims to start Cybertruck production this summer, but volume production is not expected until 2024. At this point, it’s not clear if both 9-ton Giga Press are going to be needed for the start of production or if the second one is meant to be used to achieve higher volumes.

2023/03/21,"Tesla (TSLA) stock is surging amid data coming out of China, showing that the automaker will likely deliver a strong quarter in this important market.
At the time of writing, Tesla’s stock is up 6%, while the market is up about 1%.
This surge comes after the China Merchants Bank International released car insurance registration data; the data shows 106,915 new Tesla vehicles registered in China between January 1 to March 19.
It is tracking ahead of the last quarter, which was a record quarter for Tesla in China, with 122,038 cars delivered.
With almost two weeks left in the quarter and Tesla often delivering more vehicles over the last few weeks of a quarter, the automaker is expected to beat its latest record in China.
China is a critical market for Tesla and electric vehicles in general. Tesla’s performance in China often makes the difference in whether it has a good quarter.
The increase in sales comes after Tesla slashed prices globally. The price cuts came to China first in early January.
Everything points to Tesla having a great quarter for deliveries in Q1 2023.
Fred, you wrote,  ""However, the attention is going to be on Tesla’s gross margin. The price cuts successfully boost sales, but they will negatively affect its gross margin."" Of course when you significantly drop prices you are going to lower your gross % profit margin. Also, even if Tesla vastly increased their sales their profit would increase but not their % of profit margin. IMO, the important goal is to grow demand/production/sales while still earning a credible profit.


Over the last few years, ending in 12/31/2022, Tesla had the major slice of the  US BEV  market pie, AND they could raise prices because the legacies were barely in the game. I still expect Tesla to dominate but their % of market will decrease simply because others are beginning to sell BEVs (although not in significant numbers in my opinion). The fact that Tesla maintained such a high % of the market share  could be credited to Tesla's focus and committment to manufacturing and delivering  BEVs and the legacies were not.  Yes I know the legacies have big plans, building new factories, new strategic alliances ... I wish them great success. IMO one of the reasons the legacies were slow to market with their BEV/ZEVs is due to the impressive profits their ICEV operations were generating.  



Legacy future BEV success will lower Tesla's market share% but Tesla will likely continue to produce impressive numbers and the legacies BEV gains will be at their ICEV's expense.  It isn't reocket science.
However, the attention is going to be on Tesla’s gross margin. The price cuts successfully boost sales, but they will negatively affect its gross margin.
The good news for Tesla is that it had industry-leading gross margins. They are large enough to eat the price cuts, but investors are hoping for Tesla to still be in the double digits gross margin.
In Q4 2022, Tesla had a record of 405,000 deliveries globally. Investors are hoping for Tesla to beat that – likely only marginally. 
The company has the capacity to produce about 2 million vehicles in 2023, and it wants 10 times that by 2030. Not many people outside of Tesla fans believe that it is possible, but there weren’t many people who believed Tesla would get to a capacity of one million people. But it did – and more.

2023/03/21,"A new report states that Tesla engineers tried to convince Elon Musk not to give up on radar for its Autopilot and self-driving effort.
Tesla has a weird history with radar sensors for its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving vehicle programs.
The automaker decided to remove its front-facing radar and, more recently, the ultrasonic sensors from its sensor suite.
It’s all part of its “Tesla Vision” approach, where the automaker believes that the best way to achieve self-driving capability is through cameras being the only sensors. The logic is that the roads are designed to be operated by humans who operate cars through vision (eyes) and biological neural nets (brain).
Tesla believes that the best way to replicate that is through cameras to replace the eyes and neural nets running on a computer to replace the brain.
The company removed the radars on its vehicles in 2021 and removed the ultrasonic sensors last year.
However, we now learn that not everyone at Tesla was on board with this significant change.
A new report from SF Gate, which claims to have talked to several former Tesla employees, describes an effort to try to convince Musk not to remove the radar:
Some Tesla engineers were aghast, said former employees with knowledge of his reaction, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. They contacted a trusted former executive for advice on how to talk Musk out of it, in previously unreported pushback. Without radar, Teslas would be susceptible to basic perception errors if the cameras were obscured by raindrops or even bright sunlight, problems that could lead to crashes.
The report claimed that Musk overruled a significant number of engineers who tried to warn that removing the radar would be problematic.
The report goes as far as linking the removal of the radar to an uptick in accidents related to Tesla Autopilot:
Musk was unconvinced and overruled his engineers. In May 2021 Tesla announced it was eliminating radar on new cars. Soon after, the company began disabling radar in cars already on the road. The result, according to interviews with nearly a dozen former employees and test drivers, safety officials and other experts, was an uptick in crashes, near misses and other embarrassing mistakes by Tesla vehicles suddenly deprived of a critical sensor.
However, the situation was a little more complicated than that. Electrek spoke to Musk around the time of the removal of the radar, and the CEO was mostly frustrated with the quality of the radars and still believed that higher definition radars would improve Autopilot/Full Self-Driving.
He told Electrek:
A very high resolution radar would be better than pure vision, but such a radar does not exist. I mean vision with high res radar would be better than pure vision.
Sure enough, two years later, Tesla is now including a high-resolution radar in its latest sensor suite for Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.
I’m trying to find the logic behind going to just cameras because that’s the way humans operate vehicles (sight). Isn’t the whole idea of (semi) autonomous driving to use technology to improve on human capabilities?
The report also claimed that Musk had several Tesla Autopilot engineers, even Ashok Elluswamy, the head of Autopilot and self-driving software, work on Twitter.
I am sure that many people at Tesla weren’t happy about removing the radar. It’s not exactly surprising. Honestly, I am more concerned about the claim in the report that Musk had Tesla Autopilot/Self-Driving engineers work on Twitter.
That’s ridiculous.
Tesla is years behind its self-driving promises; all its staff should be solely focused on making right on those promises. Having them work on Twitter is laughing in the face of Tesla customers who paid up to $15,000 for the Full Self-Driving package.
",tesla
2023/03/20,"Tesla is expanding its new sales strategy of using virtual sales advisers with remote test drive locations to Europe.
In the summer of 2021, Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was implementing a new sales strategy. At the time, we reported that the main changes were that the automaker was moving away from high-rent locations in malls and shopping districts in favor of delivery centers and remote test drives.
The strategy is again focused on online sales, but Tesla has recognized that physical presence is still necessary to enable test drives.
When someone used to place an order for a Tesla vehicle online in North America, the customer was assigned a “Tesla Advisor” at their local store to help manage the process leading up to the delivery.
Instead, Tesla started to assign orders to “virtual sales advisors” not assigned to any specific stores, and customers could go to cheap remote test drive locations with Tesla vehicles in parking lots.
The company has been gradually implementing this new strategy in North America. Tesla has now expanded its strategy to Europe with its first remote test drive hub location in Sweden:
Our first remote test drive hub in Europe is now open in Örebro, Sweden 🇸🇪 pic.twitter.com/qtPR7oLFFD
I'd like to see how this works out.  Not a bad idea but some people tend to find ways to abuse things that are unattended.  
Tesla explains the simple process of using the location:
Book an appointment at http://tesla.com → call us when you’ve arrived → we remotely unlock the vehicle for you & walk you through the basics → test drive for 30 mins → drop off vehicle at the same location.
This enables Tesla to operate these locations with very few staff. The company simply needs to make sure those vehicles stay clean and charged.
When we first reported on the new strategy in 2021, sources told Electrek that Tesla was already seeing some success with the first few locations in the US. 
Now that the company is expanding this strategy in Europe, we have to assume that the automaker is happy with it and has decided to implement it in new markets.

2023/03/20,"A new survey of American truck drivers shows that many of them are getting ready to go electric, but the majority of them don’t even believe Tesla Cybertruck is a “real truck.”
American Trucks is behind the survey and described its intention with it:
While electric vehicles have been in high demand in recent years, electric pickup trucks have taken longer to hit the market. Now that we’re starting to see more models available, which ones are people most excited about, and what do current truck drivers think of them? We surveyed hundreds of Americans, both truck owners/drivers and non-truck owners/drivers, to find out.
Historically, truck drivers have been more resistant to the electric transition, and there’s a good reason for that.
While range is becoming a nonissue for most passenger vehicle use, if you are using your truck to actually do work, like pulling a heavy trailer, it will indeed limit your range greatly.
The survey shows that 35% of truck drivers are considering going electric this decade and most of them over the next five years:
Here are the most popular electric pickup trucks that current truck drivers are most excited about:
Interestingly, the survey also included nontruck drivers. If you isolate them, the Tesla Cybertruck becomes the most anticipated electric pickup truck:
""Tesla is saying that the Cybertruck is going into production this summer, but most truck drivers surveyed believe it is still at least two years away.""

For them, that is true.  For the most part, people who drive pickups didn't put down a deposit on the Cybertruck, so there are about a million people ahead of them in line.  If half of those drop out, it would still take at least two years for production to ramp up enough to satisfy the backlog.
The difference seems to be that truck drivers don’t see Cybertruck as a “real truck.”
Of the truck drivers surveyed, 56% answered no to the question: “Do you think Tesla’s Cybertruck is a ‘real’ truck?”
Tesla is saying that the Cybertruck is going into production this summer, but most truck drivers surveyed believe it is still at least two years away.
Truck drivers are looking for longer ranges, more charging stations, and faster charge times to help convince them to go electric.

2023/03/20,"Tesla has finally started the broad rollout of Full Self-Driving Beta v11, a significant update that is Autopilto with the Full Self-Driving Beta software stack.
Tesla FSD Beta v11 is both an exciting and scary step as it is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot highway stacks.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level 2 driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
Since the wider release of the beta last year, there are currently over 400,000 Tesla owners in the program in North America – virtually every Tesla owner who bought the FSD package on their vehicles.
However, the bulk of these owners had yet to receive significant FSD beta updates as Tesla was supposed to release v11 to the fleet in November 2022, but the update has been stuck in testing within Tesla’s closed fleet since then.
The update is an important step because it includes many new neural networks, as Elon Musk stated. But from a consumer perspective, it’s also important because it is expected to merge Tesla’s FSD Beta software stack primarily used on roads and city streets with Tesla’s Autopilot software stack, which is used as a level 2 driver assist system on highways.
It has been delayed several times, but it finally went to a closed beta release last month. Tesla is slowly releasing it to more beta testers, but it had yet to go to a broader release.
I love this website but the FSD Beta stories are 90%+ the same piece copy and pasted.  Sometimes with a bit of new info but today there is basically none or at most one sentence worth.

More useful would be feedback on whether the new release was better or worse on highways than AP and then perhaps how it was doing on other roads.
CEO Elon Musk kept saying that it is about a week away from a broader release since last month, and last week, he said it was coming this weekend.
This time was the right one. Tesla has now started to propagate FSD Beta 11.3.2 (2022.45.11) to more vehicles this weekend.
Tesla owners with FSD Beta across North America are reporting having received the update over the weekend. However, you don’t have to panic if you haven’t received it yet. It seems that while Tesla has started a wider rollout, the update is still being gradually deployed.
As usual, be careful testing the new software. You should always keep your hands on the steering wheel and be ready to take control at all times.

2023/03/17,"GM’s Cadillac is going after Tesla’s clientele in a not-so-subtle way by setting up test drives directly at a Tesla Supercharger station.
How can you find people who like electric vehicles? If you find Tesla owners, you likely found people who are into electric vehicles. Where can you find Tesla owners? Supercharger stations are a safe bet.
Not only will you find Tesla owners there, but they will have to stay there for a little while with not much else to do – Cadillac saw an opportunity in that situation.
In Shanghai, General Motors was spotted setting up shop at a Tesla Supercharger station to offer test drives in a Cadillac Lyriq:
WTF look what's happening Cadillac sales team are currently parked outside of Shanghai Jinqiao Supercharger.Approaching Tesla Owners and trying to offer free test drive.Competition is great but this is Tesla’s territory. Shameless cold calling by Cadillac. @Tesla @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/bmvoC7aVj9
Tesla drivers were spotted getting quick test drives in the electric SUV while waiting for their own cars to charge.
The Cadillac Lyriq starts at RMB 479,700 or about $70,000 USD in China; therefore, it only competes with the higher-end of Tesla’s lineup in the country.
It’s not the first time that companies have directly targeted Tesla and its customers to try to sell their own EVs.
It's a group that's interested in EVs, but it's also a group of people who already have an EV, most likely a late model one. 

They'd be better off parking near gas stations, and telling homeowners with cars that they'd never have to stop to pump gas again.

There's a huge market for cars and a huge potential customer base. You won't see Tesla trying to offer drives in front of a different EV maker because almost all Tesla owners started off with an ICE and replaced it with a Tesla. If you ignore that group and focus on people who already have one of what you are selling, you're targeting the wrong people. 
It was a very popular practice after Tesla received hundreds of thousands of reservations for the Model 3. Nissan released an “attack ad” against Tesla’s reservation process for the Model 3, and BMW did the same to try to sell its plug-in hybrids.
I’m not mad at this. I don’t get the “territory” comment. As long as they are not blocking any charging station and parking in a public space, it’s fair game in my opinion.
Now the tactic also has its downside – mainly the fact that being at a Supercharger station highlights that Tesla has a big advantage with having its own charging network.
However, this advantage is slowly going away as the automaker opens up the charging network to other electric vehicles.

2023/03/17,"Tesla has released a new mobile app update that gives owners better insights into their vehicle’s battery pack, among other things.
The mobile app is at the center of the Tesla ownership experience.
It is used to unlock and start a Tesla vehicle, and whenever the owner is not in the vehicle, it has some powerful features that can control charging, climate, and virtually everything to do with Tesla vehicles.
The automaker regularly pushes new updates to improve the app, and today we reported on a new one (Tesla App 4.19 via Not A Tesla App).
One of the primary improvements is to the charging tab:
When a Tesla vehicle has been parked in the cold for an extended period of time, it loses some battery capacity until it warms up. 
Now owners will get better insights into how much capacity they are losing:
stoked to see the 2 charging levels and ability to soak up excess solar generation.  i made this exact request in a survey Tesla sent me a while back.  while probably not deserved, i'll take credit for this feature. 😂
In this update, Tesla has also added the capacity to manage charging membership:
In addition to Manage Payment and History, there is now a new ‘Membership’ option to manage your membership for charging non-Teslas. In this menu, you’ll be able to sign up, cancel or renew your charging membership. The charging membership lowers the price per kW at Superchargers for non-Teslas, although there is a five session limit per day.
Finally, as we previously reported, Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.
We now learn that Tesla is appropriately calling the feature “Drive on Sunshine”:
It looks like the feature will not be available in every market at first. The company is going to make at available in specific markets.

2023/03/16,"Tesla has submitted its environmental application to expand Gigafactory Berlin to produce one million vehicles per year.
When ramping up a new vehicle to volume production at a new factory, Tesla generally considers 5,000 units per week to be the goal.
After starting production late in 2021, Tesla originally aimed to achieve that at Gigafactory Berlin by the end of 2022.
But the goal was ambitious amid a continuing global supply chain crisis.
Instead, Tesla announced that it finished the year with a respectable production rate of 3,000 Model Y vehicles per week at Gigafactory Berlin.
Last month, Tesla confirmed that the factory has managed to continue the ramp to 4,000 vehicles per week.
The automaker is expected to hit its goal of 5,000 units per week relatively soon.
In the meantime, it is already looking to expand its factory. Gigafactory Berlin is currently approved for a production capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year.
We now learn that Tesla has submitted its environmental application for the expansion, confirming that it aims to ramp up to one million units per year (translated from German via RBB):
According to Tesla, the application for partial approval that has now been submitted to the responsible State Office for the Environment (LfU) primarily relates to changes to the existing plant. It serves to further expand production on the factory premises. As a spokesman for the LfU announced, Tesla has applied for an increase in production capacity from the current 500,000 vehicles per year to one million vehicles per year in the future. The production facilities required for this are to be set up on the existing factory premises. However, the mark of 500,000 cars per year has not yet been reached.
Thank you, Fred, for reporting the water use portion of the application more clearly than I have read elsewhere.  You've made it clear that Tesla claims to be able to double capacity without exceeding the existing water use permit because they are currently using far less water than the amount for which they are permitted.
With the initial phase of the factory, Tesla faced a lot of pushback from environmental groups for a variety of reasons ranging from deforestation to water usage.
Lately, water usage has been the biggest concern, and Tesla made sure to address that in its application for expansion.
The automaker claims that it won’t need more fresh water than already approved thanks to its water reuse program:
Tesla has optimized planning and production processes in such a way that the amounts of fresh water previously used as a basis and contractually agreed are also sufficient for this expansion.
We expect the company to still have to battle with environmentalists for the expansion, but the automaker has strong support from local politicians, which should help move things forward.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.
Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.
Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.
Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.
A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:
– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4J
The feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:
“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”
It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.
This is a good move, long overdue.

Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.

Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.
We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.
There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?
I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.

2023/03/15,"Tesla Supercharger V4 has been revealed to have the potential to be twice as powerful as the previous generation.
We are finally starting to get a little more information about the specs of the Supercharger V4, the latest generation of Tesla’s popular DC fast-charging station.
Last year, we reported on Tesla’s Supercharger V4 design being revealed in the plans for a new station. Tesla is believed to be ramping up production of the new charger in order to start deployment soon. The new charger is expected to feature the potential for a higher charge rate (which is currently capped at 250 kW for the Supercharger V3) and a solution to allow CCS charging for non-Tesla electric vehicles.
The CCS solution was later revealed to be the Magic Dock. Thus far, we have only seen it deployed on Supercharger V3 stations, and the V4 had yet to show its face until earlier this month.
We reported that Tesla started to deploy its first known Supercharger V4 station in the Netherlands. However, the station was still covered at the time.
Yesterday, we reported a first look at the station, and today, Tesla officially launched it:
First V4 Supercharger stalls now open in Harderwijk 🇳🇱!Stalls are equipped with a longer cable, providing easy access for all EVs. pic.twitter.com/TnY3dBoyhP
But again, Tesla didn’t reveal any new information about the next-generation Supercharger other than the obvious: a longer cable.
However, thanks to local Tesla owners visiting the new charging station, we are learning a little more about its power.
A Tesla owner spotted the electric car specs of the charger, revealing a rated voltage of 1,000V and a rated current of 615A:
Sticker on the back of the new @Tesla V4 supercharger in The Netherlands #TeslaEurope @tesla_europe pic.twitter.com/5BsGvn41Iq
That would mean a total max power output of 600 kW. Of course, the top rated output is rarely something that is maintained or even achieved, but theoretically, that’s what the new Supercharger V4 can do.
The other limitation is at the car level. Most Tesla vehicles today won’t be able to accept half of that power, and that’s when they are almost entirely depleted. It could indicate where Tesla plans to go with its electric vehicles in the near future.
Would be curious to see the results of a Taycan charging there?  Currently Taycan's can't get their max charging capability at v3 superchargers, because of the voltage difference (800v on Taycan versus 400v from supercharger).
Also, we don’t know if Tesla splits that power – though that strategy is something that the automaker previously moved away from with the Supercharger v3.
The combination of a longer cable design with a higher output makes this update a significant one.
But the higher power output is not that important right now, considering the limitation is still on the vehicle side and will likely remain like that for a while. 
I think it’s not as big of an upgrade as v2 to v3, but it’s still a nice one.

2023/03/15,"Tesla is facing a new lawsuit instigated by an owner who is attempting to have Tesla give up its quasi-monopoly on repairing its vehicles.
Most people agree that Tesla bypassing the franchise car dealer model and going direct to consumers is an asset for the company.
Tesla is removing the intermediary between the automaker and the consumer for both selling and servicing its vehicles.
However, there’s a downside for the consumer, which is that Tesla has almost complete control over repairing and servicing its vehicles.
Now Tesla doesn’t technically have a full monopoly on Tesla vehicle repair. I am, for instance, getting my Tesla vehicles serviced by a third-party service center, Simon André Voitures Electriques in Trois-Rivières.
But it’s not easy since the few shops that went into the complicated and expensive process to support Tesla vehicles still rely on Tesla to get parts.
In practice, most Tesla owners don’t have access to repair from anyone other than the automaker itself unless they are located in the few markets where they are third-party shops that can service and repair Tesla vehicles.
Now a Tesla owner in California has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the automaker because of the lack of access to repair (via Bloomberg):
The antitrust class action was filed Tuesday in San Francisco federal court on behalf of Virginia M. Lambrix, who lives in Sonoma County and owns a Tesla Model S. She says owners of traditional combustion engine cars have multiple options for maintenance and repairs, or do the work themselves. Those repairs can rely on parts from the original manufacturer or parts made by other companies, according to the complaint.
The lawsuit claims that Tesla is actively working to limit access to repairs, which led Tesla owners “to suffer lengthy delays in repairing or maintaining their electric vehicles, only to pay supracompetitive prices for those parts and repairs once they are finally provided.”
Right to repair is a real thing.

Surprised it has taken this long.

Again, I want to be fair here and make it clear that there are other options than Tesla in some markets. But having talked to those people, it hasn’t been easy to set up support for Tesla vehicles, and Tesla is not always easy to work with when it comes to getting parts and diagnostic capability.
However, it has apparently been getting better over the last year or so.
I don’t know exactly what this lawsuit can accomplish, but if anything, it is bringing some attention to the issue.
I still firmly believe that Tesla’s direct service approach is the way to go, but I also think that there’s room to create some competition and keep the company in check.

I'm not thrilled with this.  I was on a recent long road trip, and part of my route home had me on a some high speed, four lane-divided highway that was not technically freeway for about 30-40 miles.  My Tesla saw the road as ""surface street"" and thereby treated it as such in regard to FSD.  So instead of having my largely stable freeway autopilot that tracked where I wanted it to the FSD robot kept trying to move me over to the left lane for no reason.  Very annoying to the point where I pulled over and disabled FSD on my car.  

This is a PSA:  If you rely on autopilot on the freeway be very wary about upgrading to FSD v11.  
It has been delayed several times, but it finally went to a closed beta release last month. Tesla is slowly releasing it to more beta testers, but it has yet to go to a broader release.
Today, Musk said that it will finally go to a wide release this weekend:
V11 starts going wide this weekend
Again, take this with a grain of salt since the CEO teased the release of the new v11 update several times over the last year.
But Tesla did release a new version of v11 to some beta testers last week, and it looks like it went fairly well. This could be a good indicator that a wider release is finally coming.

Looks like a scaled up urban charger. Also looks like it's centrally located in the parking spot so it no longer favors Tesla placement on the left side of the car. 
As expected, the stall is much taller than the previous generation, which allows Tesla to install the cable higher up – leading to a longer overall cable.
A longer cable is going to be particularly useful as more non-Tesla vehicles start to use the Supercharger network, as not every electric car has a charge port in the same place that Teslas do.
This is likely what Supercharger stations are going to look like for many years to come. However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about Supercharger V4. 
Now with the first station being deployed, we should soon learn more details about the new station, especially about the potential higher capacity of Supercharger V4. With the previous generation, Tesla sent out a rare press release to announce the deployment. We might see the same with Supercharger V4 in the coming days.

2023/03/14,"Tesla has decided to walk away from millions of dollars in public funding for Superchargers in California due to a requirement to integrate a payment system.
Public money is flowing into electric vehicle charging infrastructure right now.
There’s the $7 billion from the federal government that is about to be distributed, but other grants are also being distributed at all levels of government.
For the former, Tesla had to adapt and open up stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in order to get access to funding.
But other financing programs have different requirements. In California, Tesla was in the running for $6 million in funding for four large Supercharger stations with 420 charge points.
The California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Rural Electric Vehicle Charging program was behind the funding.
Now we learn that Tesla has given up on the $6 million in subsidies because it doesn’t want to comply with “payment infrastructure requirements.”
Drive Tesla Canada obtained a letter that Tesla’s Policy and Business Development Lead in California, Jennifer Cohen, sent to the CEC:
The California Clean Energy Commission (CEC) has been a great visionary in the expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in California. Unfortunately, due to unnecessarily cumbersome payment infrastructure requirements, we are unable to utilize this award.
Some programs require that charging stations have screens and credit card payment systems directly on the station in order to be eligible for funding.
Tesla always handled all Supercharger payments through its mobile app, which has enabled them to simplify the design of the Supercharger stalls and remove a potential failure point.
Tesla decided not to adapt for this specific incentive to gain federal funding.
Payment and authentication screens are the main hinderance for public charging right now IMO. While it's sad that Tesla had to walk away for this reason, they do presently have the best payment authorization system on the market (for first-party Tesla vehicles). It's just a bummer that there couldn't be a shared payment API like what Tesla uses that would be available for others to use. Plug-and-play is the perfect UX.
The CEC also required 50% of the charge points to have CCS connectors, but Tesla already has a solution for that with its Magic Dock CCS adapter that it started to deploy at Supercharger stations to support non-Tesla electric vehicles.
If $6 million didn’t do it, it looks pretty clear now that Tesla will never adopt a payment system at its Supercharger stations.
As we previously noted, no one is more capital efficient than Tesla when it comes to deploying reliable DC fast-charging stations.
Therefore, it’s a bit of a bummer that Tesla is not using that money, but it doesn’t really need it anyway. I think Tesla will be deploying Supercharger stations as fast as it possibly can, with or without subsidies.

2023/03/14,"Tesla and BYD have developed into unlikely partners lately. A media report questioned that, but both Tesla and BYD have come out and said that their partnership is continuing.
The two companies didn’t use to be on friendly terms.
There was a time when they didn’t take each other very seriously; there’s an infamous interview in which Elon Musk literally laughs at BYD’s electric vehicles, but they have since both emerged as EV powerhouses.
While they were mainly seen as competitors, the two companies started getting cozy together last year as Tesla started to buy battery cells from BYD. 
The supply deal has led us to believe the companies were now getting closer, but a new report from the Korean Economic Daily cited sources saying Tesla had decided to not renew its supply contract with BYD.
However, BYD and Tesla have both denied the report.
Sounds like healthy competition... each pushing the other to make each other better.  Everybody wins.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk even went as far as stating that the relations between Tesla and BYD are “positive”:
That media report is false. Relations between Tesla and BYD are positive.
This is good news for Tesla considering BYD is one of the rare battery suppliers that can supply LFP cells, which is a chemistry that Tesla is now heavily relying on for its cheaper vehicles.
BYD developed expertise in LFP cells with its electric buses when that was the primary type of vehicle to use the chemistry, but it has since become popular for passenger electric cars also.
The technology is currently primarily produced and used in China, but Tesla has started to deploy it globally, and other automakers, like Ford, have started to follow.

2023/03/13,"Tesla Model S Plaid is finally delivering on original promises to achieve a 200 mph top speed with its new ceramic brakes.
When Tesla first announced the Model S Plaid, its new top-performance flagship electric vehicle, the automaker promised a top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h). However, when it was first delivered last year, the vehicle “only” featured a top speed of 163 mph (262 km/h).
Last year, Tesla released a new “Track Mode” for the Model S Plaid that pushed the top speed to 175 mph (282 km/h).
It appeared that the brakes were the limiting factor. Tesla didn’t want to unlock higher top speeds without the electric supercar having bigger brakes that be able to slow it down after achieving this new top speed.
Tesla started to offer to upgrade the brakes with a carbon ceramic kit for $20,000 last year, but the automaker has yet to install the new brakes on Model S Plaid.
Last summer, we reported on a Tesla Model S Plaid breaking a 200 mph top speed for the first time after being hacked by the owner to remove Tesla’s speed limiter.
It actually achieved a top speed of 216 mph (348 km/h) and it looked like it could have gone faster, but they were running out of tarmac and braking space – despite having upgraded the brakes themselves with third-party brakes.
Now Tesla is likely about to install its own brake upgrade as Sebastian Vittel, a racecar driver that has often collaborated with Tesla, released a video in partnership with Tesla Belgium where he was loaned a Model S Plaid with the ceramic brake upgrade to do a test lap at Circuit de Bresse:
For those of us that already have upgraded the brakes to something arguably even better than the Tesla spec CCBs, I'm hoping there's a way to unlock the car. Especially since the requirement for brakes didn't exist when some of us bought the car.

Def agree the car is really good once you have track capable brakes. We've gone even further and added aero and suspension and the car is just insanely good.  Really want to see Tesla do a upgraded ring lap with the brakes (and it would be fun to see them do a lap with susp and aero updates too!)
Vittel commented on his experience with the car:
And let me tell you guy, this is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL compare to the stock car!!
He confirmed that the vehicle didn’t have a speed limiter, and he achieved 350 km/h (217 mph) on several occasions – breaking the previous record.
The driver says that he managed to beat the lap record for a street legal car at the race track with the upgraded Model S Plaid:
Second, I had the chance to bring the car for one full day on CIRCUIT de BRESSE in France for a real condition test. It is a technical small track, which is normally great for small cars like Caterham, Ariel Atom or other Lotus cars and a TRUE NIGHTMARE for heavy cars and the brakes!!! Well, after a couple of laps, i just did the track record for a street-legal car on non-semi slick tires here. Tire Original Michelin PS4S on original dimension 265/35/21 front 295/30/21 rear and original TESLA WHEELS the laptime (in this video): 1min33.610 is absolutely insane for this kind of big car who is totally not adapted for this track!!
Vittel indicated that more videos of the Model S Plaid’s new performance with the upgraded brakes.

2023/03/13,"Tesla has significantly ramped up its hiring effort for Cybertruck production, which is just a few months away.
The Cybertruck production program is being closely followed by the industry as it is likely the most important new electric vehicle to launch this year.
With over 1.5 million reservations and Tesla’s incredible track record in building electric vehicles in high volume, it is expected to be a game changer in the young but important electric pickup truck market.
We have been tracking the production program closely, including actual production equipment specific to Cybertruck coming to Gigafactory Texas, a Cybertruck body at Gigafactory Texas, and, more recently, Cybertruck Beta prototypes being spotted testing on the road.
Another good way to track progress with the production program is the hiring effort for Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas.
With production start being just a few months away, Tesla has recently posted dozens of new job openings linked to Cybertruck production.
For example, Tesla just posted seven new jobs related to the Cybertruck paint shop:
Now, while most of the Cybertruck is stainless steel and won’t use paint like most other vehicles, there are still a few parts on the electric pickup truck that need to be painted.
I personally don't have much interest in owning a CT.  However, in terms of the market, it's a huge deal so it will be interesting to follow.
Tesla posted four new jobs related to casting and stamping for the Cybertruck program:
The automaker also posted a multitude of new production manager and supervisor positions related to different Cybertruck production units:
This ramp-up in hiring comes as Tesla already confirmed being in the middle of deploying its Cybertruck production line at Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.

2023/03/11,"This Tesla Solar Roof and Powerwall installation earns the homeowner $350 per month as part of a virtual power plant.
With this product, Tesla aims to offer a rooftop solar power option for new homes or homes that need a new roof soon.
If you need a new roof and want solar power, you can combine the two with sleek-looking solar tiles that serve as a roof and produce energy.
We have reported on some really cool Tesla Solar Roof installations over the years. It’s still a relatively new product that is expensive; therefore, it is often installed on bigger or more valuable homes – making for some impressive projects.
A few months ago, we reported on this massive 30 kW Tesla Solar Roof home – one of the biggest and most powerful solar roof installations we have seen to date.
Now we feature a new Tesla Solar Roof that is even more impressive, with over 60% more power. 
The project was installed by Rising Sun Solar, one of Tesla’s main partners for solar roof and Powerwall installations in Hawaii. 
It’s a massive 50 kW Tesla Solar Roof on the Big Island of Hawai‘i:
At 50 kW, this is venturing into the commercial solar scale. We can see here that Rising Sun Solar designed the system to squeeze in as many solar cells as possible.
In this picture, we can clearly differentiate between the regular tiles and the solar tiles. We can see that the firm managed to optimize the design where it looks like there could almost be more solar cells per section than with solar panels:
On top of the solar roof, the installation also includes six Tesla Powerwalls for a total of 81 kWh of energy storage.
As has been pointed out, the system will not pay itself back with just the VPP revenue; no surprise there. But there are some other things which can factor in & ought to be mentioned:

1} What was the previous cost of electricity for this home? 
2} Does the homeowner drive pure electric, and what is the cost of those miles in equivalent ICE vehicles? 
3} How often does the electric service here 'black out', and what is cost of damages from that? 

I am sure there are other factors to consider, too -- like the amount of state & federal money was available to offset the costs
Joti Mangat, Rising Sun Solar’s chief revenue officer, noted that the homeowner is using their new system as part of a virtual power plant that is earning them $350 per month:
Fun fact, the Swell Energy Home Battery Rewards VPP in partnership with Hawaiian Electric will earn this customer approx $350 per month in grid revenue, every month, for the next five years.
Swell Energy has launched several large-scale virtual power plants all over the US, with many of them primarily using Tesla Powerwalls. 
In over five years, it will generate $21,000 for the homeowner. Of course, the entire Tesla Solar Roof and Powerwall installation likely costs 10 times that, but it still makes a significant difference, especially when you consider that on top of getting money back from the grid, they are not paying for electricity anymore. Complete independence. They own their own power plant.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/03/10,"Tesla has decided to open direct Powerwall orders again after previously only making the popular home battery pack available with a solar power system.
Home battery packs have greatly gained in popularity in recent years. People have been looking for more energy security to counter power outages and to make better use of renewable energy, like rooftop solar. Home battery packs provide that.
Tesla Powerwall is by far the most popular home battery pack system, and its popularity has led to a significant backlog of orders.
In 2021, Tesla decided only to allow Powerwall orders when they are combined with a rooftop solar or solar roof order.
Two years later, Tesla has now changed its strategy and reopened orders for Powerwall by itself:
Tesla is now revealing new pricing for a Powerwall installation without solar – starting at $9,200 for a single Powerwall before taxes and incentives.
That’s directly from Tesla where the company can perform installations.
Of course, Tesla Powerwalls were always available separately through third-party installers, which has become an important segment for the company.
I'm on a flat yearly net metering plan at least of the next 13 years.  Powerwalls make very little financial sense for me.  Still I would be interested as a backup device, but even then in AZ it would maybe run my AC for a couple of hours even in the night time.  Not worth the price and not sure why they are still so expensive with battery prices coming down.
This could point to Tesla finally starting to have better availability of the Powerwall. Last year, the automaker confirmed having ramped production to about 6,500 Powerwalls per week.
I have noticed an increased number of advertisements from certified Powerwall installers, which would indicate that they have inventory.
Now with Tesla opening direct orders, it looks like Powerwalls are becoming easier to get… if you can pay the price.

2023/03/10,"Tesla Cybertruck’s size has apparently been revealed through executives at Investor Day, confirming that it is just a bit smaller than the original prototype.
Not long after unveiling the Cybertruck prototype in 2019, CEO Elon Musk started talking about making the electric pickup smaller to fit inside a regular garage.
In 2020, the CEO was asked what the biggest change is to Cybertruck from the prototype, and he responded that Tesla “reduced the size by ~3%,” made the “center line more level,” and “lowered the window sill height.”
Now, the Cybertruck is in a “pre-production beta phase,” just months away from the start of production, and Tesla has been shy about confirming changes, including the actual size of the electric pickup truck.
Today, Matthew Donegan-Ryan, a Tesla investor who attended Tesla’s Investor Day earlier this month, claims to have talked to Tesla executives at the event who confirmed many new details about the Cybertruck:
While Donegan-Ryan was there at the event and apparently did talk to Tesla personnel, the information can’t be confirmed, so take it with a grain of salt.
Most notably, he claims that Tesla confirmed the dimensions of the Cybertruck, saying that it was 5% smaller than the original prototype.
He claims the Cybertruck has about the same exterior dimensions as an F-150 Raptor Supercrew.
Started watching video. Guy claims to be truck expert, then says he mainly uses truck for Costco runs. Then he  claims Cybertruck will have capability of an F250, when the numbers Tesla has provided so far do not come close to max towing and payload of a 3/4 ton. He also makes it sound amazing Cybertruck is a 3/4 ton with the dimensions of a 1/2 ton. While it is true that the longest F250 is 16 inches longer than the longest F150, if you need the towing of the F250 but need it to be  shorter, just don't opt for the longest box. For a truck expert, he didn't start out very well. 





While the exterior dimensions would be extremely close, the bed would apparently be much larger.
Amongst other things that Donegan-Ryan claims to have confirmed with Tesla execs, the Cybertruck will have five seats instead of the six-seat configuration that was shown on the original prototype, he said. We suspected that this could be a possibility after seeing the preproduction beta prototype at the Investor Day with the center console. The center console, which used to change into the front center seat, had been modified and no longer looked removable anymore.
A few more details that Donegan-Ryan claims to have revealed include an 18-inch center display and a second-row center display like Model S and Model X; he also claimed that Tesla confirmed having a team working on Cybertruck accessories that will work on the 48-volt system.
We should soon start to get more official information from Tesla about the Cybertruck as the automaker gets closer to bringing the vehicle to production this summer.

2023/03/10,"Tesla is facing “criminal” allegations regarding Gigafactory Berlin as environmentalists accuse the automaker of “suspected water pollution and a possible environmental crime.”
For years now, Tesla has been in battle with environmentalists in Germany who have tried to stop or slow down the construction of and production at Gigafactory Berlin.
Their complaints have ranged from deforestation to water usage.
Now they are going a step further by “filing criminal charges,” according to a new report by Moz.de. The Association for Nature and Landscape in Brandenburg has filed three “criminal charges” with the public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt (Oder), and two of them are against Tesla.
The first charge has to do with Tesla driving foundation piles that the association believes could be reaching and/or affecting groundwater. Groundwater contamination and water usage have been one of the main battlegrounds for environmentalists trying to stop the Gigafactory Berlin project.
The second charge is against Sascha Gehm, the first deputy of the Oder-Spree district and head of Department III Construction, Order, and Environment, who they claim had “a lack of supervision and control” over the Tesla construction project.
The last charge is again against Tesla, which they accuse of starting construction the “Tesla-Süd” work shuttle station project at the Gigafactory Berlin site before it officially received the construction permit.
It’s not clear what the prosecutor’s office is going to do with those allegations yet. The association might have some backing regarding the water contamination allegation as the Strausberg-Erkner water association (WSE) has also expressed some concerns.
I have mixed feelings on this one I don't know the details so it's hard to say. On one hand I'm not a Tesla or certainly not an Elon fan and I am pro-environmental and I am glad that Germany and other European countries have some standards but sometimes these things are taken too far. What ends up happening is the companies will just build and create jobs in countries with almost no standards in the pollution will be far worse. Either that or people use or overuse regulations in the courts just to prevent something from happening.
Tesla has had strong backing from local politicians and civil servants in Brandenburg. It has been able to use that backing to avoid significant impact from these environmentalist organizations trying to slow down the project, but it looks like they are now cranking up the pressure with these criminal allegations.
I am not familiar with the German legal system. The local reporting claims that the association “filed” those “criminal charges” against Tesla with the court. 
In most justice systems I know about, the prosecution can file charges and not one organization against another.
Therefore, I don’t know how serious this is, but we will keep an eye on it as Tesla’s expansion at Gigafactory Berlin is critical to the automaker’s plans.

2023/03/09,"Tesla announced today that its new Model S vehicles come with a new “high-visibility glass roof” following a slight refresh.
There has been sort of a stealth refresh of the Model S and Model X. The main reason appears to be the integration of Tesla’s Hardware 4.0 Autopilot and Self-Driving sensors and computer, but the automaker used the opportunity to add a few more features.
We reported earlier today on Tesla introducing a new “ultra red” color for Model S and Model X. The automaker has also started to make a round steering wheel available instead of only having the “yoke.”
Now Tesla has sent an email to its customers to highlight all of those changes. Again, most of them we already knew about, but we also learned something new. Tesla says that it is introducing a new “high-visibility glass roof” to Model S:
Our new Model S roof glass lets in more light, allowing a clearer view of the sky, day or night, while maintaining the same level of heat and UV protection
I think an electrochromatic roof would be best.  Clear at night and in the winter and more tinted in the summer.  In Cleveland it can hit high 90's and below zero.  
You can get a quick look at it in this new video released by the automaker today:
Introducing Ultra Red paint for Model S & X pic.twitter.com/CFT1sdyIr1
Tesla claims that the new glass roof now “weighs less and lets in 5 times more light” compared to the previous glass roof while still providing the “same level of UV protection.” The automaker claims that it also “improves handling” by helping lower the center of gravity.
Interestingly, in its new communications about the updated Model S and Model X, Tesla doesn’t discuss the new Autopilot hardware – presumably, because those changes are also expected to come to Model 3 and Model Y, and the automaker doesn’t want to negatively impact sales until the transition is made.
While the company is staying quiet about arguably the biggest change to the Model S and Model X, Tesla did prominently highlight the recent price reduction. It notes that you are getting “more features for less.” We reported earlier this week that Tesla significantly dropped Model S and Model X prices, with the former now starting at just $90,000.

2023/03/09,"Rebates and tax credits might need a tweak to incentivize consumers to fully switch to electric vehicles – here’s what a new study found.
Electrek spoke with Brad Greenwood, professor of information systems and operations management at George Mason University’s School of Business, about his recent research, which found that EV subsidies rolled out in China – similar to the US’s new $7,500 EV tax credit – incentivized people to buy EVs as second vehicles, but they kept buying and driving gas cars as well. 
Here’s what Dr. Greenwood found in his research about what subsidies need to do in order to get gas vehicles off the streets – and for drivers to switch to fully electric.
Electrek: You recently conducted a study on EV subsidies as incentives for people to switch from gas to electric. Can you tell us a bit about that?
Brad Greenwood: The goal of the paper was to examine how EV subsidies affect both EV markets and traditional vehicle markets. There’s a lot of evidence that financial subsidies can stimulate EV purchasing, but we don’t know how they influence the purchase of gas cars. To the extent that the stated goal is the cannibalization of the treated market, it’s important to examine this question. 
Electrek: Did the incentives work, and how, exactly?
Brad Greenwood: Well, it depends. Like a lot of other studies, we see that EV sales rise sharply when financial subsidies are offered. This, of course, makes sense, because you’re essentially lowering the price.
The concern is that the market – that is, both EVs and gas cars – expands overall, and there’s no observed decrease in traditional vehicle purchasing. Instead, it looks like consumers are either buying an additional vehicle, or buying a vehicle when they otherwise would have relied on alternate transportation options. 
Electrek: Is there a way for incentives to be more effective to get people to fully switch from gas to electric cars? 
Brad Greenwood: What’s pretty striking is that we see that the impact of the subsidy is strongest in cities with really poor air quality. But consumers don’t react heterogeneously in cities with higher fuel prices. That’s surprising, because consumers are reacting to a monetary incentive – the subsidy – but they don’t react more when prices for operating a traditional vehicle are higher – that is, when there’s a real financial advantage to having the EV. 
Electrek: What do you think would make subsidies more effective?
Brad Greenwood: That’s a matter of speculation. What appears to be critical, though, is mandating abandonment of a gas car when purchasing the EV – that is, the gas car needs to be traded in, at least in the emerging stage of the market. We’re obviously going to need a lot more research to substantiate the factors that increase or decrease the efficacy of subsidies, but that’s the direction we’re pointed in now.  
Time is actually what is needed for one simple reason: Most people buy used vehicles, not new. We won’t see used market buyers give up ICE until there are enough used long range, fast charging EVs available to purchase at a reasonable price. 
Brad Greenwood is a professor of information systems and operations management at George Mason University’s School of Business with expertise regarding the consequences of innovation and the intersection of modernization, business, technology, and social issues.

2023/03/09,"Tesla has decided to install a “dummy” camera in its new vehicles equipped with its Hardware 4.0 Autopilot/Self-Driving sensors.
Hardware 4.0 is Tesla’s latest suite of sensors and computer that powers its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving package features. We have been gradually learning more about the new sensors and computer over the last few months.
We learned that the automaker is changing its cameras, according to a filing with Chinese regulators. More specifically, the filing showed that Tesla has changed its front-facing camera setup from three to two cameras.
This was later confirmed by a teardown of this new Hardware 4.0 computer.
But we were confused when we started to see the first Model S and Model X vehicles coming out of the Fremont Factory. They had a new front-facing camera enclosure, but it looked like it still had three cameras.
Now we learn why, thanks to the first service manuals for the new Model S and Model X being built with Hardware 4.0.
It gives us a closer look where we can see that the camera on the left is different, almost looking like a dud:
It could have been a different sensor, but in the manual, Tesla confirms that it is a dummy camera:
The bi-camera assembly has cutouts for 3 camera lens assemblies, but one of the cutout is populated with a dummy camera.
I don't know what the big deal is this camera is every bit as real as full self-driving cars by Tesla, and they've selling those for years.
Here it is:
Tesla doesn’t explain why it put a dummy camera in the cutout, but the computer teardown did reveal that Tesla had one “spare” camera input in the new Hardware 4.0 computer.
It could be that Tesla is planning to install a new camera later, but it’s not clear why it needs to put a fake one in the meantime.
Tesla is starting to deliver its first vehicles with Hardware 4.0 starting with new Model S and Model X vehicles. Model 3 and Model Y are expected to follow.

2023/03/09,"Although its lead has started to dwindle a bit going into 2023, Tesla continues to be the true #1 in EVs around the globe by market cap. While other automakers are driving their new electrified models through a door in the automotive industry that Tesla originally kicked in, the American automaker continues to offer four super popular EV models. That being said, prices have risen in recent years and continue to fluctuate… often. Here’s where Tesla prices currently sit in 2023.
Tesla currently offers EV models of varying trim levels and prices to choose from in 2023. Below, we have compiled all the current pricing for each available Tesla model ranging from its lowest, bare-bones starting price to its maximum MSRP. Let’s begin with Tesla’s most affordable EV, the Model 3.
When we say that the Model 3 is the most affordable Tesla, that doesn’t necessarily mean it doesn’t cost a lot, especially in 2023. You may recall that when Tesla first introduced this EV in 2016, it was aiming to deliver at at a price below $35,000 and did – for a very short period of time.
First and foremost, it’s important to preface these prices by stating that they are accurate at the time of this post, but Tesla likes to keep us all on our toes, so that could certainly change. We will try our best to keep this article updated with the latest pricing for you. Let’s dig in.
Currently, the Rear-Wheel Drive trim of the Tesla Model 3 starts at an MSRP of $42,990 with zero upgrades, not including any taxes, destination, or other fees. 
To give you the full price range of the Model 3, we also priced it loaded with every available upgrade including red paint, 19″ Sport Wheels, black and white interior, plus the perpetually forthcoming full-self driving capability for an additional $15,000. All in, the fully-loaded RWD Model 3 costs $62,490.
If you don’t want to spring for full-self driving capabilities, Tesla offers a less robust add-ons called Enhanced Autopilot that delivers features like auto lane change, autopark, and navigation on autopilot. That option is only $6,000 rather than the $15k mentioned above.
The Long Range Model 3 used to start at $55,990 and reach a top end price of $72,490, but that version is currently not available until sometime in 2023, so pricing has been removed for now. We will update accordingly. 
Lastly, the Performance version of the Model 3 starts significantly lower in 2023 than it was in 2022, at an MSRP of $53,990. Decked out it can go as high as $71,990 with 20″ Überturbine wheels and other add-ons mentioned above. 
Another new sales tactic for Tesla is a separate fee for charging connectors. No matter which model or trim you choose, you now have to pay an additional $200-$400 for your mobile or wall charging connector. Model 3 prices have come a long way since its initial debut as Tesla’s cheapest EV, but you can still save some cash by getting yourself a pre-owned model.
With continued delays of the Cybertruck (more on that later), the Tesla Model Y currently sits as the newest Tesla EV, despite beginning deliveries back in early 2020. Three years later, the Tesla Model Y comes in two different options and prices, both of which are higher than its compact Model 3 sibling. 
Just like the Model 3 above, we have provided the bare bones MSRP option as well as the completely loaded Model Y with add-ons like red paint, 20″ Induction Wheels, black and white interior, a tow hitch, and full FSD capabilities (again, you also can pay $6,000 for “enhanced autopilot” instead).
To begin, the dual motor Long Range Model Y starts at a base MSRP of $54,990 and can jump to $79,990 fully-decked out. This higher price includes all the available features mentioned above as well as the seven seat interior option for an extra $3,000 (only available on the Long Range trim). 
The Model Y Performance trim starts at $58,990, and it, too, increases to $77,990 when souped up (although you can only get the five seat interior).
Recently, the IRS updated its classification of the Model Y as an SUV, meaning its MSRP limit jumped from $55,000 to $80,000. This means it can now qualify for federal EV tax credits until at least March when the US Dept. of Treasury is expected to share its guidance on battery components. 
Aside from the original Tesla Roadster, the Model S remains the oldest EV model from the American automaker and the longest running in production. As more affordable Tesla models like the 3 and Y have emerged over the years, higher end EVs like the Model S have seen sales slow down a bit.
In 2023, consumers that can afford the prices of the Tesla Model S trims are certainly still buying, especially given the high-end specs the Plaid trim provides.
Currently, the Dual Motor Model S begins at an MSRP of $89,990, down a few thousand compared to late 2022. Despite not having any add-ons, the $95k version of the Model S can travel 0-60 mph in just over three seconds and offers over 400 miles of EPA estimated range. 
With that said, the loaded version of the Dual Motor Model S provides similar performance, but with added features like red paint, cream (or black and white) interior, and FSD capabilities – all for $114,490. This price also includes 21″ Arachnid wheels which also lowers this particular trim’s range down to 375 miles.
Despite the impressive specs on the Dual Motor Model S, they are nothing compared to Plaid and the price tag that follows suit. The tri-motor Model S Plaid starts out at an MSRP of $109,990 with zero upgrades. All-in, however, you’re looking at a purchase price of $134,490, including those same Arachnid wheels that again sacrifice a bit of range (~48 miles).
In early 2023, Tesla not only lowered prices of all its models, but also started offering Model S customers the choice of the standard steering wheel again, in addition to the yoke. 
You’d think that with the sportiness of the Model S Plaid, it would be the most expensive Tesla model, and for a portion of time it was. However, 2022 bought about a Plaid version of the Tesla Model X, and its prices remain the automaker’s highest yet.
You get what you pay for, as they say, and the Model X has the most to offer drivers in terms of space and performance, but for a price. Like its veteran sedan counterpart, the Model X currently comes in two available trims.
The Dual Motor Model X starts at an MSRP of $99,990 minimum – again, down compared to 2022 (for now). From there, it vaults up to $131,490 with added bonuses like 22″ Turbine wheels, cream interior, and a $6,500 up-charge for a six seat interior that includes captain’s chairs. If you’d rather have the seven-seat row, it costs $3,000 less.
The Model X refresh brought a Plaid version to the lineup to replace the Performance trim. Plaid starts at $109,990 and maxes out at $135,490, including all the most expensive add-ons. Note that the Model X Plaid currently only comes in the six seat option. 
It’s been three years since Tesla has introduced a new models to its lineup, but it has been teasing the masses with two upcoming passenger EVs for six years now. This includes the Cybertruck and the 2nd Generation Roadster. 
How much do they cost? Well, let’s just say their prices have changed over the years and as of 2023, Tesla remains far more tight lipped about it.
Originally, the Tesla Cybertruck was priced out in three separate trims of varying MSRPs:
However, Cybertruck production has been delayed mutliple times, and although we’ve spotted some prototypes out driving around, we no longer have a grasp on what this EV behemoth will cost when it eventually arrives. Since October 2021, the pricing and specs of the Cybertruck are no longer listed on Tesla’s website.
That being said, with Gigafactory Texas ramping up operations, the Cybertruck appears closer than ever to reaching scaled production. In May of 2022, Tesla began once again taking reservations for the Cybertruck for North American customers only. That only costs $100 down too.
That remains the case while we continue to await details of the actual production model, which should eventually be followed by official pricing… someday.
While Tesla fans have been waiting over four years for the Cybertruck to arrive, they’ve been tortured even longer by the prospect of a 2nd Generation Roadster, which was originally unveiled in 2017.
Your original Cybertruck pricing is wrong. You added $10,000 to each. However your prices are probable a lot closer to what Tesla actually sales the Cybertruck for upon initial release.
It was first scheduled to begin production in 2020, but Tesla has continuously punted its start of assembly to focus on its other EVs, particularly the Cybertruck. We know for sure that this hyper EV is delayed until at least 2023 at the earliest. 
Tesla originally listed the revamped Roadster at a price of $200,000 with $50,000 required up front to confirm a reservation. Additionally, Tesla originally offered a “Founder’s Series” version of the Roadster which appeared to be a limited production run for $250,000. The Founders Series Roadster required the full amount up front within ten days of the reservation, and has since sold out.
In 2023, Tesla no longer lists any pricing for the 2nd Generation Roadster, nor does it mention the Founder’s Series version at all. All we know is that you still need to pay $50,000 within ten days of reserving one to hold your spot in line. 
While you wait for its arrival, you can relive the magic of the Roadster’s first unveiling back in 2017 below.

2023/03/09,"Tesla has added a rare new paint color option, “Ultra Red,” available on the Model S and Model X built at Fremont Factory. 
Back in the early days of the Model S, Tesla used to offer a variety of colors, but the automaker decided to streamline options in order to facilitate production and service.
It gradually reduced options until it made only a handful of color options available across its entire lineup – even for the flagship Model S and Model X.
Only late last year, Tesla decided to add two new colors, Quicksilver and Cherry Red, but it was only on new Model Y vehicles produced at Gigafactory Berlin and enabled by the new state-of-the-art paint shop at this new factory.
Now Tesla has surprised us with a new color option, and this time, it’s for Model S and Model X:
We say a “new color option,” but it actually replaces the old multilayered red that was previously available.
The new “Ultra Red” is darker and closer to the Cherry Red that Tesla launched on Model Y in Berlin, but it appears a tad lighter.
The option is available on both Model S and Model X for $3,000.
I’ve always thought Tesla’s multi-coat red was so boring and uninspired in real life (looks pretty nice on their website, but only there). It barely pops in the sun, and is so unnoticeable if it’s cloudy out. It’s too dark to be bright and too bright to be dark, so I’m eager to see what this new tone looks like.
Model 3 and Model Y produced in Fremont are still only available with the “multi Red,” which as you can see below is lighter and appears to have fewer nuances than the new Ultra Red.
The Cherry Red produced at GIgafactory Berlin is also known to look significantly different in different lights due to its many coatings. It will be interesting to see if it’s the same case with the new Ultra Red.
Earlier this week, Model S and Model X recently saw a new important price reduction. Furthermore, Tesla is starting to deliver its two flagship vehicles with the latest Hardware 4.0 suite of Autopilot and Self-Driving sensors.

2023/03/08,"Tesla has started to push a new Full Self-Driving Beta v11 software update, but the rollout of the highly anticipated FSD Beta update is still slow.
Tesla FSD Beta v11 is both an exciting and scary step as it is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot highway stacks.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
Since the wider release of the beta last year, there are currently over 400,000 Tesla owners in the program in North America – virtually every Tesla owner who bought the FSD package on their vehicles.
However, the bulk of these owners have yet to receive significant FSD beta updates as Tesla was supposed to release v11 to the fleet in November 2022, but the update has been stuck in testing within Tesla’s closed fleet since then.
The update is an important step because it includes many new neural networks, as Elon Musk stated, but from a consumer perspective, it’s also important because it is expected to merge Tesla’s FSD Beta software stack primarily used on roads and city streets with Tesla’s Autopilot software stack, which is used as a level 2 driver assist system on highways.
It has been delayed several times, but it finally went to a closed beta release last month. Tesla is slowly releasing it to more beta testers, but it has yet to go to a broader release.
Today, the automaker has started to push a new FSD Beta v11.3.1 (2022.45.10) software update to a slightly larger group of beta testers.
The update features several improvements to the new single stack as well as new visualizations that give drivers more insights into what FSd Beta is going.
Here are the release notes for FSD Beta v11.3.1  (via Not a Tesla App):
– Enabled FSD Beta on highway. This unifies the vision and planning stack on and off-highway and replaces the legacy highway stack, which is over four years old. The legacy highway stack still relies on several single-camera and single-frame networks, and was setup to handle simple lane-specific maneuvers. FSD Beta’s multi-camera video networks and next-gen planner, that allows for more complex agent interactions with less reliance on lanes, make way for adding more intelligent behaviors, smoother control and better decision making.
– Improved recall for close-by cut-in cases by 15%, particularly for large trucks and high-yaw rate scenarios, through an additional 30k auto-labeled clips mined from the fleet. Additionally, expanded and tuned dedicated speed control for cut-in objects.
– Improved the position of ego in wide lanes, by biasing in the direction of the upcoming turn to allow other cars to maneuver around ego.
– Improved handling during scenarios with high curvature or large trucks by offsetting in lane to maintain safe distances to other vehicles on the road and increase comfort.
– Improved behavior for path blockage lane changes in dense traffic. Ego will now maintain more headway in blocked lanes to hedge for possible cans in dense traffic.
– Improved lane changes in dense traffic scenarios by allowing higher acceleration during the alignment phase, This results in more natural gap selection to overtake adjacent lane vehicles very close to ego
– Made turns smoother by improving the detection consistency between lanes, lines and road edge predictions. This was accomplished by integrating the latest version of the lane-guidance module into the road edge and lines network.
– Improved accuracy for detecting other vehicles’ moving semantics. Improved precision by 23% for cases where other vehicles transition to driving and reduced error by 12% for cases where Autopilot incorrectly detects its lead vehicle as parked. These were achieved by increasing video context in the network, adding more data of these scenarios, and increasing the loss penalty for control-relevant vehicles,
– Extended maximum trajectory optimization horizon, resulting in smoother control for high curvature roads and far away vehicles when driving at highway speeds.
– Improved driving behavior next to row of parked cars in narrow lanes, preferring to offset and staying within lane instead of unnecessarily lane changing away or slowing down.
As an owner of 2 Teslas with FSD, and 90% of my miles on autopilot or fsd beta, I am excited about this but also a bit nervous since highway autopilot is incredibly useful, and I’ve learned when/where it may require extra attention- and now with the stack change; it’s like taking all my favorite highways and moving the potholes around. The first drives will be with sweaty palms. I do believe this is one of those “4 steps forward, 1 step back” moment for the stack, so yay+gulp.
If I understand correctly, they added again, the ability to send fsd specific bug reports regardless of model. Happy beta tester here, I want my effort to be useful in addition to video clips.
– Improved back-to-back lane change maneuvers through better fusion between vision-based localization and coarse map lane counts.
– Added text blurbs in the user interface to communicate upcoming maneuvers that FSD Beta plans to make. Also improved the visualization of upcoming slowdowns along the vehicle’s path. Chevrons render at varying opacity and speed to indicate the slowdown intensity, and a solid line appears at locations where the car will come to a stop.
– Improved the recall and precision of object detection, notably reducing the position error of semi-trucks by 10%, increasing the recall and precision of crossing vehicles over 100m away by 3% and 7%, respectively, and increasing the recall of motorbikes by 5%. This was accomplished by implementing additional quality checks in our two million video clip autolabeled dataset.
– Reduced false offsetting around objects in wide lanes and near intersections by improving object kinematics modeling in low speed scenarios.

2023/03/08,"The NHTSA announced that it is investigating the Tesla Model Y over a potential issue after two vehicles had their steering wheels fall off.
In a new report, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) wrote that it is aware of two reports of steering wheels completely falling off on 2023 Model Y vehicles:
The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is aware of two reports of complete detachment of the steering wheel from the steering column while driving in 2023 Model Year Tesla Model Y vehicles. Both vehicles were delivered to the owners missing the retaining bolt (P/N1036655-00-A) which attaches the steering wheel to the steering column.
The NHTSA has been in communication with Tesla, and it has found out that both affected vehicles had an “end-of-line repair” that required the removal of the steering wheel.
The NHTSA wrote in the report:
Both vehicles received an end of line repair requiring removal and re-installation of the steering wheel. A friction fit maintained the connection between the steering wheel and the column splines during operation until separation. Sudden separation occurred when the force exerted on the steering wheel overcame the resistance of the friction fit while the vehicles were in motion. Both known incidents occurred at low vehicle mileage.
The agency is still working with Tesla to determine the scope of the manufacturing issue to see if it affects more vehicles and therefore could need a safety recall.
Over the last year, Tesla was hit by many recalls from the NHTSA, but most of them have been fixed with over-the-air software updates – leading Tesla fans to complain about the use of the word “recall” in those cases.
But in this case, it would be a manufacturing issue that would require a physical recall. However, it’s still not clear if more vehicles are affected beyond the two incidents reported to the NHTSA.

2023/03/07,"Elon Musk commented on Tesla’s next car, saying that it will operate “almost entirely in autonomous mode,” but the automaker has yet to deliver on its promise to make all its cars made since 2016 autonomous.
While Tesla unveiled its plan to build a new vehicle platform that will be more efficient to manufacture at its Investor Day last week, many were disappointed that Tesla didn’t go into details about the vehicle models that will be based on this new platform.
During a brief appearance at a Morgan Stanley conference today, CEO Elon Musk briefly commented that the vehicles to be built on Tesla’s next-gen platform will operate “almost entirely in autonomous mode.”
He made it sound like humans will only rarely have to be behind the wheel of the vehicle.
That’s in line with what he previously said about Tesla planning to bring a new purposed-built “robotaxi” electric vehicle to production.
But the idea of Tesla working on a new vehicle built especially to be used “almost entirely in autonomous mode” is worrying some people.
Musk has been promising that Tesla is going to make all its vehicles built since 2016 “full self-driving” through software updates. The CEO went as far as mentioning “level 5 SEA self-driving.” Some Tesla buyers paid between $5,000 and $15,000, thinking that the automaker would eventually deliver on that promise.
However, Tesla has so far only delivered “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta), which is still a level 2 driver assist system as per the automaker’s own admission.
The FSD Beta program has also been stagnant for months with little to no significant updates for the vast majority of people in the program.
The company claims that it still plans to deliver on that promise, but some owners are starting to have doubts as Tesla moves to build purpose-built autonomous vehicles, like the “robotaxi,” and introduces a new Autopilot Self-Driving hardware suite on new vehicles that it won’t offer retrofits for.
The amount of money Elon and Tesla have fleeced from consumers on the promise of FSD  is breathtaking. Just call it what it is...advanced cruise control. Let consumers decide if it's worth paying a premium for the feature. The fact that HW4 won't be backwards-compatible with prior systems should be enough evidence that no current Tesla has what it takes to be fully autonomous. 
On its own, one doesn’t mean that the other doesn’t make sense, but it is indeed worrying amid the state of the FSD program.
Despite what Musk and the biggest FSD cheerleaders are saying about FSD Beta, it’s hard to see a clear path to it ever achieving level 5 or even level 4.
The good news for Tesla is that I can see the company applying what they learn from the FSD program to build a great purpose-built self-driving vehicle, like the robotaxi, but what does it mean for the millions of Tesla owners who bought cars since 2016 thinking that they would eventually become self-driving?
I see lawsuits coming. Lots of them.

2023/03/07,"Tesla (TSLA) investors have been buying the automaker’s stock at a record pace over the last few weeks. Here’s why we think they are doubling down.
Despite a less-than-stellar performance on the stock market over the last year, individual Tesla investors appear undeterred.
A new report from Vanda Research (via WSJ) shows that individual investors are buying Tesla stocks at a record pace.
We mean individual investors with broker accounts, not hedge funds and other institutions. Those investors bought just short of $17 billion worth of Tesla stock in 2022, which was a record.
Now just over two months into 2023, Vanda Research reports that individual investors have already bought over $13 billion worth of Tesla stock this year.
They are showing a lot of confidence in Tesla’s stock, which has been up so far this year, but that was after taking a brutal beating last year.
Now trading at $189 a share, it is still way down from its 52-week high of $384 a share.
That’s a tricky question to answer. Historically, Tesla has been a “story stock,” meaning that people were mainly buying into the story of Tesla rather than solid financials behind the company; this has changed over the last few years as Tesla began to consistently deliver strong financial performance and growth.
With Gigafactory Berlin and Texas now ramping to volume production, investors are expecting Tesla to deliver a record number of vehicles in Q1. And while margins are going to be negatively affected by recent price cuts, the automaker should remain profitable.
Tesla is also adding the Cybertruck to its lineup this year, but it is not expected to contribute meaningfully to deliveries or financials this year.
I recently bought a bunch of stock. I nearly doubled my stake when the price got down to $129. After Investor Day, I'm more convinced than ever that it was a wise decision. 
Another explanation for why individual investors were buying Tesla at a record pace this year could be in anticipation of the Investor Day that happened last week.
The Investor Day presentation received mixed reviews. Many were disappointed by the lack of significant news or announcement, but others were impressed by Tesla bringing a significant step change to vehicle manufacturing with its next-generation vehicle platform.
A “buy the rumor, sell the news” situation could have contributed to this surge in Tesla investors buying the stock.
Tesla investors are also known to be quite loyal and many of them rushed to buy last year’s dip. It will be interesting to see if the buying continues into the rest of the year.

2023/03/06,"Tesla’s official announcement to build what is now known as Gigafactory Mexico was light on details, but now we are starting to learn more, thanks to local reports.
After months of rumors, Tesla finally announced Gigafactory Mexico during its Investor Day last week.
CEO Elon Musk himself admitted that it was the biggest “news” of the event, but it was extremely light on details.
Tesla basically only said that the factory would be built just outside of Monterrey, Nuevo León, and that it will build electric cars based on the automaker’s new vehicle platform.
When Tesla builds a factory anywhere, even near a large city like Monterrey, it is going to have a big local impact, and obviously, locals want to know more.
Now Samuel García, Nuevo León’s governor, has started to release more details about the project.
The governor confirmed that Tesla secured a substantial piece of land spanning 4,200 acres. That’s about twice the size of the land Tesla has secured to build Gigafactory Texas and all adjoining projects, like its cathode material factory.
He also confirmed that Tesla plans to spend about $5 billion to build the factory, which is in line with the planned capital expenditure at other gigafactories. It’s important to note that this is generally over years and several phases of construction, with other phases coming after the start of production in order to support the investment.
Finally, García said that Tesla plans to employ 7,000 people at Gigafactory Mexico directly. This is on par or lower than at other Tesla gigafactories. It could create tens of thousands more jobs indirectly as suppliers move to the region or ramp up production as Tesla already has several suppliers in Nuevo León.
Tom Zhu, Tesla’s head of automotive and the person in charge of gigafactories, added that his team plans to build the factory at a record pace like Gigafactory Shanghai, which went from breaking ground to production in about nine months.
García confirmed that Tesla told him it plans to start producing cars there next year. 
Tesla was very light on when the ""next generation vehicle platform"" will launch. Next year already would be much quicker than many probably anticipated. However ""next year"" probably means end of the year. Groundbreaking in about a year from now? And I think Tesla said more details (also on the upcoming models) will be shared when they start breaking the ground. So probably in February/March next year? Maybe a bit earlier?
It’s an exciting project. I assume that Tesla has negotiated with the government to be able to fly through the regulatory process and to break ground and go into production as soon as possible.
Like any latest Tesla factory, it is the most exciting since the company learns from project to project and can apply all that new knowledge. 
This one is particularly exciting because Tesla is taking everything from Gigafactory Shanghai, Berlin, and Texas, and it is building specifically for the new generation platform.
It could become what Elon has previously referred to as the “alien dreadnought.”

2023/03/06,"After years of price increases, Tesla has updated pricing on its flagship Model S and Model X vehicles. The Model S now starts at just $90,000.
Over the last few years, Tesla has gradually increased prices across its entire lineup amid supply chain difficulties and inflation, but also mainly due to enjoying some robust demand.
That finally changed in January when Tesla implemented price cuts across its entire vehicle lineup worldwide.
Since then, the automaker has made some smaller price adjustments – primarily small increases to the Model Y and small price decreases to Model 3.
Now in an overnight update to its online configurator, Tesla has slashed the price on Model S and Model X:
These are significant price reductions ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the model.
However, these price cuts come after years of significant price increases on Model S and Model X following a design refresh two years ago.
Tesla had difficulties ramping up production of the new version of the vehicle – creating long wait times that the automaker took advantage of price-wise.
Two years ago (when I ordered mine) Model S Long Range was $79,990. Had to wait seven months to receive it, waiting for the refresh, but still, it was even $10,000 less than now.

Low-priced EVs for everyone is important, but it's not a bad strategy to sell to the highest emitters (wealthiest) first.
With the Model S now starting at $90,000, the price is basically back at the level it was in the summer of 2021.
Interestingly, the Model S Plaid and the Model X Plaid are now the same price. It’s not the first time it has happened, but it makes little to no sense as Tesla has generally kept the price of the bigger electric SUV higher than the sedan, which is still the case for the non-Plaid version by as much as $10,000.
These new price cuts come just as Tesla updated Model S and Model X recently. We noted that those are the first models to feature the new Hardware 4 Autopilot/Self-Driving suite of sensors and a new computer. Tesla also slightly updated the rear of the vehicles.
All Model S and Model X vehicles are built in Fremont, California, and they are shipped to all Tesla markets worldwide.

2023/03/03,"Tesla is deploying its first Supercharger V4, a new generation of its DC fast-charging stations, and it’s much bigger than the previous generation.
Last year, we reported on Tesla’s Supercharger V4 design being revealed in the plans for a new station. Tesla is believed to be ramping up production of the new charger in order to start deployment  soon. The new charger is expected to feature a potential for a higher charge rate (which is currently capped at 250 kW for the Supercharger V3) and a solution to allow CCS charging for non-Tesla electric vehicles.
The CCS solution was later revealed to be the Magic Dock, but we have only seen it deployed on Supercharger V3 stations, and the V4 had yet to show its face until now.
Now we learn that Tesla has started to deploy the new Supercharger V4 with a station being spotted under construction in Harderwijk, the Netherlands:
Previously details about the Supercharger V4 pointed to a taller stall with a longer charging cable.
Now this new station in the Netherlands is still under construction, but we can still see the size of the new Supercharger stalls – and they are huge:
Unfortunately, we don’t get a good look at the cable, but if it is located where it was on the technical drawings, it will undoubtedly be much longer at that height.
The automotive energy division (Tesla Supercharger) will remain the largest and most competitive company in the field of service stations for electric vehicles. During journeys longer than the autonomy of our vehicle, we will refuel at Tesla instead of Shell or Chevron.
A longer cable is critical for new Tesla Superchargers as the automaker is opening up the network to non-Tesla electric vehicles, which don’t necessarily have a charge port at the same location as Tesla’s.
It results in them sometimes having to park in weird ways to access the charger and sometimes even blocking other stalls.
A longer cable would be a solution.
Now with the first station being deployed, we should also soon learn more about the potential higher capacity of Supercharger V4. With the previous generation, Tesla sent out a rare press release to announce the deployment. We might see the same with Supercharger V4 any day now.

2023/03/03,"Tesla has put the Cybertruck against the Tesla Semi in what looks like a drag race, but it is more likely a photo op.
As a semi-truck, the Tesla Semi has truly impressive performance. 
Drivers have said that it handles more like a sports car than a semi-truck – and it sure accelerates closer to a sports car.
Tesla quotes a 0 to 60 mph acceleration in 20 seconds, but that’s while pulling a full load. Anyone who has been stuck behind a truck on a highway on-ramp should know that this is impressive.
Now without a load, the 0-60 mph acceleration is believed to be closer to five seconds. 
Tesla is trying to make the Cybertruck also outperform conventional pickup truck. CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla set out to make it “more utilitarian than the F-150 while handling and accelerating like a sports car.”
Now we get to see the Tesla Semi and Cybertruck go head-to-head in what appears to be some kind of staged drag race:
Tesla Cybertruck vs Tesla Semi 🔥🤯@Tesla @elonmuskpic.twitter.com/imtVZcJyIz
The footage emerged from social media, and some presented it as a “drag race” between the Tesla Semi and Cybertruck.
However, with the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X, all in white in the back, it looks like it is a staged photo op for Tesla rather than an actual demonstration.
But it does look like they floored the Tesla Semi for a second, and the sound is absolutely insane. 
Anyone spotted the  2̶0̶2̶0̶ 2̶0̶2̶1̶ 2̶0̶2̶2̶ 2023 Roadster lately? Seems like that's become the forgotten Tesla with all the CyberTruck and Semi hype lately. Is it still on track for 2023 production or has it slipped again?

It looks like it is beating the Cybertruck, but again, I doubt that they were flooring the electric pickup truck, and we also don’t know which version of the truck Tesla is using here.
The top-of-the-line version of the Cybertruck is expected to have four motors and accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in the ~2.5-second range.
The base entry versions of the electric pickup would likely have an acceleration closer to a Tesla Semi without a load.
Either way, it is pretty surreal to see those two vehicles on the road side-by-side.

2023/03/02,"Tesla announced that it has built its 4 millionth electric car, and the rate of production is increasing at an impressive pace.
It took Tesla 12 years of operations in order to build its first million electric vehicles; the automaker achieved that milestone in early 2020.
Now just a few years later, Tesla has repeated the achievement several times as it managed to ramp up electric vehicle production better than any automaker to date.
At its Investor Day event yesterday, Tesla announced that it has now produced its 4 millionth electric car, and it took the automaker only seven months from its 3 millionth milestone:
We produced our 4 millionth vehicle at Giga Texas today ✌ pic.twitter.com/YMxb4zX5WB
The 4 millionth Tesla vehicle was produced at Gigafactory Texas in Austin. With new capacity being deployed at the factory and a Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla is now able to produce about two million vehicles per year.
This is a spectacular achievement and definitely deserves to be celebrated. It is also a testament to the amazing talent, ingenuity, persistence and hard work of Tesla employees and management. This capability was really the highlight of investor day presentation and something that everyone at Tesla can be proud of.
Tesla has a goal to ramp up to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year.
It now has four Gigafactories in operation. It is also expanding Gigafactory Nevada to add Tesla Semi production at the location, and it recently announced Gigafactory Mexico.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk said that he believes Tesla will need about 12 Gigafactories in order to achieve a capacity of 20 million vehicles per year.
The automaker is expected to announce more locations for new gigafactories soon, since it takes a few years to bring each one to volume production and 2030 is coming fast.

2023/03/02,"Tesla has teased what appears to be a new wireless home charging station as part of its charging presentation during its Investor Day.
Investor Day included presentations from all of Tesla’s major divisions, including a presentation about charging by Rebecca Tinucci, head of global charging infrastructure. The bulk of the presentation focused on Tesla’s extensive and already well-documented effort to deploy both DC and AC charging globally.
For the most part, we already knew about what the executive was discussing – though Tesla did share some interesting data points. For example, we already had some indications that Tesla’s Supercharger cost of deployment was much cheaper than the competition, but now the company has put some numbers behind it.
Tinucci ended the presentation with her own “one more thing” moment when she said:
And one more thing. Yes, we got to scale our infrastructure, and yes, we want to power it via renewable sources, but we are Tesla. So we also want to make sure that we are continuing to be focused on proving incredible charging experiences.
That’s the slide she was showing as she said that:
The slide shows the Tesla diner, which is a project that is already underway in California. The company wants to operate its own retro diner at a Supercharger station with movies being projected on giant screens outside.
Now the second image is brand new and appears to show a new wireless home charging station from Tesla:
The pad on the ground underneath the car is what points to a wireless inductive charging system.
Considering the slide also included an image of the Tesla Supercharger diner, which we know is an ongoing project, it could mean that this wireless charging station is also in the works at Tesla.
Of course Tesla is going to do wireless charging at some point.  Just because Elon poo-pooed it years ago, doesn't mean that they can't change their minds after seeing how far the technology has come.  (And yes, it's now so close to wired charging in efficiency that the difference is not worth mentioning).  

Wireless charging will not replace wired charging everywhere, but it's going to be critical in some key areas.  Namely, I view it as a much better solution for public level 2 charging.  It has several advantages in that arena.  It doesn't tick off the NIMBYs by causing a bunch of street clutter and cords.  It leaves parking lots free of obstacles so it won't interfere with things like snow clearing equipment.  It also cuts down on vandalism by embedding all the copper in concrete so there's nothing for the crooks to cut and steal. For fleets like Ubers or robotaxies, being able to graze on power during brief breaks at taxi stands is going to be huge.

Looking forward, there's already trials under way to create wireless highways, where people can charge while driving.  This opens up so many possibilities and completely eliminates the last remaining non-subjective argument against EVs (huge range and towing long distances).  

I firmly believe that the future of charging will be a mix of wired and wireless charging.  Each where it makes sense.
Several companies have been working on wireless charging for electric vehicles in recent years, but the technology has never taken off.
There are several issues with it. For example, it’s not as efficient as charging with a cable – though the technology has been closing the gap in recent years. It’s also more expensive as you generally have to embed a charging pad securely in the ground instead of just mounting a charger on the wall.
And for these downsides, it doesn’t solve a major problem: having to plug in your car. It’s not a super difficult nor time-consuming task. Nonetheless, Tesla has previously talked about automating the task in order to be ready for self-driving technology. If the cars are driving themselves, it would make sense for them to be able to charge themselves without a human having to plug them in.
However, Tesla appeared to favor an automated robot arm instead of wireless charging to complete this task. Maybe things have changed?

2023/03/02,"A deadly Tesla crash in China last November, which at the time was subject to swirling social media rumors that blamed it on Autopilot or brake failure or too-powerful electric motors, turns out to have just been another example of pedal confusion.
But now, data from the car’s Event Data Recorder has been posted to the internet by Xiao Te, a Tesla owner in China. And the data shows that in the seconds before the crash, the accelerator pedal was held at 100%, with no brakes applied. Further, the steering wheel did show inputs during that time frame, Autopilot was not active, and the car’s stability control system was engaged.
While the police investigation is not yet finished, the driver, who survived the crash and was wearing his seatbelt at the time, was not driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
The video of the crash received quite a lot of play because of how dramatic it was. In about 30 seconds, a Model Y traveled 2.6 kilometers at up to 164km/h (101mph), weaving through traffic, sideswiping other vehicles until it crashed into a storefront. The whole thing was tracked by Chinese CCTV cameras and stitched together (warning: graphic video).
The driver survived, though at least one bystander was left dead (most sources we’ve seen say two, but some say one). After the crash, the driver was interviewed stating that he had never touched the accelerator, and that he was pressing the brake the whole time.
This led to social media rumors suggesting brake failure, a topic that has made the rounds multiple times on Chinese social media, including when a protester showed up at Tesla’s booth at the Shanghai Auto Show.
Other theories made their way around social media as well. Some thought that it could have been Autopilot gone rogue during an attempt to autopark the car, and some incorrectly said that even if the brakes are functioning, a Tesla’s motor is too powerful and can overcome the brakes and therefore lead to a dangerous event like this (all cars are designed for brakes to be able to overcome the accelerator).
This is a story that has gone on for decades with only one meaningful variation.  Karen buys a ""look at me"" car.  Karen drives badly and crashes it.  Karen KNOWS Karen never ever makes a mistake.  Karen blames the car.  Other dumb people sympathize as if they haven't seen Karens doing Karen things their whole lives.  The only difference in this story is that Tesla can PROVE Karen is wrong.

Decades ago, a rash of Karens crashed their Audis.  There were numerous lawsuits and ""journalism"" about ""sudden acceleration syndrome"".  This cost Audi a lot of money and reputation for what was almost certainly just another outbreak of Karenism.

One of the big benefits to the OEM of good and reliable monitoring software is protection against this kind of nonsense.
But the video showed that the brake lights never turned on, and the vehicle was not behaving in a manner consistent with Autopilot usage either.
So, at the time, we predicted that this was just another example of pedal confusion, which it turns out to have been. Pedal confusion is where a driver presses the accelerator thinking it’s the brake and then, while panicking, continues to press the accelerator harder and harder, only contributing to the problem.
Accusations of brake failure are not just limited to China – Tesla has also received many such complaints in the US, which at one point it responded to in a blog post broadly claiming, “there is no ‘unintended acceleration’ in Tesla vehicles.”
These complaints were examined by the NHTSA, which found that incidents of sudden unintended acceleration in Teslas were a result of driver error, and not due to any design flaw in the vehicle. The NHTSA reminds drivers that there are 16,000 preventable crashes per year in the US due to pedal error and cautions drivers to be aware of this problem, regardless of what make and model of car they drive.

2023/03/01,"Tesla announced that it will soon launch a new plan for unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month as part of its “Tesla Electric” energy retailing business.
Late last year, after gaining experience through its virtual power plants (VPPs), Tesla took things a step further with the launch of “Tesla Electric.”
Instead of reacting to specific “events” and providing services to your local electric utilities, as Tesla Powerwall owners have done in VPPs in California, Tesla Electric is actively and automatically buying and selling electricity for Tesla Powerwall owners – providing a buffer against peak prices.
The company is essentially becoming an energy retailer.
Tesla Electric is currently only available to Powerwall owners in Texas, but the company has plans to expand the products through this new branch.
Today, Tesla announced the first new product under “Tesla Electric” at its Investor Day.
Drew Baglino, senior vice president of engineering, announced that Tesla is going to launch a new  unlimited overnight home charging for $30 per month.
Unlike the current Tesla Electric program, this is not only going to be available to Tesla Powerwall owners.
Baglino said:
By this summer, we are going to offer retail electricity plans to people who have our cars where they can have unlimited overnight home charging for $30 per month. This is part of reducing the total cost of ownership of our vehicles, and the reason why we can do this is because Texas as a ton of wind. And in Texas, the wind blows at night.
Current 36 month fixed rate no TOU in Texas (Houston zone) is 11 cents kwh. You need to drive more than 1,000 miles a month to break even assuming the plan for rest of day is 11 cents. 

There are a lot of free nights and weekend plans available, but they stick it to you in the day. We will see if Tesla really has a better deal. 

FYI people can go to powertochoose[dot]org to see ERCOT's consumer retail price comparison tool for anywhere in the state with competitive pricing. 
If charging at night is an option for you and you drive quite a bit, $30 per month is going to result in significant savings.
Tesla can afford to do this through its relationships with electric utilities that have a surplus of power at night thanks to lower demand and strong wind power, as Baglino mentioned.
Such a low cost would incentivize drivers to charge at night, which would reduce the load from electric vehicle charging during the day.
Tesla says that the plan will be available in Texas this July and teased more to come with Tesla Electric.

2023/03/01,"Tesla vehicles will be capable of bidirectional charging within the next two years, according to comments from Tesla VP Drew Baglino at today’s Investor Day event.
A question was asked during the Q&A portion about whether Tesla would move toward enabling bidirectional charging on its cars, noting the company’s historical reluctance to do so.
Drew Baglino, senior VP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering, answered the question by noting that the lack of bidirectional charging was not really a conscious decision, but rather not a priority at the time. But, as Tesla has improved its power electronics units, it has found ways to reduce cost while also bringing bidirectional charging to its vehicles.
Baglino went on to say that this could happen within the next two years, as Tesla is currently within a retooling process for their power electronics manufacturing.
But immediately after this answer, CEO Elon Musk stepped in to pour a little cold water on the idea, stating, “I don’t think very many people are going to want to use bidirectional charging, unless you have a Powerwall, because if you unplug your car, your house goes dark, and this is extremely inconvenient.”
The answer was interesting because it gives a little insight into what Tesla’s thinking has been about bidirectional charging all along.
Bidirectional charging is the capability of a car to not only take power to charge the battery, but to send that power back to power devices, a home, or even the grid. These are further categorized as vehicle-to-load, vehicle-to-home, and vehicle-to-grid, or V2L, V2H, and V2G, respectively, and sometimes categorized overall as V2X.
Historically, Tesla has indeed opposed putting bidirectional charging systems on its vehicles. Most manufacturers have as well – only a few cars have bidirectional charging, and it’s often limited.
The Hyundai/Kia E-GMP platform cars are capable of V2L, Rivian is capable of V2L with potential V2H capabilities coming later, and Ford’s F-150 Lighting is capable of V2L, or V2H with its Ford Charge Station Pro. The Nissan Leaf is the only car we’re aware of with V2G capability, which has been built into the cars since 2013 but only recently got a charger that enables it, though Lucid has said they’re working on V2X for their vehicles as well. VW also says its ID range will get bidirectional charging eventually.
So where does that leave us with Tesla? It sounds like they will have the technical capability of providing bidirectional charging, but as the answer was short, we didn’t get a lot of specifics on the various forms.
One reason Tesla hasn’t considered bidirectional charging a priority is because there are some reasons that an owner wouldn’t want to use it. For example, if you parked your car with 200 miles of charge and plugged it into the house, then the house or grid decided to discharge your car to take advantage of peak electricity rates (perhaps through Tesla’s Virtual Power Plant program), perhaps you’d be surprised to return to it having 100 miles of range – maybe you made some money, but now you can’t get where you were planning to go.
For this reason, you’d need to have robust controls and internet communications with the car, so that owners can manage demand, but that shouldn’t be hard since every Tesla has internet communications built-in.
The ability to make money by selling power back to the grid brings up another point – you generally need a compatible charger, hooked into your home’s electrical system or with a special grid interconnect, and these can sometimes cost thousands of dollars to install. That money could be recuperated by participating in Virtual Power Plants, as long as your car is plugged in at the right times and set to participate in a program like this. Also, it’s cheaper than a Powerwall, but the point of a Powerwall is that it’s plugged in all the time, unlike a car.
The house going dark isn’t really a big concern, though, unless we’re talking about off-grid solar-only houses that use the car as their sole overnight energy storage or something. Otherwise, a home would simply switch to grid power when the car is unplugged. So Musk’s answer was, at best, quite glib.
I'll get a V2H car as soon as I can.   When parked at home, using it to handle the afternoon/early evening peak rate when the solar isn't productive will be a godsend, and having the full pack of the car is a lot more cost-effective than powerwall or equivalent.

Seriously, a no brainer for me.

The main problem is going to be software.   I looked at the Ford system, and it's disconnected backup only with a transfer switch.   Useful for some, but not for me.

Baglino also mentioned that there is more value in simply “charging the car at the right time,” rather than sending energy the other way. And this is true – while the dream of using millions of EVs as backup power for the grid is interesting, EVs can already help the grid just by charging at the right time, when excess energy is available, and by not charging at peaks.
Most EVs already do this, because many locations offer “time-of-use” rates allowing EVs to get cheaper electricity at night, which already works well at encouraging owners to charge at night instead of during peak electricity demand. And in fact, Tesla even announced that very thing in today’s Investor Day event – they’re offering overnight charging for $30/month in Texas later this year, where their isolated grid often deals with a glut of wind at night with nobody to sell it to, such that wholesale prices occasionally go negative.
But these answers do indicate possible internal tensions over whether to add bidirectional charging capability to cars. This is something that many EV owners like in theory, but could perhaps open a whole can of worms in practice, and may not actually help Tesla to sell all that many cars anyway since it’s a rather small crowd of people clamoring for this feature.
Baglino’s answer showed that the technical capability is there, but Musk’s answer showed that perhaps Tesla still thinks that customers might be too confused or resistant to the idea of losing a certain amount of control over their vehicle and home’s energy usage.

2023/03/01,"Tesla has done the math to better understand what it takes to transition the world to sustainable energy and released it during its Investor Day.
When on stage during the event, CEO Elon Musk said that it was about hope:
This event is about hope and optimism that is based on physics. Earth will move to a sustainable energy economy, and it will do so in your lifetime.
The CEO and Drew Baglino, Tesla’s top engineer, explained how they see the path to achieving this sustainability as mostly straightforward.
To explain it, they did the math and highlighted it in a series of slides:
That’s all Tesla believes the world needs for the energy economy to be fully sustainable.
Here’s the breakdown of all the related industries:
The company is making it sound relatively reasonable, and it has some good points to support its calculations.
First off, electric vehicles and renewable energy are so much more efficient than fossil fuels that you need to deploy a lot less capacity of the former to replace the latter:
That’s a great starting point and highlights just how much more efficient of a solution electrification is than burning fossil fuels.
The two biggest industries to address are energy and transport. Tesla broke down the needed energy and energy storage capacity to make the transition:
Tesla also highlighted heat pumps as a massive opportunity and the “‘lowest hanging fruit” to reduce fossil fuel use:
Another important thing that Musk and Baglino tried to highlight throughout the presentation is that for the biggest industries – energy and transport – we are already well underway, and that’s where Tesla plans to have the biggest impact:
For those worried about the cost of making that transition, Tesla isn’t worried about its own impact, which it plans to support through its own operations.
Can anyone explain how a battery based electric economy can be sustainable taking into consideration the limited lifetime of the batteries? From what i know, Tesla is not building pyramids that might outlive most of us by orders of magnitude, but their products have a lifetime of around 10 years, looking at their warranty periods. So let's say we spend the 10 trillion in 10 years and the global economy transitions entirely to use batteries of the total specified 240 TWh capacity as an energy storage solution. Now, after 10 more years, after the batteries start failing, wouldn't we need to spend those 10 trillion all over again? So the 10 trillion aren't actually recurring costs every 10 years? From what i heard, a single 100KWh EV battery costs $20k to replace. How is this sustainable, keeping in mind the costs of recycling and replacing the failing batteries, for all of them, 10 times over the next 100 years?

Similarly to how all the current people living currently on Earth won't be around 100 years from now, but will be different people entirely, the same should be expected with batteries, but only 10 years from now, with the same (maybe slightly smaller) cost of the ""transition"" repeated all over again every 10 years.

Am i missing something?
On a worldwide scale, Tesla’s math came to an investment over 20 years that is 40% lower than the investment in fossil fuels over 20 years based on the rate of investment in fossil fuels in 2022.
As for mining, when accounting for oil extraction, Tesla argues that the transition to sustainable energy through electrification will result in lower overall resource extraction from the earth:
In short, Tesla’s calculations come to the conclusion that a transition to a sustainable energy economy through renewable energy and electric vehicles is not only feasible, but it is going to be cheaper than what we currently invest in fossil fuels.
While that was more of an overview, Musk said that Tesla will release the math and sources for people to challenge its view.

2023/03/01,"Tesla has officially announced “Gigafactory Mexico” to build its next-gen vehicle platform to support new models.
We knew it was coming for months, and it was confirmed by Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador yesterday, but now Tesla has made it official.
At Tesla’s Investor Day today, the automaker announced that the project, now called Gigafactory Mexico, will be built just outside Monterrey in Nuevo León.
Tesla has released the render of the factory above, but it hasn’t released any detail about the factory other than it will be used to produce vehicles based on the automaker’s new vehicle platform.
The timeline for the new project also hasn’t been released, but we know that a quick regulatory process and road to construction and production have been part of the negotiation process with the government.
The automaker is going to try to recreate its success with Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Texas, which Tesla has been able to bring to production relatively quickly.
One of the reasons for choosing Monterrey is its closeness to Gigafactory Texas and Tesla’s headquarters, which is about a seven-hour drive away from the new plant site. Tesla has also managed to negotiate an interesting deal that will allow efficiency for travel between the sites.
Remember when EV naysayers would say “100% growth on zero is still zero”?
As we previously reported, people crossing the border between Texas and Nuevo Leon were surprised to see not just the usual marked lanes for cars and trucks but also one marked “Tesla.”
We ended up finding out that Tesla had struck a deal with the state of Nuevo Leon to have its own lane at the border crossing in order to reduce wait times for cargo going through the border. Or at least that was the explanation of Ivan Rivas, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon.
While it’s true that Tesla has several suppliers in the state, as we reported at the time, we suspected that the move might have more to do with Tesla potentially investing in a factory in the state.
Now it has been confirmed with Gigafactory Mexico.

2023/03/01,"Tesla will create a permanent magnet electric vehicle motor with zero rare earth elements in it, the company announced at its Investor Day today.
Rare earth elements are a bone of contention in EV supply chains, as it can be hard to secure supplies of them, and a large majority of worldwide production is either sourced or processed in China.
This is important for several reasons, not the least of which is due to the Biden Administration’s current push for domestically produced electric vehicle component materials.
However, there are a lot of misconceptions about what a rare earth element is and how many of them are used by electric cars. In fact, lithium-ion batteries typically contain zero rare earth elements (though they do contain other “critical minerals” as defined in the Inflation Reduction Act).
On the periodic table, “rare earth elements” are those outlined in red in the graphic below – Lanthanides, plus Scandium and Yttrium. They are not actually all that particularly rare either, with Neodymium being about two-thirds as abundant as copper.
The rare earth elements in an EV are used in electric car motors rather than batteries. The most used is Neodymium, which is used in powerful magnets for speakers, hard drives, and electric motors. Dysprosium, Terbium and Praesodymium are commonly used as additives in Neodymium magnets.
Further, rare earth elements are not used in every type of electric car motor – Tesla uses them in DC permanent magnet motors but not in its AC induction motors.
Originally, Tesla used AC induction motors in its vehicles, which did not need rare earth elements. In fact, this is where the company got its namesake – Nikola Tesla was the inventor of the AC induction motor. But then when the Model 3 came out, the company introduced a new permanent magnet motor and eventually started using these motors in its other vehicles as well.
Tesla stated today that, between 2017 and 2022, it managed to reduce rare earth usage in these new Model 3 drive units by 25% as it increased the efficiency of the drivetrain.
But now it looks like Tesla is trying to get the best of both worlds: a permanent magnet motor, but without rare earth elements.
The main alternative to neodymium iron boride as a permanent magnet is simple ferrite (iron oxide, typically with barium or strontium additives). You can always make a permanent magnet stronger by simply using more magnet, but space inside a motor rotor is limited and neodymium iron boride gives you so much more magnetisation with a smaller amount of material. Other permanent magnet materials on the market include AlNiCo (aluminium-nickel-cobalt alloys), which perform well at high temperature but easily lose their magnetisation, and samarium cobalt, another rare earth magnet that is similar to NdFeB but handles high temperature better. Research is underway into a range of alternative materials, mostly targeting the gap between ferrites and rare earths, but this is still in the lab, not in serious production.

I suspect Tesla have found a way to use ferrite magnet rotors. If they've been reducing the amount of rare earths, that'll mean they've been reducing the amount of permanent magnet in the rotor. I'm willing to bet that they've decided to get their lower-than-normal magnetic flux from a big chunk of ferrite, rather than a small chunk of NdFeB. I could be wrong, and they could have buddied up with one of the pilot-scale alternative materials. But that seems unlikely to me - Tesla are gunning for high-volume production, which basically means either rare earths or ferrites.
During its Investor Day presentation, Tesla showed a slide comparing its current rare earth usage in the Model Y permanent magnet motor with a potential next-generation motor:
Tesla was not specific about which elements it uses, perhaps considering that information a trade secret that it doesn’t want to let out. But the first number is likely Neodymium, and the others could be Dysprosium and Terbium.
As for the future motor – well, we really aren’t sure. Tesla’s graphic states that the next motor will include a permanent magnet, but the magnet will not use rare earth elements.
Neodymium-based permanent magnets have been the standard for applications like this for some time, but there has been research over the last decade looking into other potential materials which could replace it. While Tesla has not specified which one it plans to use, it seems to be close to a decision – or at least sees the possibility of sourcing a better solution in the near future.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/03/01,"Tesla is displaying an impressive-looking “pre-production beta Cybertruck” at Investor Day – resulting in our best look at the latest version of the electric pickup truck yet.
As we previously reported, Tesla has built a fleet of beta Cybertruck prototypes to test ahead of the start of production this summer.
Over the last few weeks, we started spotting those Cybertruck prototypes around California.
Every time we see a new prototype, we try to see new design features that might end up in the production version – like an updated front-end and the monstrous wiper coming back on a recent sighting or the jacked-up air suspension spotted a few days ago.
Earlier this week, we also saw new aerial footage of the Cybertruck, showing that the latest prototypes are more refined.
But now we get our best look yet as Tesla is displaying what it calls a “pre-production beta Cybertruck” at its Investor Day event today.
Tesla Daily captured a video of the prototype with the closest look at the electric pickup truck to date:
This prototype looks to be the most refined we have seen to date, with body panels looking more like a production vehicle than a prototype.
A few new features are seen on the prototype. For example, the Cybertruck has a new steering wheel – it’s not the yoke anymore, but it’s not completely round either:
I read the news for Cybertruck updates every day, so I didn’t see too many surprises here.  I saw a few odd things – which I’m surprised were not corrected.  Like why do the window frames rounded in the upper corners?  I’m hopeful to hear about a mid-gate (it doesn’t look like this beta has one) and the roof light bar.  I like that they had the wheel covers on, and I think the exterior trim looks great!  What I want to know most is the PRICE!!   For a reasonable price, I can accept that the interior is cheap robber and plastic.  But if this is to compete with the pricier Fords, Chevys, and Rams, Tesla is going to have to up their game. 
People were allowed to get inside, but from this angle, it looks like the center console has been updated. It looks bigger, and it’s harder to tell if it can still be used as a seat, as was the case with the original prototype.
The video also shows cameras all around the Cybertruck, including in the front bumper – something that could be announced today with the Hardware 4.0 Autopilot sensor suite.
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, which is when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
Is there anything else interesting you see on this prototype? Let us know in the comment section below.

Over the last few years, Tesla has started to hold regular events like ‘Battery Day‘ and ‘AI Day’ to give updates on some of its most important programs and recruit talent to build them.
In January, Tesla announced that it is adding another such event to its calendar: Investor Day. Today, March 1st, 2023, has come.
The automaker described the event:
Our investors will be able to see our most advanced production line as well as discuss long term expansion plans, generation 3 platform, capital allocation and other subjects with our leadership team.
The fact that the new platform is going to be part of the event has led to a lot of speculation about Tesla potentially unveiling a new vehicle based on that platform, but it’s only speculation for now.
Since the announcement, CEO Elon Musk also confirmed that his Tesla Master Plan Part 3 will be part of the event. We know that the latest installment of the “Master Plan” will be about how the automaker’s plan to scale to 20 million vehicles per year by the end of the decade.
Therefore, Tesla is expected to talk about supply chain strategies down to mining the materials and all the way to producing the batteries and the vehicles. 
Odds are 100 to 1 against V2G
Mostly I expect the presentation to convince me to wait another 2 years to buy for the next great things coming.
New factory announcements are expected to be part of the event, including Gigafactory Mexico.

2023/03/01,"A new report states that Tesla is currently working on a Model Y refresh codenamed “Juniper,” which should come into production next year.
We know that Tesla is currently working on a Model 3 refresh as prototypes have been sighted over the last three months.
Now Reuters reports that a Model Y refresh is following not too far behind:
The changes to the Model Y – code-named Project Juniper at Tesla – involve the exterior and interior of the crossover electric vehicle with a target of starting production in 2024, according to two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the planning remains private.
As we previously reported, Reuters has a less-than-stellar track record when it comes to reporting on Tesla, so we need to take this with a grain of salt.
In this case, it sounds like the publication is working with sources at Tesla suppliers:
Tesla has separately asked suppliers for quotes for a revamped version of the Project Juniper version of the Model Y for exterior and interior components that would go into production next year, two of the people said.
Based on that information, it claims that the refresh will involve the interior and exterior of the SUV, but no detail about what would be different is available. A start of production in October 2024 is currently what they are aiming for, according to the report.
The Model Y went into production in 2020, but it didn’t start to ramp up significantly until 2021. 
As well as structural I wonder if this is also about aligning a new design language. Model 3 will get the update first - maybe we'll see that today, probably subtle but noticable and it's logical for Y to then follow suit in a bid to have as many common parts as possible. This may even include shared components with '2' if and when that comes to life?
It is a bit early for Tesla to do a “refresh” of the vehicle, but it could also be about the automaker introducing significant architectural changes, like a structural battery pack – something that is currently only done on some Model Y vehicles built in Texas.
The report seems to be based on information from China with one of Reuters’ Shanghai-based reporters.
They could be hearing about Tesla’s project to introduce the structural battery pack Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai.
Obviously, I don’t have their information and it’s just a guess, but it would make sense in my opinion.

2023/02/28,"Tesla has finally started to open some Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric car owners in the US, and it explained how it works.
It has been a long time coming, but we also knew it was finally coming soon as we started to spot Tesla installing the “Magic Dock” at some Supercharger stations in the last few days.
While those stations were now equipped with the integrated CCS adapter to work with non-Tesla EVs, the automaker had yet to officially open them up through the app and start onboarding electric cars owners to its charging network.
Today, Tesla officially started to do that:
Select Superchargers in the US are now open to other EVs → https://t.co/zObpFM4li1 pic.twitter.com/wQW0KGvlpw
As we previously reported, everything is handled through the app. Non-Tesla EV owners simply have to download the Tesla app, create an account, add a credit card for payment, and then they can roll up to some of the select few Supercharger stations now equipped with a Magic Dock – primarily in New York for now.
In the app, electric car owners can see the station and select the stall where they park. After, they simply have to grab the handle where the CCS adapter will come out of the Magic Dock:
Tesla does warn that it can take up to two minutes to charge, which is longer than with a Tesla vehicle – presumably because the station has to talk to the car through the app instead of directly.
The automaker produced a quick video to show non-Tesla EV owners how to use the Supercharger network:
This is awesome. Personally, I don't care that it costs more - for those once or twice a year trips that most people need to charge up outside their home, the convenience really overshadows the price.
At the moment, it appears that only half a dozen stations in the state of New York are available to non-Tesla EV owners, but the number is expected to grow rapidly as Tesla deploys the Magic Dock at more stations and builds new ones.

It’s pretty impressive that Tesla managed to create an experience for non-Tesla EV owners at Supercharger stations that is almost as frictionless as the experience for Tesla owners.
I’d argue that the experience is going to be as good if not better than at third-party stations, which were supposed to be designed for non-Tesla electric vehicles.
Hopefully, this should force charging network operators to elevate their customer experience and network reliability, which is something that the Supercharger network has been dominating.

2023/02/28,"Consumer insights and analytics specialist J.D. Power has released its annual US Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study that relays not only an increase in EV customer satisfaction but also a shift to more traditional factors, like vehicle quality and styling, rather than categories like range. In its first year of eligibility, the Rivian R1T garnered the top satisfaction rating amongst premium EVs, dethroning 2022’s leader, the Tesla Model 3.
J.D. Power is an American consumer intelligence company founded in the late 1960s that uses big data and AI to evaluate detailed consumer interactions and trends across many industries, including automotive, financial services, healthcare, insurance, technology, and media.
Each year, the company releases its US Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study, which benchmarks customer satisfaction with the critical attributes that affect the total or overall EV ownership experience.
For the past two years, the study has been conducted through the EV driver app and research firm PlugShare and has rated BEVs and PHEVs in both the premium and mass-market automotive segments. J.D. Power’s leading premium BEV for 2022 was the Tesla Model 3, joined by the Kia Niro EV as the highest-rated mass-market model.
This year, however, J.D. Power is reporting a new premium EV with the highest customer satisfaction that also represents a shift in factors most important to customers, like towing. Here’s the 2023 data:
According to J.D. Power’s 2023 EVX Ownership Study, the Rivian R1T and MINI Cooper electric have the highest levels of owner satisfaction for premium and mass-market Evs, respectively. The R1T ranked highest in seven of the 10 categories within the study for a total of 794 points (out of 1,000). Second was the Tesla Model 3, with 759 points.
The MINI electric garnered 782 points, followed by the Kia EV6 (762) and Mustang Mach-E (742). Compiling all three years of the study, J.D. Power points out that customer satisfaction for premium EVs averages 756 points, while mass-market vehicles sit at 730. Executive director of the EV practice at J.D. Power Brent Gruber spoke to this year’s results:
The electric vehicle landscape is changing quickly, and newer models are bringing in more mainstream, first-time EV buyers. Recent vehicle launches from both new brands and traditional automakers have had a profound effect on what factors are most important in the ownership experience. Today’s EV owners are looking for quality, reliability, driving enjoyment, safety and technology features.
According to J.D. Power, the biggest inhibitors to customer satisfaction in premium EVs are squeaks and rattling, while infotainment remains the biggest complaint for mass-market BEV owners for a third consecutive year. Mass-market vehicle owners also reported a much larger qualm with public charging availability as those EVs do not have access to Tesla’s Supercharger network… but only for a bit longer.
The past year brought the debut of multiple all-electric trucks in addition to the Rivian R1T, and customer satisfaction surprisingly reflected positive feedback for those who did use their all-electric towing capabilities. Drive range satisfaction was also higher among those who towed compared to those who hadn’t, stating that estimated range accuracy met customer expectations.
First-time BEV ownership is up 11% compared to 2022, and mass-market EVs are seeing adoption at a higher rate than premium models. Those customers note decreased operational costs and tax credits as their primary reasons for purchasing their first EV, while driving performance remains the top reason for first-time premium BEV buyers.
J.D. Power states that customers for the study included 7,073 owners of 2022 and 2023 model-year BEVs and PHEVs who were surveyed from August through December 2022.

On top of that, it doesn’t work both ways, since Tesla owners don’t have access to most non-Tesla charging stations due to them being equipped with CCS connectors.
In 2020, Tesla announced that a CCS1 adapter is coming, but it was only available in Korea, for some reason.
It took two years, but Tesla finally launched the $250 CCS adapter in North America late last year.
However, the adapter was not available to all Tesla owners. The charging ECU in Tesla vehicles built prior to October 2020 is not compatible, and it is going to need a retrofit in order to work with the adapter. 
When first launching the adapter last year, the automaker said that the retrofit would come in 2023 without confirming the price.
Now Tesla has added the price of the retrofit, and it’s not cheap. Last week, Tesla reduced the price of the adapter to $175, which helps, but if you have a car older than October 2020, it is going to cost you $450 to get both the adapter and the new charging ECU.
$450 is too much? or $700 with the adapter, service included?

It is an optional update and not needed by many. Tesla never said that the charger on the car would be CCS compatible. The fact that they can retrofit 3 years old cars to have CCS compatibility with an adapter is a plus. 
Tesla also appears to have pushed the start of the retrofits, which will put some stress on the automaker’s service capacity, to “mid-2023.”
Is it worth it? That will depend on everyone’s situation. If you do a specific route regularly that the Supercharger network doesn’t cover well, but where there are CCS chargers, it might be worth it.
Personally, I think $450 is a bit high. I don’t think I’ll get it on my Model 3. 
The Supercharger network has served me well so far and it keeps growing. I think I’ll save $450.

2023/02/27,"Tesla is completely dominating brand loyalty in the US, and that’s because electric cars are taking over, and Tesla is basically the electric car market in America right now.
With over 60% of the new electric car market, Tesla is extremely dominant in the US. When you think of electric vehicles, you are more likely than not thinking about Tesla. And with interest in electric vehicles rising fast, combined with the fact that electric car drivers are not going back to gas, it creates an incredible opportunity for Tesla to capture market shares and create brand royalty.
A recent study already showed that Tesla has the highest customer retention rate in the US.
Now a separate study from S&P Global is showing that Tesla now dominates brand loyalty in the US:
On top of its “Overall Loyalty to Make” recognition, Tesla scored repeat wins for “Highest Conquest Percentage” and “Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to Make.” The combination of an active return-to-market consumer base and a majority share of BEV sales were contributors to Tesla’s loyalty performance this year. However, the brand’s resonance with ethnic consumers was a key driver in its recognition of loyalty improvement and diversity retention.
The only two categories that Tesla didn’t come on top in the study are “Overall Loyalty to Manufacturer” and “Overall Loyalty to Dealer”:
This can be easily explained by the fact that Tesla only has a single brand, unlike GM, and it doesn’t use the dealer model, like Subaru and most other automakers.
S&P Global also noted that Tesla’s rise to the top of loyalty in the US comes amid an overall decline in average loyalty in the auto market.
And it will tend to stay like that unless the CCS1 charging networks can get their act together and other makers do a better job with their software.

IoniQ 5 & EV6 customers are still waiting for the battery pre-conditioning update. VW still has buggy software. Etc.
This is not a complicated situation. Electrification is coming faster than all those automakers anticipated, and Tesla is offering compelling electric vehicles in higher volume than anyone else.
Customers are going to them, and they are not going back to gas.
More non-Tesla options are becoming available, but none of them are available in the kind of volume that Tesla is currently delivering.
This will change in the next few years, but this early advantage is giving a big edge to Tesla – an edge that could last a while.

2023/02/27,"Tesla has updated some of the language around its “Full Self-Driving Beta” program following the NHTSA recall, and some owners are quite disappointed.
If you were to take the pulse of Tesla owners on social media this morning, you would find that many of them are confused or even disappointed.
We are seeing a lot of comments like this one from well-known FSD Beta tester Chuck Cook: 
I'm really disappointed.  Can anyone really read this and feel like we are where we thought we were?  I am all in on #FSDBeta and supportive of the path we are on, but this wording sounds so ""legal"" that I am not sure what to expect going forward. https://t.co/zKtggsUAqb… https://t.co/5oKPQxdrLW
The concern arises from a new support page that Tesla created regarding the NHTSA recall for FSD Beta earlier this month.
On the support page, Tesla admits that FSD Beta can sometimes break the rules of the road, which is something that anyone who used the system already knows, but the biggest concern for Tesla owners seems to be Tesla qualifying the system as a “level 2 driver assist system”:
FSD Beta is an SAE Level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations. With FSD Beta, as with all SAE Level 2 driver support features, the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle.
Tesla always qualified it as such, but some believe that the automaker is saying that it will always be “Level 2.”
The company also confirmed that it has stopped the expansion of the FSD Beta program until it propagated the “recall update”.
Everyone knows I’m not the biggest fan of FSD Beta. The very first tweet I sent to Elon Musk after he unblocked me last week is to suggest Tesla should offer refund for FSD:
Tesla should offer the possibility of getting a refund to everyone who ordered the Full Self-Driving package.
With that said, I am not particularly concerned about what Tesla is saying on this new support page.
Autopilot alone is incapable of operating in inclement weather the moment a camera gets obscured with water.  How exactly does Tesla plan to operate fleets of self driving taxis when a splash of mud on the freeway will blind the car to the point of being inoperable?  What's the software patch for that?

If you can't figure that one out, then it rapidly becomes clear that this whole thing has been a fraud since the beginning.  

Never mind the new ""required"" self driving hardware that's somehow needed for full self driving but don't worry, your old hardware will also maybe sorta work just enough so Tesla can pretend to avoid legal liability.
Yes, it does make it sound like “FSD Beta” is only intended to be “Level 2,” but that’s the beta. In my view, it doesn’t go against what Tesla has said in the past. Under the beta, Tesla is trying circumvent a lot of complications and regulations that come with anything more than a level 2 driver-assist system, but the goal is to use the program to eventually take it out of beta and become a level 4 or 5 system.
Now whether Tesla can achieve that is a completely different question, and I have my doubts, but I don’t think anything changed here.
I still believe Tesla needs to offer the option to be reimbursed for people who bought the FSD package and still don’t have the beta or are disappointed in the beta since it’s nowhere near what Tesla promised years ago.
I think that will go a long way to create some goodwill as the inevitable lawsuits start to pile up.

2023/02/27,"Tesla announced that it has achieved a new production rate milestone at Gigafactory Berlin, which now produces 4,000 Model Y vehicles per week.
When ramping up a new vehicle to volume production at a new factory, Tesla generally considers 5,000 units per week to be the goal.
After starting production late in 2021, Tesla originally aimed to achieve that at Gigafactory Berlin by the end of 2022.
But the goal was ambitious amid a continuing global supply chain crisis.
Instead, Tesla announced that it finished the year with a respectable production rate of 3,000 Model Y vehicles per week at Gigafactory Berlin.
Now two months later, Tesla confirmed that the factory has managed to continue the ramp to now 4,000 vehicles per week:
4k Model Y built at Giga Berlin this week 🤘Congrats to the Tesla team! pic.twitter.com/VJ0qBPkQ6U
That puts Tesla’s total annual capacity at Gigafactory Berlin at about 200,000 vehicles, and it is getting fairly close to the goal of 5,000 units per week.
Once the automaker achieves that goal, it has several important implications.
It being Europe, Model 2 production would seem to make sense - assuming the design allows for minimal labour hours per vehicle so the labour cost disparity vs China is not too difficult. Perhaps the higher end Europe spec of the M2?

Can't help thinking they should start looking at 'badge engineering' to differentiate cheaper lower spec models to avoid eroding margins in their primary brand.
Generally, that’s where the gross margin starts to improve, and the factory starts to weigh less negatively on Tesla’s overall gross margin. It also means that Tesla will likely start to look at deploying production capacity for another vehicle program at Gigafactory Berlin.
Originally, Tesla talked about a Model 3 production line, but it’s unclear if that’s still the plan.
The automaker also planned to start battery cell production at the factory, but we recently learned that Tesla slowed down that plan as it focuses on ramping up cell production in the US first.
Eventually, Tesla plans to produce over half a million vehicles per year at Gigafactory Berlin along with battery cells to support that production capacity, and that’s just for the first phase of the factory. Ultimately, Tesla has said that the goal is to produce up to a million vehicles annually at the plant.

2023/02/26,"A Tesla Cybertruck prototype was spotted with a new black tonneau cover as the electric pickup truck is starting to look more refined as it gets closer to production.
As we previously reported, Tesla has built a fleet of beta Cybertruck prototypes to test ahead of the start of production this summer.
Over the last few weeks, we started spotting those Cybertruck prototypes around California.
Every time we see a new prototype, we try to see new design features that might end up in the production version – like an updated front-end and the monstrous wiper coming back on a recent sighting or the jacked-up air suspension spotted a few days ago.
Now a new sighting, this time aerial, gives us a great look at the top of the Cybertruck, which appears to feature a new black tonneau cover:
New shot of Tesla Cybertruck in California. 👀 The black glass top with black cover looks really good imo. pic.twitter.com/z65vKTm5hJ
Many recent Tesla Cybertruck prototypes didn’t have a bed cover, and this one appears to be darker than those previously spotted.
It could potentially be the production one.
The tonneau cover is supposed to be automatically retractable and robust enough for someone to be able to stand on it.
Furthermore, it is supposed to also have solar cells in it – or at least to have an option for solar cells in it.
After the launch of the Cybertruck, CEO Elon Musk surprised many when he said that Tesla’s new electric pickup truck will have a solar roof option that will add 15 miles of range per day.
Later, Tesla filed for a patent that showed the solar cells will be embedded inside the retractable tonneau cover.
I think, Cybertruck will be a huge success. I put down $100 the day it is unveiled and still waiting for it. I think I can get it in 2025. Whenever it is available, I will buy it. If you consider that I am living in Istanbul, Türkiye, it will seem weird but as a person currently driving a simple Toyota Corolla, I still want to have it whatever it will cost to me. It's an extraordinary machine to drive and I want to have that experience...
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
I doubt that this particular prototype features solar cells. If Tesla still plans to bring that as an option, I would assume that it wouldn’t launch at the same time as the Cybertruck.
It would likely become an option later after Tesla has ramped up to volume production.
Nonetheless, it’s nice to see a Cybertruck that looks almost complete driving around on the road. It truly looks like it is CGI.
",tesla
2023/02/24,"Tesla has applied for a patent on a new “ultra-hard” steel alloy that it plans to use with the Cybertruck electric pickup truck.
One of the Cybertruck’s biggest differentiating features is the fact that Tesla plans to build it with a body and “exoskeleton” made of “ultra-hard” stainless steel:
Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.
The automaker said that it planned to develop its own alloy for it, and now it has applied for a patent to secure the intellectual property behind it.
In the patent application called “Ultra-Hard Cold-Worked Steel Alloy,” Tesla noted that it could be used in a vehicle with an exoskeleton:
In some embodiments, at least one exterior panel and/or body of the vehicle comprises the steel alloy. In some embodiments, the vehicle architecture is designed such that the exterior panels of the vehicle also contribute to the vehicle’s structural performance, wherein such exterior paneling of a vehicle may be referred to as an “exoskeleton.” In some embodiments, the exterior panel is or is formed from a monolithic metal sheet of the steel alloy. In some embodiments, the corrosion resistance of the monolithic metal sheet allows for the exterior panel of the vehicle to be utilized without application of an anticorrosion coating or corrosion protective agent (e.g. paint). In some embodiments, an exterior surface of the exterior panel does not comprise paint.
This leads us to believe it is indeed the alloy that Tesla plans to use for the Cybertruck.
Just another blend of 300 series stainless steel.  It probably made a trade off between the variation of 301, 304 and 316 SS.  Those are standard offering that is very common in the industry.   Tesla probably just has its own slightly tweaked 300 series blend.  That isn't all that rare.  

Some people fall for the marketing of 30X meaning that it is 30 times stronger.


In the patent application, Tesla shared some technical specs of the steel alloy:
In one aspect, a steel alloy composition is described. The composition includes Fe, a hardness is at least about 400 HV, and an Epit-Eocp corrosion resistance of at least about 500 mV in a 3 wt% sodium chloride aqueous solution.
In some embodiments, the hardness is about 420 HV to about 500 HV. In some embodiments, the Epit-Eocp corrosion resistance is about 520 mV to about 800 mV. In some embodiments, the Epit-Eocp corrosion resistance is about 520 mV to about 600 mV. In some embodiments, the composition has a yield strength of at least about 1100 MPa. In some embodiments, the composition has a ductility of at least about 60° bend angle at 1.8mm thickness. In some embodiments, martensite formation begins at about 260 K to about 340 K. In some embodiments, martensite formation begins at about 260 K to about 320 K. In some embodiments, the composition has at least about 12 vol% martensite. In some embodiments, the composition has a yield strength of at least about 1100 MPa.
The automaker claims that it outperforms other alloys:
It’s still not clear who is going to manufacture this alloy for Tesla, but there have been rumors that Steel Dynamics, which is operating a new giant plant in Texas not too far from where Tesla plans to manufacture the Cybertruck, could be a potential partner.
Tesla plans to start production of the Cybertruck at Gigafactory Texas in Austin this summer and ramp up to volume production next year.

2023/02/23,"A new prototype vehicle has been spotted over the last few days, and it clearly has some Tesla design features. It could be a test mule for the upcoming new “Tesla Model 2” $25,000 electric car, or it could be nothing.
The rumors about a new Tesla vehicle have been ramping up over the last few days.
Tesla has been talking about a new cheaper model for years now, and with the upcoming unveiling of its next-generation vehicle platform next week, it’s possible that the automaker will quickly reveal the first vehicle to use that platform.
Earlier today, we reported on Tesla potentially leaking the design of its new electric compact car with design drawings in a new corporate video.
Now we have also been getting reports on a new prototype in China, and some are speculating that it is a Tesla vehicle.
A reader also sent us some images of the same prototype:
The vehicle is highly confusing. It has clear Tesla design features, including the wheels, headlights, and front-end, but it also appears to have a Mazda CX-30 body.
Tesla is not known for using camouflage like this, but at the same time, it’s the first time the automaker is developing a new vehicle in China, and we should expect some new ways of doing things.
In 2020, Tesla announced plans to establish a new R&D center in China to build “a Chinese-style” electric car.
Tesla started taking design submissions for its Chinese-made small electric car that summer and started hiring for the program shortly afterward.
CEO Elon Musk said that it would be a Tesla car “designed and built in China.”
But it’s still not clear if this is a Tesla test mule for its next vehicle or if it’s a strange modified CX-30 made to look like a Tesla prototype.
In China, it is being reported as a new “Tesla Model 2,” but there doesn’t seem to be any proof beyond the prototype having been spotted around over the last few days.
I don't understand why many are thinking that a modified cx-30 would be a Tesla prototype.
I think it's a prank of a Chinese ""tiktoker"" equivalent.
I'd really surprised if Tesla invested money in a new Chinese design department to produce a model almost identical to a boring one of a competitor only 30cm (1') smaller than a model Y. I'm just speculating but I'd expect the next cheaper Tesla in the 4-4.2m (13'-13'10"") range.
This is a strange one. Very confusing. It would be a departure from Tesla’s usual prototype-making to use a body from another automaker, but again it’s the first time it is developing a car in China.
Also, the CX-30 is probably about the size Tesla would be going for with this new model.
If it’s not a Tesla test mule then what is it? That’s a hard question to answer. Some kind of prank? 
I don’t know. I am torn. What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below.

2023/02/23,"The first Tesla Supercharger station with a “Magic Dock” to allow non-Tesla electric cars to charge has been spotted in the US.
After opening its Supercharger network in Europe last year and indicating that it would do the same in North America by the end of the year, we were a bit disappointed when it didn’t happen.
However, we know that it is still imminent. It could really happen any day, or it might have already happened by way of a “soft launch.”
Unlike in Europe, where Tesla already uses the CCS connector, we knew that Tesla would have a tougher time opening its Supercharger network in North America because it uses its own proprietary connector in the market.
The move to open source its connector in an attempt to make it the new North American charging standard made the plan murkier late last year, but the automaker confirmed that it still plans to offer a CCS adapter at its charging stations to support non-Tesla electric vehicles.
We recently learned that Tesla’s solution is going to be deploying the “Magic Dock,” a new receiver for the Tesla charge connector on the Supercharger station.
When the Magic Dock is locked, the station can be used normally by any Tesla owner, but when it is unlocked through Tesla’s app, both the charger and the Magic Dock get pulled along with the Tesla Supercharger handle to become a CCS adapter – allowing it to be plugged into most electric vehicles.
Now a Redditor spotted what is likely the very first Supercharger station to feature the Magic Dock:
With a faceplate in the ground next to the charger, it looks like Tesla had just updated the Supercharger and is testing it with a Rivian R1T electric pickup truck.
I actually saw (and spoke with) this exact crew working on superchargers at a different location in Western NY on Tuesday Feb 21st. They said they were preparing the chargers for upgrades, even though the chargers are only a couple of months old. I saw that same Rivian pull up to one of the chargers and it seemed like he was going to charge (I didn't check to see if he plugged in because he was sideways). Even though I had heard Tesla was opening up the network a few days before, I didn't put two and two together. Granted, I'm new to the Tesla family (as of Sunday) and I'm not used to only seeing Teslas at superchargers yet.

The workers seemed like a great group of guys. Very friendly. The worker I was talking with said the guy in the Rivian was one of his coworkers (along the other Tesla parked sideways). They might be using the Rivian for testing purposes.

The cars are parked sideways to block off the chargers because they are being worked on.
Electrek reader Kenny sent us another picture with a close up of the Magic Dock:
The Supercharger is located in upstate New York – not too far from Buffalo, where Tesla is operating Gigafactory New York – a location used to build Supercharger stations, among other things.
Tesla hasn’t updated the information about this specific Supercharger station to disclose that it is open to non-Tesla EVs, as it appears to still be testing it.
Last week, Tesla and the White House have confirmed that the automaker will soon start to open “select” Supercharger stations to non-Tesla EV owners in the US and plans to double the size of its network to make 7,500 Superchargers available to all EVs by the end of 2024.

2023/02/23,"Tesla might have leaked design drawings of its upcoming new electric compact car as part of a new corporate video.
At Tesla Battery Day in 2020, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will be making a $25,000 electric car.
The CEO commented in the announcement:
Tesla will make a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that is also fully autonomous.
He made it clear that this new price point is achieved through Tesla’s new battery cell and battery manufacturing effort, which could reduce battery costs by over 50%.
The $25,000 Tesla electric car, which is often referred to as the “Tesla Model 2,” has been likened to a new electric hatchback that Tesla has been planning to produce at Gigafactory Shanghai in China and export globally.
In 2020, Tesla announced plans to establish a new R&D center in China to build “a Chinese-style” electric car.
Tesla started taking design submissions for its Chinese-made small electric car that summer and started hiring for the program shortly afterward.
At the time, the automaker also released this early design drawing of a small electric hatchback. It led many to think that it was the design direction and form factor that Tesla is going for in the upcoming electric vehicle:
As Tesla is about to reveal its next-generation vehicle platform at its upcoming Investor Day next week, there are a lot of rumors about the automaker potentially unveiling the first vehicle on this new platform, which could be this cheaper electric hatchback.
Now the rumors are ramping up because people on social media spotted new design drawings as part of a corporate video released by Tesla for the opening of its new engineering headquarters yesterday.
In the video, we see the drawing shown above, and next to it there are two other design drawings that can be directly linked to existing Tesla vehicles:
Those drawings appear to be of a more compact vehicle from Tesla, which is leading some Tesla fans to believe it could be the $25,000 car that Musk talked about before.
Car designers seem to be obsessed with giant wheels with low profile tires, which are aerodynamically less efficient and low profile tires lead to busted tires and rims in our potholed world. With a marginal handling advantage, they give a harsher ride.
What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below.
Personally, I’m not convinced by the blue design drawing. It could be a Model 3. I’ve seen design drawings from Tesla for existing vehicles where they look shorter and have only two doors.
We recently covered that with the Cybertruck.
But the white one is more interesting. It looks more like a hatchback, and the fact that it is on top of the previously released design drawing could be an indicator.

2023/02/23,"A Tesla Model 3 prototype with a refreshed design under camouflage has been spotted sporting new wheels.
Late last year, we started hearing rumors that Tesla is working on a Model 3 refresh that would come during the second half of 2023.
The project is reportedly codenamed “Highland.”
For a few years now, Tesla has been integrating its large casting technology into Model Y with single large casting parts replacing dozens of parts in the electric SUV.
This new technology has enabled Tesla to greatly improve manufacturing efficiency with the Model Y compared to Model 3. CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla will bring the same technology to the Model 3 eventually, but he couldn’t exactly say when.
The problem is that such an update to the Model 3 would temporarily slow down production, and Tesla couldn’t afford that while it was still ramping up Model Y production. However, Model Y production is now starting to exceed Model 3 production, and it could be good timing for Tesla to update the Model 3 using the technology.
In December, a Model 3 prototype with heavy camouflage was spotted being tested in California.
Another prototype was spotted earlier this month as Tesla is expected to be closer to releasing the vehicle.
With the heavy camouflage on the front and back of those prototypes, it has been hard to identify any specific change to the Model 3.
Now another Model 3 prototype has been spotted, and it again features heavy camouflage on the front and back:
Project Highland 👀 #Tesla #ProjectHighland pic.twitter.com/PuOJjFe1LL
But this time, we can see a change in the vehicle: the wheels. This prototype features new wheels that have never been seen on a Tesla vehicle before.
They appear to be new 18″ aero wheels without the aero cap.
Unlike Tesla’s current aero wheel design, the spokes come into the center at different angles. If the wheel itself has changed, it’s likely that Tesla also changed the design of the aero caps, but those haven’t been spotted yet.
It’s not clear when Tesla plans to announce the new updated Model 3, but more details could be released on Investor Day next week as the automaker is expected to give a product roadmap update.

2023/02/22,"Tesla is set to announce a move to a new ‘California Engineering Headquarters’ in about an hour with both CEO Elon Musk and Governor Gavin Newsome participating in the announcement.
California has been critical to Tesla’s success over the last 20 years. The state has helped Tesla in its time of need, and its strong climate initiatives and EV incentives have made it the biggest market for electric vehicles in the US and, therefore, Tesla’s biggest market.
However, the love story between Tesla and California ended somewhat abruptly in 2020. Early measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 resulted in Tesla closing its Fremont factory, which angered CEO Elon Musk to the point of threatening to move Tesla from California.
By 2021, Tesla delivered on the threat and moved its headquarters to Texas.
The automaker always maintained that it is still heavily investing in California and even had to walk back Musk’s threat to move the Fremont factory out of the state.
The company maintained its old headquarters in Palo Alto, which became a hub for some engineering and administrative teams.
There have been rumors that Tesla has been taking over some buildings previously occupied by HP closer to the center of Palo Alto in recent months – with rumors that it would move its California offices there.
Tesla had already started taking buildings at the old HP headquarters back in 2021.
Now Tesla has announced today that it will confirm a new “California Enigneering HQ” today:
California Engineering HQ announcement with @elonmusk & @GavinNewsom at 11:45am PT
The announcement is coming in the next hour and we will update this post with all the details. Stay tuned.
Update: it’s going to be broadcasted live on Twitter (of course).
California Engineering HQ—Remarks by Gov. Newsom/Elon Musk https://t.co/DMoY7TYK5O
This would be a very good move for the company. Abandoning California after all these years would be a bad idea. Hopefully they can reap benefits from and have great relationships with both California and Texas.
They have confirmed that the new engineering headquarters will be located at 1501 Page Mill Road. Palo Alto, CA 94304.
The announcement is as simple as making the former HP HQ in Palo Alto Tesla’s new engineering headquarters. The company didn’t confirm how many employees will work there, but it looks like the facility can fit thousands of employees.
Good to see Elon Musk and CA governor Gavin Newsome still have a working relationship though that 6-minute interaction seemed rather uncomfortable, particularly after all of the disparaging things Elon has said about California’s government and Democratic politicians.
It also underscores that though Tesla was able to move a lot of mostly manufacturing jobs and HQ to Texas, the braintrust of Silicon Valley is still key to Tesla’s survival and growth.

2023/02/22,"A couple of Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles have been spotted with the new Hardware 4.0 suite of cameras.
As we previously reported, Tesla has been preparing an upgrade to its Autopilot/self-driving hardware for a bit now.
Most notably, Tesla filed with the FCC to add a new radar on its vehicles and said that it planned to start marketing it in January. A new radar would mean that Tesla plans to update its sensor suite for Autopilot and self-driving.
We have also heard that the automaker is changing its cameras, according to a filing with Chinese regulators.
Finally, Tesla is expected to produce a new self-driving computer to merge all those new sensors into a more powerful computing platform. Last week, we reported on a teardown of this new Hardware 4.0 computer, as Tesla appears to have started installing it in some cars.
The Kilowatts on Twitter went to Fremont Factory to see if he could spot some of those new vehicles being built with the latest hardware, and sure enough, he found some:
It looks like every Model S/X without visible Ultrasonic Sensors in the delivery lot has camera units that I’ve never seen before pic.twitter.com/e1sxEG8cua
Here are side-by-side pictures of the new (left) and old (right) cameras starting with the fender camera:
For this one, it appears that Tesla changed the angle quite a bit. It now seems to face toward the side a lot more than toward the back.
As for the B pillar camera, it looks like Tesla just updated the camera itself – the placement and angle look similar.
The front-facing camera enclosure has changed quite a bit. As we previously reported, it is supposed to now have only two cameras rather than three, but it’s not clear from this angle.
As for the rear camera next to the plate, it looks like it has moved just a bit. The Kilowatts’s picture on this one also gives the best look at the new camera, which appears to be just slightly bigger than the old one.
I do think users who paid for FSD should be able to carry that license through to a new vehicle purchased with HW4 or whatever ends up being the actual configuration that grants what was originally promised: L5 autonomy. At the very least, pay the difference discount (IE: bought at $8k and currently at $15k, only pay $7k difference). 
The Kilowatts also couldn’t find any camera in the headlights or bumpers, which is expected to be part of the new hardware suite. The computer that leaked showed that Tesla is planning to increase the number of cameras from 8 to 11.
He also took some pictures of the new rear-end of the Model S and Model X with updated badging:
 pic.twitter.com/T6xlafv8CO
He couldn’t find any Model 3 or Model Y vehicles at the factory with the new hardware. 
As we previously reported, it’s not clear when Tesla plans to make the new HW4 official, but the timing of the March 1 Investor Day makes it a likely contender for an official announcement. We could know a lot more about it in just a week.

Unfortunately, it looks like the video was filmed by a 10-year-old potato of a phone, but it is the first good look at a working air suspension on the Cybertruck.
Tesla has always intended for the Cybertruck to have a strong adaptive air suspension. The automaker wrote about it:
Raise and lower suspension four inches in either direction for easy access to Cybertruck or the vault, while self-leveling capabilities adapt to any occasion and assist with every job.
Later, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is updating the air suspension to have even more travel for off-roading.
""Filmed by a potato"" had me thinking that someone had strapped a ""Grow-Pro"" to a potato which a Cybertruck happened to drive past.

Obviously a You-tuber.
On Twitter, the CEO hinted that Tesla might test the truck in Baja:
We’re working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.
He is referencing the Baja 1000, which is a Mexican off-road motorsport race held each year on the Baja California Peninsula. It features a bunch of cars, trucks, motorcycles, ATVs, and buggies outfitted for off-roading.
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
In the meantime, we should expect to spot more Cybertruck beta prototypes in the wild. If you spot one, don’t hesitate to send your sightings our way at fred@electrek.co.

2023/02/21,"Tesla is shifting its battery cell production capacity from Germany to the US as it expects that it is going to be more useful there, giving the automaker’s buyers access to the $7,500 federal tax credit.
For the last three years, Tesla has been working to build its battery cells with a new 4680 format. The plan is critical to the company’s long-term growth as it powers its next generation of electric vehicles using a new structural battery pack architecture.
Tesla is currently building the cells at its pilot plant in Fremont, California, but the automaker is deploying larger-scale cell production at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
Last year, we heard that Tesla was running into issues building battery cells at Gigafactory Berlin and was considering moving battery production equipment to the US.
The information came as we learned that to get the full $7,500 federal tax credit, automakers will need to source their battery cells from North America.
There's also a $45/kwh battery production credit available to Tesla in the USA that's not available in Germany, so this move was a no brainer. That's a $3,645 subsidy that goes directly to Tesla from the US taxpayer for each 81 kwh Model Y long range battery pack they produce. Details about the subsidy can be found under section 13502 of the IRA.
Therefore, it makes sense for Tesla to focus its attention on ramping up battery production at Gigafactory Texas over Gigafactory Berlin since it will have a bigger impact there.
Now the Brandenburg economy ministry issued a statement confirming that Tesla is starting to produce battery cell components, but it is holding off on full cell production because it is prioritizing US production:
Tesla has started its battery system production in Gruenheide and is preparing to manufacture battery cell components. The company has prioritized further production steps in the USA because tax incentives make business conditions more favorable there.
Tesla has recently confirmed that it is making progress toward ramping up production of its new 4680 battery cell at Gigafactory Texas.
The cells are going to be used to increase production of the Model Y at the factory and launch the new Cybertruck later this year.

2023/02/21,"Tesla has signed a deal with Magnis Energy Technologies, an interesting new battery technology company based in Australia. It could become an important partner for the automaker.
Magnis announced today that it signed an anode active materials (AAM) offtake agreement with Tesla:
Magnis Energy Technologies Ltd (“Magnis”, or the “Company”) (ASX: MNS; OTCQX: MNSEF; FSE: U1P) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a Binding Offtake Agreement with Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) for the supply of AAM beginning in February 2025 with fixed pricing.
The company is developing a graphite mine in Tanzania where it plans to get “ultra-high purity natural flake graphite” from the operation.
Under the agreement, Tesla plans to purchase “a minimum of 17,500tpa starting from February 2025,” and the automaker has an option for “a maximum of 35,000tpa for a minimum 3-year term at a fixed price.”
But the interesting part here is that Tesla is not just buying the graphite from Magnis. It plans to buy processed anode material (AAM) based on the graphite, and the deal involved Magnis building a US facility to produce the AAM:
The agreement is conditional on Magnis securing a final location for its commercial AAM facility by 30 June 2023, producing AAM from a pilot plant by 31 March 2024, commencing production from the commercial AAM facility by 1 February 2025, and customer qualification.
Tesla is good at securing quality safely mined materuals for its large battery production. They also recycle old battery material. 

Magnis describes itself as “a vertically integrated lithium-ion battery technology and materials company.”
Along with its graphite mining project in Tanzania, the company is part of the Imperium3 New York consortium of companies working to build a lithium-ion battery cell gigafactory in New York.
Furthermore, Magnis is also a shareholder and partner with C4V, a New York-based battery cell technology company. 
All these links to US-based battery projects could prove useful to Tesla as the automaker is looking to secure a large number of battery cells in order to support its plan to build 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030.

2023/02/20,"Tesla is reportedly considering buying Brazil-based lithium miner Sigma Lithium, which is currently valued at $3 billion.
With the rapidly rising costs of key minerals for battery production, Tesla has been considering venturing into the mining world.
For example, in response to the rising cost of lithium, CEO Elon Musk said last year that Tesla “might” now get into the lithium mining business, even though it’s already supposed to be in it.
At Tesla’s Battery Day event in 2020, the automaker announced that it is getting into the mining business – starting with buying lithium claims on 10,000 acres in Nevada.
More than two years later, Tesla has yet to do anything with this claim or a new lithium mining technology announced at the same event.
However, the company has been going into lithium refining with a new plant under construction outside of Corpus Christi, Texas.
In order to get into the mining business, Tesla has said that it might actually consider an acquisition, which is not something that the company often does – especially not on a large scale.
Now a new report puts a potential acquisition target on the map: Sigma Lithium.
Bloomberg reported:
The EV maker run by Elon Musk has been speaking with potential advisers about a bid, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. Sigma Lithium is one of multiple mining options Tesla is exploring as it mulls its own refining, one of the people said.
According to the report, Sigma lithium’s biggest shareholder, A10 Investimentos, a Brazilian private equity fund, is considering pushing for a sale of the company; they are currently talking to potential bidders, and Tesla is one of the companies that has shown interest.
Sigma declined to comment on the report and claimed it was a rumor.
The company’s main project is large lithium mining projects within Minas Gerais State, Brazil, along a corridor known for having large lithium deposits.
It’s still in the development phase, but they have achieved pilot-scale production, and they are moving to commercial exploitation with the goal of producing 766,000 tonnes (104,200 tonnes of LCE) a year.
Sigma Lithium’s stock price has tripled over the last year, making it a more difficult target for acquisition. The stock also shot up 24% in aftermarket trading following the report that Tesla is interested in acquiring it.

2023/02/20,"In the release notes of the latest Tesla FSD Beta v11, Tesla explains what is happening to Autopilot with the new update, and it adds the capacity to send voice feedback.
Tesla FSD Beta v11 is both an exciting and scary step as it is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot highway stacks.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
Since the wider release of the beta last year, there are currently over 400,000 Tesla owners in the program in North America – virtually every Tesla owner who bought the FSD package on their vehicles.
However, the bulk of these owners have yet to receive significant FSD beta updates as Tesla was supposed to release v11 to the fleet in November 2022, but the update has been stuck in testing within Tesla’s closed fleet since then.
The update is an important step because it includes many new neural networks, as Elon Musk stated, but from a consumer perspective, it’s also important because it is expected to merge Tesla’s FSD Beta software stack primarily used on roads and city streets with Tesla’s Autopilot software stack, which is used as a level 2 driver assist system on highways.
It has been delayed several times, but recently, Musk confirmed that a new version (v11.3) is going to a closed beta fleet this week – indicating that it might finally be about to be more widely released.
Now Not a Tesla App, which tracks Tesla software updates, has obtained the FSD Beta v11.3 release notes, and they contain some interesting information.
Tesla starts out by explaining in more detail what it going to happen to Autopilot with this update:
Enabled FSD Beta on highway. This unifies the vision and planning stack on and off-highway and replaces the legacy highway stack, which is over four years old. The legacy highway stack still relies on several single-camera and single-frame networks, and was setup to handle simple lane-specific maneuvers. FSD Beta’s multi-camera video networks and next-gen planner, that allows for more complex agent interactions with less reliance on lanes, make way for adding more intelligent behaviors, smoother control and better decision making.
As expected this leaves the door open for some regression at first, but Tesla makes it clear that it believes this is the way to go long-term.
Hope this is rolling the improvements into the non-FSD AP only product as well.   If it fixes the issue of trying to lane center instead of staying left when a lane widens for merging traffic I will be delighted.
Another interesting new feature revealed by the release notes is the capacity to send Tesla voice memos about your FSD Beta experience. That’s something that Beta testers have been asking for a while as they can use it to give Tesla more details about a specific situation that they experience with the system.
A big part of the rest of the notes appears to focus on curbing some potentially dangerous driving behavior that FSD Beta has been known to do and has recently been described by NHTSA in its FSD Beta recall notice.
As we noted in our reporting of the recall, the notice made it sound like Tesla’s “fix” for the “recall” was simply its usual next software update, but now it looks like they did try to address some of these things more specifically as described in the release notes.
Here are the full Tesla FSD Beta v11.3 release notes:

2023/02/18,"Tesla overnight dropped the price of its CCS Combo adapter to just $175, making the prospect of fast charging at any DC fast charging station a relatively easy prospect for most Tesla owners. 
The adapter, which cost $250 previously, is now 25% off; however, the company isn’t advertising the price as a sale, so it very well could be a new price. The price also dropped to $240 in Canada, down from $340.
Tesla did also drop the price of its home chargers briefly last month, and then brought them back up.
Lectron, a low-cost charging device maker, has a version of this adapter for $189.99, but it is uncertain if this is what caused the price drop. 
Tesla vehicle prices also have been in flux over the past weeks as the automaker deals with varying inventory and subsidies globally.
Not all Tesla owners can take advantage of the adapter. Some vehicles made before 2020 require a retrofit, which Tesla has offered but hasn’t started implementing yet.
What a god awful connector. Guess I should get one but not sure it will fit in the trunk.  Does it come with a tow hitch?
CCS Combo inventory might also be a reason for the price drop. 
Description
Expand your fast charging options with the Tesla CCS Combo 1 Adapter. The adapter offers charging speeds up to 250kW and can be used at third-party charging networks.
The CCS Combo 1 Adapter is compatible with most Tesla vehicles. Some vehicles may require a retrofit to enable use of the CCS Combo 1 Adapter. Sign in to your Tesla account to check compatibility.
Note: For vehicles requiring a retrofit, please check back in early 2023 for availability. 
CCS Combo 1 Adapter will begin shipping within two weeks of order placement.
Maximum charge rates may vary from charge rates advertised by third-party stations. Most third-party stations are not capable of charging Tesla vehicles at 250kW. Tesla does not regulate the pricing or charging experience at third-party charging stations. For more details on charging practices, please consult the third-party network providers directly.
Find out more details in the CCS Combo 1 Adapter Owner’s Manual.
If you were on the fence about grabbing one of these, today might be a good day to dip in here. I bought one myself a few months ago for charging at an EVgo in the Supercharger desert of SE Vermont, and I’ve used it a few times already. With EVgo’s Autocharge, it is almost as easy, cheap, and quick to start charging as a Supercharger but is significantly slower at 50kW. 
Tesla is making it easier for its owners to charge anywhere there is fast charging, which is a win for its customers AND other EV charging companies, which now have a bigger market.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/02/17,"A Tesla Semi prototype and a Cybertruck prototype were spotted with a massive new lidar sensor in the front – likely to ground truth data for the Autopilot/self-driving sensor suite on those new vehicles.
Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging, and it is a method for determining ranges by targeting an object with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver.
Tesla has taken a different approach and is instead betting on pure computer vision using cameras.
CEO Elon Musk has often said that lidar technology has been overblown and has described it as a distraction to achieving full self-driving capability.
But Tesla still uses lidar for its Autopilot and self-driving effort, but it’s not in its sensor suite on its actual vehicles. Instead, Tesla uses lidar sensors on prototypes for the process of ground truthing its own sensors.
When rumors of Tesla using lidar came up after those prototypes were spotted, the company commented:
The claim that Tesla may be planning to use LiDAR as part of its self-driving hardware suite is fundamentally untrue. We regularly test our own technologies against other sensors to calibrate our camera, sonar and radar system.
What’s interesting about those prototypes is that they are often spotted when Tesla is testing new sensors or new vehicles.
Now, a Tesla Semi electric truck was spotted driving around Palo Alto with a XenomatiX solid-state lidar:
pic.twitter.com/h3EXOqjIuP
When Tesla unveiled the production version of the Tesla Semi and started deliveries in December, we noted that Tesla didn’t say a word about the electric truck being equipped with Autopilot or self-driving technology – like all of Tesla’s other vehicles.
But the production vehicle is equipped with Autopilot cameras.
I have no problem believing that adding lidar to test vehicles can provide more data for training. We can be sure they wont be adding it to production vehicles, still fine expect to use it to double check tests. (if a camera only FSD ever exists is still not known until it is done)
Now this prototype indicates that Tesla is testing the cameras and whole sensor suite for the Tesla Semi.
Additionally, @dad_uff on Twitter spotted Tesla testing a Cybertruck with the same lidar sensor:
This prototype also features a lot of additional sensors – all likely for ground truthing the actual sensor suite of the Cybertruck. 
It makes sense that Tesla would be testing the sensor now since the automaker currently has a fleet of beta Cybertruck prototypes ahead of the start of production this summer.

2023/02/17,"Tesla is again increasing Model Y prices in China following its massive price drop last month as demand appears to be picking back up.
After months of rumors that Tesla’s demand in China was slowing down, the automaker implemented significant price drops of up to 13% on its electric vehicles in the critical EV market in early January.
January saw a significant increase in sales of Tesla’s China-made cars, but many of those are for foreign markets.
Insurance registrations are better indicators of sales of Tesla vehicles in China, and it reached over 8,000 units during the first week of February, which is good early in a quarter as Tesla is still generally producing mostly cars for foreign markets at Gigafactory Shanghai at that point.
Another good indicator that demand is picking back up in China is that Tesla is again increasing the price of the Model Y, its most popular model, in the country.
Today, Tesla updated its Chinese online configurator with a 2,000 yuan increase on the Model Y Long Range to now 311,900 yuan ($45,473) and a 2,000 yuan increase on the Model Y Performance, which now starts at 361,900 yuan ($52,600).
Price increases and decreases are generally the best indicators of Tesla’s demand in any given market. Despite the fact that Tesla claims it is simply trying to reduce prices, the automaker tries to sell its electric vehicles for the most it can based on demand.
In the case of China, it’s extremely important to track since it is by far the biggest EV market in the world.
The price increases are small, but they should help Tesla’s gross margins recover in Q2, which is when most of those new orders are expected to be delivered.
Tesla’s Chinese prices are currently highlighting Gigafactory Shanghai’s cost competitiveness as the Model Y Performance in China is cheaper than the Model Y Long Range in the US.

2023/02/16,"Tesla has released a blog post defending itself against allegations that it fired employees at Gigafactory New York over a push to unionize.
As we reported earlier this week, workers doing Autopilot data annotation at Gigafactory New York announced their intent to unionize.
Yesterday, the organizers behind the unionization effort filed a complaint with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming that Tesla fired dozens of employees at the plant in retaliation for the union push.
Tesla didn’t comment on the stories coming out based on the NLRB complaint this morning, but the automaker has now put together a blog post claiming that the layoffs were planned before the company was made aware of the unionization effort.
Either way whether Tesla is lying or not, it’ll be incredibly easy to prove or disprove Tesla’s rebuttals. They share enough information here to clear them of any blame here. If it doesn’t add up (and everything they share is verifiable), then that’ll come out.

What I appreciate about Tesla’s response is they simply state facts to back up their side without making any accusations themselves. In previous responses to accusations of wrongdoing by employees, Tesla would tend to fire back with its own accusations.
The automaker laid out the following chronology of events leading up to the layoffs:
While the automaker certainly has an anti-union history and the timing looks horrible, I tend to believe Tesla on this one. 
In December, we reported that Tesla was planning a new wave of layoffs in Q1. This matches Tesla’s timeline of events here.
It certainly doesn’t look good, but I think it all adds up. What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below.

2023/02/16,"Tesla is attempting to get owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles with unlimited Supercharging to upgrade to a new car with an enticing new offer.
While Model 3 and Model Y sales are going through the roof, the more expensive Model S and Model X are a little more difficult to move.
Now Tesla has come up with an interesting new offer for owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles to upgrade to newer versions.
The automaker has started reaching out to owners of Model S/X with unlimited Supercharging (pre-September 2018, but it was also reintroduced sporadically) and offering them an extra $5,000 on their trade-in when they buy a new Model S or Model X.
Tesla wrote in the email:
As an early Model (S or X) owner, you are eligible to exchange your unlimited free Supercharging miles for an additional $5,000 on your vehicle’s trade-in value when you purchase a new Model S or Model X.
The offer is also available to Canadian Tesla owners, who will get an extra $7,000 CAD.
It’s an interesting offer, but there’s a lot to consider here.
While it’s hard to value since it depends entirely on how you use your Tesla vehicle, $5,000 is a good offer to give up on free Supercharging for most people.
I own a 2014 Model S and in my case, the answer is a resounding no. Only if the offer applied to all Teslas, then maybe.

I bought the Model S because back then it was pretty much the only practical EV available. This is not the case anymore. As much as I love my car, the current MS is made for a very different audience.
However, that’s $5,000 extra on top of the trade-in value that Tesla gives you, and the automaker is notorious for not giving the best prices on trade-ins. So that might be a downside here.
Also, the Model S and Model X are way more expensive than they used to be. Tesla used to sell Model S starting at $70,000 (excluding Model S 40, which was available for barely a minute). Now Model S starts at $95,000.
That’s a $25,000 difference. Therefore, people coming from, let’s say, a Model S 70 might not be the same people who can afford a $95,000 car, regardless of what your trade-in car is worth.
I am curious to see if this offer will be successful at getting owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles to upgrade.

2023/02/16,"Tesla has been forced to “recall” all vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta as NHTSA believes it may cause crashes.
The fix is a software update.
In a recall notice released today, NHTSA has notified that Tesla has agreed to “recall” all 362,758 vehicles equipped with FSD Beta in the US over what it believes is a serious risk that it “may cause crashes.”
Here’s the recall notice summary from NHTSA:
Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation. The FSD Beta system may allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution. In addition, the system may respond insufficiently to changes in posted speed limits or not adequately account for the driver’s adjustment of the vehicle’s speed to exceed posted speed limits.
The notice describes well-known mistakes that FSD Beta frequently makes.
Here are NHTSA’s four main issues with FSD Beta:
Tesla has been consistently releasing new software updates to try to improve on FSD Beta, but it has never been able to completely remove those behaviors.
Now the “remedy” to the recall is another software update, NHTSA doesn’t go into the specific of the update other than it will “improve” on those behaviors:
Tesla will deploy an over-the-air (‘OTA’) software update at no cost to the customer. The OTA update, which we expect to deploy in the coming weeks, will improve how FSD Beta negotiates certain driving maneuvers during the conditions described above.
Based on the defect notice, NHTSA raised its issue with Tesla about FSD Beta on January 25, 2023, and the automaker met with the regulators on several occasions until February 7.
Tesla disagreed with NHTSA’s analysis, but it decided to do a voluntary recall:
On February 7, 2023, while not concurring with the agency’s analysis, Tesla decided to administer a voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution.
Tesla also confirmed that it identified 18 warranty claims between May 8, 2019, and September 12, 2022, that it believes “may be related to the conditions” described in the recall notice. The company says that is not aware of any injuries or deaths that may be related to such conditions.
FSD in shadow mode has always been the best option. They could have even let people turn it into a game by earning points or something from allowing Tesla to monitor your drives and train the system. I get that they are trying to make sure people who bought FSD sometime in the past way too many years sees value from it, but they should have kept increasing the EAP proven features rather than just trying to jump right to level 5. 
This is interesting. Beyond the usual concerns – “Is it a recall if the fix is a software update?” – the software update itself could be interesting.
All the issues described in the defect notice are things that Tesla has obviously already been working on. Now the fix for the recall is to “improve” on those issues.
Therefore, it sounds to me that the “recall update” is just the usual next Tesla FSD Beta update. No? 
But even if it’s just that, it’s still an important situation since it shows that NHTSA is watching closely and willing to put pressure on Tesla regarding the FSD Beta program.

2023/02/16,"Tesla’s move to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric car owners is splitting the Tesla owner community in two, with some owners being upset and feeling that it will negatively affect their ownership experience.
But the move is 100% aligned with Tesla’s mission.
We knew it was coming for a while, but it’s now finally official and happening soon.
Both Tesla and the White House have confirmed that the automaker will soon start to open “select” Supercharger stations to non-Tesla EV owners in the US and plans to double the size of its network to make 7,500 Superchargers available to all EVs by the end of 2024.
The Supercharger network is widely recognized as the best DC fast-charging network in the world, and the difference with other networks is even more pronounced in the US.
For a long time, it has been considered one of Tesla’s competitive advantages, or moats, and the biggest reason to buy a Tesla over other electric vehicles, as the network easily enables long-distance driving without friction.
Other networks are not only less extensive with fewer stations and fewer chargers per station, but they are also notorious for being unreliable with chargers that don’t always work.
Now that Tesla is opening the Supercharger network to other electric vehicles, Tesla owners are a bit divided on the issue with some owners being upset about the move. 
Since the announcement yesterday, we received several emails from Tesla owners who believe that onboarding more vehicles will negatively affect their experience by increasing traffic at Supercharger stations.
Additionally, some Tesla investors are not happy about the move since they believe it will negatively affect Tesla’s business by removing the Supercharger network as a moat and making non-Tesla EVs more attractive, as they will also be able to use the network.
One Tesla owner went as far as claiming that it’s not fair since early Tesla owners paid for Tesla’s deployment of the network while non-Tesla EV owners didn’t.
The owner in question sent us the following email:
Money does not come out of thin air. To build Tesla’s charging network, the money had to come from increasing the cost of the car. With Tesla opening access to its charging network to non-Tesla owners, that means I paid extra for my Tesla to access the charging network so that others could have access for free. Since I paid extra so non Tesla owners can access the network for free, I believe Tesla should provide some type of rebate to Tesla owners.
However, the majority of Tesla owners and Tesla fans appear to be on board with the move since it aligns with Tesla’s mission, which is to accelerate the advent of electric transportation and renewable energy.
The automaker, and specifically CEO Elon Musk, always made it clear that it would consider the mission a success if it can not only contribute directly to accelerating that goal but also indirectly by forcing the rest of the auto industry to move to electric vehicles.
I understand the concern about having more traffic at Supercharger stations, especially considering that some are already overcrowded on busy travel days, and that’s a real problem.
If more money comes in, the network can be greatly expanded. Thats a massive win for Tesla owners. 

If they decide to let stations become full too often and people start getting mad at Tesla for running an overly saturated network, that will hurt their brand image and they will fix it by adding more stations. They wouldnt like being referred to as the second best EV charging network, and I doubt they would let it happen. 

There is absolutely a balancing point between having too many or too few charging stations (too many means price per KWh goes up for maintenance overhead). Naturally there will be highs and lows, but as long as the network stays around the proper balance it shouldnt feel any different because other cars can use them. 
But Tesla is going to do it like it did in Europe, meaning the change will happen gradually while monitoring the usage to avoid overloading the network.
Meanwhile, the move will also enable Tesla to access billions of dollars in incentives to deploy more stations and increase network capacity for both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners.
As for the business standpoint, it’s true that it will remove a competitive advantage for Tesla and make competing EVs more attractive now that they can use the Supercharger network. But it will also boost its energy business, which I think the Supercharger network will be folded into because like Tesla Energy, or Tesla Electric, it is technically selling electricity.
Tesla could become the biggest charging network operator in the world as electric vehicles take over.  I can see a future where the Tesla Supercharger network is bringing in billions of dollars a year in revenue just by selling electricity to all electric vehicles.

2023/02/16,"Tesla has fired dozens of employees at Gigafactory New York after a new unionization effort was launched this week, according to a new complaint with the US National Labor Relations Board.
As we reported earlier this week, workers at Gigafactory New York, where now almost a thousand workers perform data annotation for Tesla’s Autopilot and self-driving efforts, announced their intent to unionize.
The effort started with the data labelers who want better pay, job security, and less tracking at work, and it is supported by Workers United, which is known for having unionized workers at hundreds of Starbucks stores.
They also plan to add the ~1,000 manufacturing workers at Gigafactory New York in Buffalo to the unionization effort.
After they announced the union push on Tuesday, Tesla has reportedly fired dozens of employees at the plant – including several who were linked to the unionization effort, according to a complaint filed by Workers United with the US National Labor Relations Board.
Bloomberg reports on the complaint:
In a filing with the US National Labor Relations Board, the union Workers United accused Tesla of illegally terminating the employees “in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity.” The union asked the labor board to seek a federal court injunction “to prevent irreparable destruction of employee rights resulting from Tesla’s unlawful conduct.”
Jaz Brisack, a Workers United organizer working on the Tesla union drive at Giga New York, commented on the terminations:
“This is a form of collective retaliation against the group of workers that started this organizing effort. The terminations are designed to terrify everyone about potential consequences of them organizing, as well as to attempt to cull the herd.”
Arian Berek, a Tesla employee who was one of the organizers and was among those terminated Wednesday, commented: 
“I feel blindsided. I got COVID and was out of the office, then I had to take a bereavement leave. I returned to work, was told I was exceeding expectations and then Wednesday came along.”
key facts

Tesla has been looking to replace data analyzers with AI

The people laid off were not all union organizers or necessarily supported unionization 

The timing may indicate 

a swift reaction by Tesla against unions


 Tesla already planning on laying off these analyzers and they started to actively promote unions in effort to save their jobs

 A combination of the above
While they claim that the firings are illegal, the union organizers at Gigafactory New York claim that they are helping the effort.
Sara Costantino, a Tesla worker on the Autopilot team at Giga New York and a member of the union organizing committee, commented:
“It’s pretty clear the message they’re sending. They’re trying to scare us. And it’s really I think backfiring on them. It has really opened people’s eyes to the fact that this is why we need a union.”
It’s not the first time that Tesla has been in trouble with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and specifically for firing people related to union drives.
In 2021, NLRB ruled that Tesla violated labor laws by firing an employee over what they claimed was union support and because of a tweet in which Elon Musk stated that unionized employees would lose their stock options as part of their compensation package.

2023/02/15,"Tesla has sold out the Model Y for the quarter in the United States with no more production builds until April, even though we are just halfway through the quarter.
With the significant price drops and the new $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, Tesla has seen a surge of orders in the United States.
Now sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla has completely run out of production build slots for the quarter for Model Y, which is now Tesla’s highest-volume model.
While Tesla is sold out for new production “build slots,” it will still have some specific configurations in inventory available in some markets.
The automaker has updated its estimated timeline on the Model Y to “Est. Delivery: Apr – Jun 2023,” which is after having increased the price of the base Model Y back up $1,500 after reducing it by $13,000 early last month.
Meanwhile, new base Model 3 vehicles can still be built and delivered this month with an estimated delivery timeline of “Feb – Mar 2023.” That’s despite Tesla continuing to reduce the price of the Model 3 since the big price drop in early January.
We suspect that Tesla might have issues selling Model 3 vehicles right now because of the impending refresh that is expected to come soon.
Just got a model 3.  Only 3 weeks from order to delivery.  In Canada, so the shipping from California prob took a good chunk of that time.    So effectively no backlog for the 3.      If I was American I would have ordered a Y instead.   I prefer the y But too expensive in Canada.  
But one thing that is helping Tesla sell Model 3 and Model Y vehicles this quarter is the fact that we don’t know if those models will still have access to the full tax credit for vehicles delivered after March.
The new battery sourcing guidance is coming by then, and automakers will start to know whether or not they qualify.
Furthermore, Tesla buyers in California also have access to an additional $2,000 incentive on top of the $7,500 federal tax credit. With California being the biggest EV market in the United States by far, and Tesla dominating the US EV market, this is going to be a big help for the automaker to keep growing in the state.
Tesla delivered close to 200,000 electric vehicles in California in 2022. It was a record performance for the automaker, but there’s still room to grow with electric vehicles only accounting for 16% of new passenger vehicle sales in California.

2023/02/15,"Tesla might have revealed the Cybertruck frame in a new video about the automaker’s robots.
The Cybertruck production program is being closely followed by the industry as it is likely the most important new electric vehicle to launch this year.
With over 1.5 million reservations and Tesla’s incredible track record in building electric vehicles in high volume, it is expected to be a game changer in the young but important electric pickup truck market.
We have been tracking the production program closely, including actual production equipment specific to Cybertruck coming to Gigafactory Texas, a Cybertruck body at Gigafactory Texas, and more recently, Cybertruck Beta prototypes being spotted testing on the road.
Now we are seeing what appears to be a Cybertruck frame that Tesla showed for a second in a funny video.
Tesla produced a video for Valentine’s Day that is basically a spoof of a dating video with its robots and posted it on LinkedIn:
During the profile of the robot called Joey 2000, Tesla showed it lifting a large vehicle frame that doesn’t seem to match any Tesla vehicle currently in production:
The size and configuration could be a match for the electric pickup truck, and the background appears to be Gigafactory Texas in Austin.
It looks like Tesla could drop the previously leaked body (below) onto that frame:
It’s doubtful that Tesla would have put that together just for a joke video. Therefore, the most interesting thing is that it would indicate that the Cybertruck production line is fairly advanced to the point that they have robots moving frames around.
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
Some Tesla fans have been hoping that the automaker is underpromising with the Cybertruck production program, and while those glimpses at the production are encouraging, there’s no real evidence that it will happen any faster than what Tesla has already announced.

2023/02/15,"Tesla’s new self-driving computer, Hardware 4.0 (HW4), has leaked as the automaker appears to be already building some cars with the upgraded system.
Here’s a first teardown.
We have known that Tesla has been preparing an upgrade to its Autopilot/self-driving hardware for a bit now.
Most notably, Tesla filed with the FCC to add a new radar on its vehicles and said that it planned to start marketing it in January. A new radar would mean that Tesla plans to update its sensor suite for Autopilot and self-driving.
We have also heard that the automaker is changing its cameras, according to a filing with Chinese regulators.
Finally, Tesla is expected to produce a new self-driving computer to merge all those new sensors into a more powerful computing platform. 
All these hardware changes have been stressful for Tesla owners since the automaker has been promising that all its vehicles built since 2016 have all the hardware necessary to achieve self-driving through software updates.
It turned out not to be true as Tesla needed a more powerful computer (HW3), but it did supply the retrofit to existing owners for free.
Now CEO Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla will not provide retrofit to HW4, but he said that the automaker still plans to deliver on its self-driving promises with HW3 and that HW4 will only push the performance higher.
The teardown comes courtesy of Green The Only, a well-known Tesla hacker and tinkerer who has consistently revealed a lot of new information about Tesla vehicles by hacking the automaker’s software and tearing down its hardware.
In this case, he managed to get his hands on a new HW4 computer from a new Model X vehicle. We won’t go into details about how.
There are some indications that Tesla is implementing the new hardware suite in the Model X first with the automaker having just put up for sale its display and test drive fleet, which Tesla generally does later in a quarter. It could mean that Tesla is liquidating its Model X units in preparation for the new hardware.
Green started the teardown by confirming what Musk recently said: Don’t expect a retrofit.
To start with sorta bad news, The form-factor is totally different, so definitely no retrofits on this one.top/left is new unit, bottom – current plaid unit) pic.twitter.com/iHziGZPIBj
Tesla’s self-driving computer is combined with its infotainment computer, which has also been updated with this HW4 upgrade.
Green said about the change:
Infotainment was reworked compared to current units. The GPU is now on the same board, so no more GPU daughterboard. This makes the whole unit thinner, otherwise no changes there – same 256G NVMe and 16G RAM, same AMD CPU and GPU.
As for Tesla’s actual HW4 computer, Green sees less improvement than what was hoped:
HW4:A lot less improvement than many hoped for.Still Samsung Exynos-IP based.Bumped CPU cores from 12 to 20 (5 clusters of 4 cores each), maxing at 2.35GHz, idle at 1.37GHzNumber of TRIP cores increased from 2 to 3, 2.2GHz max freqAll  x2 since there are two SoCs per board pic.twitter.com/eeHXg5x0aL
He did note that there are some improvements in security. Musk mentioned hackability of self-driving vehicles was a top concern at Tesla.
On the downside, the hacker’s own measurement shows that the new board has a higher power consumption than HW3 when idle.
Green noted that Tesla has also made improvements to the redundancy of the system, which is obviously important in a self-driving vehicle:
Redundancy is the name of the game this time? The board is mostly symmetric, with identical power connections on each side. There are even two network links to infotainment. Yet… if you unpower the A side, that kills the network switch and the link is lost. Still the improvements are there.
Now for what people have all been waiting for – the sensors.
Obviously, this is the computer and not the sensors, but the connectors can give us more information about the new sensors in HW4.
Now Tesla has been moving to a vision-based (cameras) approach and it has made a big deal of removing its radar and ultrasonic sensors.
There’s good news with HW4. Tesla appears to be including more cameras. There are currently 8 cameras in Tesla’s hardware suite, but now the new computer has connectors for 12 cameras, although one connector is marked as “spare.”
So we are talking about likely 11 cameras. Now as for the camera placement, it looks like all the current cameras remain other than a two camera setup in the windshield rather than the current three-front-facing camera setup.
While the information is hard to decrypt, Green sees indications that Tesla might have added cameras in the bumpers:
What’s SVC you might wonder? According to Tesla EPC, SVC is a bumper cover. So I’d guess these are bumper cameras. There’s a huge blindspot upfront on legacy cars up front (welcome to the legacy camp, Plaid owners!), so front bumper camera and two in the (rear?) bumper corners for cross traffic alerts (esp. with pillar moved forward)?
Green also found a connection for a new GPS module with a triband antenna:
The hacker noted about the new GPS unit:
The unit itself is big and unmarked, so who makes it is unknown, I would not be surprised if it’s somewhat custom Tesla thing. They carry a bootloader for it in firmware.
Finally, Green also found evidence of Tesla’s integrating a radar back into its sensor suite:
Radar: Yes, there's now the bespoken Phoenix radar (yes, of course there is and yes that's what it's called in the properties too). There's also the radar heater of course. pic.twitter.com/7inrjGmBM0
Musk told Electrek in June of last year after Tesla stopped using its radar:
The probability of safety will be higher with pure vision than vision+radar, not lower. Vision has become so good that radar actually reduces signal/noise.
My two cents:
The cars cannot see wide enough nor far enough left and right.
From all the issues I have seen, most if not all, are from not being able to see far enough and wide left and right.
It seems like more camera are needed on the A pillars and/or near the headlights.

When pulling up to make a right turn, the car often can not see far enough to the left, for example. 
However, the CEO also added that Tesla might still use radar if it had a “very high-resolution radar”:
A very high resolution radar would be better than pure vision, but such a radar does not exist. I mean vision with high res radar would be better than pure vision.
We saw some indications of Tesla working on that. We previously reported on Tesla looking to add a new “4D” imaging radar with twice the range of its previous radar.
That high-resolution radar was codenamed “phoenix,” so it might be the very radar that makes it to the new hardware suite.
It’s not clear when Tesla plans to make the new HW4 official, but the timing of the March 1 Investor Day makes it a likely contender for an official announcement.

2023/02/15,"A report coming from China states that Tesla is going to partly shut down some Gigafactory Shanghai production lines for upgrades starting this weekend. 
It’s believed that the upgrades are for a refreshed Model 3.
Late last year, we started hearing rumors that Tesla is working on a Model 3 refresh that would come during the second half of 2023.
But we have seen since indications that Tesla is close to launching the new version of the Model 3.
Over the last few years, we have noticed that Tesla first implemented changes to its vehicles in China, where it produces vehicles at Gigafactory Shanghai.
Now we learn that Tesla is planning to partly shut down the factory for upgrades (via Bloomberg):
The plant has two phases for vehicle manufacturing, and some workers on the first phase won’t be allowed on production lines from as soon as Sunday as the work on improving them is undertaken, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. 
The interruption is expected to run until the end of the month, and it is expected to specifically affect the Model 3 production lines.
This would point to Tesla potentially preparing for the switch to the new version of the Model 3.
While the vehicle is expected to feature a slight design refresh with prototypes spotted with heavy camouflage on the front and back, much of the improvements are expected to be at the body level and not necessarily visible.
The improvements could lead to weight reduction and efficiency improvements, but the ease of manufacturing is likely going to be the biggest difference.
The new Model 3 is also expected to feature Tesla’s new “Hardware 4” suite of sensors and computers for Autopilot and self-driving.
With the timing of the factory upgrade planned for the end of the month, it’s possible that the new version of the Model 3 could be announced at Tesla’s Investor Day on March 1.

2023/02/15,"Tesla and the White House announced that they reached a deal for the former to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs in the US. The automaker also confirmed plans to double its number of chargers in the US by 2024.
Over the last year, Tesla has been working to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles.
In Europe, Tesla has already opened hundreds of stations in most countries it operates in. The automaker indicated that it planned to do the same by the end of 2022 in North America, but we are now in 2023 and Tesla has yet to do it.
We knew it would be a bit more complicated in North America since, unlike in Europe where Tesla uses the standard CCS connector that is on all electric vehicles there, here, it uses its own proprietary connector, which makes opening the Supercharger to non-Tesla EVs more difficult.
When the automaker decided to open-source its proprietary connector in an attempt to make it the new North American standard last year, it cast some doubts about Tesla’s plan to open the network.
But we have since learned that Tesla has a solution to onboard EVs with CCS connectors on the Supercharger network with something called the Magic Dock, which is basically an integrated CCS adapter on Supercharger stalls.
With this in place, it’s unclear why Tesla had yet to open the Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs in the US yet.
We know that Tesla has a strong incentive to do so since a requirement to get access to the $7.5 billion in funding for EV charging infrastructure that the federal government announced is that the chargers work for EVs from more than one automaker.
Today, the White House released its official guidance for this program and as part of the announcement, it confirmed that Tesla has agreed to open the Supercharger network in the US by the end of 2024.
Furthermore, Tesla plans to “more than double” its Supercharger network in the US.
Here’s the official announcement coming from the White House:
Tesla, for the first time, will open a portion of its U.S. Supercharger and Destination Charger network to non-Tesla EVs, making at least 7,500 chargers available for all EVs by the end of 2024. The open chargers will be distributed across the United States. They will include at least 3,500 new and existing 250 kW Superchargers along highway corridors to expand freedom of travel for all EVs, and Level 2 Destination Charging at locations like hotels and restaurants in urban and rural locations.  All EV drivers will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or website. Additionally, Tesla will more than double its full nationwide network of Superchargers, manufactured in Buffalo, New York.
The announcement comes just days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with Biden administration officials regarding EV charging infrastructure.
The White House didn’t disclose how much funding Tesla will receive as part of the program but it is undoubtedly significant.
Hopefully adding CCS will also mean a longer cable. Otherwise, it'll result in some awkward parking attempts as people try to get close enough to charge. I've heard anecdotes that's already the case in Europe?
The Supercharger network is widely considered the best DC fast-charging network in the US, and Tesla currently owns about 60% of the US EV market.
This is undoubtedly great news for EV drivers everywhere. Tesla owners will get twice as many charging options while other EV drivers will have the opportunity to charge at many more locations on a reliable network.
The devil is always in the details however. Will Tesla owners have to wait on other EV drivers at busy Superchargers? Will Tesla have to change its Supercharger layout to facilitate other EV charge port locations? Will Tesla open important Supercharger locations or just enough to get the federal money and still leave other EV makers hamstrung? 
It will be interesting to see how this goes but for now we should be optimistic that Tesla is helping with its stated goal of moving the world to sustainable energy and transport.

2023/02/14,"The Tesla Model Y and Model 3, California’s #1 and #2 best-selling vehicles, are once again eligible for California’s $2,000 electric car rebate after steep price drops last month which bring them back under the MSRP cap for eligibility.
California’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program has issued over a billion dollars in total rebates since the inception of the program. The money comes from the California Air Resources Board which gets much of its funding from California’s cap-and-trade program.
It has been modified multiple times to add criteria, one of which is a limitation on the purchase price of the vehicle.
Currently, that limitation stands at a base MSRP of $45,000 for cars and $60,000 for “large vehicles” (SUVs, minivans and pickups).
Tesla vehicles previously qualified for rebates under this program, but between continuous price hikes over the past couple years and new MSRP limitations on California’s rebate program, they had been ineligible since March 15, 2022 when Tesla raised MSRP beyond the price caps.
We checked two weeks ago and they were still not included on the site, even after last month’s price drops, as Tesla had not yet re-applied for eligibility for the program.
However, it looks like Tesla applied and was accepted now, as California has now updated the CVRP website to officially add Tesla’s best-selling offerings (and the two best-selling cars in California) back into eligibility for the program after last month’s price drops.
This change is somewhat retroactive, as well. The CVRP website has a topic specifically about the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, stating that vehicles ordered on or after January 12 (the day of the price drops) can still apply for a rebate within 90 days of registering the vehicle. So if that’s you, then don’t wait – the clock starts from your registration date, not from today.
The standard rebate for both vehicles is $2,000, though every vehicle can also qualify for an “increased rebate” for lower-income buyers, defined as 400% of the federal poverty level. For those buyers, the current total rebate is $4,500, though that is separately slated to raise to $7,500 on February 28.
Other limitations apply, such as an income limit of $135,000 for single filers and $200,000 for joint filers. So low-income buyers get increased rebates, and high-income buyers get no rebate at all. CARB hosts an FAQ about the program if you have any other questions.
The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y both currently qualify for the full federal EV tax credit after recent price drops and a change in IRS guidance which raised that credit’s MSRP cap to $80,000 for the Model Y.
Some may question whether the government needs to be subsidizing the price of two cars which are already the best-selling ones in the state. But these rebates aren’t specific to Tesla, they’re for all EVs, and the program has obviously been effective, given that California is the top EV market in the nation and continues to lead the country in adoption and is one of the largest EV markets in the world.
And the subsidy isn’t from “taxpayers,” but rather largely from California’s cap-and-trade fund, which punishes polluting companies by forcing them to pay penalties when they go over their allocated amount of emissions per year. This fund has been effective at reducing emissions in California, though the state could go further.
And, frankly, nobody ever questions the massive subsidies which California’s former best-selling vehicles still get. The IMF estimates that, globally, dirty energy gets $5.3 trillion in subsidies every year. Studies have shown that each gallon of gasoline benefits from around $3.80 in displaced costs, in the form of increased health costs and environmental damage that all of us have to pay for.
So, lets look at the previous best-selling car in California, the Toyota Camry, and see how much subsidy it would get over its lifetime.
If a Camry lasts 200,000 miles – perhaps a high estimate, but it’s known as a reliable car, so let’s go with it – then that means it will consume 6,250 gallons of gasoline, with its 32mpg combined EPA rating.
So multiply that 6,250 gallons by the $3.80 in displaced health and environmental costs per gallon, and you have $23,750 in subsidy over the lifetime of that vehicle. But that subsidy isn’t being paid by the polluters themselves, via a cap-and-trade fund like the EV incentive is, it’s being paid by your lungs. It’s making your life worse, making you spend more time in the hospital, making you less productive, making your health insurance premiums higher, making your environment less beautiful and able to support human and animal life.
Meanwhile, EVs are doing the opposite of that, and are making California healthier, as a new and completely unsurprising study shows.
So yes, I do think it is more than justifiable to take money out of the pockets of polluters and put it into the hands of buyers who are making a cleaner choice, even if that choice is already a popular one.

2023/02/13,"Tesla has released an in-depth, impressive look at its latest electric car production line deployed at Gigafactory Berlin, including its new “Godzilla” robot.
Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas are Tesla’s two latest factories, and they both feature the automaker’s latest manufacturing technology.
While Tesla was underestimated as a car manufacturer by the industry for years, many are starting to give Tesla credit for innovations, especially in body manufacturing through large casting technology.
The company invested in massive casting press and stamping machines to produce fewer but larger parts, resulting in lower capital expenditure and more efficient production lines.
As we previously reported, Tesla has been ramping up its use of its social media and blog to develop its own voice lately rather than have everything go through Elon Musk, which has been the case since he dissolved Tesla’s PR department.
Now the automaker has released an in-depth look at its latest production line at Gigafactory Berlin as part of this new effort:
13 different body parts are stamped with a total of 7300 tons of force, in a press line that runs at up to 16 parts per minute pic.twitter.com/gSAynANrAx
Tesla starts out by showcasing its stamping line and how it produces its 13 different body parts.
The automaker also features its rear underbody, which has been its biggest use of its giga press so far with a single piece replacing 70 parts:
In the body shop, stamped parts & chassis castings are welded together by 600+ robots. Each car body is then lifted into the paint shop by one of the largest industrial robots ever, named Godzilla pic.twitter.com/n5jGXhmLkB
After originally using too many robots and automation in the first Model 3 production line, a mistake that Tesla later admitted, the automaker now takes pride in using fewer robots, but it confirms that it still uses a significant number of robots in this latest production line: over 600.
One of those robots is Godzilla, which is the largest industrial robot in the world:
It’s a massive robot made by Fanuc and used by several automakers.
The automaker also showcased its Gigafactory Berlin paint shop, which it claims is the most advanced paint shop in the world, enabling new multi-layered colors recently released on Model Y.
Finally, the vehicle moves to General Assembly, where seats, HVAC, power electronics, drive units & more are installed, using 20+ automated stations. This is our biggest shop by headcount—on any given shift, 1k+ people are helping build Model Y pic.twitter.com/IgSrCpH5DR
Nothing impressive in what they are showing.  16 Stampings/minute is actually not very fast.  Speed becomes limited by how fast the robots can transfer the parts.  If they move to fast the parts can deform.

Toured multiple plants where robot picks up entire body structure. 
Finally, Tesla released new images of its Model Y general assembly line at Giga Berlin.
Other companies have been impressed by Tesla’s plan for the factory. 
Herbert Diess, then CEO of Volkswagen, said that Tesla’s planned output at Gigafactory Berlin was 10 hours of production per car compared to VW being at over 30 hours at its Zwickau plant.
Most recently, Tesla said that it is producing 3,000 Model Y vehicles per week at Gigafactory Berlin, and it aims to ramp up to 5,000 units per week.

2023/02/13,"Tesla has secured a massive new 1 GWh Megapack order for a large-scale energy storage project in Canada.
Back in 2019, Tesla launched the Megapack; it was Tesla’s third stationary energy storage product after the Powerwall and Powerpack.
A single Megapack unit is a container-sized “3 MWh battery system” with integrated modules, inverters, and thermal systems. With the bigger size and integrated power electronics, Tesla claims that the Megapack is 60% more energy-dense than its Powerpack. It also comes on-site, ready to install, and can ship in containers.
A few months ago, Tesla updated the Megapack with more capacity, 3.9 MWh, and made it a bit bigger. The energy storage system has quickly become the most popular battery pack for large-scale energy storage projects.
Despite a significant ramp-up in production capacity over the last year, the lead time on new Megapack orders shows that it is basically sold out for the next two years.
Now a new giant project is being added to the backlog.
NRStor Inc. announced a new partnership to build the Oneida Energy Storage Project:
The Oneida Energy Storage Project is the largest of its kind in Canada and amongst the largest in the world. It will provide a gigawatt-hour of much needed capacity to the Ontario grid, while prioritizing local Indigenous partnerships and environmental benefits. NRStor and Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation (“SNGRDC”) have been jointly developing the Project since 2018 and are also pleased to announce Northland Power’s participation as an equity and operating partner.
The consortium confirmed that it is going to use Tesla Megapacks for the 250 MW/1,000 MWh project.
Annette Verschuren, chair and CEO of NRStor, commented on the announcement:
This is a significant day for the Oneida Energy Storage Project, and we are proud of the example it sets as a sustainable energy project with strong Indigenous partnership from Six Nations and collaboration between industry and government. We thank our many stakeholders, including the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada, whose support and investment in this Project have played a key role in bringing it to this stage.
The Tesla Megapacks are going to be used to store surplus power from renewable energy produced in Ontario and deliver it back to the grid at peak demand. It will also provide grid balancing services.
As previously stated, the project is added to Tesla’s long Megapack backlog, and it is not expected to be completed before 2025.

2023/02/13,"Tesla is preparing to launch its new Autopilot hardware 4.0 upgrade, according to a filing with European regulators.
The automaker is expected to announce a new Autopilot/Self-Driving hardware suite, which has been referred to as Hardware 4.0 (HW4), any day now.
There have been quite a few indications that some major changes are coming. For example, after famously removing radar sensors from its hardware suite, we learned in December that Tesla is planning to add one as soon as this month.
Additionally, we also reported on a Tesla Model 3 prototype that potentially featured a new Autopilot/Full Self-Driving hardware suite.
A report coming out of China also showed that Tesla applied with regulators for some modifications to its vehicles, including new Autopilot cameras.
Now Tesla has done the same in Europe where it files for changes to its vehicles with regulators in the Netherlands.
The Tesla forum TFF has a neat tracker to follow all the changes that the automaker applies for with the regulator, and it revealed a new application for Model S and Model X with a significant list of changes:
It confirms that Tesla is about to release the new Autopilot hardware 4.0, and it is going to include a new computer.
With Tesla now applying with regulators, it is fair to expect the launch of the new hardware to be imminent. 
CEO Elon Musk recently commented on the introduction of Hardware 4.0, and while he didn’t release any details about the upgrade or its timing, he did confirm that Tesla doesn’t plan to offer retrofits for older models.
Interestingly, more changes are being introduced at the same time, including a new drive inverter, though more details are not available.
It’s clear Tesla will need to continue to upgrade its hardware in order to one day achieve FSD. In my opinion, the best way forward would be to allow those who paid for FSD to transfer the software to any Tesla they choose. At the same time Tesla would no longer be responsible for upgrading any hardware since what you paid for was software. So in the future your options would be to either pay for a hardware upgrade or purchase a new Tesla and transfer the software.
Also, this is the new rear badging for those who are curious:
The new top speed appears to be linked to the Plaid models, which have yet to deliver on Tesla’s original top speed promises when first announcing its new top-of-the-line models.
The automaker has been software limiting the top speed until it can release its carbon ceramic brake kit to improve braking performance and make that insane top speed of 322 km/h (200 mph) safer.
As we previously reported, a Tesla Model S Plaid owner already managed to beat that top speed by unlocking the speed limiter in Tesla’s software.

2023/02/12,"Tesla is again adjusting pricing for its electric vehicle in the US – making it the fourth time in just over a month. 
It’s starting to be difficult to keep up with Tesla’s price changes lately.
As we previously reported, Tesla started the month by implementing drastic cuts across its entire EV lineup, with Model Y seeing the biggest cut of up to $13,000.
However, a few weeks later, the automaker adjusted the prices up on the Model Y by $500.
CEO Elon Musk indicated that more price increases may come as Tesla is adjusting to the demand the massive price cuts created.
Last week, we reported on Tesla adjusting Model Y prices up again while the Model 3 base price went down.
Now a week later, Tesla has again updated its online configurator with a few price changes.
The automaker has decreased the price of the base Model 3 by $500 again – now starting at $42,990:
The price of the Model 3 Performance has stayed the same, and Tesla is still not letting people order or giving a price on the Model 3 Long Range.
CEO Elon Musk originally claimed that Tesla stopped taking orders for the specific trim due to high demand, but we have since learned that Tesla is about to update the Model 3, which could explain the stop on new orders and the further price decrease as people might be reticent about placing a new order knowing that it might be updated soon.
Isn't really news. Prices change for products sometimes by the hour. At least that's what I see when driving my EV past the local gas station.  Supply, demand, cost of production, competition, inventory all impact the equation.  As the world becomes more intelligent through technology, this will be the norm for just about everything bought online and Tesla is certainly not the first to make constant price adjustments for the products it sells.  
As for Model Y, Tesla decided to increase the price of the Model Y Performance with the price adjustment update to the configurator today:
The Model Y Long Range, which is the base version for new orders, is still the same price – starting at $54,990.
While the Model Y Long Range is the base trim available to order, buyers can still get the Model Y Standard Range AWD as inventory vehicles when available. Tesla has also increased the price of that version. It’s now $500 more expensive – starting at $51,490.
Price increases generally mean that Tesla is seeing strong demand for a specific trim, but Tesla is still listing a quick delivery timeline by the end of March for a new Model Y Performance despite the price increase.

2023/02/12,"Tesla’s important Full Self-Driving Beta v11 software update is delayed again as the automaker appears to have serious issues shipping it.
Tesla FSD Beta v11 is both an exciting and scary step as it is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot highway stacks.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
Since the wider release of the beta last year, there are currently over 400,000 Tesla owners in the program in North America – virtually every Tesla owner who bought the FSD package on their vehicles.
However, the bulk of these owners have yet to receive significant FSD beta updates as Tesla was supposed to release v11 to the fleet in November 2022, but the update has been stuck in testing within Tesla’s closed fleet since then.
The update is an important step because it includes many new neural networks, as Musk stated, but from a consumer perspective, it’s also important because it is expected to merge Tesla’s FSD Beta software stack primarily used on roads and city streets with Tesla’s Autopilot software stack, which is used as a level 2 driver assist system on highways.
Most recently, CEO Elon Musk said that the v11 was coming last week, but last week came and passed without the update.
“FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.”

If it requires constant monitoring, it isn’t driving autonomously. 
Now Musk said that it is coming this week, but he said that it will be in a “limited beta”:
v11.3 (single stack) goes to limited beta this week. Probably 11.3.2 before wide release in North America. Then we adapt for EU roads & submit to regulators. 90% of what we’ve done so far for NA applies WW.
That generally means that the update will only be pushed to a select few early beta testers.
But that’s also what Musk is saying, and he has said several times that the update is coming within a week or so since late last year.
The CEO did admit that the v11 was “much harder than expected” and blamed the “re-architecture of neural nets” that the update brings to FSD Beta. Beyond that comment, it’s unclear what is holding up the update, but in the meantime, the 400,000 Tesla owners with FSD Beta haven’t seen meaningful improvements in a while.

2023/02/11,"A Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta smear campaign is reaching a whole new level as it is going to have a Super Bowl ad, according to the people behind the campaign.
Last year, we reported on Dan O’Dowd, a self-described billionaire and founder of Green Hills Software, a privately-owned company that makes operating systems and programming tools.
O’Dowd had launched a senate campaign in his home state of California, but the tech executive made it quite clear that he is making it a single-issue campaign, and that issue is Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program.
Under the protection of political ads, he invested several million dollars in an ad campaign to attack Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta program, with the goal of having it banned from public roads in the US.
Even though O’Dowd has lost his senate effort, the campaign continues under the name “The Dawn Project” and continues to attack Tesla.
Last summer, the campaign launched a new ad called “The Dangers of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Software,” in which they showed footage of an in-house test showing a Tesla Model 3 on FSD Beta hitting a child dummy.
The next day, Electrek posted a report that poked major holes in the ad, and the report that the Dawn Project released at the same time supposedly included the methodology of the tests behind the ad.
For example, in some of the footage used to produce the video, FSD Beta was clearly not engaged.
Tesla ended up sending a cease-and-desist letter to the Dawn Project over the campaign.
As we have often reported in the past, Tesla FSD Beta is a level driver assist system that requires driver attention at all times. The automaker is using the program to improve its neural nets in order to eventually deliver on its self-driving promises.
The campaign is producing unscientific tests where it puts FSD Beta in difficult situations and only show the worst performances to produce these ads.
Now O’Dowd announced that they produced a new anti-Tesla FSD Beta video that they are going to show as a new Super Bowl ad this Sunday:
Watch The Dawn Project’s #SuperBowl ad demonstrate critical safety defects in @Tesla Full Self-Driving. 6 months ago we reported FSD would run down a child. Tesla hasn't even fixed that! To focus their attention, @NHTSAgov must turn off FSD until Tesla fixes all safety defects. pic.twitter.com/AxJbN5oOSr
Again, the ad shows just a collection of bad Tesla FSD Beta performances and Tesla vehicles crashing into dummies. Also, it keeps referring to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta program as “Tesla Full Self-Driving” – insinuating that this is what Tesla believes self-driving should be.
It’s also worth noting that O’Dowd’s Green Hills Software claims to produce software for the automotive industry and specifically for driver assist features, which makes it a direct competitor to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD efforts.
Now if you have been following my writing on Tesla’s FSD Beta, you know that I’m not the biggest fan, but I think this effort is stupid.
Always weary of a company that ""when it can't beat the competition, it goes into attack mode.""  Just like the oil industry has been attacking renewable energy for the past decade.
You could produce videos like that about any driver assist system or self-driving programs if you used it over enough miles or set up unscientific tests for them.
You can see big fails from Cruise and Waymo online, but of course, since you can’t own the vehicle and use it all the time, it’s harder to produce a fail compilation video like this.
I do agree that it’s important to criticize FSD Beta and point out its weakness, but O’Dowd is not just doing that – he is creating a smear campaign and trying to have NHTSA shut down the program. Again, he is a direct competitor to that program.
He claims that it is to save lives, but that feels disingenuous. If you are using FSD Beta as intended, it is not more dangerous than any other driver assist features, which you also need to be careful with.

2023/02/10,"Tesla has hired a new general counsel, a position that has been historically superhard to fill for the automaker.
Tesla is often described as having high turnover, which has been especially true for its top lawyers.
Elon Musk surprised many when he hired his personal divorce lawyer, Todd Maron, to be Tesla’s general counsel (he was first deputy counsel) in 2013.
It’s not often you see an expert divorce lawyer become a top corporate lawyer at a major company, but it was actually a very successful move.
Maron took the helm for almost five years, became Tesla’s longest-reigning counsel, and took on a role that was beyond the responsibilities of most general counsels.
But he left in early 2019, and Tesla has had issues replacing him.
In January 2019, Tesla hired Dane Butswinkas, who was an outside counsel for the automaker.
Butswinkas only lasted about a month and was replaced by Jonathan Chang, an eight-year veteran of Tesla’s legal team at the time.
Then Chang ended up leaving Tesla at the end of 2019 to be replaced by Alan Prescott, who had been associate and, later, deputy general counsel as well as director of regulatory affairs for the past two years.
Prescott was named acting general counsel and corporate secretary, virtually becoming Tesla’s top lawyer.
Gotta build that ""hardcore litigation team"" for the upcoming FSD and other class action lawsuits. 
He left Tesla about a year later, and it wasn’t clear who replaced him – though now it appears that Dinna Eskin took over in an acting role.
Now Tesla has confirmed that it has hired a new general counsel and that Eskin is remaining at the company:
Excited to have Brandon Ehrhart join the Tesla team as our General Counsel & to have Dinna Eskin continue in a leadership role in Tesla Legal, as we build a world class team!
Ehrhart is coming from DISH Network, where he had an impressively long 20-year career and most recently held the position of general counsel, DISH Wireless, as well as executive vice president and corporate secretary, DISH Network.
The Vanderbilt-educated lawyer comes to Tesla at a time when CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is building a “hardcore litigation department” to become more aggressive in litigations.

2023/02/10,"Tesla is preparing to expand its insurance business internationally – starting with insurance products in the United Kingdom.
The automaker originally introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data or Tesla’s safety score, which had been the original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, Tesla wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October 2021, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes comparing the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month to month depending on your score:
Since releasing the product, Tesla has integrated everything into its mobile app, from ordering insurance to using the safety score to paying and managing claims.
The company expanded the insurance product to Illinois in December and then to  Arizona and Ohio in January.
In April, Tesla launched insurance based on real-time driver data in Colorado, Oregon, and Virginia.
In June, the automaker expanded the product to Nevada, and in July, we saw Utah and Maryland being added to the list.
The rollout is not happening as fast as Tesla anticipated as CEO Elon Musk stated that he believes Tesla Insurance would be in most states by the end of last year.
But now we learn of Tesla preparing its insurance business expansion internationally – starting with the UK.
The UK’s Insurance Post (via City AM) reports that Tesla started the process, and it is hiring a lawyer to work in its “full-stack in house in insurer” based in its London headquarters.
The UK has rapidly become one of Tesla’s most important markets as new car buyers are increasingly turning to electric vehicles.
Despite a higher sticker price, electric vehicles can result in a much lower cost of ownership, but Tesla has often been subject to higher insurance rates from established companies.
By offering its own product, Tesla hopes to reduce the cost of insurance for its owners and, in turn, reduce the overall cost of ownership.

2023/02/10,"Redwood Materials just got a $2 billion conditional loan from the US Department of Energy to expand its factory near Reno, Nevada, where it will manufacture EV batteries from an increasing amount of recycled content.
In a US first, Redwood will produce 100 GWh annually of ultra-thin battery-grade copper foil and cathode-active materials from both new and recycled feedstocks at gigafactory scale. 
Tesla cofounder JB Straubel founded Redwood Materials in 2017. It has partnerships with Ford Motor, Audi, Volkswagen, Volvo, and also with Panasonic, which is at the Tesla Gigafactory nearby. 
Straubel said in an interview, according to Reuters, that the initial loan draw, assuming it’s approved, “will help accelerate [production] and compress the time for us to get to full scale” at the Nevada battery factory.
Redwood says it expects to create 3,400 good-paying construction jobs and employ around 1,600 full-time employees. 
Redwood’s announcement summarizes what components are needed to manufacture batteries:
The two most essential and valuable components in a battery are the anode and cathode. The cathode contains all the critical metals in a battery – lithium, nickel, and cobalt – and requires a complex manufacturing process and functional specification integral to the performance and safety of an electric vehicle battery. The anode contains copper and graphite and is primarily responsible for a battery’s charging performance. Together, these components amount to nearly 80% of the materials cost of a lithium-ion battery.
But today, these components are manufactured entirely overseas, predominantly in Asia. 
So Redwood’s plan is to make anode and cathode components and produce them from an increasing amount of recycled content domestically, at scale. And that would reduce the need to import battery components from overseas.
Redwood recycles from consumer electronics such as cell phone batteries, laptops, power tools, and other electronic waste.
The US Department of Energy asserts:
On average, Redwood can recover greater than 95% of the critical battery elements in an end-of-life battery (including lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper), and then use those metals to manufacture anode and cathode components domestically for US battery cell manufacturers.
That’s enough battery materials to produce more than one million EVs annually. It also allows battery and auto makers to meet the Inflation Reduction Act’s mineral and battery component requirements so that consumers qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit.
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said:
It’s going to be a slam dunk for our domestic burgeoning electric vehicle industry.
[Redwood will play an] outsized role in bringing the battery supply chain home – because you are focused on the pieces that we don’t have in the United States.
Redwood is building another factory in Kansas that will source the company’s cathode and anode materials for battery cell production, and it’s also building a factory similar to the Nevada facility near Charleston, South Carolina. The South Carolina factory is around two years behind the Nevada factory, according to Straubel.
The Biden administration is working to create a US EV supply chain, thus reducing dependence on components made in China. It also has a target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and fuel cell electric vehicles.

2023/02/10,"Tesla is slightly raising the price of the base Model Y in China after an important price cut last month resulted in a significant increase in orders.
Last month, we reported on Tesla slashing prices in China, which raised demand concerns for the automaker in the important EV market.
The price drops on some Model 3 and Model Y trims were significant, and while it would have a negative effect on the company’s gross margin, we expected that it would be successful in increasing sales.
Several local reports confirmed that Tesla’s order rate significantly increased over the last month.
Now Tesla is even adjusting up its price on the base Model Y a bit.
In an update to its online configurator today, Tesla increased the price of the Model Y Standard Range by ¥2,000:
The Model Y now starts at 261,900 yuan – the equivalent of $38,577 USD – in China.
While Tesla increasing the price would indicate that the automaker is seeing a stronger order rate than it can handle right now, the company is still quoting a delivery time of two to five weeks for the base Model Y.
It’s the same for the longer-range Model Y and even a little faster for the Model Y Performance.
In January, Tesla China had an output of 66,000 electric vehicles out of China, but only 27,000 units were for the local market.
However, Tesla generally uses most of its early output out of China for exports to Europe and other markets early in the quarter and then focuses on domestic deliveries during the second half of the quarter.
Therefore, February and March numbers should be the ones confirming the impact of Tesla’s price adjustments in the important EV market.
In 2022, 22% of Tesla’s $81 billion in revenue came from China, making it Tesla’s second most important market after the US.

2023/02/09,"A new Tesla Cybertruck beta prototype has been spotted and this time we get a good look at the front-end, which appears to have been updated, and it still has a monstrous windshield wiper.
As we reported last week, we expected to start seeing a lot more Cybertruck sightings as the automaker is testing its new fleet of beta prototypes ahead of the start of production.
The first beta prototype was spotted in Palo Alto last week, but it mainly gave us a look at the latest design from the back and side of the Cybertruck.
Now a new sighting shows a Cybertruck beta prototype from the front:
NEW CYBERTRUCK SIGHTING! So much to take in here.. hmmm pic.twitter.com/SMpD1FzZRA
We believe it’s a new beta prototype because like the one spotted last week, it also features the new triangular side mirrors, which weren’t on previous prototypes.
The view of the Cybertruck from the front gives a look at what appears to be a slightly updated fascia:
It’s hard to know for sure because pictures can sometimes be distorted, but it appears that the Cybertruck has a shorter ground clearance than previous prototypes.
Also, it looks that Tesla is sticking with unconventional headlights as it moves to the beta prototype. The light bars are similar to the prototype from the original unveiling in 2019:
However, the grill underneath the lower light bar appears to be slightly different on the new beta prototype.
Ah, so TESLA has finally realized that a front fascia that works as a knife in any sort of accident with a pedestrian is not a good idea and not going to be approved... Who could have seen this coming.. 

I expect a lot more ""design refreshes"" before the thing is actually released. On that note, having so many refreshes in the same year that they are supposed to be releasing a model is not a good sign. That should've been down pat a long time ago.

The wiper, which is so large it looks like it could be used as a murder weapon, is sitting in view on the side when not in use unlike regular vehicles where it stays tucked next to the hood.

This, in itself, is a design flaw. The purpose of hiding the wiper behind a cowl is that is minimizes the amount of dirt that attaches to it. If you leave it up like that on a relatively low vehicle, you may as well not have a wiper because you won't see anything but streaks when you try to use it.. 
The new prototype also still features the monstrously large windshield wiper that has been previously seen. The wiper, which is so large it looks like it could be used as a weapon, is sitting in view on the side when not in use unlike regular vehicles where it stays tucked next to the hood.
CEO Elon Musk has previously said that it wouldn’t be the wiper that would make to production, but the beta prototype is supposedly very near to the final production version.
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
In the meantime, we should expect to spot more Cybertruck beta prototypes in the wild. If you spot one, don’t hesitate to send your sightings our way at fred@electrek.co.

After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/02/09,"Tesla Semi program manager, Guthrie Gintzler, explained his pitch to fleet managers and the importance of electric trucks to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.
Gintzler joined Tesla in 2016 as an intern, but he quickly rose through the ranks and was made program manager of Tesla Semi last year.
He has an interesting educational background, with a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics from the University of Pennsylvania, along with a bachelor’s in economics, finance, and management from Wharton and a master’s in robotics, again from the University of Pennsylvania.
Gintzler recently went back to his alma mater to discuss electric trucks just as Tesla is finally starting to deliver its first Tesla Semi electric trucks.
In his talk, he explained that electric truck pitch to fleet managers is fairly simple: 
I’ll pose a bit of a rhetorical question here. If you’re a diesel fleet manager looking to reduce costs, which category would you target? You’re going to try to tackle your largest cost. That’s energy. Your best option to do that is with EV trucks. The cost of ownership of electric trucks is much lower than diesel.
He stated that a plurality of trucks is operated by the top 20 fleet operators and targeting these few operators alone could result in a 2.5% in emission reduction.
The program manager stated that even though semitrucks represent about only 1% of vehicles on the road, they account for almost 40% of total emissions from the transportation sector:
[Trucks] are heavily utilized. Folks that own a car use it about 5% of the time, but heavy-duty trucks are utilized as much as the driver possibly can, eight or more hours per day. They’re also higher energy consumption, meaning that to move one mile, you have to use more energy.
It’s a difficult task that is going to require achieving high-volume production of electric class 8 semitrucks, which doesn’t exist right now.
Tesla is believed to have delivered a few dozen Tesla Semi trucks, but it is producing them in low volume at a facility next to Gigafactory Nevada.
The automaker recently announced a large investment in Gigafactory Nevada to build new large production lines for Tesla Semi, and it has indicated a plan to ramp up to a capacity of 50,000 trucks per year.
However, it is expected to take years before it gets there.

2023/02/09,"Tesla Powerwall owners in the California virtual power plant report making up to $500 in the first year of the new program despite launching only in the summer.
It looks like it could be a real way to lower the cost of owning home energy storage.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems – like Tesla Powerwalls – used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants.
In 2021, Tesla launched a VPP pilot program in California, where Powerwall owners would join voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it. It helped Tesla prove the usefulness of such a system.
Following the pilot program, Tesla and PG&E (the electric utility covering Northern California) launched the first official virtual power plant through the Tesla app with compensation in June.
This new version of the Virtual Power Plant actually compensates Powerwall owners $2 per kWh that they contribute to the grid during emergency load reduction events. Homeowners are expected to get between $10 and $60 per event.
Shortly after, Tesla’s California VPP expanded to Southern California Edison (SCE) to now cover most of the state, and the VPP had its first event, and it was extremely successful.
Tesla has now sent the payments for 2022 to Powerwall owners participating in the VPP, and they are reporting up to $575 in revenue (via reader Mahkus who has been documenting his use on Youtube)
This appears to be on the higher side of the payment range as this homeowner has three Powerwalls.
Tesla failed to add our new Powerwalls to the VPP until I pestered them, so we didn't join until the last two weeks of August, and we still got nearly $200/Powerwall in Massachusetts.  The program with Eversource is only active in the summer, as they only hit peak loads then.  I'm looking forward to seeing what I get next summer with the full summer.
He said that the compensation was for delivering 297 kWh to the grid through 10 events over 26 hours with the VPP. Most other homeowners are reporting payments between $300 and $400.
That’s not bad, especially considering that it was for about half the year. As the VPP expands and becomes more efficient, it’s possible that we could see most owners earning between $500 to $1,000 a year.
It could significantly contribute to reducing the cost of ownership of the Tesla Powerwall or other home energy storage devices, which are becoming increasingly popular to combine with solar power as well as backup power.

2023/02/09,"Tesla, and specifically Autopilot, has been cleared from blame in the highly publicized fatal crash in Texas that was reported to have happened with “no one in the driver’s seat.”
In April 2021, a strange and tragic accident in a Tesla happened in Spring, Texas.
A Tesla Model S missed a turn, hit a tree, and caught on fire, killing the two occupants. The strange thing was that the police said they don’t think anyone was in the driver seat as someone was found on the front passenger seat and another in the back seat. Furthermore, a family member of the Tesla owner said that he jumped in the back seat when starting the drive.
As we noted at the time, the local media presented the accident as being an autonomous vehicle crash, but Tesla doesn’t have any autonomous vehicles on the road right now, and didn’t at the time – only vehicles with driver-assist features and the FSD Beta, which is also considered level 2 driver assist.
Either way, Tesla’s Autopilot was blamed in the media and both the NTSB and NHTSA launched investigations into the accidents.
Don't forget the press stories also said it took a long time (days?) for the fire department to put the lithium fire out. Of course no retraction after the fire chief said it was out in minutes, no problem. They kept putting a little water on the car to keep the battery cool for a longer period of time.
Data from the car’s event data recorder, which acts as a sort of black box, indicated that Autopilot features were not activated at the time of the crash.
Now two years later, Tesla has been fully vindicated in the accident as the NTSB as released its final report on the crash today and found no evidence that Autopilot was involved:
On-scene exemplar vehicle testing confirmed the manufacturer-provided information that the car’s Autopilot feature could not have been engaged on the roadway where the crash occurred, due to the lack of lane markings. Investigators found that the TACC system was capable of being engaged; however, testing showed that with TACC engaged, the maximum speed possible on this roadway was approximately 30 mph. The acceleration achieved with TACC engaged was lower than the acceleration documented in the car’s EDR data. This evidence indicated that TACC was not engaged during the crash trip.
Instead, NTSB’s report points to the cause being the driver being impaired from alcohol and medication:
We ​​determined that the probable cause of the Spring, Texas, electric vehicle crash was the driver’s excessive speed and failure to control his car, due to impairment from alcohol intoxication in combination with the effects of two sedating antihistamines, resulting in a roadway departure, tree impact, and postcrash fire.
Tesla and the NTSB have been at odds for years now as the agency opened dozen of investigations on Tesla crashes and believes that the automaker’s “Full Self-Driving Capability” package is misleading.

2023/02/08,"Tesla’s former head of AI, Andrej Karpathy, announced that he is joining OpenAI, an AI startup originally co-founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But is the relationship between the two a happy one? Maybe not…
Karpathy joined Tesla more than five years ago as a neural net and computer vision expert. He joined as Tesla was transitioning from using Mobileye’s technology for driver-assist features to its own system powered by computer vision.
The engineer is credited for building Tesla’s machine learning and computer vision team. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a big part of Tesla’s Autopilot team as well as the automaker’s effort to develop a full self-driving system.
As Tesla expanded its effort from self-driving to broader artificial intelligence, Karpathy was promoted to senior director of AI at Tesla.
In March 2022, Karpathy announced that he was going on sabbatical for four months. At the time, we reported that it was worrisome since Tesla executives taking breaks has most often resulted in them not coming back.
Sure enough, Karpathy announced in July that he was not coming back to Tesla to focus on his “long-term passions around technical work in AI, open source and education.”
He was highly respected in the AI community and was credited for greatly helping Tesla hire in the field. It was seen as a big loss for Tesla when he left.
A few months ago, he said that he would consider coming back to Tesla at some point, but today, he has announced that he is joining OpenAI:
Some personal news: I am joining OpenAI (again :)). Like many others both in/out of AI, I am very inspired by the impact of their work and I have personally benefited greatly from it. The future potential is especially exciting; it is a great pleasure to jump back in and build!🪄
Interestingly, OpenAI, an AI company now famous for its ChatGPT chatbot based on large language models, was originally co-founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a non-profit.
In 2018, Musk left Open AI’s board and sighted a potential conflict with Tesla’s own AI effort as the reason for severing ties with the company at the time. He swiftly unfollowed Karpathy following the announcement.
👀 @elonmusk (Great person. Please do not ban this bot.) is no longer following @karpathy
Now it looks like we are witnessing a clear example of that potential conflict of interest as important AI team members are moving between the two companies.

2023/02/08,"Tesla has managed to cut the price of its electric cars in half over five years, and it might do it again with its next-generation vehicle platform.
Much has been said of Tesla’s prices lately.
Despite its high prices, Tesla has attracted some non-luxury buyers over the years who have been willing to pay a premium to go electric, but it remains a luxury brand.
As a premium brand, the automaker competes primarily with other luxury brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Lexus.
But it has been gradually going down market over the years – albeit for massive price increases over the last two years that put even its entry models out of reach of most buyers.
Last month, Tesla implemented some significant price cuts across its entire EV lineup that made its vehicles more affordable, but they still all sit firmly in premium categories.
As we previously reported, the price drop might have started a new EV price war, and Tesla is in a great position to win that war thanks to its industry-leading gross margin.
The automaker has managed to cut its average sale price by half since 2017 while improving its operating margin from negative 15% to now more than 15% in the black:
That’s despite prices going slightly up in 2022,  breaking the trend for the first time.
However, prices are expected to go down significantly in 2023 with the big price cuts to start the year.
But it’s most exciting to look into the future as there’s potential to see Tesla’s prices cut in half, or close to it, again over the next five years – thanks to its next-generation vehicle platform about to be unveiled.
The Model S and Model X were based on Tesla’s first-generation vehicle platform. Model 3 and Model Y were based on the second generation – even though Model Y ended up featuring many improvements over Model 3.
Now Tesla is getting ready to unveil its third-generation vehicle platform at its Investor Day on March 1.
There are not many details available about Tesla’s new platform, but it is expected to focus on reducing cost and improving manufacturability to achieve a new level of scale.
More specifically, the new platform is expected to take advantage of Tesla’s 4680 battery cell, structural battery pack design, and its latest large casting technology to achieve a new level.
Today, Musk indicated that he will release Tesla’s Master Plan Part 3 at the event, and he has made clear on many occasions that the plan will be about how the automaker plans to scale to 20 million vehicles per year.
The plan is expected to include Tesla’s deeper involvement through the entire battery material supply chain, including more factories to refine minerals like lithium and nickel, as well as more vehicle and battery factories.
This supply chain and manufacturing plan along with the new vehicle platform is likely to enable Tesla to produce vehicles in new categories – even potentially an eventual $25,000 compact vehicle that would increase Tesla’s scale and greatly reduce its average sale price.
It’s hard for people to imagine Tesla ramping up to 20 million vehicles per year, but it was also hard for most people to imagine Tesla ramping up to 1 million units.
The company not only did that, but it now sits at a capacity to produce 2 million cars per year.
It won’t be easy to 10x that capacity in seven years, but I think it’s doable.
Whatever discussion of a low cost, Tesla comes up, I’m a little confused about how they can produce a $25,000 car and then continue to sell autonomous software for $15,000. I guess those cars will not be part of the program. And please don’t Make the case for the value of using the cars as Robotaxis. I’m assuming if somebody needs to buy a car in the $25,000 range, it’s because they need that card for themselves for their own transportation to get to work.
However, production is just one side of things. Tesla also needs cheaper offerings in order to have the demand for anything near 20 million vehicles per year.
If the automaker achieves self-driving capability, it would certainly be an easier sale, but putting that aside, Tesla is likely limited to about 3 million potential sales per year with its current lineup.
Electric pickups, like the Cybertruck, could bring that up to 5 million units without having to average down the sale price, but everything else will likely have to come from new segments lower than $40,000.
That’s why all eyes should be on that presentation on March 1 since it should give us a better idea of how Tesla plans to deliver on those ~15 million vehicles per year that are hard to imagine right now.

2023/02/08,"California released its 2022 vehicle data and confirmed that Tesla is dominating the market, leading to a new record 17% market share for electric vehicles.
Total vehicle registrations were down 7.9% in 2022, according to the California New Car Dealers Association’s annual report.
But the report highlights a positive with electric vehicles being up more than 50%:
A positive in California’s 2022 new vehicle market: sales of electric vehicles, with an estimated increase in market share of 17.1 percent. While vehicle pricing was a major concern in 2022, sales of pure EVs increased by over 50 percent from 2021. California is clearly doing its part to increase EV sales.
Tesla is again the biggest contributor to electric vehicle growth in the state. 
The Model Y has even become the bestselling vehicle in California with over 87,000 deliveries in the state in 2022.
Model 3 came in second with just short of 79,000 units registered in the state last year.
While Toyota is still the bestselling brand overall in California thanks to having many more models, it is starting to be seriously threatened by Tesla who now has the two best-selling vehicles in the important market.
The California New Car Dealers Association breaks down SUVs and pickups into light trucks and other vehicles into passenger vehicles. 
Here are the top five bestselling “light trucks” in California in 2022:
And here are the top five bestselling passenger cars in the state last year:
Tesla is the only major brand in terms of volume to have had a significant increase in registrations in 2022:
That last chart is pretty telling. Automakers should take note that if you want to counter this automotive market downturn, you need to have compelling electric vehicles to offer in volume.
And this chart is also saying a lot:
Electric vehicle market shares continue to increase at an incredible pace; it jumped from 9% in 2021 to 17% in 2022. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s between 25 and 30% this year.
Automakers who are not ready for that will see a decline in sales this year again.

2023/02/08,"Hertz disclosed that it took delivery of only half its massive Tesla order of 100,000 electric cars. However, the numbers don’t add up.
In 2021, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles. More recently, the company added Model Y vehicles to the order.
The rental car company said that it expects to have all 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 – though Tesla didn’t seem to be completely on board with that timeline.
Today, Hertz’s disclosed through its annual filings for 2022 that it ended the year with about 48,344 Tesla electric vehicles:
Hertz’s fleet in the Americas peaked at 428,700 vehicles for the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, of which 11% were Tesla cars, the filing showed. The company had an additional 1,187 Teslas in its international fleet.
The media is reporting that this is disappointing since it appears that Hertz only took delivery of about half of its planned 100,000 Tesla vehicles.
However, the numbers are pretty confusing.
Just checked Hertz, for a rental going out of my local international airport. Prices start at $69 per day for a Model Y, $51 per day for a Model 3. Cheaper than Turo around here for me. That's pretty cool. Thought everybody would be wondering. 
Shortly after announcing the Tesla order, Hertz announced that on top of adding Tesla vehicles to its rental fleet, the company also made a deal with Uber to offer its drivers access to the Tesla vehicles. 50,000 Tesla vehicles will be offered for rent to Uber drivers, and the company has an option for more if the program is successful.
Last month, Hertz confirmed that nearly 50,000 Uber drivers had rented a Tesla through this program.
It’s still unclear if this program is accounted for on top or alongside Hertz’s fleet Tesla consumer rental. Either way, it would be strange for Hertz to have fewer than 50,000 Tesla vehicles and yet have a visibly large fleet of Tesla vehicles for consumer rental and had nearly 50,000 Uber drivers renting Tesla vehicles through its program, which is more for long-term rentals.

2023/02/07,"Tesla will finally unveil a planned expansion of its “master plan” on March 1 at the company’s “Investor Day” summit at Giga Texas, said CEO Elon Musk today.
Tesla announced its “Investor Day” event last month, to occur in March. This is a new event by Tesla, seemingly separate from the annual shareholder event, where some investors will be invited to see updates on Tesla’s progress. The event will be livestreamed as well. In the past, Tesla has held a “Battery Day” and an “AI Day” focusing on those topics.
The company said that Investor Day would include factory tours and discussion of Tesla’s long-term expansion plans and its upcoming generation 3 vehicle platform. Its announcement came after the end of Tesla’s worst year in the stock market ever, dropping some 65% in 2022. We now know that Investor Day will include Tesla’s newest “master plan.”
Musk first teased this expansion of Tesla’s “Master Plan” last March, meaning almost a year has passed since it was first publicly mentioned. We thought there was a chance the plan would be unveiled at Investor Day, and that prediction was confirmed today.
This is the third version of the company’s “master plan,” the first of which was posted in 2006.
At first, Tesla’s “secret master plan” was a cheeky blog post on the company’s original blog site. The goal was to lay out the vision behind Tesla as a company, and let people know what the company was planning to do. The idea was, instead of auto industry plans being shrouded in secrecy, Tesla would be upfront about what it wanted to do to change the industry – to lead us into an all-electric future.
So, the four steps of the original plan went thusly:
These referred to the original Tesla Roadster, the Tesla Model S (which was originally intended to start at $50,000 after credits), and the Tesla Model 3 (originally intended to start at $35,000).
Then, ten years down the line, in 2016, the company had finished the first two steps and was in the process of acquiring SolarCity and putting the final touches on the Model 3, and thus, the end of the plan was in sight. So it was time for an update.
Tesla’s “Master Plan, Part Deux” was less cheeky, but again laid out the future plans of the company. In short, these were the four steps this time around:
These steps were a little more complicated, a little more specific, and perhaps a little more aspirational. And Tesla has seen perhaps less success bringing them to market than the steps of the original plan.
Step 1 has been completed, and some customers do have solar roofs, but installations have never really gotten off the ground in large numbers, and Tesla has drastically cut back on installations of solar roofs.
Step 2 is basically complete, depending on how we define “major.” Cybertruck is nearing production, and is probably about as close to market as Model 3 was at the time Part Deux was posted. Tesla Semi is on the road now, and Tesla has both large and mid-size luxury sedans and crossovers available. These are most of the main “major” segments of vehicles, though Tesla does not have a truly affordable car (even its “$35k” model now starts at $43,490 after a recent huge price drop) or any small sedan or hatchback. Or a sportscar, for that matter, but that’s not really a major segment.
Step 3 could be argued, but requires heavy massaging of the data. Tesla’s most recent Autopilot safety report shows one accident per 4.31 million miles while activated, compared to one accident per 484,000 miles for average vehicles. This is about 10x, but doesn’t take into account that Autopilot is mostly used on highways, which are dramatically safer than city roads, and new cars are safer than older cars as well. When comparing to Tesla cars without Autopilot active, Autopilot is only about 2.7x safer “than manual” – and again, this does not account for highway vs. surface street differences.
And step 4 is not even close (unless you listen to Musk, who has been promising self-driving tech “by this time next year” for about ten years now).
So, execution of this plan has been a little more equivocal than the first. Nevertheless, Tesla sees a need to issue an update regardless, this time seven years after the previous plan was posted, instead of ten.
So, what’s left for Master Plan Part Three?
Well, Musk’s announcement today suggested that “the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth will be presented on March 1”:
Master Plan 3, the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth will be presented on March 1. The future is bright! pic.twitter.com/11ug0LRlbD
Tesla has previously said that Master Plan Part 3 is “all about achieving very large scale” in vehicle and battery pack production, including mining and refining, enough to “actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth.” Tesla has recently considered getting into mining, which could end up being part of the master plan update, and is rumored to be looking to build a factory in Mexico as well.
Musk’s statement today suggests that the plan won’t just include discussion of cars, but also sustainable energy options. Tesla’s current sustainable energy products include solar system installations, solar roof tiles, and stationary battery installations with Powerwalls (for home storage) and Powerpacks (for grid storage). Then there’s Tesla’s Virtual Power Plant program, where Powerwall owners can join a distributed network of energy storage to help back up the grid in times of need.
These are basically covered in step 4 of the first master plan, and step 1 of the second master plan, so we suspect they will make an appearance in the third master plan.
It seems likely that we’ll see something similar to the incomplete points of the last master plan, perhaps having to do with autonomous driving. Particularly, maybe we’ll hear an update on the dedicated robotaxi which Tesla has alluded to multiple times.
I'd say that major, at minimum, would include all the categories that all major auto makers have in their lineups. Minivans are missing. Tesla muddied the whole SUV/crossover distinction. In all fairness, the notion of a traditional SUV with a truck chassis makes no sense for an EV with independent drive trains on each end so I wouldn't hold it against them. But in terms of body style, sizes, level of luxury, the coverage is a bit narrow. 
Beyond that, the image chosen for the advertisement is notable, as it seems to be a large repeating pattern of many stamped car bodies. This refers to the previously-announced focus on production scaling, as Tesla still plans to scale car production and deliveries by ~50% per year for the foreseeable future. Tesla delivered 1.3 million in 2022, which was up 40% from 2021, and wants to deliver 1.8-2 million cars in 2023.
And perhaps, even though Tesla used pictures of a Model 3 body, it might announce a new, even-more-mass-production model.
Tesla has previously mentioned that Investor Day would include discussion of its “generation 3” platform, which is expected to be more affordable than the Model 3/Y platform. Since those cars were originally meant to start at around $35k, the next step was to release a vehicle starting at around $25k, but Tesla has gone back and forth on whether that car was in the plans.
We suspect we’ll find out on March 1 whether it is.

2023/02/06,"The police chief of Somerset in Wisconsin explained in detail why his police department decided to go electric with a Tesla Model Y patrol car and how he expects the single electric vehicle will save the town $80,000.
There are an impressive number of police departments around the world realizing that electric vehicles are the perfect solution to both reduce the operating cost and the environmental impact of their patrol vehicles.
The Somerset PD is one of those police departments and, like many of the departments going electric, they went with Tesla vehicles – more specifically, the Model Y.
Joel Trepczyk, Somerset PD Chief, explained in detail the reasoning behind buying the Tesla Model Y.
He made it clear that they chose the Model Y for financial reasons. He said in an interview with Police 1 News:
We specifically choose the Tesla Model Y for the financial benefits. 
The chief listed the main benefits of the Model Y:
The Model Y cost the department $60,000, though they had some subsidies and help to acquire it, but more importantly, Trepczyk believes Somerset PD will save over $80,000 over 10 years thanks to these benefits to the cost of operation:
The vehicle was purchased using American Rescue Plan Act funds. We also applied funding from an LEA grant, as well as donations to the purchase. The purchase price of the vehicle was around $60,000. More importantly, it’s projected to save our village over $80,000 throughout its 10-year duty cycle.
The chief says that the officers are so far liking the Model Y and choosing it over the other patrol cars.
With about 300 miles of range, distance is not an issue. Most of the police department’s officers average 30 to 60 miles per shift. The department had a Tesla Wall Connector installed at the station where the vehicle can be charged when needed.
One comparison of a Model 3 over 300,000 miles revealed total maintenance costs less than $10,000 for the Model 3 vs more than $50,000 for a comparable ICE car.
Here’s a look at the interior of the Somerset PD’s Tesla Model Y patrol vehicle:
Somerset PD is not the first police department that is finding EVs to be a much cheaper solution for patrol vehicles.
Even if the sticker price is higher, the cost of operation is so much cheaper that the vehicle pays for itself in no time.
A police department that purchased a Model 3 found that the difference in price with the usual Ford vehicle they would buy for police patrol can be paid for in 6 to 18 months depending on use.

2023/02/06,"Tesla has filed to trademark the term “TeslaOne” for what appears to be a new in-house work mobile application.
Last week, Tesla filed for a new trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
We waited until this week to report on it since we got misled by another filing seemingly made by Tesla last month for new vehicles but that was actually initiated by a Tesla fan for the company.
Therefore, we waited until we could get our hands on the original application for this one, and we can confirm that it was signed by Emily Lough, associate general counsel and chief IP counsel for Tesla.
The new filing is for the term “TESLAONE”; based on the application, it is for a workplace mobile application.
Tesla wrote about the new trademark:
TESLAONE™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of downloadable computer software in the nature of a mobile application for document management, workforce timekeeping and scheduling, analysis of employee time and activity, tracking purchase orders and returns, completing customizable comment forms, and database management.
The automaker is known for developing its own enterprise software instead of relying on commonly used software from companies like SAP or Salesforce. 
Most famously, Tesla has created its own all-encompassing enterprise software that manages all parts of its business, from sales to supply chain.
Tesla’s longtime chief information officer, Jay Vijayan, who quietly left in January 2016, is credited for leading the development of the system, which Tesla calls “Warp.”
Vijayan discussed what pushed them to develop their “Warp” system in-house during an interview with CIO Insight in 2014:
Elon’s vision is to build a vertically integrated organization where information flow happens seamlessly across departments and where we have a closed feedback loop to our customers. By doing this, we can provide the best possible product, service, and overall experience to our customers in the fastest way possible, while also operating efficiently as a business to bring this vision to life, we had to have simple and central business operations software that could connect all departments and enable information flow seamlessly across departments. Again, we couldn’t find one software program in the market that satisfied this need.
Elon Musk has since pushed his companies to develop even more new enterprise engineering systems to be used across his multiple companies.
For example, we previously reported on Tesla and SpaceX sharing some custom software platforms developed for materials research.
WARP encompasses a lot of important back-end software that automates many processes for Tesla, from purchasing to manufacturing to inventory.
In 2021, Tesla accused one of its former engineers of stealing the Warp system.
Tesla has since migrated to new versions of its in-house software, and it looks like TeslaOne might be a new addition to Tesla’s in-house enterprise software.

2023/02/06,"Tesla’s infamous Full Self-Driving Beta v11 update was supposed to be here in November of last year, but it has been delayed many times.
CEO Elon Musk now says it’s coming this week – if you believe him.
Tesla FSD Beta v11 is both an exciting and scary step as it is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot highway stacks.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
Since the wider release of the beta last year, there are currently over 400,000 Tesla owners in the program in North America – virtually every Tesla owner who bought the FSD package on their vehicles.
However, the bulk of these owners have yet to receive significant FSD beta updates as Tesla was supposed to release v11 to the fleet in November 2022, but the update has been stuck in testing within Tesla’s closed fleet since then.
This weekend, Musk commented on the release of v11 and said that it might start to ship at the end of the week:
V11 has been tougher than expected, as it is a significant rearchitecture of NNs, plus many more NNs replacing C++. Hoping to ship v11.3 end of week.
But the CEO has said that about other versions of the update over the last three months.
The update is an important step because it includes many new neural networks, as Musk stated, but from a consumer perspective, it’s also important because it is expected to merge Tesla’s FSD Beta software stack primarily used on roads and city streets with Tesla’s Autopilot software stack, which is used as a level 2 driver assist system on highways.
This is a scary step for many Tesla FSD Beta users who aren’t satisfied with the level of usefulness in the system, which requires a significant level of oversight and often needs to be corrected, while Tesla’s Autopilot on highways is more appreciated by the average Tesla driver.
Some are afraid that the merging of the stacks could potentially negatively affect their Autopilot experience on highways
I disagree the FSD program is stale. I have seen continued improvement even without the major V11 update. It is so much smother and FSD is handling situations so much better even without the combined stack. I had a 50 mile drive with local roads, state highways and interstate last night without a single intervention or issue. Major improvement. My wife and I use FSD beta daily. 

Yes it has further to go but the improvements have been huge!
Hopefully, all of these delays about releasing v11 to the fleet over those last three months were about making sure that this fear doesn’t become reality.
At least that’s my hope.
But in the meantime, it’s resulting in a stale FSD Beta program with no significant update in a long time, which is also a problem because it makes Tesla’s road to a true level 4 self-driving system harder to imagine.
At this point, v11 really needs to be something special otherwise I think more people are going to be disillusioned by Tesla FSD beta and its potential to deliver on Tesla’s ambitious “full self-driving” promises.

2023/02/04,"A new video of the Tesla Cybertruck’s impressive four-wheel steering at work has leaked – giving us the best look at the feature yet.
Rear-wheel steering is quickly becoming a must-have feature for electric pickup trucks coming to market.
Rear-wheel steering, or four-wheel steering, is the ability to steer the rear axle, generally to a smaller degree than the front wheel, and to create a tighter and more precise turning radius. 
GMC started the dance by demonstrating the “crab mode,” utilizing rear-wheel steering on the Hummer EV.
Several other automakers have since announced rear-wheel-steering, and back in 2021, Tesla followed by announcing that the Cybertruck will have the capacity.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced last summer:
We’re adding rear wheel steering, so it can do tight turns and maneuver with high agility.
Last year, we saw a quick video of the Cybertruck showcasing the feature for a second, but now we have a much better look, thanks to Twitter user TokyoTesla.
They posted a much longer video of the Cybertruck that more clearly featured the four-wheel steering capability:
4 wheel steering Cybertruck is sick! 🤩 pic.twitter.com/WAlCTIBxWi
In the video, we can see the rear wheels actively turning, which confirms the rear-wheel steering on the electric pickup truck.
Musk commented on the video without actually addressing the feature:
Very hard car to build, as it is unlike any other, but, as stated publicly, Cybertruck production starts this year.
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024 when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
GMC started the dance by demonstrating “Crab Mode’ utilizing rear-wheel steering on the Hummer EV.

GM offered Quadrasteer as a (very expensive) option on 1/2T & 3/4T pickups and some other models, 2002-05.  It's not new in the domestic truck market, only ""refreshed"".

The automaker also confirmed having built a new fleet of Cybertruck Beta prototypes. One was spotted in Palo Alto earlier this week.
It’s not clear if this new video is of a beta prototype as it appears to look closer to the alpha prototypes with the large side mirror and lack of tonneau cover.
The video also appears to have been filmed at Gigafactory Texas – possibly during the last event where the Cybertruck was featured.
Nonetheless, it’s the best look at the Cybertruck’s rear-wheel steering we have seen yet. It will be interesting to see if Tesla tries to implement new features with the capacity – like Rivian’s “tank turn” or GMC’s “crab walk.”

2023/02/04,"Tesla has again adjusted its electric vehicle prices for the third time in a month. This time, Model Y prices went up while the Model 3 base price went down.
It’s been an eventful few weeks for people tracking Tesla’s prices.
As we previously reported, Tesla started the month by implementing drastic cuts across its entire EV lineup, with Model Y seeing the biggest cut of up to $13,000.
However, a few weeks later, the automaker adjusted the prices up on the Model Y by $500.
CEO Elon Musk indicated that more price increases may come as Tesla is adjusting to the demand the massive price cuts created.
Today, Tesla again adjusted prices on both Model Y and Model 3:
The Model Y Long Range, which is the base Model Y that is configurable on its website (as Tesla has yet to offer custom orders for the Model Y AWD standard range produced at Gigafactory Texas), has seen a price increase by $1,500.
That’s a $2,000 increase since the price cut last month.
The Model Y Performance is now $1,000 more expensive – now starting at $57,990.
Tesla also adjusted Model 3 prices:
They let 3 and Y price get too close, causing a mismatch between orders and production. They need to shift enough buyers back from Y toward 3 to bring the mix back into balance.
Interestingly, Model 3 prices were adjusted down again with the Model 3 RWD, Tesla’s cheapest vehicle, now starting at $43,490 – down $500.
Tesla is still not listing the price of the Model 3 Long Range or letting people order it. The automaker has previously said that the demand was too high for the vehicle – hence why it stopped taking orders.
However, we also know that Tesla is about to update the Model 3, which could explain the stop on new orders and the further price decrease as people might be reticent about placing a new order knowing that it might be updated soon.
Model 3 Performance is still the same price as it was before this latest price adjustment.

2023/02/03,"Car rental giant Avis just sent an email out today to its customers to let that it has new rental terms and conditions for its fleet EVs. Some of the company’s EV rules are a bit of a head scratcher.
Here’s what the email said:
As we introduce Electric Vehicles to our fleet, our rental terms have been amended. To accommodate our expanding vehicle inventory, this amends the agreement signed by you with respect to the rental of a vehicle powered by an electric motor (an “EV”). Our updated terms can be found here.
Note that these were sent out by Avis Canada, but the rental terms and conditions are for both the United States and Canada.
I’ve pasted the seven-plus points terms included in the EV section below, and my comments are after each point, in bolded italics:
39. ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) TERMS. This EV Amendment amends the rental agreement signed by you with respect to the rental of a vehicle powered by an electric motor (an “EV”) from Avis Rent A Car System, LLC, Aviscar, Inc., or any Avis Rent A Car System, LLC, affiliate, or the independent Avis Rent A Car System, LLC, licensee identified on the rental agreement (collectively referred to herein as “Avis”).
Boilerplate text. All good. Next.
1) AMENDMENT TO RENTAL AGREEMENT: This EV Amendment simultaneously amends the terms of your rental from Avis with respect to the terms herein only.  All other terms of your rental remain in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this EV Amendment and your other rental terms, the terms of this EV Amendment shall govern.
More boilerplate. Nothing to see here.
2) ONE WAY RENTALS ARE NOT PERMITTED:  Due to unique infrastructure needs associated with EV’s, your EV must be returned to your rental location on the date/time specified in your rental terms.  If your EV is not returned to the renting location, all costs incurred in transporting your EV back to the renting location will be assessed to you.  In addition, you will be assessed a fee for Avis’ loss of use of the EV between the time that you should have returned the EV to the renting location and the time that it is returned to the renting location up to a maximum of thirty (30) days. The loss of use fee will be your daily rental rate.
“Unique infrastructure needs.” LOL.
At the end of January, a couple of us at Electrek received a PR announcement announcing that Avis was launching a “significant number of EV charging stations at the George Bush International Airport in Houston” with EverCharge. The EV charging stations will “only be used by the Avis and Budget fleets of EVs and PHEVs available for rent” at Houston airport.
I asked, “How many EVs does Avis have for rent across the US, and which makes and models?” And got the reply: “Avis is not commenting on the specifics of its fleet at this time.”
Bummer, because Hertz sure is commenting, and with Tom Brady to boot.
I asked the spokesperson how many EV charging stations Avis is installing at Houston airport, and they wouldn’t tell me – they only said that both DC and Level 2 are being put in. 
I asked what the rollout plan is for other North American airports, and got the reply: 
Following the launch at the Houston airport, Avis and EverCharge plan to extend the partnership to additional airport locations this year.
So, based on the above information, it would appear that the reason why a car rental customer has to return the EV to the original rental location – in this case, airports – is because Avis doesn’t have enough EV charging infrastructure yet. 
I get that this is a growing pains issue, but simply, it isn’t very practical. Not everyone returns to the place where they rented a car.
Maybe Avis should have installed more EV charging infrastructure before it rolled out its unknown quantity of EVs. 
One can currently rent a Tesla Model 3 from Avis in seven US states – all in the West. It’s kind of silly that one can’t drive between those locations without having to return to home base.
3) BATTERY CHARGING LEVELS AT VEHICLE CHECK OUT: Avis will rent the EV with at least a 70% charge on the battery.  The range of your EV will vary based on a number of factors including vehicle load, driver’s actions such as speed and acceleration, climate and terrain factors such as inclines.  Avis does not warrant or guarantee the range of an EV.
Why 70%? The ideal topped-up charge level is 80%. If Avis has EV chargers at its rental locations, then it should charge them to 80%. 
And Avis ought to print up a helpful document, or give renters a QR code, so they can read about why and how vehicle load, speed, and acceleration affect charge. Let’s not say there are factors without explaining them.
4) BATTERY CHARGING LEVELS AT VEHICLE RETURN:   Your EV must be returned to Avis with a battery charge level of at least 70%.  If returned at less than 70% but more than 10% battery charge level, a charging fee of $35 will be assessed to you.  If returned with less than a 10% battery charge level, you will be assessed an additional low charge fee of $35 (a total of $70 charging fees if returned with a battery charge of less than 10%). The charging fee is based on the kilowatt hours, overhead, loss of use of the EV and administrative costs Avis incurs in charging the vehicle.  Note:  fees assessed in the United States refer to U.S. dollars and fees assessed in Canada refer to Canadian dollars.
A $35 car charging fee is a bit steep. Let’s say a driver returns the car with 50% charge – the amount of money to bring it to 70% would be around US $5 at the most.
An 80kwh Tesla battery x 20c/kwh (high estimate) = $16 assuming 0-100% charge.
But I guess this is like when you bring a gas car back empty without prior arrangements, and car rental companies charge you a really high fill-up fee. And if Avis has DC chargers, then they won’t have to wait long to charge up a car that has a battery charge level of less than 70%. 
5) ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE:   Roadside assistance is available for your EV but fuel cannot be delivered to EV’s.   If you require roadside service because you depleted your EV’s batteries, your EV will be towed to your renting location and the towing expense will be assessed to you.   If you require another vehicle due to a breakdown, you may be provided a gasoline powered vehicle in which case, all fuel provisions of your rental terms shall apply with respect to your replacement vehicle.
“Fuel cannot be delivered to EVs” – heehee. Love it. It would be cool if Avis invested in some mobile EV charging trucks to make up for the fact that they don’t actually have enough EV charging infrastructure yet to service their EV fleets.
Why can’t the EV be towed to the nearest Tesla Supercharger or Electrify America or similar? Why does it have to go all the way back to the renting location? What if the driver is on a road trip? This one definitely qualifies as weird. This may scare some people off who wanted to try an EV for the first time.
6) SPECIAL EV EQUIPMENT:  All EV equipment including, but not limited to, charging equipment, keys, key cards, fobs and/or remote (“EV Equipment”) provided with your EV must be returned.  The full replacement cost of any EV Equipment not returned with your EV will be charged to you.  LDW, even if elected, does not cover EV Equipment.
Maybe this is a legal thing, but surely it would be common sense that keys, key cards, and fobs would have to be returned, much like any gas rental car? Perhaps Avis has experienced some customers throwing away key cards because they think they’re like hotel key cards? At any rate, I’d be pretty annoyed if I was an Avis employee and customers kept throwing away the key cards, so fair enough. Fobs is a bit of an overstretch. I guess they just had to mention them to cover backs. 
7) UNIQUE TESLA TERMS:  If you rented a Tesla EV, you will be able to access Tesla Superchargers, subject to availability, to recharge Tesla vehicles provided, however: 1) any fees, charges and/or costs to access and utilize the Tesla Superchargers shall be your responsibility; 2) any Tesla “idle fees”, as defined and charged by Tesla, shall be your responsibility (see Tesla’s website for details https://www.tesla.com/support/supercharger-idle-fee); and 3) the provisions of “Battery Charging Levels at Vehicle Return” shall continue to apply to you.
These are fair terms, because they’re essentially Tesla terms 101.
TESLA VEHICLES MAY NOT BE WASHED AT AN AUTOMATIC CAR WASH. ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY AN AUTOMATIC CAR WASH SHALL BE ASSESSED TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE “DAMAGE/LOSS TO THE CAR” PROVISIONS OF YOUR RENTAL TERMS AND WILL NOT BE COVERED BY LDW.
They kind of make sense. On the return charge level, they are covering the time lost to charging more than the KWh.  Same kind of issue if you drop it off somewhere without charging.
I love the bold capital letters for the CAR WASH RULES. One can take Teslas through car washes, but only in touchless car washes. Teslas have Car Wash Mode. 
Maybe Avis decided that putting its Teslas into Car Wash Mode is too complicated for its customers and too much like hard work for its reps to explain how to use the feature to every EV renter? It’s never occurred to me to take a rental car to a car wash, but I’m not fastidious with my cars. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this car wash thing in the comments below.

2023/02/03,"A jury has found Elon Musk not guilty in the case of his tweet about taking Tesla private at $420 a share.
Five years later, this single tweet is still haunting the Tesla CEO.
For those who don’t remember the situation, back in 2018, Musk briefly considered trying to bring Tesla private and disclosed his intentions to investors through a simple tweet.
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that Musk exaggerated and misled shareholders when saying that the funding was “secured” in the tweet:
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Musk went on a campaign against the SEC, calling them names and claiming that they were working for people shorting the electric automaker. But ultimately, Tesla and Musk ended up reaching a settlement with the SEC.
As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down from the role of chairman of the board, and Tesla and Musk had to each pay $20 million in fines.
The CEO presumably didn’t want Tesla to have to pay for his issue with the SEC. While he couldn’t directly pay for Tesla’s part of the fine, he decided to buy $20 million worth of shares from Tesla. That way, he sort of indirectly ended up paying for Tesla’s fine – though he also ended up with ~71,000 additional Tesla shares in the process.
As we previously reported, Musk ended up actually making money from the settlement due to Tesla’s stock price surging.
Another part of the settlement was that Musk and Tesla had to agree for the former to have his tweets reviewed by the latter’s legal department if they are material to the company.
Musk has consistently denied any wrongdoings and claimed he settled with the SEC under pressure from Tesla investors.
Separately, Tesla investors have sued Musk personally over the tweet, claiming that they were defrauded of millions of dollars as Musk exaggerated the claim that funding was secured.
The case was ongoing for years, but it was finally heard by a jury in northern California last week.
Today, the jury released its verdict – finding Musk not liable for the investors’ losses.
Musk commented on the verdict:
Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed! I am deeply appreciative of the jury’s unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.
That’s probably the end of this saga – though Musk is still fighting some of the aspects of his settlement with the SEC, primarily the need to review his tweets that are material to Tesla’s stock.
That’s probably the right thing. 
Weirdly the stock actually went up after the tweet .. so it was never Tesla stock holders who were affected by the tweet .. they made money!  So what was the issue?  Short sellers (who borrow stock hoping the price goes down) lost money as they had to cover their positions at a higher price point.  No share-holder lost money.  
As we previously reported, all the evidence pointed to Musk being a bit too excited and jumping the gun with the tweet.
For him to be found liable, they would have to prove that he was intentionally planning to defraud investors, and that’s a tall task. 
He certainly should be more cautious about tweeting things like that when no deal has been signed, but I don’t think it’s fraud. 
However, you’d hope that he would have become more cautious about his tweeting after this entire saga, but we haven’t seen much evidence of that either.

2023/02/03,"Tesla Model Y, which is undoubtedly the most important EV this year, has gained full access to the $7,500 federal tax credit with a new $80,000 price limit.
With the new year, the US Treasury released the full list of electric vehicles eligible for the new $7,500 tax credit.
At the time, we noted that there were some inconsistencies on the eligibility for the SUVs. The type of vehicle is significant, since it determines a price limit to be eligible for the tax credit.
SUVs and pickup trucks have a higher MSRP limit of $80,000 instead of $55,000 for all other vehicles.
We noted that the Tesla Model Y only qualified with a seven-seat configuration and other SUVs, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, also weren’t considered SUVs, according to the IRS list.
That’s despite the VW ID.4, which has about the same size as the Model Y and Mach-E, being considered an SUV and getting access to the tax credit for a price of up to $80,000.
It appears that the IRS defines an SUV only by the vehicle’s GVWR or Gross Vehicle Weight Rating, which appears to need to be over 6,000 lbs to be considered an SUV. There might also be some other criteria that the IRS hasn’t shared because, again, there are some inconsistencies in the list if it’s just based on weight.
Many EV enthusiasts are seeing this as a major mistake since it goes against the purpose of the program, which is to encourage sales of more efficient vehicles. Vehicles with lighter weights are more efficient. There are several SUVs that have less cargo space than the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E that are considered SUVs in the program, like the BMW X5 plug-in and Jeep Wrangler plug-in.
It seems to be a major faux pas by the IRS, especially when it comes to the Model Y, which is going to be the most crucial electric vehicle this year as it is expected to have a global production capacity of over 1 million units.
Today, the IRS updated its list of eligible EVs and fixed its mistake by making all versions of the Model Y eligible up to $80,000 MSRP:
No more need for Musk to keep the Model Y under $55,000. Watch the price start going up again.
This should significantly increase access to the Model Y for people who are eligible to the tax credit in the US, meaning single fillers with an income of $150,000 or lower and dual fillers with an income of $300,000 or lower.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E has also gained full eligibility up to $80,000:
Again, these eligibilities for the full $7,500 credits are good until March when we are expecting new guidelines about the battery requirements, which should affect eligibility.
But for now, it’s good news all around. The IRS is clearly trying to do the right thing.

2023/02/02,"A Tesla Cybertruck prototype, likely a new beta build based on updated features, has been spotted ahead of the electric pickup truck’s production start.
For a vehicle that is expected to go into production in just a few months, prototypes of the Cybertruck have been rarely spotted being tested in the wild.
As far as we know, Tesla only had two or three Cybertruck prototypes until recently.
During a conference call following the release of its Q4 2022 financial results last week, Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering at Tesla, confirmed that Tesla built a fleet of new Cybertruck Beta prototypes.
Moravy said about Tesla’s Cybertruck production:
We’ve started installation of all the production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops. We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said, the ramp will really come 2024.
Now we are bound to see some of those Beta builds driving around, and it looks like the first one was spotted yesterday.
Flavio Tronzano posted on Instagram a Tesla Cybertruck spotted in Palo Alto yesterday:
While it’s hard to confirm that this is a new beta prototype, there are some features pointing to it.
For example, this Cybertruck features new side mirrors in a triangular shape.
Of course, Tesla’s hope was to offer the Cybertruck without side mirrors and instead use cameras that feed into screens inside the electric pickup truck, but regulations in the US prevent that. The lack of side mirrors can significantly improve aerodynamic performance, resulting in improved efficiency and longer range.
Just a quick observation, but those side mirrors look way too small to be useful for a full-size truck, let alone one that will be used for towing.
CEO Elon Musk has previously talked about Tesla potentially delivering the truck with removable side mirrors and letting owners decide.
A post shared by Flavio Tronzano (@ftronz)
The Cybertruck in the picture also appears to have a working tonneau cover, which was not seen on the last prototype. The same goes for what appears to be a working side window. 
Tesla recently said that it aims to bring the Cybertruck to production this summer, but we shouldn’t expect significant deliveries until 2024, when the automaker will ramp up to volume production.
In the meantime, we should expect to spot more Cybertruck beta prototypes in the wild. If you spot one, don’t hesitate to send your sightings our way at fred@electrek.co.

2023/02/02,"Tesla has the highest customer retention rate, and the industry should worry because they will have issues getting EV buyers back.
S&P Global released an interesting new research paper about “nomad” car buyers, which are described as people who buy a car brand for the first time and return to the market after:
Most automotive customers who are new to a brand often leave for yet another brand when they return to market. In fact, more than half of these “Nomads” make a habit of it.
The report also describes a subset of nomads called “one and done”:
Nomads who own a brand once and leave are also known as ‘One and Done’ – about 58 percent of Nomads left their brand in the 12 months ending July 2022. That’s the highest ‘One and Done’ rate (defection rate of Nomads) in at least 10 years, according to data analysis by S&P Global Mobility.
In the paper looking at how these buyers are reacting to the current market, S&P Global found a clear leader: Tesla.
Obviously, as a newer brand, Tesla would have more first-time owner, but it’s its ability to retain those owners that is so impressive:
While Tesla’s high share of first-time owners (83%) isn’t too surprising, their ability to keep those new customers is extraordinary. Tesla’s ‘One and Done’ rate is just 39% compared to 58% for the industry (remember, a lower number is better in this case). The next-best ‘One and Done’ rate goes to Ford at 50%. However, Nomad share of Ford’s return-to-market households in less than half of Tesla’s.
Tesla dominates loyalty metrics for this important nomad segment of car buyers according to the study:
Tesla has previously topped the list of the most satisfied customers in the auto industry and has proven to lead in customer retention – not just for nomad buyers.
The rest of the auto industry should really take note here. Tesla is far from perfect and it has issues, but there are quite a few aspects to Tesla’s products and business that will make it hard for customers to go back to other brands.
For people who bought a Tesla for what it actually is, I find it hard to imagine what other car those people would buy next. I owned Ford, Audi (2x), Volkswagen (2x) and BMW, and bought a Model 3 in 2019. This is the car I'm still driving now, and it's also the car I kept the longest so far. With now 60,000 mi, it still feels like a ""new"" car to me, mainly because of constant OTA updates - which is the one thing that in retrospect adds most value over other brands.
I am talking about things like the Supercharger network, the user interface, the frequent new features through software updates, and the direct-to-consumer sales, rather than going through third-party franchise dealers.
This should be an important concern to other brands because at the same time, Tesla is delivering electric vehicles in higher volumes than anybody else – conquering the EV buyers en masse.
The combination of volume and brand loyalty is going to make it hard for other brands to take buyers away from Tesla when they are themselves ready to deliver electric vehicles in volume, which is still a few years away for most major automakers.
Many industry analysts are having issues understanding how Tesla can believe it can deliver 20 million vehicles per year starting in 2030, but if this trend continues, I can definitely see it happening.

2023/02/01,"The US needs to more than double the number of EV charging stations that currently meet minimum federal funding requirements in order to make long-distance EV road trips seamless, according to a new road map and analysis from low-carbon energy startup Carbon Solutions and energy nonprofit Great Plains Institute (GPI).
The Federal Highway Administration’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program allocates $5 billion to the states to create a US-wide, interconnected network of DC fast chargers along the National Highway Systems. 
The NEVI Formula Program is part of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law by US President Joe Biden in November 2021.
There are currently 4,943 existing public fast chargers in the US that aren’t Tesla’s. And out of those non-Tesla fast chargers, there are just 509 that comply with The NEVI Formula Program. 
So that means that the United States needs to add at least 1,104 additional new fast-charging EV stations to a nationwide network that can support seamless long-distance EV travel – and are NEVI compliant.
In order to be NEVI compliant, EV charging stations must include at least four ports with connectors capable of simultaneously charging four EVs at 150 kilowatts (kW) each, with a total station power capacity of 600kW or more. 
They must also be located within one travel mile of a designated EV Alternative Fuel Corridor. Compliant stations must be spaced no more than 50 miles apart along a designated corridor for the corridor to be certified as NEVI-compliant.
Carbon Solutions developed a network-tracing analysis using real driving distances to measure real access to existing and proposed charging stations:
Kellen Schefter, senior director of electric transportation at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents all US investor-owned electric companies, said:
A foundational build-out of EV fast charging infrastructure is critical to providing drivers with the confidence they need to make the switch to an EV.
This road map provides the clearest view yet of the gaps in the national EV fast-charging network. We are eager to use this tool with our member electric companies, as well as with states and other stakeholders, as we work together to plan for the infrastructure needed to provide reliable and accessible EV fast charging.
The study reports that estimated equipment installation costs would be a minimum range of $794 million to $1.3 billion.
This study is super exciting for all EV drivers. Who doesn’t want to see DC fast chargers sited 50 miles apart on EV Alternative Fuel Corridors? And the NEVI requirements are what we all want anyway – at least four chargers available at at least 150 kW each, and we want them to be reliable and easily accessible.
I have an ID.4 and a Model 3. I get from A to B, but I have to work a little harder to charge up the latter. (The Tesla Supercharger network makes charging a piece of cake on road trips.)
I recently had to leave the interstate, go two miles to a parking garage near Boston, and use my credit card to get into said garage (I wasn’t charged, but still), and had to drive in a spiral to find the 150 kW Electrify America chargers, which were in a dark corner. Give me a break. 
I want to charge my ID.4 with the ease that I charge my Model 3, and then some. Knowing that there’s a fast charger available every 50 miles sounds like perfection. 
And thanks to the NEVI Formula Program, the money’s there.
The quality of chargers is more important than the quantity of chargers.  If you can't count on a charger working on a road trip, it might as well not exist.
Here’s the map, literally, so let’s get these DC fast chargers installed asap. If you build them, they will come.

2023/02/01,"Tesla Model S has broken the winter range record in a new wide-ranging cold weather range test conducted in Norway.
For years now, Norway has been conducting extensive range and efficiency tests in cold weather, which is a concern for many potential EV buyers living in regions with harsh winters.
This year’s test was the most extensive to date with 29 different EV models.
The Tesla Model S stole the show this year.
After not being sold in Europe for almost two years following a design refresh, The Model S joined the winter range test, and it did phenomenally.
The tests were conducted on this loop between Oslo and Hjerkinn at temperatures between -5C and -10C (via Norway’s Motor.no):
The Model S – which finished at 530km (329 miles), only 16.40% short of its advertised 634 km WLTP range – is the only vehicle on the list that passed 450 km (280 miles). 
This is much better than most other vehicles tested, which saw their range affected closer to 20-30% by the cold weather.
The Mercedes EQE 300 is the closest competitor to the Tesla Model S that was tested, and it saw a massive 33% deviation from its advertised range.
Here are all the results for every EV model tested in the winter range test:
What is the actual reason (e.g. battery management, type of cell density) that Teslas consistently still outperform? I'll take an answer from anyone who knows. Thanks.

These test results have come at a pretty good time for people in the Northeast in North America since we are expecting a massive cold front here in the coming days.
The results are what you should probably expect at -5C to -10C (14F), but this weekend we are going to experience -33C where I am in Shawinigan, Quebec. That’s -24F.
At these extreme cold temperature, you can expect closer to 40% drop in range – even in the latest Tesla Model S. But that’s not just an electric vehicle thing. Every car is less efficient in extreme cold.
Be careful out there this weekend. Frostbite is a real thing.

2023/02/01,"Tesla Roadster, credited by some for launching the EV revolution, is turning 15 years old today. While we celebrate the original Roadster, there’s still no sign of the new version that Tesla promised.
While the Tesla Roadster wasn’t exactly a successful vehicle program on its own, it did succeed in its goal to show that you can have a compelling electric vehicle that can compete with gas-powered cars in its segment – sports cars, in this case.
As a vehicle program it didn’t turn out great, with only about 2,000 units produced and the early production batches having to be worked on a lot as Tesla failed to successfully merge technologies from early partners AC Propulsion and Lotus.
After those first few difficult batches in 2008 and 2009, Tesla started to hit its stride and made many happy costumers with the Roadster; many of them are still using their vehicles more than a decade latter.
Today, Tesla celebrated the 15th anniversary of the first Tesla Roadster deliveries:
15 years ago today, we delivered the first Tesla Roadster → https://t.co/O8FipJIjAc pic.twitter.com/A0EfkufDbS
It’s truly a day to celebrate for EV enthusiasts since there’s a strong argument to be made that the original Tesla Roadster launched the resurgence of electric vehicles in the 2000s after the last attempt to revive the technology died in the 1990s.
It also launched Tesla into the EV powerhouse that it is today. Again, the program itself wasn’t super successful, but Tesla learned a lot from the original Roadster and it used that knowledge to build the Model S, which was its first vehicle built by itself from the ground up.
The rest is history.
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, it surprised many, but the reason made sense. Tesla now wanted to unveil a “halo car” that would clearly show that if you want to have the best car possible, it has to be electric.
At the time of the unveiling in 2017, CEO Elon Musk said that it would come to market in 2020.
Tesla started taking reservations at the unveiling event for the impressive electric supercar that goes zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds with over 600 miles of range. People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.
The vehicle program was later delayed, and the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.
In 2020, Musk hinted at the Tesla Roadster being delayed until 2022 as the automaker focuses on the Cybertruck.
In 2021, the CEO confirmed that the new vehicle will indeed not come to market until 2022.
Later, Musk confirmed that it is now delayed until at least 2023. Furthermore, the CEO said that its arrival will depend on how much “drama” Tesla goes through in 2022.
We haven’t heard much from Tesla about the Roadster, but Tesla still lists the production as “in development” at a location “to be determined”:
I am huge fan of the original Roadster, and I’m in the camp that gives it a lot of credit for launching the EV revolution. I think that without it, we would probably be 5-10 years behind where we are now.
I test drove the original Roadster back in early 2000’s, and it’s exhilarating performance was an eye-opener, and hooked me on Tesla EVs. Although I couldn’t afford one back then, it was the reason I lined up to buy a Model 3 in 2018 (sight unseen) behind 100,000 others, and since life has been good to me, later buy a Plaid. What a rush!
As for the new Roadster, I understand why it’s not a priority for Tesla; high volume EV programs are more important. 
However, the mission of a “halo car” is still important in my opinion, and Tesla did use the vehicle to save the company in 2018-2019. It was a difficult time for the company and using the Roadster as part of its referral program helped create a ton of publicity for Tesla.
Five years later, the vehicle program is still delayed even though Tesla took millions of dollars in deposit for the vehicle and promised it as a reward to many Tesla enthusiasts who help promote the company. 
At the very least, Tesla should be more transparent about what is happening with the Roadster program. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.

2023/02/01,"A new report states that Tesla plans to ramp up electric vehicle production at Gigafactory Shanghai to 20,000 units per week after a surge in orders.
After years of claiming that demand was exceeding production capacity, we have seen plenty of evidence late last year that Tesla was starting to have some more serious demand issues.
However, Tesla countered that last month with significant price cuts across its entire lineup in all markets.
The price reductions appear to have worked, as there have been many reports of Tesla’s demand surging in several markets following the adjustment.
In China, there have been rumors that before the price cuts, Tesla has been throttling production output at Gigafactory Shanghai, which is Tesla’s most productive and profitable factory.
Tesla has disputed some of those reports, but the output has gone down in the last few months of the year from a high of over 80,000 units in September.
Now Reuters reports that Tesla is planning to ramp up production at Gigafactory Shanghai following a surge of orders due to the price reductions.
The publication is basing the report on a “planning memo” that it claims to have seen. Reuters reported:
The automaker plans to produce a weekly average of nearly 20,000 units at its Shanghai factory in February and March, according to the memo, which detailed output plans for Tesla’s most productive and profitable manufacturing hub.
""... output has gone down in the last few months of the year from a high of over 80,000 units in September.""

The high was 87.7k in October. November rate was slightly higher, but one fewer day resulted in 86.7k for the month. December was the only down month at 58.8k. January will probably be even lower.

Returning to the previous 20k/week isn't really what I'd call a ""ramp up"", but it does indicate the price cuts worked as planned.
The surge in orders justifying this alleged production ramp could come from China, but Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai also exports vehicles to other APAC markets and in Europe.
As I have previously stated, we need to be careful with Reuters’ Tesla reporting. They have had a lot of false and misleading reports about Tesla over the last year. 
In this case, they do mention actually seeing a “planning memo” from Tesla, which does give a bit more credibility, but I would still take the report with a grain of salt.
With that said, it makes sense that Tesla’s price cuts would create a surge in orders big enough to justify ramping Shanghai back to full capacity.

2023/01/31,"Tesla is going to build an assembly factory in Mexico City, according to a representative of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
The new rumored factory is apparently on top of the rumored factory in Nuevo León, Mexico.
Last year, we reported on Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk confirming that Tesla is considering sites for a new factory in Canada, Mexico, and the United States when discussing Tesla’s next plant in North America.
In October, rumors of a Tesla factory in Mexico ramped up as Musk visited the state and met with the governor. Local media reported that Tesla was particularly interested in a location in Santa Catarina, a municipality just outside of Monterrey in Nuevo León. 
Following the visit, the government confirmed discussions of a possible investment in the state.
In December, a deal to bring a Tesla factory to Mexico was reportedly achieved with an announcement expected within the month. By the end of the month, government officials claimed that an announcement from Tesla was imminent, but a month later, we haven’t heard back.
Now a different government official working directly with President López Obrador claims that Tesla is going to build a different factory next to Mexico City.
Mexican presidential spokesperson Jesus Ramirez said that Tesla is looking to invest in the new business hub project promoted by the president just 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the new Felipe Ángeles International Airport (AIFA).
Ramirez told a local paper:
Tesla will invest there … in an assembly plant, to export directly by air.
I thought maybe shipping with Electric planes? However its about 725 miles by air from AIFA to Austin airport, so there would need to be many charging spots in between as the largest electric cargo planes have 200 miles of range. Still much cheaper to ship via Semi, although I wish we saw more train shipping. 
The Mexican government confirmed that Tesla visited the site, and while Ramirez seemed to say that it was a done deal, we heard the same about the Nuevo León project before.
While this comes from the top and appears to be a done deal, I’d still take it with a grain of salt since we have been burned by Mexican officials before.
It’s also surprising that they would mention an “assembly plant” and shipping by air.
That hasn’t been Tesla’s way of operating in the past, but I’m keeping an open mind. We will keep an eye out for the potential project.

2023/01/31,"Tesla confirmed that it grew its headcount by 29,000 employees last year despite waves of layoffs in 2022.
2022 has been a tough year for Tesla employees.
They faced waves of layoffs, and the stock price plummeted, which negatively affected their stock options, an important part of their compensation.
Despite the layoffs, Tesla has still grown its employee headcount considerably in 2022.
Today, the company confirmed it with the release of its 10-K SEC filing:
Our greatest asset is our people and we continue to attract the best and brightest with our competitive pay and benefits package which starts with ownership. We offer employees the opportunity to receive equity during their employment and share in the success of Tesla. As of December 31, 2022, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries’ employees worldwide was 127,855, a 29,000 year-over-year increase.
Tesla confirmed that it has now just short of 128,000 employees, adding 29,000 workers in 2022.
The headcount is starting to approach those of competitors like GM and Ford, which produce a lot more vehicles overall.
However, the comparison is not a great one since on top of having several businesses outside of making cars, Tesla’s automotive business also doesn’t compare well to Ford and GM’s since Tesla owns its entire service and distribution network while other automakers use third-party franchise dealers.
The automaker has a lot of employees working in sales, service, and deliveries that other automakers don’t have.
But a lot of Tesla’s growth in 2022 actually came from its new factories in Berlin and Austin. Tesla is trying to hire as many as 10,000 workers at each of those factories, and the projects weren’t subject to the automaker’s hiring freezes last year.
Unless there’s a significant economic downturn, Tesla’s growth is expected to continue at a high rate as the automaker aims to raise production to 20 million vehicles by the end of the decade, which would require eight additional Gigafactories.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/01/31,"Tesla confirmed that it still holds Bitcoin, but it sold a lot of them and took a $200 million loss because of the cryptocurrency.
Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that it was not selling its stake in Bitcoin and that it planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network showed a higher mix of renewable energy.
A year after the initial investment, Tesla’s Bitcoin holding increased to $2 billion.
Tesla’s Bitcoin ‘loss’ isn’t quite what it appears. As I understand it, accounting rules require the recording of an impairment loss equal to the lowest market value of the Bitcoin during the quarter. So if by the end of Q4 the price was $23k, but at some point in the quarter it hit a low of $16.5k, then they have to mark to the market the value of their Bitcoin at the lowest price it hit during the quarter. 
The cryptocurrency has since lost much of its value and the automaker’s position suffered greatly, but Tesla also sold gradually throughout the drop – avoiding a lot of the downturn.
With the release of its 10-K annual financial filing with the SEC today, Tesla has released more details about what it has referred to as a “restructuring of its digital assets.”
The company wrote in the filing:
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased and/or received an immaterial amount and $1.50 billion, respectively, of digital assets. As of December 31, 2022, we have converted approximately 75% of our purchases into fiat currency. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $204 million and $101 million of impairment losses on such digital assets, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we realized gains of $64 million and $128 million, respectively, in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our digital assets held was $184 million and $1.26 billion, which reflects cumulative impairments of $204 million and $101 million, each period, respectively. The fair market value of such digital assets held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $191 million and $1.99 billion, respectively.
In short, Tesla sold most of its Bitcoin in 2022, but it still holds about $184 million worth of Bitcoin while taking an impairment loss of $204 million in 2022.

2023/01/31,"Tesla continues the gradual opening of its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles – now with a few stations in Australia.
The timing of the launch of the pilot program in North America is still unknown.
Over the last year, Tesla has been working to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles.
In Europe, Tesla has already opened hundreds of stations in most countries it operates in. It gradually added more countries to what it calls a “pilot program” for non-Tesla EVs on its Supercharger network and has added more stations over the last 18 months. 
The automaker indicated that it planned to do the same by the end of 2022 in North America, but it has yet to do it.
Tesla has been focusing its efforts on markets where its vehicles and its Supercharger network already use the CCS connector and protocol (CCS2 in particular), which is virtually everywhere except for North America and China.
Today, Tesla confirmed that it is expanding the pilot program outside of Europe – starting with some stations in Australia:
Select Superchargers in Australia are now open to all electric vehicles → https://t.co/DwPxc1e9D4 pic.twitter.com/XF2mrBaxI9
The NSW state government has offered to help finance the installation of Superchargers but ONLY if access is available to all EVs. This is driving the change in this one state.
The automaker is starting slow, with only five stations opened to non-Tesla EVs in New South Wales:
The stations appear to be not the most popular ones since they are not near densely populated areas or along highways between populated areas.
Tesla says that it is still testing the user experience for both non-Tesla EV owners new to the network and current Tesla owners who will experience more traffic at Tesla charging stations – hence why the automaker is not opening the Supercharger network as a whole in those markets.
As for the North American market, we believe that the launch of the pilot program is getting close, as we recently learned of the solution that Tesla plans for the problem of using a different connector in the market.

2023/01/30,"A Tesla Megapack-powered microgrid in Northern California has helped keep an airport and US Coast Guard station, described as a lifeline for the region, powered during natural disasters.
Natural disasters such as earthquakes and winter storms can cause power outages, leaving communities without access to essential services. In the event of such occurrences, it is important to have backup power systems in place to ensure continuity of operations. This is exactly what the clean energy microgrid at the Arcata Airport and the US Coast Guard Station in Humboldt County, California, has done.
The microgrid consists of a 2.2 MW solar array system and a 2.3 MW/9 MWh energy storage system that is made of three Tesla Megapacks.
Megapack is quickly becoming the go-to energy storage solution for large-scale energy storage projects.
As we recently reported, Tesla has deployed a record 6.5 GWh of energy storage capacity last year – a new record primarily thanks to a ramp-up in Megapacks.
The Megapack-powered microgrid in Humboldt County had a significant test late last year in the immediate aftermath of the early morning magnitude 6.4 earthquake centered in Ferndale. It let thousands of PG&E customers in the Humboldt area go without power.
But the microgrid has kept its 19 customers online, including the Arcata-Eureka Airport and the adjacent US Coast Guard Air Base, which are critical to the region, especially in a natural disaster.
Dana Boudreau, director of infrastructure planning and operations, Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA), commented:
RCEA is the local government owner-operator of the microgrid generation system and while we didn’t expect such rigorous real-world testing this winter, the system exceeded expectations. During a significant earthquake and multiple major storms, the microgrid reliably delivered power during grid outages so that our regional airport and coast guard could focus on their core missions. RCEA will continue efforts to prepare our region for future challenges and help our essential services to stay online when they are most needed.
According to RCEA, the Megapack-powered microgrid again proved itself useful in the last month as several usual winter storms hit Northern California.
The system islanded on several occasions including an eight-hour stretch on January 4.

2023/01/30,"Tesla has burst into the top 10 best-selling cars in the world with not just one but two models in 2022. It’s something that the industry should be scared of, as manufacturing electric vehicles in volume becomes clearly disruptive.
It’s hard to argue against the fact that electric vehicles are taking over. 
Their market shares are rising slowly but steadily in most markets, and while they still account for a small fraction of new car sales, there are a few tidbits of data that point clearly to EVs taking over the industry faster than people think.
A market like Norway is a good example and window into the future of the broader auto industry with now over 80% of new cars sales being electric, and fossil fuel-powered vehicle sales have slowed to a crawl.
Another good example is the fact that all the fastest-growing car models are electric, and they are now even reaching the top 10 best-selling vehicles in the world.
According to data compiled by Focus to Move, electric vehicles, more specifically the Tesla Model Y and Model 3, have entered the top 10 best-selling electric vehicles in the world:
As you can see, Toyota remains dominant with three models within the top five best-selling passenger vehicles in the world.
However, every single model in the top 10 is down year-over-year except for Tesla’s two vehicles. 
On top of it, by revenue, the Tesla Model Y takes the first stop since it averaged a sale price of over $55,000 for most of the year.
The auto industry should take this seriously. It wasn’t that long ago that, aside for the more savvy people in the auto industry, Tesla was mostly a joke to auto execs. They would literally laugh at Tesla and its effort to build electric vehicles in volume.
Now a few years later, Tesla has not one but two models in the top 10 list of best-selling passenger vehicles in the world.
Amazing how no one realizes that the Tesla numbers in the table don't add up.

According to the table, the Tesla Model Y had 759k deliveries in 2022, and the Model 3, 596k.

Adding both together, we get 1.355 million units.

But according to Tesla's own numbers, they delivered 1.31 million units in 2022, including Tesla Model S and Model X...
And Model Y is on a very clear path to becoming the number-one-selling vehicle in the world this year.
All the while, every other single best-selling vehicle finds itself down year-over-year.
It proves that if you can produce a compelling electric vehicle in volume, not only is there a market for it, but it is taking over the industry.
With Toyota still not having a global all-electric vehicle produced in volume, I think it will be completely knocked off that list by 2025.

2023/01/27,"Elon Musk has met today with top Biden administration officials over electrification goals and amid tensions between Musk, Tesla, and the administration.
There have been a lot of tensions between the Biden administration, Tesla, its CEO Musk, and Musk’s fans. 
The first major blow seems to have been the ceremony where President Biden signed a new executive order for 50% of new cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2030.
Tesla wasn’t invited, and both Musk and many Tesla fans took offense. However, the event was about US automakers, like Ford and GM, committing to go 50% electric by 2030. Tesla is already all-electric.
But then the Biden administration, influenced by the United Auto Workers union, pushed for reform of the electric vehicle tax credit to include an additional $4,500 credit per electric vehicle produced at a unionized factory.
Some Tesla fans saw this as an attack on Tesla since the company is the biggest US producer of electric vehicles and its workforce is not unionized. Musk later called out Biden for “being controlled by unions.”
Things started to escalate from there when President Biden made the undoubtedly ridiculous statement that gave GM CEO Mary Barra credit for “electrifying the entire auto industry.” Biden and his administration have since made several similar claims and appeared to have an issue even mentioning Tesla when it came to electric vehicles, despite the company being the biggest electric vehicle producer in the country and a big part of the administration’s plans to lower emissions.
Musk also didn’t help by calling the Democratic Party the “party of hate” and asking his followers on Twitter to vote Republican during the last election.
I hope the meeting went well and that common goals were identified, then let's see what comes out of it.
Fortunately, tensions have calmed down as Biden eventually acknowledged that Tesla is the leader in electrification in the US and the administration eventually dropped the requirement for union-assembled vehicles in the federal EV tax credit.
Now we’ve learned that Elon Musk has even met with two top Biden administration officials today to discuss “shared goals around electrification.” According to a White House spokesperson:
John Podesta and Mitch Landrieu met with Elon Musk to discuss shared goals around electrification and how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act can advance electric vehicle production and charging as well as the broader cause of electrification.
The meeting comes as Tesla is expected to be one of the top companies benefiting from the new $7,500 federal EV tax credit.
However, Tesla, along with all other automakers, is still waiting for the final guidelines for the battery material requirements that unlocks a large part of the credits. Tesla is expected to be in the best position to benefit fully since most of the battery cells going into its US-built electric vehicles are also built in the US.

2023/01/27,"Tesla’s energy storage business is booming with a record year, but it’s just the beginning as we could see volume hit new records quickly.
With the release of its Q4 2022 financial results, the automaker released its energy division’s deployment number.
Tesla Solar had a good quarter with 100 MW deployed, but the company really shined with its energy storage deployment: Powerwalls and Megapacks.
Tesla confirmed that it deployed a record 2.4 GWh of energy storage in Q4. That’s up 152% year-over-year and 300 MW more than the previous quarter, which was also a massive record.
It brought Tesla’s total deployment for the whole year to an impressive 6.5 GWn – up 64% versus 2021.
Tesla wrote about its energy storage business in its Q4 shareholder’s letter:
Energy storage deployments increased by 152% YoY in Q4 to 2.5 GWh, for a total deployment of 6.5 GWh in 2022, by far the highest level of deployments we have achieved. Demand for our storage products remains in excess of our ability to supply. We are in the process of ramping production at our dedicated 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California to address the growing demand. This factory should help to further accelerate growth of energy storage deployments.
That new factory in California did contribute to the record in Q4, but we learned that the ramp started in the middle of the quarter, which means that the impact will be felt more in 2023 as it takes time from the production of the Megapacks to their deployments at energy storage projects. 
Tesla’s energy storage business is still peanuts compared to Tesla’s automotive business, but it’s growing fast.
""It’s now at over $1 billion a quarter for the first time""

Multiply by 6 when Lathrop is fully ramped, hopefully by the end of the year.  Margins could be as high as 50%, with a waiting list, as of now, of two years.  WS it appears is just becoming aware of that fact.
It’s now at over $1 billion a quarter for the first time, and I think it’s only going to go up. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla ramps up Megafactory to 40 GWh by the end of the and ends up deploying between 15-20 GWh this year. That’s a massive ramp from 6.5 GWh this year.
And I’m not even accounting for Powerwalls, which I think Tesla could be able to produce at a rate of 4 GWh this year.
2023 is going to be a huge year for Tesla’s energy storage business. It’s probably going to be the year that the market starts taking this part of Tesla’s business more seriously as I think the higher volume will come with bigger gross margins too.

2023/01/26,"Elon Musk made new comments about Tesla’s Full Self-Driving effort, saying he believes that only some “smart retail investors” understand the value that Tesla is going to create.
During Tesla’s conference call for the release of its Q4 2022 financial results yesterday, CEO Elon Musk made some comments about Tesla’s self-driving effort.
The CEO claimed that most people are missing the value that he believes Tesla is going to create with Full Self-Driving:
Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot of others maybe don’t – is that every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly. So that’s actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions, only a small percentage of cars don’t have Hardware 3, so that means that there are millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin. And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows. And then, when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet. That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history. Yes.
Musk has previously stated that when Tesla finally delivers on its self-driving promises, it will unlock tens of thousands in value in each Tesla vehicle through the capacity to turn them into robotaxis.
However, the CEO hasn’t mentioned that service in a long time as Tesla missed several previously announced timelines. Now Musk has been mainly focusing comments on improvements to Tesla FSD Beta. He has stayed away from offering a timeline to deliver on the promised capabilities.
I always like to be careful when I talk negatively about Tesla FSD because I do believe that on its own the product is impressive and the people developing it are doing an incredible job – for the most part.
My main problem with the situation is the discrepancy between the current capacity of the product and what Tesla, and more specifically Musk, has been promising for now seven years. There’s that, and there’s the constant moving of the goalpost.
At first, it was 1 million robotaxis by the end of the year, then it was 1 million people on FSD Beta, and now it’s just 400,000 people on FSD Beta and no word on an actually useful full self-driving product.
What Musk doesn’t seem to understand is that every single investor on earth understands that a company delivering full self-driving capability in millions of vehicles would be a massive assets value increase and, yes, potentially the biggest of any in history, as Musk says.
You don’t need to be that smart to understand that.
The doubts that Musk is hearing, and I assume what is leading him to say something like this, are not due to a lack of understanding of the value of self-driving but about whether Tesla will ever deliver that capability on these millions of cars.
Musk and Tesla have lost a lot of credibility on that front due to the previously mentioned missed deadlines and moved goalposts. There’s certainly room for doubts.
The CEO said yesterday that “full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly,” but that’s not my experience after a year of using it in my car, nor is it the experience of most FSD Beta users I know who are not primarily pandering to Musk or trying to justify to themselves having purchased the expensive feature or Tesla stocks.
Musk has been known to block critics on Twitter, and he has surrounded himself with yes-men and sycophants who keep telling him how amazing FSD Beta is.
And again, I think it is amazing that Tesla achieved what it did with FSD Beta if the feature lived in a vacuum without the many promises made. If Tesla had never promised anything and just unveiled this through software updates in its cars, we would all be impressed.
First, let me say that I absolutely want level 5 autonomous cars to become a reality. I’m 74 years old and I know it will get to appoint one day where I will no longer be able to drive myself. I don’t want to give up my freedom or have to depend on someone else to get me around. Unfortunately, the United States has never really developed a decent public transportation system so I’m stuck with a car.

That being said, I haven’t bought the software for our 2017 S or 2022 X. Why? Because it hasn’t been proven to me that it delivers the proposed capabilities. Also, I’m not interested in renting out my car to some stranger who needs a ride home from the bar on Saturday night and might just throw up in the back seat. 

Some other company may succeed before Tesla. I’m willing to be there are other very smart people in the world besides Mr Musk, what’s to say they won’t be first. Spending $15K on FSD is a gamble I’m unwilling to take. Maybe when I can subscribe for a month and the software works as it should, I’ll reconsider.
But compared to the promises of a robotaxi service, it is a disappointing product with no clear path to achieving the company’s promises on the current hardware.
If I go into my Tesla right now and activate FSD Beta, I feel more like a driver-ed instructor trying to teach a confused 16-year-old first-time driver than someone being driven around by a robotaxi. It doesn’t make for a better driving experience.
I’d be OK with that if there were a clear path for Tesla to achieve the robotaxi capability, but with Musk believing that the progress has been incredible when it’s hard to see any meaningful improvement from a user basis over the last year, it’s becoming harder to believe him or to believe in the product.
I think that’s the disconnect between Musk believing people don’t understand the value of self-driving through software updates and people actually starting to have serious doubts about Tesla delivering it.

2023/01/26,"Elon Musk has killed the little hope some had for Tesla in offering a retrofit to the new Autopilot/Self-Driving hardware (HW4) to current Tesla owners.
Tesla is expected to announce a new Autopilot/Self-Driving hardware suite, which has been referred to as Hardware 4.0 (HW4), any day now.
There have been quite a few indications that some major changes are coming. For example, after famously removing radar sensors from its hardware suite, we learned in December that Tesla is planning to add one as soon as this month.
Additionally, we also reported on a Tesla Model 3 prototype that potentially featured a new Autopilot/Full Self-Driving hardware suite.
Finally, a report coming out of China showed that Tesla applied with regulators for some modifications to its vehicles, including new Autopilot cameras.
Engineers' instincts predicted this future when I bought my M3 in 2018.

Never, never, never, never, never pay for unfinished features. Odds are they are unfinished for a reason. Even if they do finish them, it may require big changes to the original design.
Now during Tesla’s conference call for the release of its Q4 2022 financial results, CEO Elon Musk was asked about the potential of Tesla offering retrofits to the new hardware for current Tesla owners, but the CEO shut down the idea:
The cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant. So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
However, he did clarify that he still expects Tesla’s full self-driving promises to be achieved with the current Hardware 3, which should ease some concerns that many owners had.
Musk said during the call:
Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I’m confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the safety of the average human. So how do we get ultimately to – let’s say, for argument’s sake, if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than humans, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%. It will be Hardware 5 beyond that. But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
However, the CEO didn’t discuss Tesla achieving true full self-driving capability that will enable a robotaxi service approved by regulators, which ultimately is what the company has been promising to every Tesla owner since 2016.

2023/01/26,"Tesla has given an update on the Cybertruck production timeline, and those who thought that Tesla could deliver a lot of electric pickup trucks this year are out of luck.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline approached, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023, and in June, Musk said that Tesla is aiming for production to start in mid-2023.
In its communications, Tesla has stuck to a mid-2023 timeline over the last few months, and it is starting to become more real than just words with actual production equipment specific to Cybertruck coming to Gigafactory Texas, and the company started hiring for the production of the electric pickup.
Now during Tesla’s conference call for the release of its Q4 2022 financial results, CEO Elon Musk was asked if Tesla still planned to start production of the Cybertruck this year.
This was his response:
We do expect production to start, I don’t know, maybe sometime this summer. But I always like try to downplay the start of production because the start of production is always very slow. It increases exponentially, but it’s always very slow at first. So I wouldn’t put too much thought in start of production. It’s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that’s next year.
Lars Moravy, vice president of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla, added that the automaker is currently building the production lines, but he also emphasized that the production ramp is planned for next year.
Personally, I’m not too surprised. It’s basically what I’ve been guiding for the last year – meaning no meaningful deliveries of Cybertruck in 2023, just the start of production.
I think what is missing from this article is the fact that the 4680 cell has been the main constraint. It looks like the 4680 Austin Y is about the same weight as 2170 Y and gets less miles per charge. So it would appear there is no weight savings for cell to structure and pack energy density is the same. Only advantage is production complexity but you lose the ability to easily repair, replace, reuse, and recycle. How is this really better?

This would have been an excellent chance to address the elephant in the room that every Tesla Bro refuses to discuss and that is: cell to structure is engineered obsolescence. Provides little to no benefit to the customer and only the manufacturing process. Of course this could lower costs and over all price for customer but now they have a vehicle that requires significantly more work and costs to replace a battery.

But the true elephant in the room is how much harder it will be to recycle the batteries. How do you remove the batteries in a cell to structure? I'm sure you can do it but way harder than a pack that comes out with a few bolts/wire/tubes removed. Massive story here, and everyone pretends like there isn't any elephant in the room.

So in conclusion, the 4680 Austin Y has failed to show any advantage over 2170 other than production complexity is probably much less.

Based on those new comments, I think it’s good not to expect Tesla to deliver more than 5,000 or 10,000 Cybertrucks in 2023.
But as Musk and Moravy pointed out, tracking the ramp is the harder and most important thing.
Considering it generally takes Tesla about just over a year to ramp a new vehicle program to about 5,000 units per week, I think we shouldn’t expect more than 150,000 Cybertruck deliveries in 2024.
I know that many Tesla fans had their hopes up for a quick ramp-up of the Cybertruck, but I think these expectations are a bit more realistic.

2023/01/25,"Elon Musk dismissed a serious question from investors about his negative impact on Tesla’s reputation following his political comments and Twitter acquisition.
He not only dismissed the question but instead responded by bragging about his number of followers.
During Tesla’s Q4 2022 conference call following the release of its financial results, Musk was asked a question about his impact on Tesla’s reputation: 
Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult & YouGov show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division along partisan lines. Such brand damage can impact demand. Does Tesla track favorability and how will any brand damage be mitigated?
The question is a serious one that was requested by over 3,000 Tesla retail investors. Musk decided to dismiss the question with a response that can be best described as douchey.
He started out by literally bragging about how many people are following him on Twitter, as if this is any indicator of his impact on Tesla’s reputation:
Well, let me check my Twitter account (pause as he appears to actually pull out his phone). So I got 127 million followers and it continues to grow rapidly. That suggests that I’m reasonably popular. Now I might not be popular with some people, but for the vast majority of people, my follower count speaks for itself. I have the most interacted social account maybe in the world – certainly on Twitter.
The CEO only mentioned Tesla in his response for a second by making the claim that he “believes Twitter is an incredible [tool] to create demand for Tesla.” He never addressed the actual question, which was about his political comments affecting Tesla. The question never mentioned Twitter. 
The Tesla CEO continued by coming just a hair short of trying to sell Twitter ads to other car companies and asking them to use Twitter more. Again, that’s during a Tesla earnings call, talking to Tesla shareholders who just took a massive hit from Musk selling Tesla shares to buy the social media platform.
This is a ridiculous answer, and I lost respect for Musk because of it.
First off, who the hell brags about their number of followers on Twitter? Is he a teenager?
But more importantly, he basically dismissed the question, which points to him completely missing the point. A point that is obvious to most people.
I'm sometimes critical of Lambert opinions about Musk as I'm a total supporter of Musk. But on this one I agree with Lambert. I think Lambert has integrity and is not carried away either way like some haters or super fans. I applaud him for this.  
That point is that regardless of your political inclinations, most people can understand that the CEO and main only spokesperson for a company openly and actively taking a side in American politics, which are highly polarizing, is plain bad for business since you alienate a large part of the population. 
Musk’s comments about Democrats, especially saying things like the Democratic Party is “the party of hate,” is undoubtedly bad for business.
Instead of recognizing this behavior as a marketing faux pas (at best) and adjusting to reduce the negative impact on Tesla’s important mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, he decides to say, “look at my Twitter follower count.”
That’s so dumb. Yeah, you have a lot of people following you on Twitter. That’s just more people to piss off with your careless statements. Perhaps he believes in P.T. Barnum’s adage, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.”

2023/01/25,"With the release of its Q4 2022 earnings today, Tesla is making it clear to shareholders that it plans to keep cutting the cost of its electric vehicles to withstand “uncertain” times.
If there were a theme to Tesla’s Q4 2022 shareholder letter published today, it would be cost-cutting.
Tesla started out by writing:
As we progress into 2023, we know that there are questions about the near-term impact of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and in particular, with rising interest rates. The Tesla team is used to challenges, given the culture quired to get the company to where it is today. In the near term we are accelerating our cost reduction roadmap and driving towards higher production rates, while staying focused on executing against the next phase of our roadmap.
The company is making that statement after implementing some massive price cuts across its entire lineup earlier this month.
Investors are worried about the impact on the company’s profitability.
While we won’t know the exact impact until the next earnings report, shareholders do get some hints at the impact from the Q4 2022 results released today.
Tesla confirmed that 51% of the 405,000 vehicles it delivered in Q4 were delivered in December when Tesla started to offer some significant discounts on its vehicles.
Despite half of its deliveries getting discounted, Tesla only took a two-point hit on its automotive gross margin in Q4 – going from 27.9% in Q3 to 25.9% in Q4.
That’s encouraging for shareholders, but the gross margin hit is expected to be much bigger in Q1 since the price cuts are more significant than the discounts Tesla was offering in December 2022.
To further highlight opportunities to reduce costs, Tesla noted that it has been able to reduce its end-of-quarter delivery waves. The 51% of vehicles delivered in the third month of the quarter in Q4 is down from 74% in Q2.
Tesla says that it is working to keep bringing that percentage down for smoother deliveries throughout quarters, which should help with costs.
At the end of its shareholder’s letter, Tesla again reemphasizes that cost efficiency is crucial:
We are particularly focused on vehicle cost during this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, high-interest rates (thus higher cost of vehicle financing) and vehicle price deflation. We continue to focus on cost efficiencies while improving functionality and reliability. While cost-efficient manufacturing of EVs is still rare across most of the industry it is critical for profitability.
Tesla seems confident that it can keep its lead in selling electric vehicles profitably.
Tesla's CFO just confirmed on the earnings call that based on their forecast they will maintain over 20% gross margin throughout 2023.
That's pretty good given the price cuts.
I think Tesla is onto something here – especially with that last comment. It is almost a warning to the rest of the industry that if they can’t keep their EV cost down and start selling EVs profitably, they are in real trouble.
Today’s earnings were encouraging for investors with Tesla only taking a two-point hit on gross margins. Q1 will be much worse, but I now think it’s possible Tesla could still maintain something close to 15% gross margin despite the big price cuts.
Most automakers would sell their soul to the devil to get 15% gross margins, especially on electric vehicles.
It adds to my theory that Tesla might have just started an EV price war that it will likely win.

2023/01/25,"Tesla (TSLA) used car prices have crashed $18,000 since their peak six months ago, bringing a new level of affordability to the electric car brand.
Most car buyers can’t afford a new car and turn to the used car market, which is a critical part of the auto industry.
When it comes to electrification, we always focus on the new car market since that’s what is needed to transition the industry, and it’s also what feeds the electric used car market, which is still a pretty young one.
The Tesla used car market specifically is interesting in the US since it is fairly large – thanks to the fact that Tesla has been owning a majority of the EV market in the country for years.
Over the last few years, as Tesla increased its new car prices, Tesla used car prices have also been rising fast.
At one point last year, used Model Y prices went out of control and started to sell for more money than new Model Y vehicles. 
But used prices finally started to come down in December as Tesla started to offer discounts at the end of the quarter.
They have continued to come down over the last month and they have crashed over the last few weeks after Tesla implemented massive price cuts throughout its entire lineup and the new federal EV tax credit came into effect.
According to CarGurus data compiled by Charlie Bilello, Tesla used car prices have now crashed $18,000 from their high in July:
To be fair, the entire used car market is also down over the same period, but nowhere near Tesla’s level.
$50,000 is still a lot for a used car with some miles on it-- especially given known issues with early cars.  And, given what $50K will buy on the ICE side of the ledger
Used car market prices are down less than 2% over the last 30 days while Tesla’s used car prices are down over 8%. It is even more pronounced over a 90-day period where average used car prices are down 5.5% compared to Tesla’s being down 17.7%
Here are all the price movements from used Tesla models:
While the prices have come down significantly, the vehicles are still holding their value fairly well compared to new models.
Nonetheless, we are now seeing a new level of affordability in the used Tesla car market that wasn’t there for a long time.

2023/01/25,"Consumer Reports has released its latest rankings comparing the active driving assistance systems (ADAS) of EV automakers like Ford, GM, Rivian, and of course Tesla. The independent, non-profit consumer organization tested 12 different ADA systems broken down into five distinct categories in which it determined that Ford’s BlueCruise technology is the current industry leader, usurping General Motors’ Super Cruise. Tesla’s Autopilot, on the other hand, has tumbled off the podium into mediocrity.
The CR rankings released this morning are comprised of months of vehicle testing from Ford, Hyundai Motor Group, Tesla, and even our friends over at Toyota. As you’ll see below, not all ADAS are created equal.
At it’s core, the technology is a bolstered form of adaptive cruise control (ACC), that combines computer control of a vehicle’s brakes and acceleration with lane centering assistance (LCA) that also helps keep the vehicle a preset distance away from others in your lane.
No matter what flavor Kool-Aid you choose to drink, full self-driving technology still feels perpetually two years away (ask Elon Musk). In the meantime, however, some automakers on the list below have developed some truly impressive technology as the bridge between fully-attentive driving and not doing anything at all.
This sort of collaborative driving style may not be yet like an episode of The Jetsons, but it is still a marvel to experience in person and is becoming more and more common in passenger vehicles. According to CR’s data, ADA systems are already available on more than 50% of 2023 model-year vehicles – whether it’s an add-on or a standard feature.
Let’s start with the rankings and go from there to explain how Ford nabbed the top spot and Tesla fell to middle of the pack. Have a look.
Consumer Reports explained that to determine this list, it put each of the 12 ADAS through laps around its own track in Connecticut, plus a 50-mile loop on public roads throughout late 2022. Per the report:
Each system was rated for its performance in 40 separate tests, such as steering the car, controlling the speed, and keeping the driver safe and engaged with the act of driving. Additional features such as automatic lane changes or reacting for traffic lights were not evaluated in this test. 
CR testers evaluated the way each of the 12 systems performed within five specific categories: capability and performance, keeping the driver engaged, ease of use, clear when safe to use, and unresponsive driver.
In the latest rankings, Ford’s BlueCruise ADAS claimed the top spot over the previous leader in GM’s Super Cruise while Tesla, whose Autopilot sat in second place in 2020, dropped all the way to seventh. Consumer Reports explained that Ford and GM are leading the current pack because their systems also utilize direct driver monitoring systems (DDMS). These additional systems require drivers to keep their eyes on the road while the ADAS is activated, using infrared cameras on the driver’s face to alert them if they stop paying attention to the road.
Most other systems on this list have not yet integrated DDMS and simply require occasional hand pressure on the steering wheel to at least give the impression that the driver is paying attention. We’ve seen Tesla drivers share creative but utterly dangerous loopholes in Autopilot’s steering wheel requirement, rigging their EV to be “hands free.” The American automaker has since integrated the detection of cheating devices, but its driver monitoring leaves much to be desired. At least according to Consumer Reports, who has criticized the technology for years. 
We have 2 model 3s. I have full self-driving beta and my wife just as auto-pilot (not even enhanced AutoPilot). I paid $5k for FSD in 2019. If I could get $5k back to remove FSD, I would. That should tell you something. AP is good enough. FSD is sometimes cool, but it's not really great. I mostly have given up using it because it's too unpredictable.

I would like to try Ford and GM's advance driver assistance system because Tesla's requiring manual torque from my hands every few seconds is very annoying, and sometimes dangerous. I can have my hands on the wheel and be looking perfectly forward and the car will still start that incessant blue blinking waiting for me to jiggle the steering wheel. I've gotten used to it, but it would be SO much better if I could just leave my hands off the wheel and the system could make sure I am following with my eyes. In my view, the touched based version is indeed inferior to a system that tracks eye/attention. I think Consumer Reports got it right with this.
The CR team pointed out that systems in both Tesla and Mercedes-Benz vehicles allowed highway driving for approximately 30 seconds before any audible warning was given to retake the wheel. The testing team stated that amount of time time equates to over half a mile of driving without hands on the wheel and without successfully ensuring the driver is even looking at the road.
The rankings display that Ford’s BlueCruise technology is newer and more technologically advanced than everyone else, including Tesla – whose Autopilot technology has seen added features, but has kept the same basic functionality since day one. CR’s senior director of auto testing Jake Fisher elaborated:
After all this time, Autopilot still doesn’t allow collaborative steering and doesn’t have an effective driver monitoring system. While other automakers have evolved their ACC and LCA systems, Tesla has simply fallen behind.
We were surprised to see Volvo ranked 11th out of 12, considering passenger safety is a huge selling point in its overall brand. The automaker has promised to deliver one of the safest EVs on the planet when its upcoming EX90 hits the market, so perhaps its ADAS will see some improvements as well. We already know it will have advanced driver monitoring and will be able to safely stop the vehicle should you become unconscious.
Ford, Tesla, and GM drivers, what do you think about these rankings?

2023/01/25,"Tesla has started to release a new software update to its fleet of customer vehicles with two new features: Auto Steering Wheel Heat and Sentry Mode Lighting.
The automaker writes in the release notes of the new 2023.2.0.5 software update about the new Auto Steering Wheel Heat feature:
Set your steering wheel heater to regulate its temperature automatically based on the climate control set temperature. To access steering wheel heating controls, tap the temperature settings to bring up the climate control panel.
Obviously, this only applies to Tesla vehicles with heated steering wheels.
With the new software update, Tesla is also making a significant addition to Sentry Mode.
Tesla’s Sentry Mode is an integrated surveillance system inside Tesla’s vehicles using the Autopilot cameras around the car – it has been game-changing when it comes to vandalizing parked cars.
It builds on TeslaCam, an integrated dashcam system.
On several occasions, Sentry Mode videos went viral, and the vandals turned themselves in after the online pressure. In other cases, it helped police with video evidence to help them identify and find the vandals.
But it has also been capturing footage of strange events around Tesla vehicles and impressive moments showcasing the performance of Tesla’s vehicles. We built a list of some of those moments a few years ago.
Tesla has also been building on the feature to release new ones – most recently, a new live camera view feature.
On top of filming what is happening around the car, Sentry Mode is also capable of detecting potential “threats” and launches an alarm to deter those potential threats.
Now with the new 2023.2.0.5 software update, Tesla is adding a pulse of the headlights to the system:
When a threat is detected, Sentry Mode will softly pulse the headlights to indicate that your vehicle is recording video. The pulsing stops after 60 seconds or when the vehicle is unlocked.
The new software update has now started to roll out in Tesla’s customer fleet, but it can take a few days to even a few weeks for it to reach the entire fleet.

2023/01/24,"Tesla has officially announced its expected new battery and Semi factories in Northern Nevada, along with $3.6 billion in investment to make them happen. But are these actually new factories, or simply the completion of Gigafactory Nevada to its originally planned size?
Earlier today we reported on the Nevada Governor hinting at plans for Tesla’s new factory, which were expected to be officially unveiled today. Tesla has now put up a blog post describing its progress with its previous investments in Nevada and the plans for this new investment.
Tesla says that it has already spent $6.2 billion in Nevada and hired 11,000 employees, while creating 17,000 local construction jobs building out its Gigafactory there, and that the factory has produced:
These numbers are higher than Tesla’s original 2014 plan, which was to spend $3.5 billion on a factory to produce 35 GWh of batteries annually, which would then hire 6,500 employees.
Since then, the EV market has expanded rapidly, which means 35GWh is still not enough to fulfill global demand for Tesla’s EVs. 
Today, Tesla said:
We will be investing over $3.6 billion more to continue growing Gigafactory Nevada, adding 3,000 new team members and two new factories: a 100 GWh 4680 cell factory (with capacity to produce enough batteries for 2 million light duty vehicles annually), as well as our first high-volume Semi factory.
Tesla’s announcement is unclear about whether these factories will still be on the same property as its current gigafactory, which is still about 60% complete when comparing renders to the current status of the building.
Judging by the new render, these new factories may be in the same building. Compared to the existing building, which has an L-shape, and the original and new renders of the building, filling out that L-shape would complete the building to look more like the renders:
The announcement mentions that some of the $3.6 billion will be spent to continue growing the gigafactory, but also build two new factories. Previously, Electrek reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near Gigafactory Nevada, so we’re not sure if it’s changing plans and will bring all this production under the same roof, or continue expanding that new building nearby. The new render shows assembled Tesla Semis coming off the line on the left side of the building, which could suggest their assembly will be done under the same roof – or maybe it’s just a render.
The Semi delivery event was held at the NV Gigafactory and Panasonic is working with Tesla on the mass production of the new 4680 cells. It shouldn't be a huge surprise that Tesla will continue to invest in the property they already own along with the partnership they have on site with Panasonic.  As far as solar on the roof, there are laws in NV that affect how much a company or business can supply themselves without buying power from the utility (NV Energy).  I'm not current with those laws and not a lawyer but I know it's been in the news over the years when some of the large casinos tried to do a total off grid operation a few years ago and it either wasn't allowed or required a special wavier by the courts.  The electric rates in NV are much cheaper than many places and for every solar panel Tesla puts on their own roof it's one less they have to sell to a consumer so the FUD needs to stop.  There are issues in court right now about lithium mines trying to open in NV and a local company that generates power from geothermal is trying to open another plant near where Burning Man is held but that is also being challenged for those of you that are paying attention.
This announcement comes the day before Tesla’s earnings report, which is certainly interesting timing. Tesla set a record for deliveries with 405,000 vehicles delivered in Q4 and 1.3 million in 2022, though the Q4 number came in under expectations. Near the end of the quarter, Tesla started offering discounts and has recently drastically cut prices, signaling that it needed to stoke demand a little after more than a year of significant price increases while EV demand skyrocketed.
Update: We’ve got some answers from the presentation which was released early on Jan 25th:
The big answer is that those 2 factories are within the planned Gigafactory Nevada:

2023/01/24,"Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q4 2022 and full-year 2022 financial results on Wednesday, January 25, after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management are scheduled after the results.
Here we’ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.
As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q4 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company’s revenue.
Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 405,000 electric vehicles during the fourth quarter of the year.
This is a delivery record for Tesla, but the automaker actually came significantly below expectations. There was also a record discrepancy between vehicles produced and vehicles delivered. Tesla produced 439,000 vehicles during the quarter.
Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results.
For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $24.669 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $24.879 billion.
This would be a record quarter for revenue, thanks to the record deliveries, but it’s hard to estimate due to Tesla offering some significant discounts in December.
Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green:
Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now.
For Q4 2022, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $1.13 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $1.19 per share.
The estimates have a wide range this quarter because of the discounts that Tesla offered in December. It most likely significantly impacted gross margins, but it’s hard to say by how much without knowing how many cars Tesla delivered last month.
The automaker also had over 30,000 vehicles in inventory or transit at the end of the quarter, which is also going to impact earnings negatively.
Here are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green:
In the shareholder’s letter and the following conference call, Tesla generally shares additional details about not only financial results, but also other important metrics on how the company is doing.
CEO Elon Musk is not always on the call, but this time, he is expected to be since it’s not only the Q4 earnings but also the full 2022 earnings.
Tesla will continue to expand at about 50% y/y for a couple of more years, then rate will decline yearly (as it gets exponentially harder to keep up a 50% pace) until they get to 10-20 million/yr in 2030-35.  Utility / residential battery packs / virtual power-plants will be as big or bigger than cars by then and FSD / robots / the machine that makes the machine .. will be a thing.  This is in motion now and only time/effort stand in the way .. world events notwithstanding.
Generally, the full-year earnings are also when a company releases guidance for the new year, but Tesla is not like most companies.
Tesla has consistently just reiterated its intention to remain marginally profitable as it reinvests into its business and aims for about 50% growth in deliveries per year.  
However, the automaker generally shares its planned capital expenditure for the year, so we can expect that.
Interestingly, Tesla recently announced a new “Investor Day” in March that sounds a lot like an earnings conference call or an annual shareholder meeting, so it’s possible that Tesla keeps some of the more juicy stuff that would have been said at the earnings for this Investor Day.

2023/01/24,"Tesla, which is known for its touchscreen-based user interface, is finally getting some buttons and physical inputs, thanks to a new smart accessory.
Love or hate Tesla, it’s hard to argue that it doesn’t have the best user interface in the auto industry.
It’s miles ahead of other automakers; as such, most of them are now offloading most of the experience to Apple and Android because of it.
However, if there’s a main complaint about Tesla’s in-car user interface, it’s the lack of physical input. Literally, everything goes through touchscreens or voice commands, aside from a few buttons and scrolls on the steering wheel.
While many owners don’t mind, it has been a recurring complaint for people who prefer physical buttons and knobs, especially for things like volume and climate controls.
Now you can add physical inputs to your Tesla, thanks to a new product being crowdfunded on Indiegogo.
It’s a neat little accessory called Ctrl-Bar, and it sticks to the bottom of the Model 3/Y’s center display:
The knobs can be used to change the temperature, and the four center buttons can be programmed to do a bunch of different things.
The crowdfunding campaign describes the product:
The two scroll wheels with tactile indents give the driver and passenger complete control of the cabin temperature. Four push buttons ensure easy access to programmable shortcuts. All changes done on Ctrl-Bar are reflected on the center screen! 
What’s neat about the product is that it is easy to install, and it doesn’t require any hardwiring to Tesla’s systems.
Instead, all you have to do is plug it into a USB port to power it, and the controls affect Tesla’s settings through the Tesla API – meaning that you can have the buttons do anything that can be done through the Tesla app.
Button configuration can be done through the Ctrl-Bar app.
Afer 10 years of daily Tesla driving, I am very use to the Tesla's touch screen controls. I don't expect the Ctrl-Bar accessory will be of interest to me. I do think having such a device available will interest many potential new buyers and it certainly seems both easy and affordable. I wish the very good luck. 
The device also features LED lighting to create some interior ambience:
The company is also trying to bring some more advanced features like speed trap warnings:
Speed trap warnings will also be available through a subscription. Ctrl-Bar will check for nearby fixed speed traps and visually alert you when you’re approaching. If you somehow are above the speed limit (the warning threshold will be configurable), Ctrl-Bar will give an audible warning reminding you to slow down 🙂 *Will be available through a subscription.
The company is even planning to have over-the-air update capability for releasing additional features in the future.
As with any crowdfunding product, it comes with a certain amount of risk. The Ctrl-Bar starts at €199 EUR (approximately $220) for the first 75 units, and then the price gradually increases. The company plans to start deliveries in the summer.

2023/01/24,"Tesla has confirmed that following the recent price drops, both Model 3 and Model Y will now benefit from the full ~$7,000 EV subsidy in Germany for the first time.
Tesla has had its ups and downs when it comes to accessing German electric vehicle incentives.
The German auto industry had a heavy hand in managing the incentive program with the government, and Tesla claimed that it was purposefully left out at one point.
But more recently, Tesla buyers in Germany lost access to the incentive due to price caps on eligible electric vehicles, which brought Tesla’s vehicles out of range.
That was until the recent massive price cuts in Tesla’s entire lineup and across all markets, including Germany.
Today, Tesla Germany confirmed that both Model Y and Model 3, in all trims, are now eligible for the full €6,750 (~$7,000 USD) incentive in 2023 (translated from German):
As BAFA officially confirmed at the end of last week, both the Tesla Model 3 and, for the first time, the Tesla Model Y qualify for the highest premium of the new state subsidy, which will be up to €6,750 in 2023 (BAFA + manufacturer’s share). For both Model 3 and Model Y, the maximum subsidy applies to all model upgrades, including the maximum range and performance variants.
The automaker highlighted that with the price cuts and the incentives now being applied, the Model 3 and Model Y now both start at just over €40,000:
Combined with recent price adjustments, the new maximum subsidy for all variants of the Model 3 and Y allows even easier access to owning a Tesla, in line with our mission to accelerate the global shift toward sustainable mobility. The Tesla Model 3 is available from €40,470 with the maximum subsidy, and the Model Y from €41,370.
This is a new low for Tesla pricing in Germany, and it should result in a significant surge of orders for Tesla in the crucial European market. Interestingly, the difference between a Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan is under $1000
It's official: #Tesla Germany confirms that both #Model3 and #ModelY will get the maximum subsidy in 🇩🇪 for all Model upgrades, so also LR and Performance. After Tesla's price cuts, the Model 3 is thus available from €40,470, the Model Y from €41,370🥳
This is coming at a perfect time for Tesla, which needs to keep its order backlog high in Germany as it ramps up production at Gigafactory Berlin.
A strong local market where the company can quickly deliver vehicles from the factory will greatly benefit its financial position as it ramps up production.
At the last update, Tesla said that it was producing 3,000 Model Y vehicles per week at the plant, but we know that Tesla wants to bring that up to 5,000 units as soon as possible.

2023/01/24,"According to Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo, Tesla is going to announce today a new factory to build the Tesla Semi in Nevada.
If true, the move would go against previously announced plans.
The governor made the comment during his inaugural State of the State speech:
I am looking forward to joining Elon Musk and the team at Tesla tomorrow when they unveil plans to build a brand-new $3.5 billion-dollar advanced manufacturing facility in northern Nevada for the company’s all-electric semi-trucks.
He didn’t elaborate beyond that, but the comment is fairly straightforward: The governor seems to confirm that Tesla plans to announce a new $3.5 billion factory to produce the Tesla Semi.
The announcement would come as soon as today – a day before Tesla’s earnings announcement.
Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near Gigafactory Nevada. At the time, we were told that the production equipment installed would be for about five electric trucks per week.
When launching the production version of the Tesla Semi, the company confirmed that it is where they are being built. For volume production, Tesla has previously signaled plans to build the electric semi-truck in higher volume at Gigafactory Texas.
It seems everyone is announcing new $3B, $4B, or $5B factories. An article last week claimed $210B in new EV and EV battery factories have been announced in the U.S. since Biden took office! (Now, we just have to cross our fingers that everything announced get built.)

Any new $3.5B EV factory is great news, but it's no longer a ""game changer"" like it would have been just a few years ago. Now, a new $3.5B EV factory is just the cost of becoming/remaining competitive.
A new large $3.5 billion factory in Northern Nevada would be a change of plan.
Also, Tesla already has a large factory in Northern Nevada, and it is not even complete yet. It would be strange to invest in another large facility – unless the governor meant that Tesla is going to invest $3.5 billion in the production of Tesla Semi at the existing Gigafactory Nevada plant.
Coincidently, we reported just a few months ago that Tesla finally started to plan the expansion of the Gigafactory Nevada building after years of inactivity on that front. The new expansion could potentially be to support that new production of the Tesla Semi.
We should know in the next few hours. We will keep you updated when we have more information.

2023/01/24,"Tesla has increased prices on new Model Ys, in a slight reversal after drastic cuts just two weeks ago.
The changes went live on Tesla’s website tonight, and only seem to affect the Model Y, Tesla’s most popular vehicle. However, in contrast to the massive price cuts of up to $13K, the Model Y has been bumped in price by just $500.
This brings it to a base price of $53,490, as opposed to $52,990 prior to this bump. The Model 3, X, and S all maintain the same post-cut prices as before.
The recent price cuts came after weeks of signals from Tesla that demand might not have been keeping up supply, with Tesla offering discounts and incentives in various regions as inventory started to pile up. Tesla had hiked prices significantly over the course of 2021-2022 as EV demand far outstripped supply, and had little trouble selling out of vehicles until the end of the year.
We here at Electrek noted that the result of these massive cuts could lead to an EV price war, which Tesla seems poised to do well in. Though this will cut into Tesla’s high margins, its margins are higher than other companies in the space, which gives it leeway to cut prices when supply gets to the point that it can keep up with demand.
And in the weeks since that price drop, Tesla has seen “unprecedented demand” on these vehicles. Not only was the Model Y price dropped by $13K, but this also put it into range to qualify for the US EV tax credit, meaning a $20K price drop for many customers, as long as they take delivery before March when tax credits are expected to change once again.
Notably, today’s price bump does again make a difference for EV tax credit eligibility. At the previous base MSRP of $52,990, up to $2,000 in options could be added before the 5-seat Model Y reached the government’s $55,000 MSRP limit to be eligible for tax credits. This meant that buyers could choose any paint color (which cost up to $2,000) or could choose the $2,000 20-inch wheels and just skate in under the limit.
Now, adding the most-expensive red multi-coat paint color or the 20-inch wheel option take the MSRP above $55,000, which means Model Ys with those options will not qualify. At this point, the only options a 5-seat Model Y can choose to still qualify for tax credits are silver, blue, or black paint or a tow hitch (though the hitch can be added after purchase, which we’d recommend if you’re getting any other options).
Tesla also made another change tonight – it now quotes the actual MSRP of the vehicle upfront, instead of including “potential savings” from gas and incentives:
Tesla has gone back and forth on this over the years. The previous method has been criticized for being potentially misleading, quoting a price far lower than a customer would pay. But Tesla, somewhat correctly, argues that it’s a more realistic comparison in terms of lifecycle vehicle costs. Tesla does offer a calculator so you can figure out your own gas savings based on annual vehicle miles, electricity rate, and gasoline costs, but would previously include average estimates of those upfront, while now they’re behind a “learn more” link:
People should be thanking the IRS for the big discount on Model Y LR... Tesla would not have dropped the price that much if they had not disqualified it for the 80k cap for the federal tax incentive. 
We’ve received a lot of angry emails recently from Model Y buyers about the price cut, feeling aggrieved that they purchased a vehicle that they could have gotten for cheaper had they just waited a little longer.
But, such is the case with purchases – sometimes the price changes, and sometimes you don’t get the best price. C’est la vie.
That said, this price change was sudden and massive, so the complaints are more reasonable this time around. Usually pricing doesn’t change so much so quickly, and usually those price changes aren’t done by a company that has repeatedly stated that “the price is the price” and that it wants to buck the dealership model and stick with transparent, predictable pricing.
Price bumps like these are a little more reasonable, as a 1% difference in price of a vehicle isn’t going to break most people’s bank. But it still violates Tesla’s “we don’t want to jerk prices around like a dealership” model, given that this happened just under two weeks after a huge price cut. There was one point long ago where it was easy to keep up with Tesla pricing, but that hasn’t been the case for a while now.

2023/01/23,"Tesla is making a massive investment in vehicle service in California with a significant hiring ramp as demand rises following price cuts.
After a short hiring freeze in many departments, Tesla is picking up its hiring efforts again, and it posted a flurry of new jobs in service in California today.
Electrek spotted that Tesla posted 89 new vehicle service jobs in California.
Here are just a few examples of the almost 100 new jobs in service that Tesla listed in California:
Several of the jobs also involve Tesla’s collision repair, which has been expanding with new collision centers in the US as the automaker is moving away from third-party body shops.
Last year, Tesla announced that it was working on service in North America; it is aiming to make the majority of appointments same-day repairs. As we noted, it is much needed since Tesla’s customer fleet is growing at a much faster pace than its service infrastructure.
We later learned that Tesla’s service problem was much bigger than we anticipated, as we reported that the automaker was going as far as sending untrained employees from other departments to work on cars.
Electrek also obtained details about Tesla’s plan to “revolutionize” vehicle service with bigger service centers and more specializations. 
It's kind of turn the crank - make more sales, hire more service folk. But good to see them building out their service network. It will be a while, but it will eventually be a profit center, as well. 
Now Tesla is ramping up hiring in service in California just after a significant price drop that has resulted in an important surge in demand.
California is Tesla’s biggest market in the US, and a lot of the new demand is expected to come from the state. 
In 2022, electric vehicle sales increased by 60% in California, and Tesla was leading the increase with over 72% market share in the state.
Over 200,000 Tesla vehicles were added to California roads over the last year, and Tesla is expected to add a lot more in 2023 – hence the investment in service to keep up with the growing fleet.

2023/01/23,"Tesla has obtained a patent for a new way to make glass that is evidently going to be used for Cybertruck’s novel windshield.
There are a lot of things about the Cybertrucks that are unlike any other vehicle out there.
The whole idea behind the radical design is that pickup truck designs have remained roughly the same for the last 30 years and Tesla believes it can create something new that will break the cycle.
One of the most novel and infamous features of the Cybertruck’s design is its “Tesla Armor Glass.”
It was made infamous by the failed demonstration on stage during the unveiling of the electric pickup truck:
For years, Tesla has been heavily investing in material science, which includes glass.
We previously reported on the Tesla Glass division working on developing new types of glass for its products.
For the Cybertruck, the company describes the “Tesla Armor Glass”:
Ultra-strong glass and polymer-layered composite can absorb and redirect impact force for improved performance and damage tolerance.
But what’s interesting about the glass on the Cybertruck is that it follows the vehicle’s sharp feature lines.
Now Tesla has obtained a new patent to manufacture glass that can be manipulated to create novel shapes that traditionally can’t be achieved in normal automotive glass manufacturing.
In the patent application, Tesla describes issues with current methods:  
Generally, such processes for making glass structures are limited by the amount of curvature or bending achievable with the glass. For example, typically only smooth, high radius of curvatures (e.g., radius of curvature of 1-3 meters or more), are used for automotive glass structures.
Tesla describes its technology to achieve shorter radiuses of curvature:
In some embodiments, a process for forming an automotive glass structure having one or more feature lines (or curves/bends) includes applying localized heat to one or more locations of the glass structure, whereby the glass structure bends at the location of the localized heat. In some examples, the glass structure is supported by a support tool such that as localized heat is applied gravity forces the glass structure to bend at the one or more locations (e.g., along a longitudinal line of the glass), thereby forming a feature line or bend in the glass. In some examples, additional forces may be applied to the glass structure, e.g., via a press, vacuum air suction, or the like to aid in bending or shaping of the glass structure. In some examples, a radius of curvature of the feature line or bend in the glass structure at the one or more locations is between 2 mm and 5 cm.
Here are a few drawings included in the patent application:
Good morning, rather early for so much negativity, don't you think? Perhaps the patent was taken out to prevent a later manufacturer from patenting the same process and stopping Tesla.  
 
In the patent application, Tesla also describes a way to achieve the same result with multilayered glass:
In another embodiment, a glass structure includes a first layer of glass having a feature line or bend in at least one location thereof. The feature line having a radius of curvature between 2 mm and 5 cm. In some examples, the glass structure is a multilayer glass structure and includes a second layer of glass including a first portion of glass and a second portion of glass, the first and second portions meeting at the feature line or bend in the first layer of glass. A polymer may be disposed between the first layer of glass and the second layer of glass.
Here’s a drawing illustrating a multilayered glass with that level of curvature:
This specific drawing would point to the wrap-around windshield in the Tesla Semi, but Tesla actually shares drawings of the Cybertruck as examples in the patent application.
Tesla is currently working to bring the Cybertruck to production by mid-2023.

2023/01/22,"Tesla has leaked the “Magic Dock” CCS adapter in its mobile app ahead of the imminent opening of its Supercharger network in North America.
After opening its Supercharger network in Europe last year and indicating that it would do the same in North America by the end of the year, we were a bit disappointed when it didn’t happen.
However, we know that it is still imminent. It could really happen any day, or it might have already happened by way of a “soft launch.”
Unlike in Europe, where Tesla already uses the CCS connector, we knew that Tesla would have a tougher time opening its Supercharger network in North America because it uses its own proprietary connector in the market.
The move to open source its connector in an attempt to make it the new North American charging standard made the plan murkier late last year, but it seems like Tesla’s plan is still to offer a CCS adapter at its charging stations to support non-Tesla electric vehicles.
Now Tesla appears to have leaked the solution in its latest mobile app update that includes an updated render of the Supercharger stall:
In this image, the connector receptacle is entirely different and much larger. It matches the description of Branden Flasch (via Drive Tesla Canada), who found information about the device called the Magic Dock.
It looks like Magic Dock is now shown in the @Tesla app – see second image for what has shown previously which reflects Euro CCS2 handle. I think Magic Dock / open Supercharger in NA launch is imminent. pic.twitter.com/HYbUj26db9
Basically, the Magic Dock is a CCS adapter that serves as the new Tesla connector dock when you don’t need CCS – in other words, for Tesla owners.
This would be awesome. The main places I travel to and need to charge are well covered with Superchargers but EA and alternatives are non-existent. This would make a non-Tesla EV viable to me.
But for non-Tesla EV owners, you can undock both and use the Supercharger with the CCS adapter.
The update in the mobile app could point that Tesla is getting ready to deploy this solution at its Supercharger station in North America.
Further evidence of the imminent launch includes people spotting “CCS compatibility” being listed at some Supercharger stations, including at Tesla’s Hawthorne Supercharger station in Los Angeles:
Anyone know what “CCS Compatibility means” on a V3 Supercharger in Hawthorne? pic.twitter.com/hqHJgNz6TG
Therefore, you should check your local Supercharger to see if this Tesla Magic Dock has appeared. If you do see it, please take a few pictures and let us know.

2023/01/20,"Tesla has just started what could become a major EV price war, and it could change the landscape as the automaker is in a great position to win that war.
The number one thing I hear from people that are interested in buying an electric car is that the price is high.
I always counter it by asking them how much they spend on gas and with those savings, the cost of ownership is often cheaper than a gasoline vehicle. However, a higher sticker price remains an important psychological barrier for many buyers even after considering the total cost of ownership.
On top of that, the average price of electric vehicles has been steadily increasing over the last two years thanks to high demand, supply chain issues, and general inflation.
But now things are starting to get interesting for the first time on the EV pricing front.
Tesla has implemented some significant price cuts across its entire lineup and in all markets. It almost reversed the price increases over the last few years entirely.
As we recently reported, the price drop has been working in the US where it also arrives at the same time as the new $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.
Tesla’s sales are surging following the price drop and now we are seeing other automakers following in the price drop. For example, Xpeng saw its sales drop during the week following Tesla’s price drop, and the company has now implemented important price drops, too.
Many experts are seeing this as the first few steps into the first ever EV price war.
In a price war, it’s all about your ability to absorb price reductions and on that front, you can’t deny Tesla’s lead.
For years now, the automaker has been enjoying industry-leading gross margins and net profits.
Here, Reuters put a chart together showing how Tesla’s gross margin and net profit compare to rivals in the auto industry:
That chart is impressive, but it doesn’t even tell the whole story.
If I remember right, GM's CEO said in a recent interview that they are currently loosing 5-6 thousand dollars on each EV that they sell. I think I remember them saying that they hope to break even on each vehicle by 2025. That's going to add up to a lot of losses very quickly.
Aside from companies like Nio and Xpeng, all the gross margins and net profits from the other companies also come from non-all-electric vehicles – meaning hybrids, PHEVs and gas-powered cars.
For companies like GM, which comes in second to Tesla in net profits, it is believed that its gasoline-powered vehicles have much higher margins than its electric vehicles.
I’ve always said that I believe some big companies will fall during the electric revolution. I’m not saying that’s happening now, but if an EV price war heats up, I think we could see it happen.
I think Tesla still has a few wild cards that are questionable – Elon Musk is at the top of that list – but it is definitely Tesla’s war to lose.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/01/20,"Tesla has been spotted using its mobile service fleet to try to fix a new Tesla Semi electric truck that broke down in California.
Tesla unveiled the production version of its Tesla Semi class 8 electric truck and delivered the first units last month.
PepsiCo took delivery of the first Tesla Semi trucks. Within weeks of taking delivery of the first truck, PepsiCo said that it was already deploying 36 Tesla Semi trucks.
Since the deliveries to Pepsi, sightings of the electric truck on public roads have significantly increased, and one of them was even spotted being towed by another truck – leading to concerns about reliability.
As we reported at the time, it shouldn’t be a major concern for now. It is still early in the production program and some breakdowns are to be expected. Reliability is indeed extremely important for commercial trucks since they are losing money when not in the use, and therefore, it’s important to track the progress on that front. But we would need more data over a longer period of time before actually having concerns about reliability.
Now we have another data point as another Tesla Semi truck owned by PepsiCo was spotted broken down on the side of the road in Modesto, California, this week:
#modestocalifornia #modesto209 #california #Trucking #tesla #teslasemi #jsktime #edisonmotors #teslasemitruckpepsi #stockton209 #punjabitruckers #dumptruckdriver #stockton209 #stocktoncalifornia 
Interestingly, Tesla was first spotted trying to fix the truck with a mobile service technician:
Another @tesla Semi Breakdown. There is a fine balance of Sustainability and reliability. Fleets can't depends on units that breakdown. $TSLA .2023 @Hyliion ERX 1,000 mile range! pic.twitter.com/spflHq02J2
Before starting deliveries of the truck in December, we reported that Tesla had already started building a team to service Tesla Semi trucks in California, including mobile technicians to go to the clients.
If you are Pepsi this is not the advertising you signed up for, but then again how many individuals are seeing this story outside the fringe electric vehicle enthusiasts. Two vehicles having issues out of a very small number delivered is not a good look. Luckily this isn't the same as a 737 Max having issues. Who cares if a few potato chips or soft drinks are late. It will be interesting to see the reliability (perceived or otherwise) compared to Freightliner, Volvo, Mack, Peterbilt, etc. and possible outcomes with orders. I have no doubt that the other class 8 manufacturers will close the range gap to the Tesla Semi, since it appears to simply be when the torque motors are activated versus the efficiency motor.
Obviously, I don’t share the concern of the Twitter poster who openly admits to be an investor in Hyliion, a hybrid hydrogen truck maker, which is a segment of the trucking industry that I think will get swallowed by all-electric trucks like the Tesla Semi within the next few years.
Again, I agree that it is important to keep track of these issues if they become more widespread, but so far, we have seen two broken-down Tesla Semi trucks out of a fleet of reportedly at least 36 trucks, and we are still early in the program. 
Electric trucks have the potential to require less maintenance and be more reliable than trucks equipped with internal combustion engines thanks to the benefits of having fewer moving parts in an electric powertrain.
But it’s still a new technology used in semi trucks. It is going to need a period of adaption.

2023/01/19,"Data shows that Tesla has significantly ramped up its own external communications over the last few months as Elon Musk becomes more controversial.
Last month, I wrote an op-ed titled “Tesla badly needs to bring back its PR department” about why I think the automaker needs to bring back its PR department that it dissolved back in 2020.
My main point was that, since then, most of Tesla’s public communications have gone through Elon Musk, who is becoming an increasingly controversial and polarizing character for many people, and the company would benefit from more robust direct communications with the public.
Tesla has not reinstated its US or global PR team, at least not yet, but the automaker has certainly significantly increased its communications over the last few months.
We noticed that Tesla has been increasingly tweeting about its products lately. Tesla normally would only tweet about new products or features, but over the last few months, the automaker has started to often post new threads that feature existing products and features.
For example, Tesla posted a whole thread about its track mode today:
Track Mode lets you use your Tesla’s instant response & motor torque to feel superhuman on the track—available on Model S Plaid + Model 3 & Y Performance pic.twitter.com/DXPmsEBz4d
This wasn’t usual for Tesla until a few months ago, so Electrek wondered if it was just in our heads or if the data actually backed it up.
Sure enough, data shows that Tesla has massively ramped up its tweeting over the last three months:
Tesla also ramped up its use of Instagram around the same time. The automaker also regularly uses Weibo, but that has always been the case as a different team handles Chinese communications.
Furthermore, Tesla also ramped up its blog posting effort. Before September, Tesla had only posted two blog posts in 2022 – one to introduce track mode in Plaid vehicles and one to defend itself against a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit.
But from September until this month, Tesla published six blog posts on its website.
The timing of this change appears to match CEO Elon Musk becoming increasingly controversial.
Over the last few months, surveys have shown that Tesla’s reputation has been going down, and the stock price is crashing further than the rest of the industry.
Many people have associated the trend with Musk becoming increasingly political on Twitter and alienating a big part of Tesla’s user base – namely liberals – who buy EVs at a much higher rate than conservatives.
Musk was always the defacto Tesla spokesperson, but when Tesla had a global PR department, the automaker had much stronger public communications that didn’t have to always go through the CEO.
Since dissolving the PR department, Musk’s Twitter page has become the source of 99% of Tesla’s official communications.
Tesla's Board of Directors need to prove that they are in control by re-instituting a PR department.  Tesla is too large and too complex for all PR to be handled by someone as distracted and overstretched by at least Three businesses, one of which has lost him more money personally than any one person has lost in the History of American Finance.

Their duty is to the employees and  the Stockholders.  Let's see them do their jobs.
It makes sense for the company to build a stronger voice of its own as many people don’t feel like following Musk on the social media platform.
If you were there for his frequent updates and comments about Tesla products, those are now few and far between Musk’s political comments, conspiracy theories, and concerns about the “woke mind virus.”
I am going to get excited about Musk on Twitter once he seems to be more excited about Tesla launching the Cybertruck than the next QAnon drop. 
That’s obviously a joke, but sometimes his Twitter feels like that.

2023/01/19,"Hertz is rolling out its EV fleet to cities across the US in a program called Hertz Electrifies, and it’s kicking off in Denver.
In a new public-private partnership, the car rental giant will bring its EV fleet to US cities, and it’s also going to expand its fleets with Tesla, Polestar, and GM models. Hertz is also going to support the buildout of EV charging infrastructure.
The company also says it will create educational and training opportunities and engage with local organizations to extend electrification to underserved communities. 
Apart from Denver, the company does not say in which US cities, or how many, the Hertz Electrifies program will be launched.
The program is launching first in Denver in partnership with Mayor Michael B. Hancock. Here’s how it’s going to play out for the Mile High City:
Denver’s Mayor Hancock said:
Our goal is to reduce Denver’s carbon emissions 80% by 2050, and expanding the use and availability of electric vehicles will play a major role in helping us achieve that goal. 
This partnership with Hertz will provide invaluable data about where we need charging infrastructure the most, as well as provide new opportunities with this new technology to create good-paying jobs for our current and future workforce.
This is a fantastic initiative to help speed up the shift to electric vehicles in the US, and we look forward to seeing how many and which cities Hertz rolls out this program to next. 
I'm particularly happy to see this as a Denver resident.  Beyond everything mentioned in the article, we have some severe air pollution problem in the metro area.  A significant part of that is caused by vehicle emissions.  

Electrifying some of the larger fleets should make an impact quicker than the non-actions of our state politicians.
Perhaps Hertz might want to consider engaging with smaller cities and rural areas as well, where EV infrastructure is sorely needed. For example, we have a lot of EV drivers here in rural Vermont, and we need a lot more public EV chargers.

2023/01/19,"Ross Gerber, a major and vocal Tesla investor, says Elon Musk broke the Tesla stock when he sold it to buy Twitter.
Gerber runs the Gerber Kawasaki ETF, and it had its January shareholder meeting yesterday. 
The investor had to explain why the fund was down 32% over the last year, and, unsurprisingly, he blamed it on the performance of Tesla’s stock, which the fund is heavily investing in.
But more specifically, Gerber blamed it on Elon Musk and the way he sold Tesla stocks to finance his acquisition of Twitter:
Elon dumped $40 billion of Tesla stocks last year – causing a massive decline in Tesla stock price.
Musk has never directly acknowledged the impact of his selling and actually denied it being a significant factor. He told Gerber to go back to and read textbooks from Finance 101 because he believed the decline in Tesla’s stock was simply due to the broader stock market and FED initiatives.
The CEO eventually did promise not to sell more Tesla stocks for the next few years. However, he said that before and didn’t follow through.
Now Gerber more specifically accused Musk of destroying Tesla’s stock in the way he sold the stock. He argues that Musk should have done a stock offering:
Instead, they were open market sales that were front-run by short sellers and some of those happened in desperation in October and November when he needed money for Twitter when Twitter revenue went to zero. A lot of those sales happened around $200 a share and he broke the stock. It went from $200 to $100.
Gerber says that the market can’t absorb $40 billion in open market sales and that the amount sold was bigger than most IPOs – hence why he argues those sales should have gone through an offering.
The investor concluded with putting the blame clearly on the Tesla board and Musk:
The board should have been all over this process, but instead, it was done at a huge expense to shareholders and there’s no excuse. And I’m not okay with it. 
Gerber has been pushing for a board seat amid this whole ordeal and claims that he plans to reign in Musk and get a confirmation in writing that he won’t sell more Tesla stocks in the same way.
Obviously, what we are seeing here is someone who leads a fund and is trying to explain to his investors why they lost a lot of money over the last year.
Could not agree more that Musk's business adventurism at a time of every increasing ev competition broke Tesla stock. Exacerbating the impact of the share sales on the Tesla stock prices is the distraction of the CEO that had the greatest long term effect. Just hubris at it's finest.

An indication of just how uniformed he was about the market Twitter is in was his surprise that Apple takes 30 points on revenue for apps downloaded from it's app store. Even an entry level developer knows that. If he was so unprepared to buy Twitter, how was he going to get up to speed without taking time away from Tesla when competition was hearing up.

Running a growing car company that all others have as their target, a rocket company that involved, well, rocket science, a tunnel boring company that is nowhere, and a neutral implant venture is the equivalent of 10 full time jobs. 

Twitter is not worth the distraction. It is a nuisance.
But the argument is sound to me. 
There’s no doubt that Musk’s share sales were mismanaged and that they had a massive negative impact on Tesla’s stock over the last year.
Now do I think that Gerber would be able to avoid or limit Musk’s future potential negative impact on Tesla’s stock? I don’t know. I think Musk is currently spending too much time in the echo chamber he created for himself on Twitter where his views are getting reinforced by an army of sycophants seeking his approval. 
That’s the bigger problem that needs to be fixed if we want Tesla, which I still view as the most important company in the world, to have a strong leader again.

2023/01/18,"Tesla and Audi are the first two automakers to participate in the Global Battery Alliance’s battery passport proof-of-concept. You can take a look at what it looks like here.
As we recently reported, the Global Battery Alliance (GAB) is pushing a new solution called a “Battery Passport” to the problem of tracking battery materials.
GAB is an industry group made up of over 100 companies involved in the EV battery supply chain from mining companies like Glencore to automakers like Tesla and battery cell makers like LG. The group’s goal is to “help establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030.”
One of the first steps in making a sustainable battery value chain is to understand where all materials in a battery cell come from, which is harder than one might think. A battery cell is mainly made up of a cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte, and each of these parts is made of several different materials that need to be processed.
From mining to processing to assembly, it can be hard to know where every part of a battery cell came from, which is important to know to make sure the entire value chain is sustainable.
In November, we reported that a Tesla executive and an Investissement Québec director are leading the project.
Now GAB has announced that it has released the first proof-of-concept:
The Global Battery Alliance (“GBA”), the world’s largest multi-stakeholder organisation to establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030, today launched the proof of concept for its Battery Passport at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos.
Tesla and Audi are the first two automakers to participate in the proof-of-concept.
Tesla only did it for cobalt on a long-range battery pack built in China for now. Here’s what it looks like:
Tesla was able to confirm that 100% of the cobalt in the battery cells come from Glencore’s Kamoto Copper Company in the Democratic Republic of Congo: 
As you can see, the report only accounts for about 1% of the battery materials in the battery pack, but the goal is to ultimately account for everyting.
You can check Tesla’s full proof-of-concept report here.
Audi also participated in the proof-of-concept, but it went a little more in-depth by adding lithium and accounting for about 10% of the pack materials.

2023/01/18,"Having already expanded into several countries throughout Europe, Build Your Dreams (BYD) has announced that sales of its EVs will begin in the UK this quarter. As the veteran Chinese automaker continues to expand its BEV production and sales presence around the globe, we wonder if 2023 is the year that BYD Auto usurps Tesla for the top spot in global sales. 
BYD Auto is the automotive subsidiary of BYD Company founded two decades ago to develop and produce passenger cars, buses, trucks, and forklifts for China. More recently, the company has begun manufacturing rechargeable batteries and eBikes while shifting its manufacturing focus to BEVs and plug-in hybrid EVs.
In fact, BYD produced its final combustion vehicle in March of 2022, refocusing its business on a future that is not only entirely electric, but is globally recognized. This past summer, BYD shared plans to begin selling its EVs in the Japanese market. Just ten days later, the company followed up by promising EV deliveries in Germany and Sweden before the end of 2022.
With a current sales presence in the countries above plus Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium, BYD capped off the year by sharing plans for at least one, if not two, manufacturing facilities in Europe to support these markets and beyond. BYD continues to gain momentum headed into 2023, following a very successful year prior.
Now, the automaker plans to begin sales in the UK, another huge global market and a growing one for EVs especially. One where BYD can continue to try and compete against the current sales leader, Tesla. Even in China, BYD has pulled no punches in stating its BEVs are designed to compete against Tesla, and some have projected the former will overtake the latter in global EV sales this year.
That’s true, but this is Electrek, so we’re gonna focus on BEV sales. By beginning UK sales this quarter with the ATTO 3 seen above, BYD has added one of Europe’s largest market to its order sheet – one that saw BEV models account for roughly 17% of deliveries in 2022, overtaking diesel for the first time ever.
When you combine BYD’s six countries in Europe beginning EV sales with its current and expanding markets in Asia and Australia, then recognize the company’s widening manufacturing footprint, it’s hard to argue it’s recipe for success. At the very least, we’ll be able to look back and say BYD swung for the fences, but will it be enough to overtake Tesla?
BYD is very present in Latin America. Here they already sell a lot more than Tesla, as they are not present. Although there is more volume for sales in the west, the world is much bigger than US and EU.
According to BloombergNEF, BYD already overtook Tesla in global EV sales last year, but only if you count PHEVs and we’re simply not going to do that. We would like to point out, however, that Bloomberg is still projecting BYD to overtake Tesla in BEV sales as early as this year.
BNEF was the first to say that betting against Tesla has never fared well for those naysayers, but BYD’s 2022 sales numbers cannot be ignored. The Chinese automaker sold 911,140 BEVs last year, compared to 321,000 in 2021. That’s an 184% sales increase YOY. 
The outlet expects Tesla’s BEV sales to grow by 30-40% this year on the wings of ramped up production at GigaBerlin and Austin, but it may come down to pricing and how many consumers Tesla can steal away from BYD and vice-versa. Despite BYD’s global expansion, much of its sales strength still comes from the Chinese market, another region Tesla EVs are sold. BYD’s distribution of sales could shift, however, as it gets its European manufacturing operational and assumedly expands to more and more markets.
Could BYD bring the fight to Tesla’s home turf in the US? The company isn’t showing its hand yet, so the immediate focus appears to be on Europe and Asia for now. But that could prove interesting in the future and could really put the BYD brand on the global map as a BEV automaker to be considered.

2023/01/18,"Tesla has increased the price of its home charging station by 20% after several price drops made it the cheapest option available. 
Last year, Tesla surprised many by announcing that it is opening its EV charge connector with the aim of making it the new standard in North America.
The automaker is challenging the J1772/CCS combo connector, which has been adopted by virtually all other automakers selling vehicles in North America, in the hope that its sleeker and more powerful design will win by force of sheer numbers.
Tesla dominates the EV market in America to such a degree that even though all other automakers currently selling EVs on the market are using the J1772/CCS connector, there are still more EVs in North America using the Tesla connector, now known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
Following the opening of the connector, Tesla has been making some moves to push its charging station – also known as Tesla Wall Connector.
For example, Tesla started selling its Wall Connector at Best Buy last year instead of only through its own website.
Tesla also significantly decreased the price of the charging station over the years.
The Tesla Wall Connector was already cheap for a 48 amp, level 2 home charging station at $400, but Tesla dropped the price to $350 in December.
Just a month later, Tesla has now decided to increase the price by more than 20% to $425 on its website:
I thought Tesla's wall charger price was a little under priced for an OEM product.  I was surprised.  Even looking online, most J1772 wall chargers are $450 or higher.  So even at $425, it's still under the aftermarket options.  Normally aftermarket stuff is supposed to be cheaper.  
The price has also gone up to $425 on Best Buy, which appears to be carrying the Tesla Wall Connector in inventory based on the short delivery time.
Interesting move. The price dropped significantly just a month ago and now it’s back up by 20%?
We know that Tesla is having a massive surge in orders right now thanks to the recent price drops. Maybe the automaker thinks it can recapture some of that through the Wall Connector – though obviously, we are only talking about $75.
But $75 on, let’s say, 200,000 car orders that decide to add the Wall Connector this quarter, that would mean $15 million in additional profits for Tesla. It’s not bad.

2023/01/17,"There are a lot of media reports about Tesla having “staged” or “faked” a self-driving video in 2016 today after the testimony of a Tesla Autopilot executive was released, but here’s the full story.
In 2016, Tesla announced that all of its vehicles going forward would be equipped with the hardware necessary to achieve full self-driving capability through software updates in the future.
Seven years later, Tesla has yet to deliver on that promise, but the company is still promising it and releasing software updates that bring the capability closer.
After making the announcement in 2016, Tesla released a video demonstration of its self-drivng technology.
The video showed a Model X driving by itself around the Bay Area for a few miles – navigating some stop signs and traffic lights before entering Tesla’s parking lot.
Here’s the full video:
That was seven years ago, so why are we talking about it now?
Today, a lot of media reports are coming out with headlines about Tesla having “staged” or “faked” the video.
Those reports are all based on the testimony of Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot software at Tesla, as part of the discovery for CEO Elon Musk’s trial brought by shareholders over claims that he misled them. 
In his testimony, Elluswamy confirmed that Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route to create the video. He also said that Tesla did the run multiple times and that the test drivers intervened on several occasions.
The engineer added:
“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system.” 
Elluswamy also confirmed that the Autopilot team put the video together as a “demonstration of the system’s capabilities” at the request of Musk.
We already knew that Tesla had to do all of that to create the video back in 2017.
In 2017, Tesla released its Disengagement of Autonomous Mode report with the California DMV and confirmed that it drove 550 autonomous miles in self-driving test vehicles with 168 disengagement events in 2016.
While the data was for the whole year of 2016, all of the miles were driven within the few weeks leading up to the demonstration video.
Tesla clearly didn’t have the capacity to release a self-driving system at the time because it had only just begun designing its own self-driving technology after stepping away from Mobileye’s driver assist system.
As we reported in 2017, Tesla ran a pre-determined route many times over in order for the system to be able to do it once without disengagement for the video.
There’s an argument that the video is indeed “staged” based on that, but the real thing in contention is that the video starts with Tesla saying this:
“The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”
I'm not sure why 'staged' is in scare quotes. A video that requires multiple takes to have a car follow a pre-mapped route without driver intervention is unquestionably a staged video. That's not necessarily bad if they presented it as a vision for the future, but the video plainly states that the driver is only there for legal purposes even though the driver was there as a safety measure to take over when the system (frequently) disengaged...
Some think that the comment is inaccurate, but the car is actually driving itself in the video, which is unedited. It’s just that it can’t do it off the lot. Tesla had to custom-build software and maps for it, but the automaker never claimed otherwise.
I’m not sure why the media decided to run with those comments because they don’t really add anything new that we didn’t know since 2017.
It’s certainly not an ideal presentation of the video, but I also don’t think you can make the point that Tesla lied or was even misleading with the video. It was showing what it planned to achieve with its self-driving and that it could do it right now with some custom software. The video showed the car navigating this route by itself.
And, in fact, now Tesla could do this same route with an off-the-lot vehicle equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta.

2023/01/17,"Tesla (TSLA) is currently experiencing “unprecedented demand” in the US following the significant price cuts that happened last week.
Many stores are hitting new records and inventories are dwindling.
Last week, Tesla implemented massive price cuts of up to $13,000 on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the US.
The automaker tried to claim that the price cuts were due to a “partial normalization of the cost inflation,” but most industry experts agree that Tesla needed the price cuts to create demand.
A week later, Electrek can confirm that the price cuts are working in doing just that.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that many Tesla stores in North America had reached their new record for sales in a single week. One source familiar with Tesla’s sales said that the company is experiencing “unprecedented demand” in North America following the price cuts.
Tesla saw similar action in China after price cuts there. 
The inventory is decreasing at a record rate in several key US markets. As for new custom orders, Tesla will likely run out of build slots for the North American market in the next few days.
That usually doesn’t happen until much later in a quarter.
I don't even think of it as a price cut, but as the end of the price gouging. The MYLR is now back down to... exactly what I paid for it 2 and a half years ago when I bought mine. Some of the stuff going into it costs more now, but I bought about 2 months into the production run so surely they are more efficient now. Meaning the overall margin is probably about what it was when I bought mine. In the meantime they've raked in a huge pile of cash. Which, thankfully, they have spent on building manufacturing capacity rather than dividends and stock buybacks. As a TSLA holder, I am glad they rolled the cash into future capacity rather than a quick profit grab. (If they do run a buyback I'm taking the gain and investing somewhere else. I think buybacks should be almost completely prohibited.)
On top of the direct price cuts increasing sales, many Tesla models are now eligible to the new $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles in the US. In some cases, this reduces the cost of some Tesla vehicles by as much as 30% compared to last year.
As I stated last week, we knew that the price cuts would work, but we didn’t know to what degree; now it’s good to see that it is creating new record demand in several markets.
We are also now seeing some other automakers reducing prices significantly, like Xpeng today.
It looks like Tesla might have started an EV price war, and I think it is in a position to win it.

2023/01/17,"Hertz and Uber announced today that they are expanding their partnership to electrify their fleets, and they are deploying 25,000 electric cars in Europe.
In 2020, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles to be delivered over the next year.
Shortly after, Hertz announced that on top of adding Tesla vehicles to its rental fleet, the company also made a deal with Uber to offer its drivers access to the Tesla vehicles. Fifty-thousand Tesla vehicles will be offered for rent to Uber drivers, and the company has an option for more if the program is successful.
As of last summer, we learned that Uber drivers were already using 15,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles through the deal with Hertz. 
Now Hertz has confirmed that nearly 50,000 Uber drivers have rented a Tesla through this program.
Building on that success, the rental car company is now partnering with Uber to bring electric vehicles to Europe:
Hertz and Uber today announced a European expansion to their successful North American partnership through which Hertz will make up to 25,000 electric vehicles (EVs) available to Uber drivers in European capital cities by 2025. A wide range of suitable EVs will be on offer, including vehicles from Tesla and Polestar.
After the large Tesla deal to buy 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, Hertz also added Tesla Model Y vehicles and Polestar 2.
The press release about the European expansion indicates that those three electric vehicles are still going to be the main ones deployed through the deal. 
Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO, commented on the announcement: 
As the largest mobility platform in the world, we know that our impact goes beyond our technology. Climate change is the most urgent global challenge which we must all tackle together – now is the time to accelerate. Expanding our partnership with Hertz into Europe will significantly boost our transition to zero-emissions, helping drivers reduce running costs and cleaning up urban transport. We aim to become a 100% electric platform across Europe by 2030.
The deal should significantly increase the number of electric vehicles on Uber’s ridesharing fleet across Europe and bring them closer to their goal of only operating with electric vehicles by the end of the decade.

2023/01/16,"Tesla has clandestinely downgraded its performance brakes on the Model Y Performance and even put a cover to hide the change in a deceptive move.
When going from a Model Y Long Range to Model Y Performance, the biggest difference is arguably the performance brakes.
You also get faster acceleration and higher top speed, but those are basically software unlocked since the powertrain in the vehicles is virtually the same.
There are also bigger wheels, but that’s a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it.
The bigger Brembo brakes are arguably the most significant upgrade for the money to move up to the top-performance version.
However, we now learn that Tesla has downgraded the brakes and has done it in a very sneaky and deceiving way.
ZEV Centric, a company building accessories for Tesla vehicles, spotted and exposed the change.
The company was working on some customers’ Model Ys and some of their own Model Y vehicles and discovered the downgrade:
We already have a 2020 MYLR and a 2022 MYP that belong to other members of the company and now have added a company owned 2023 MYP to further develop. We brought all 3 into the office to do some comparisons and a quick tear down. It was at this time that we opted to snap some photos, shoot some video, take some measurements, and reveal what is hiding behind the rear covers. Little did we know that not many people were aware of this downgrade and Tesla still markets it as a performance upgrade on their website.
The Performance upgrade on the Model Y brings a rear Brembo caliper and a 2mm thicker rotor with additional venting features.
The company spotted this around September when Tesla started to replace that Brembo caliper (right) with a new Mando brake (left):
People wanting to see compared performance between the mando and the brembo are missing the point entirely. 

Tesla lists performance brakes as an upgrade on the performance model compared to the long range. Model Y performance and model Y long range come with identical front brembo brakes (lr painted silver and p painted red), they always have and they still do. 

Prior to August 2022, model Y performance came with rear brembo brakes, model y long range had smaller mando. After August 2022, both model Y performance and model Y long range have the same mando in the back. 

The language on the website has not changed, it still lists a performance brake upgrade for the performance model, despite all models after August 2022 having the same brakes front and rear. The only difference is the cosmetic red paint. Tesla now needs to clarify that performance brakes means red paint, or better yet, remove the performance framing. 
The company now says that the rotor is 2mm thinner with the downgrade.
Here’s also a comparison of the brake pads on both calipers, which clearly shows the Brembo to be more significant in size:
ZEV Centric, who are brake experts, believes this is a significant downgrade and believes Tesla should provide them with the Brembo brakes since the change was not indicated on Tesla’s Model Y configurator.
Tesla has been known to implement cost-cutting efforts by removing features over the last few years, such as removing passenger lumbar support controls and ultrasonic sensors.

2023/01/16,"Tesla has been spotted assembling its giant new casting machine for Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas.
Last year, Idra, the maker of Tesla’s large casting press, teased a new 9,000-ton Giga Press that would take the prize as largest in the world. Considering Tesla’s relationship with Idra, it was rumored that the new machine would be for the automaker.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has since confirmed that the machine is going to be used for the Cybertruck body at Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla’s investment in larger cast parts has been extremely successful so far. The automaker managed to produce the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle, and it is doing the same with the front underbody.
This greatly simplifies the manufacturing process and reduces costs.
Following the success of the integration of large casting technology, several other automakers are apparently looking to follow in Tesla’s footsteps.
Idra reported last year that half a dozen other automakers are currently in talks to adopt the technology, but it could take years before they can integrate it into any vehicle programs.
But as for Tesla, the automaker is already moving into a wider integration of the technology, including with the Cybertruck, which is going to have even larger single casting parts.
Over the last few months, Tesla has been spotted getting deliveries of parts of the massive press from Idra.
Now a new drone flyover of Gigafactory Texas that managed to peek inside the factory showed that Tesla is currently assembling the new 9-ton Giga Press:
The giant machine has been spotted partly assembled in a section of the factory where Tesla plans to build the Cybertruck’s body:
There are a lot of eyes on the Cybertruck production program.
There are about 1.5 million people interested in the Tesla Cybertruck, and they have been starved of information for a while.
An update on the production version with final specs and pricing has been expected for the past year, but the automaker has decided to stay quiet about the electric truck, which already had some delays.
is it legal to use a drone to film inside a window like that? I was under the impression that going to extraordinary means to peep into a window violates the expectation of privacy. For instance, you can take ground level photos from the street through a window into a building because there is no expectation of privacy in that case, but you can’t scale a tree and take photos through someone’s second floor window without violating their expectation of privacy. 


When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory (that being delayed as well), it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023, and in June, Musk said that Tesla is aiming for production to start in mid-2023.
In its communications, Tesla has stuck to a mid-2023 timeline over the last few months. Therefore, it’s important to see Tesla making progress on some of those critical new production tools like this Giga Press in order for the automaker to stick to its timeline.

2023/01/13,"Tesla has commented on the new massive overnight price cuts on Model 3 and Model Y and claimed that they are due to “a partial normalization of cost inflation.”
We reported last night that Tesla implemented massive price cuts of up to $13,000 on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the US.
Similar price cuts are being reported in other markets, such as Canada and Europe.
While Tesla doesn’t have global or US press relations department to ask the company to comment on those price cuts, it still does in some markets, and a Tesla spokesperson in Germany commented on it.
The Tesla spokesperson tried to claim the price drop was due to “a partial normalization of cost inflation”:
At the end of a turbulent year with interruptions to the supply chain, we have achieved a partial normalisation of cost inflation, which gives us the confidence to pass this relief onto our customers,
This mirrors comments made by a Tesla China executive after a similar price drop in the market last week.
The price drop in some markets marks the first time Tesla has reduced prices after almost two years of gradually raising them to new all-time highs.
I am happy to see Tesla vehicles being much more accessible, but I honestly don’t know who is buying this explanation.
Let’s be honest, Tesla is significantly slashing prices right now because it has to. It needs to increase demand to match its new production capacity.
Tesla gradually and incrementally increased prices for two years during the rise in inflation. And honestly, we already knew that inflation wasn’t the only reason. Yes, it was partly contributing to the price increases, but Tesla was also just increasing the prices because demand allowed it. That is made clear by its gross margins gradually increasing while raising those prices.
Now Tesla wants us to believe that it is basically erasing those two years of incremental price increases “due to inflation” because of a “partial normalization of cost inflation.”
I don't know.  Makes sense to me.  
I work for a large automotive parts supplier in the plastics area.

Chemical prices are almost back to pre pandemic levels, except for some specialty materials that are still constrained.

Shipping containers from Asia are back to almost pre pandemic levels.

Direct labour costs are up a bit, but doesn't affect prices that much.
I don’t think so. It has more to do with the fact that Tesla had its two biggest discrepancies between cars produced and cars delivered during the last two quarters, and now it finds itself with a lot of cars in inventory in some markets early in a new quarter.
However, an interesting aspect is that Tesla can actually afford to cut the prices by that much thanks to its industry-leading gross margin.
The price drops are significant enough that Tesla is now undercutting many other new EVs coming from the competition.
It is certainly making the EV market much more interesting, especially in the US with the new tax credit coming into effect. 
",tesla
2023/01/12,"Tesla has massively cut prices across new models in the US (update: and Europe), with the largest price drop occurring on the Model Y, which is now $13K and 20% cheaper than it was yesterday.
The changes just happened on Tesla’s website and seem to cover all models.
Over the course of the last year or so, Tesla has continually raised prices on all of its vehicles as demand for EVs has been extremely high. While Tesla’s sales and production have been growing rapidly, demand for EVs has also been growing, and supply of EVs has not been able to keep up.
Other automakers have been raising prices too, though some more modest than others.
But in recent weeks we’ve finally seen some signs that Tesla might need to shore up demand, or at least that the price hikes have gone a little too far. The first and most aggressive cuts so far had been in China, but several other markets are seeing discounts and incentives added to help move vehicles as inventory has grown.
These price drops even led to protests in China from recent buyers who felt like they overpaid, to whom Tesla declined to offer compensation.
Below are the new and old prices for Tesla’s various models in the US. Similar price drops happened in Europe, though you’ll have to look country-to-country for those.
Other configurations, including Performance models, have also received price cuts, with the largest being the $21K (15%) reduction on the “Plaid” Model S. However, there is one significant price hike – the seven-seat option on the Model Y is now $4,000, rather than the $3,000 it used to be.
Among other things, this means that the base five-seat Model Y now qualifies for the $7,500 EV tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. The five-seat Model Y configuration was previously left out of qualifying since it’s considered a “car” rather than an “SUV” by government rules, which take into account a number of factors. This means that it needs an MSRP of under $55K to qualify, which base models now do.
So in addition to the $13,000 price drop, the base Model Y is another $7,500 cheaper for those who qualify for the full tax credit, meaning a Model Y ordered today could be more than $20K cheaper than one ordered yesterday – assuming delivery is taken before mid-March, when the tax credit is expected to be reduced to $3,750.
Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called for the government to reconsider this longstanding definition of “SUV,” which has been in place since before the Model Y went into production. He asked his followers to comment on the matter, but the public comment link in question looks to pertain to an annual update to the tax credit form, not to the tax credit qualifications themselves (his company’s lawyers might have told him about this, or he might have read it himself, if he weren’t spending all of his time doomscrolling on Twitter).
Previously, Musk had called for the government not to pass the bill extending tax credits, saying that Tesla did not need these credits to be successful. 
After a year of price hikes, it’s about time that we got a few price drops. Tesla may now be the top luxury brand in the US, but the original concept behind the Model 3 and Y were to be the “people’s vehicles,” closer to the low-end of the luxury segment than the mid- or high-end.
I really didn’t want to get another Tesla, but gotta admit, the Y at that price with the $7500 tax credit is tempting. 
The original launch price of the Model 3 was supposed to be $35K, and the Model Y was supposed to be $40K.
Yesterday’s prices of $46,990 and $65,990 (!) didn’t look anything like those original numbers, so it’s great to now see some prices a lot closer – still not quite there, even after the federal tax credit, but closer.
And, while there definitely seem to be demand concerns across various markets, including North America, much of this must be attributable to the large price rises Teslas have seen in the last year. These cuts finally get us heading in the right direction in terms of price, and should spur significant additional demand. But in addition, CEO Musk has been doing his part to turn customers away with his social media antics, causing many people who would otherwise consider Teslas to look at other brands instead.
These price cuts will reverse the price portion of Tesla’s demand concerns, but it remains to be seen whether customers will remain turned off by the brand destruction to which its CEO seems committed.

2023/01/12,"Tesla has secured a new 1 million-square-foot building near Brookshire, Texas. It’s not known what it’s for yet, but there’s a rumor that it is for battery storage.
Since launching its Gigafactory Texas effort in Austin two years ago and then moving its headquarters to the same location, Tesla has rapidly expanded in the state and has very much become a “Texas company.”
More recently, Tesla started working on a new lithium refinery just outside of Corpus Christi, Texas.
Now we learn that Tesla has secured a new lease on a large building in Brookshire, Texas, just outside of Houston.
The Houston Chronicle first reported on Tesla securing the lease:
Little is known about Tesla’s plans, but the Fortune 500 company signed a lease late last year for about 1.03 million square feet at 111 Empire West, part of the 300-acre Empire West Business Park in Brookshire, according to research reports from real estate brokerages Cushman & Wakefield and Savills. The landlord and developer of the park, Dallas-based Stream Realty Partners, declined to comment. Tesla officials did not respond to a request for comment. 
Mike Barnes, Brookshire’s interim city administrator, commented on the project:
We’re familiar with the Tesla project primarily from a permitting perspective. Some of their engineering-construction folks have come in with regards to initiating some dialogue.
While there’s no official word on Tesla’s plan for the large facility, the automaker already has some job openings at the location that are giving us some hints.
It sounds like it is going to involve both a warehouse and production.
Tesla writes in the description for an “Associate Manager, Production Control” position in Brookshire:
As an Associate Manager of Production Control, you will have the responsibility to design and oversee material handing functions at Gigafactory Texas. You will lead a team of Supervisors and take a KPI driven approach toward meeting daily operational objectives. In this role, you will work cross-functionally with inventory control, Production Control process, and various other supply and logistics organizations to solve problems, drive continuous improvement, and to achieve production targets.
The job also mentions a “Cell Materials production area,” indicating that the location might produce materials for cell production at Gigafactory Texas.

2023/01/12,"Tesla released a white paper on its new string solar inverter and claims that it is much cheaper than competing inverter solutions from Enphase and SolarEdge.
In 2021, Tesla launched its own solar inverter for the first time.
Over the last few years, the company has started to integrate it increasingly into its own solar installations, and it also supplies it to other solar installers through its certified installer program.
Electrek has now obtained a white paper about its solar inverter that Tesla has been sharing around.
Tesla explained in the white paper’s summary:
Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. To speed up the adoption of solar and storage in the residential energy sector, we’ve focused on providing products specifically designed for both the system owner and the installer. To develop the Tesla Solar Inverter, we leveraged our deep industry experience to design an inverter that offered the best value for system owners, while being easy to install, maintain, and service.
Tesla’s main claim in the paper is that its string inverter solution is cheaper at the purchase and through the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE).
In the paper, Tesla admits that its solution results in a lower production by about 1 or 2%:
We then assessed the real-world performance data of these sites to characterize the effects of inverter type on the system’s output. We compared actual system performance data of sites with different inverter types but similar SES, ensuring only similar roofs were compared. For the homes that are good for solar (SES 6-10), sites that used optimizers saw energy production gains of 1-2% compared to homes that used Tesla Solar Inverters. When comparing the cost of Tesla Solar Inverter with MLPEs, it begged the question whether the production gains were worth the increased cost of the MLPEs.
The leading solar inverter company using optimizers is SolarEdge, which Tesla mentions in the white paper and appears to compare its solution to in this case.
Electrek contacted SolarEdge for a comment on the comparison, and we will update if we get an answer.
In the paper, Tesla claims that the trade-off for the lower output was worth it since its analysis resulted in a 6% lower Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):
To answer this question, an LCOE analysis was performed to compare two 8 kW solar systems4. In the base-case scenario, our analysis found that the Tesla system had a 6% lower LCOE for the most common SES5. We also found that, for 93% of sites in the sample, Tesla had a lower LCOE. The difference in LCOE is driven entirely by higher inverter equipment costs. Further, the gap between LCOEs for SES 8 roofs expands to approximately 15% after factoring in the potential failures of optimizers during the service life6. These findings prove that over the system’s lifetime, the Tesla Solar Inverter will provide energy at a better value for most customers.
Tesla also claims that its string solar inverter results in benefits for installers in terms of ease of installation and site design process.
Here’s the full white paper:
The white paper reads more like a sale brochure than a scientific paper, but it doesn’t mean that the data is inaccurate.
I also found it interesting that the white paper also focused on the “Tesla ecosystem”:
For the customer, Tesla Solar Inverter completes their Tesla ecosystem. System owners use a single app to monitor and manage their entire home energy system. Instead of sorting through multiple apps to make sure all devices are working properly, the Tesla app displays all Tesla products, including solar, Tesla vehicles, and charging. The intuitive app experience allows the customer to view and manage home energy usage across these devices, with the system optimizing for savings and efficiency. As new features are developed, they are automatically made available in the Tesla app, ensuring customers can unlock the full potential of their home energy system.
Comparing a string inverter with other string inverters would be an apples to apples comparison for a cost comparison of Tesla's design vs someone else's design.

Comparing them with microinverters is not.   There are advantages and disadvantages that drive the choice of a string inverter vs microinverters.
We have been seeing a shift in Tesla’s solar business lately where the company appears to be focusing more on providing its ecosystem supported mainly by the Powerwall, and now, the solar inverter.
I think eventually that might be Tesla’s primary approach to achieving scale with its new Tesla Electric business. 
If you find yourself in this situation or even just want to check out other options to make sure you’re finding a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage. EnergySage is a free service that makes it easy for you to go solar – whether you’re a homeowner or renter.

2023/01/11,"Tesla has become the top luxury brand in the US automotive market – the first time an American automaker claims the title.
For a few years now, Tesla vehicles have dominated many luxury segments in sales in the United States.
However, due to the limited number of models available, four to be exact, other automakers could still be top sellers overs – meaning that Tesla models are often best-selling in their own segments, but Tesla as an overall brand is not.
Foreign automakers, especially German automakers like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have historically been dominant.
But with recent increases in production capacity, Tesla is now delivering more volume in the United States even with just four models.
Now Tesla has taken the top luxury automotive position for the first time in the United States and, according to Automotive News, it’s the first time in almost 25 years that the position has been held by an American automaker.
Tesla doesn’t break down sales per market, and therefore, we have to use registration data and estimates.
The data is not perfect, but everything points to a massive beat by Tesla in 2022.
Here are the top eight best-selling luxury brands in the United States in 2022:
In 2021, BMW had beaten Tesla by about 23,000 units based on estimates.
I have been daily driving Teslas for 10 years. Many will argue whether Tesla is luxury, premium, or ordinary. I really don't care. The simplicity of the design (interior and exterior) suits my tastes and needs. The interior I find soothing and I enjoy the absence of chaos (knobs, dials, switches, vents, etc.). Less is more. Tesla's philosophy of quiet, smooth, quick appeals to my senses. The exterior is also simpler than most. I still find the original Tesla Model S wonderfully and timelessly attractive.

Teslas are not for everyone or every taste. I loved my father's Jaguar XJ sedan, the exterior and especially the interior. That car had a beautiful, rich,  LUXURIOUS interior and it smelled wonderful. Sadly, the Jag had limitations, notably reliability, mechanical and electronic. Lucas is an evil sidekick.

I have owned and driven Mercedes Benzes, BMWs, Porsches, Audis, Lexus, Maseratis, Bentleys, and a few Rollers. IMO, the top of the line MB and BMWs are quite excellent but I find Bentleys are the most luxurious in my book. A rich and elegant interior and exteror. However, I choose to drive Teslas because they are simpler and make me feel comfortable. Many of my friends find Teslas very spartan and not rich and elegant and in a word cheap. We each have our taste and our own sense of style. Teslas work for me and that is all that matters. To each his or her own. Happy trails.

Now it appears that Tesla is the leader by easily 100,000 vehicles, thanks a significant production ramp last year.
It’s good to see an all-electric automaker taking the position for the first time. It’s also special that it’s an American automaker for the first time in a quarter of a century in the US market.
Interestingly, I often meet people who don’t even realize that Tesla is an American automaker, even though it’s arguably the most American automaker based on the percentage of American parts in Tesla’s vehicles.
Now, of course, that’s just the luxury segment, but I think the days where the top overall automakers are all-electric ones are coming sooner than most people think.

2023/01/11,"Tesla vehicles moved almost 100,000 people inside the Boring Company tunnels under Las Vegas in only a few days during CES last week.
The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is The Boring Company’s first full-scale loop project currently in commercial use.
Elon Musk’s tunneling start-up completed the $50 million project in just over a year.
A Boring Company Loop system consists of tunnels in which Tesla electric vehicles travel at high speeds between stations to transport people within a city.
While the ambition is to have complex tunnel systems underneath entire cities, the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is only 1.5 miles long with three stops. The company also added a stop at the Resorts World’s hotel and casino, which is one of the closest ones to the convention center.
Last year, The Boring Company obtained approval to expand the Loop to the whole city with 29 miles and 51 stations planned in Las Vegas.
But while it is expanding the tunnel network, it is operating in what is commonly referred to as the LVCVA Loop – the system had a big week with CES last week, which is often attended by over 100,000 people in just a few days.
The Boring Company has now released some data about the performance and confirmed over 94,000 passengers travel in the LVCVA loop. The company also said it moved over 10,000 passengers to and from Resorts World.
The company also said that the rides were, on average, less than 2 minutes, and the average wait time to get a Tesla vehicle was less than 10 seconds.
Imagine the capacity if they used a longer vehicle, perhaps with many cabins somehow connected!
Then to reduce friction and risks they could put some kind of metal rail the cars could ride on. This would also mean no need for tires!

Has anyone ever thought of this before? Some kind of a way that is subterranean?
For a while, we didn’t have any data about the real-world capacity of the system. This is still a smaller application of it, but it’s still interesting to get some hard data for the first time.
I know that many don’t get how this is better than a subway system, but I don’t know if this is the best comparison.
I think the biggest difference is the cost to build the tunnels for a single car width with The Boring Company is so much cheaper than building a subway system that it can enable more direct transport to specific locations.
Also, the cost should go down over time in terms of the construction with The Boring Company’s technology and Tesla eventually enabling driverless use inside the tunnels.

2023/01/11,"Tesla is again rumored to be nearing a deal to build a factory in Indonesia, which would secure a lot of nickel supply for the automaker.
There have been rumors about Tesla setting up shop in Indonesia for years.
In 2020, we reported on Tesla allegedly being in talks with the Indonesian government to build a new nickel venture in the country, which has a strong nickel reserve – nickel is one of the main materials used in the production of cathodes for battery cells used in electric vehicles. The move came after CEO Elon Musk pleaded with mining companies to increase their nickel production.
As we detailed in our previous report on Tesla’s interest in Indonesia, the country is one of the world’s biggest nickel producers, but it has also recently put a ban on exporting nickel ore in order to encourage the industry to process it locally.
Indonesia hopes that the measure will encourage companies to invest in manufacturing finished products in the country using their nickel, such as batteries.
There has certainly been strong interest from Tesla to establish a relationship with Indonesia.
Last year, Tesla sent a group to Indonesia to talk with the government, and Elon Musk met with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.
However, the automaker’s actual intentions in the country have not been clear, and rumors have been all over the place.
In May 2022, Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said that Tesla had “agreed” to “build a battery and electric vehicle plant.” At the time, we noted that the comment should be taken with a grain of salt at this point since the government seems to still be negotiating with Tesla.
A few months later, a government official said that Tesla secured a deal for $5 billion worth of nickel in Indonesia, but half a year later, there’s still no word from Tesla about the deal.
Now the rumors are starting back up with a report from Bloomberg stating that Tesla is nearing a preliminary deal for a factory in the country.
While the kind of factory Tesla planned to build in Indonesia has been unclear, the report claims that Tesla actually plans to build electric cars:
The plant would produce as many as 1 million cars a year, the people said, in line with Tesla’s ambition for all its factories globally to eventually reach that capacity. The discussions include plans for multiple facilities in the country serving different functions, including production and supply chain, one of the people said. A deal hasn’t been signed and the agreement could still fall through, said the people, asking not to be identified as the talks are confidential.
But at this point, there have been nonstop rumors about Tesla “nearing” a deal with Indonesia over the last two years. So I would take this, too, with a grain of salt.

2023/01/11,"Footage of the Tesla vehicle allegedly on “Full Self-Driving” that caused an eight-car crash pile-up in San Francisco in November has emerged.
It appears to show a classic case of phantom braking but also during Level 2 autonomy, the driver should have responded.
In November, an eight-car pile-up on the San Francisco Bay Bridge made the news after resulting in some minor injuries and blocking the traffic for over an hour.
But the headline was that the car that caused it was reportedly a “Tesla on self-driving mode,” or at least that’s what the driver told the police.
Now, as we know, Tesla does not have a “self-driving mode.” It has something it calls the “Full Self-Driving package,” which now includes Full Self-Driving Beta or FSD Beta.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name.
Following the accident, the driver of the Tesla told the police that the vehicle was in “Full self-driving mode,” but the police seemed to understand the nuances in the accident report:
P-1 stated V-1 was in Full self-driving mode at the time of the crash, I am unable to verify if V-1’s Full 24 Self-Driving Capability was active at the time of the crash. On 11/24/2022, the latest Tesla Full Self 25 Driving Beta Version was 11 and is classified as SAE Intemational Level 2. SAE International Level2 is 26 not classified as an autonomous vehicle. Under Level 2 classification, the human in the driver seat must 27 constantly supervise support features including steering, braking, or accelerating as needed to maintain 28 safety. If the FullSelfDriving Capability software malfunctioned, P-1 should of manually taken control of 29 V-1 by over-riding the FullSelf Driving Capability feature.
Was it phantom breaking, though? Phantom breaking does not trigger turn signals nor changes lane.

Isn't that the behaviour of Autopilot/FSD when the driver is inattentive for so long that the system disengages and tries to stop the car in a safe manner (which was obviously not safe in this situation).
Now The Intercept has obtained footage of the accident, and it clearly shows the Tesla vehicle abruptly coming to a stop for no apparent reason:
I obtained surveillance footage of the self-driving Tesla that abruptly stopped on the Bay Bridge, resulting in an eight-vehicle crash that injured 9 people including a 2 yr old child just hours after Musk announced the self-driving feature.Full story: https://t.co/LaEvX9TzxW pic.twitter.com/i75jSh2UpN
This phenomenon is often referred to as “phantom braking,” and it has been known to happen relatively frequently on Tesla Autopilot and FSD Beta.
Back in November of 2021, Electrek released a report called “Tesla has a serious phantom braking problem in Autopilot.” It highlighted a significant increase in Tesla owners reporting dangerous phantom braking events on Autopilot.
This issue was not new in Tesla’s Autopilot, but our report focused on Tesla drivers noticing an obvious increase in instances based on anecdotal evidence, but it was also backed by a clear increase in complaints to the NHTSA. Our report made the rounds in a few other outlets, but the issue didn’t really go mainstream until The Washington Post released a similar report in February 2022. A few months later, NHTSA opened an investigation into the matter.

2023/01/10,"Tesla has started to release its quarter Autopilot safety reports after stopping for a year. The automaker claims some improvements.
Since 2018, Tesla has been trying to create a benchmark for its improvement in Autopilot safety by releasing a quarterly report that compares the number of miles per accident on Autopilot versus off Autopilot.
The data was always limited and criticized for not taking into account that accidents are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highways, where Autopilot is mostly being used.
However, it was still helpful to compare it against itself over time and see if there were any improvements, and there were some incremental improvements at times.
Tesla suddenly stopped releasing those quarterly reports in 2022 without any explanation.
Now, the automaker has decided to start it up again and released reports for all quarters up to Q3 2022.
Tesla wrote for the most recent data:
In the 3rd quarter, we recorded one crash for every 6.26 million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology. For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology, we recorded one crash for every 1.71 million miles driven. By comparison, the most recent data available from NHTSA and FHWA (from 2021) shows that in the United States there was an automobile crash approximately every 652,000 miles.
That’s compared to one crash for every 4.35 million miles driven with Autopilot technology back in Q4 2021 – the last time Tesla was regularly releasing the data.
Tesla was also kind enough to plot the data into a chart this time for better visualization:
As you can see, it goes up and down, but that’s partly seasonal. There are notoriously more accidents during the winter due to road conditions and because it gets dark sooner.
Since Tesla stopped gathering the data, the automaker has also significantly grown its Full Self-Driving Beta program, which actually allows the use of more Autopilot technology on city roads.
However, it’s unclear whether Tesla includes this data in this report.
Fred, do you know if there are data available of the frequency of accidents among all cars of similar age to Tesla Autopilot cars (2014 or newer) occuring on highways?

That comparison to accident frequency for all vehicles in the US, including old and poorly maintained ones, and accidents that occur on city streets and secondary roads where Autopilot can't be used, always struck me as unfair.
I know. It’s a very limited dataset, and I too wish Tesla would be more transparent. But it’s the best we have right now, and it does show some improvements.
That’s what we have to work with for now.
As I recently reported, I genuinely hope Tesla would release more data specifically about its FSD Beta program so we can start seeing some solid numbers building a path to Tesla delivering on its self-driving promise.
The company restarting to release these reports might be a step in that direction. We will see.

2023/01/10,"Tesla has applied with the Texas state department of licensing for a massive $700 million expansion of Gigafactory Texas in Austin.
Gigafactory Texas is already a monstrously big factory. That becomes clear as you drive along it, which takes a while because it is almost a mile long.
Tesla is already producing Model Y vehicles at the factory, but the production lines are taking a small portion of the giant plant.
The automaker plans to add Cybertruck production in the existing facility and it has talked about expanding for future production of vehicle programs and battery production.
Today, we learn that Tesla filed for an expansion of the factory with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation yesterday.
The expansion includes a $717 million construction investment for an additional 1.4 million square-feet of space. In usual Tesla fashion, the company plans to move fast with construction starting as soon as the end of the month.
The Austin Business Journal listed the four projects as part of the expansion:
However, some of those expansion filings can be supplemental to previous plans.
For example, the Cathode plant is already under construction according to recent drone flyovers of the construction site. In the filings, Tesla writes that the projects are for new construction for “ground up and complete interior finish out of the [electric vehicle] manufacturing facility.”
Future products that are expected to eventually be built at the Gigafactory Texas site include Tesla Bot, the company’s humanoid robot, Tesla Semi, and its upcoming vehicles built on the Gen 3 vehicle platform.

2023/01/10,"Tesla is shutting down buyers in China who are protesting after missing out on significant price drops in the country. The company stated that it will not compensate them.
Last week, we reported on Tesla slashing prices in China, which raised demand concerns for the automaker in the important EV market.
The price drops on some Model 3 and Model Y trims were significant.
It resulted in many recent Tesla buyers protesting the price drop at Tesla stores as they claim Tesla misled them into buying at the end of last year while knowing the price drop was coming.
The protesters have continued their activities at Tesla stores and Tesla’s Shanghai factory throughout the weekend.
Yesterday, Tesla jumped on a WeChat group used by the protesters with its official account to tell them that they don’t plan to offer any compensation to buyers who took delivery last year.
Some claim that they will continue their effort despite Tesla shutting them down. One of the protesters at the Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai this weekend told the media:
We trusted the brand so much that we cancelled our orders for other brands for Tesla.
Separately, local reports in China, which we take with a grain of salt, are reporting that Tesla’s price drops are working in the market, with estimates ranging between 10,000 and 30,000 orders since the price drop.
The impact has been seen in Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y delivery timelines, which have increased a bit over the last few days.
I know it’s hard for many Tesla fans to sympathize with the protesters. I understand. They agreed to a price and bought it fully knowing the terms. Plus, there hasn’t been much protesting after the many other price increases from Tesla in China over the last two years.
Instant depreciation after the price drop would feel terrible for the owner but really thats life. Now if the advisor told them a different story then thats a valid issue. 
However, I am sure you can understand how frustration could arise if your Tesla adviser told you that there will be no upcoming price drop and that’s what convinced you to go ahead with your order.
That’s what many protesters are claiming.
With that said, I don’t think protesting will lead to anything. Tesla already made clear that they will not compensate people, and historically (and there’s a lot of history of Chinese Tesla customers protesting), it has never led to anything positive for customers.
On top of it, Tesla has been trigger-happy in suing people in China lately. I am not saying it’s warranted in this case, but I’d be careful.

2023/01/10,"Tesla Model 3 has ended the Toyota Camry’s 28-year run as the best-selling car in Australia and even drew a small reaction from Toyota.
For the last 28 years, the Camry has been the best-selling mid-size car in Australia.
It was on a path to make it 29 years, but Tesla delivered 1,806 Model 3 vehicles in December, bringing the total to 10,877 Model 3s in 2022 and beating the Camry, which had 9,538 units delivered last year.
It made the Tesla Model 3 the new best-selling mid-size car in Australia. It’s the first time that an electric car has held that title.
The change appears to have taken Toyota by surprise since the automaker still listed the Camry as a best-selling medium car in the country in its press release bragging about its dominance over the Australian auto market, but it had to add a mention of vehicles for less than $60,000:
Toyota vehicles were the best-selling models in nine market segments last year: Corolla (small cars), Camry (medium cars <$60K), RAV4 (medium SUVs), LandCruiser Prado (large SUVs), LandCruiser wagon (upper large SUVs), HiAce (light buses), HiAce (vans), HiLux (4×2 PU/CC) and HiLux (4×4 PU/CC).
The Model 3 starts at $64,000 in Australia compared to $30,000 for the Camry.
We are starting to see things like that in more and more markets every year. 
Impressive at double price. Sounds like Australia is coming along. Electric makes a lot of sense in a sunny country. With low prices in tesla shanghai that makes right hand side cars, it seems like a good opportunity to do fair prices in australia and sell a ton of them. steal the market.
Quite soon, only electric vehicles are going to be top-selling vehicles and Toyota is going to need a lot more of them if it still wants to be able to have those lists in its annual press releases.
The Japanese automaker has been falling behind when it comes to all-electric vehicles as it bet heavily on hybrids, which are just not cutting anymore.
Hopefully, things like that where an all-electric vehicle takes a 28-year title away from it would light a fire under them.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2023/01/09,"Tesla is continuing its discounts on its electric vehicles in several markets as inventory has piled up, which is abnormal for the automaker this early in the year.
While Tesla has a policy not to offer discounts on its vehicles, it has often broken that policy at the end of quarters in order to deliver as many vehicles as possible.
It reduces the number of vehicles in inventory, which looks good on the balance sheet for the quarterly results.
That’s exactly what happened last quarter when Tesla offered more significant discounts than ever in several markets, leading several analysts to believe Tesla was having some demand issues. Normally, the discounts end with the end of the quarter, but this time, Tesla has continued to offer discounts in the new year.
We already reported on Tesla slashing prices in China, but we have now learned that the automaker is also offering reduced prices in several other markets, including Australia, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan.
In Singapore, Tesla is offering a discount of $5,000 for people who trade in an existing internal combustion vehicle and another $5,000 credit to help cover the cost of the certificate to operate a car in Singapore.
That’s for existing inventory vehicles.
Tesla is also offering a free Wall Connector to new buyers.
The discount and price reductions are coming as Tesla happens to have some inventory build-ups, which is unusual for the automaker at the start of a new quarter. Tesla’s inventory is typically low in most markets early in a quarter, especially overseas where markets are waiting for new shipments.
But Tesla has had around a 50,000-vehicle discrepancy between vehicles produced and vehicles delivered over the last two quarters. This has resulted in some markets, especially outside the United States, having Tesla vehicle inventory early in the new year.
Market Bears Pricing model is now clearly indicating that the markets are no longer bearing the high prices.  Its time to drop the profit margin per vehicle and compensate with volume.  
We were already seeing some signs of demand issues for Tesla at the end of last quarter. Now, this pretty much confirms it.
Tesla has significantly increased its production capacity over the last year, and it looks like demand doesn’t quite match yet at the current prices.
Personally, I am not overly concerned for the automaker as I believe it will adapt and pull on some demand triggers to balance things out.
Obviously, the situation will affect its gross margin, but the automaker has some room to play there. However, it’s going to be essential to see if these demand issues continue throughout the year because it could become a problem over time.

2023/01/09,"Tesla is planning to remove a driver monitoring feature from Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta, and it got the attention of regulators.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program to improve performance with the goal of becoming safer than human drivers and adding more owners to it.
But it has yet to deliver on its promise to make a true self-driving system that can be approved by regulators.
For now, drivers are in charge, and Tesla monitors them to make sure they are paying attention and ready to take control.
There are two main ways Tesla monitors drivers: a front-facing camera tracking their attention and pressure detection on the steering wheel to try to keep their hands on it.
The latter has often been referred to as “steering wheel nag” since Tesla would send alerts to drivers to put their hands on the steering – nagging them to do so.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the company would remove the steering wheel nag for the FSD Beta owners with over 10,000 miles in the program in a tweet last week.
He said that the update would come this month, but he didn’t elaborate on the implementation.
The tweet caught the attention of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which confirmed that it contacted Tesla about the new initiative.
Presumably it would be pretty easy to test whether having either or both of the monitoring systems improves safety.  Personally it would not surprise me if the data said that only the camera monitoring actually adds safety 'value'.
NHTSA has already been investigating Tesla’s FSD Beta and, specifically, its capacity to monitor driver attention.
I don’t know if that’s a good idea, but I do know that the steering wheel nag is the worst part of Tesla’s driver monitoring system.
It doesn’t actually monitor whether or not the driver has their hands on the steering wheel. It can detect pressure being applied on the steering wheel, which can make the alerts sound annoying since you can get them while your hands are on the steering wheel.
So it’s not the worst thing that it is going away for some Beta testers, but at the same time, I think there are bigger things to worry about with the FSD Beta program.

2023/01/09,"Tesla is starting to hire for its new lithium refinery, which Elon Musk referred to as a “license to print money” in Corpus Christi, Texas.
In September 2022, we learned that Tesla has a plan to build a lithium refining facility on the Gulf Coast of Texas.
At the time, we knew very little about the project other than Tesla was planning on moving fast with hope to start building in Q4 2022.
A few months later, Tesla officially submitted the proposal for a project in Robstown, Texas, 25 minutes outside of Corpus Christi, with the purpose of  “developing a battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility, the first of its kind in North America, as well as facilities to support other types of battery materials processing, refining, and manufacturing and ancillary manufacturing operations in support of Tesla’s sustainable product line.”
Tesla also confirmed that it planned to invest $365 million in the lithium plant, which would employ about 165 people full-time plus another 250 construction jobs for about two years.
The hatred for Tesla on here is mind-numbing.
This will be looked back as a very wise decision in 2025 when booming EV demand creates even more of a lithium supply problem.
Why hasn't Tesla mined more lithium in Nevada even though they own land to do so? Because there is no place to refine it in north America. Now there will be.
Tesla will be the only automaker not paying crazy prices for lithium in the latter half of the decade.
It wasn’t clear what had happened to the proposal, but it now looks like it is moving forward as Tesla has started hiring for the lithium refinery.
Tesla has listed a new job opening for a “Project Scheduler” in Corpus Christi, and the automaker wrote in the job description:
As a project Scheduler, you will be playing a critical role in the construction of Tesla’s first lithium refinery plant near Corpus Christi, TX.  This role will support all project phases from engineering through commissioning of construction by providing project management with critical decision-making information that ensures projects are delivered on time. The Scheduler will collaborate closely with other functional teams throughout the project lifecycle to ensure accurate schedule development and reporting to track project performance.
Tesla is looking to move fast on the project, but the timeline to production is not clear at this point.
CEO Elon Musk has previously called lithium refining a “license to print money” due to the high margins in the industry, and he has encouraged more investment in the sector, especially in North America since the industry is dominated by China.

2023/01/06,"After starting the day deep in the red due to a price cut being announced in China, Tesla (TSLA) turned positive after crowds were reportedly flocking to stores to buy cars.
The only problem is that they were not there to buy but to protest.
Earlier today, we reported on Tesla slashing prices in China, which raised demand concerns for the automaker in the important EV market.
The price drops on some Model 3 and Model Y trims were significant, and while it will have a negative effect on the company’s gross margin, we expected that it would be successful in increasing sales.
The company’s stock (TSLA) was significantly down in premarket trading following the news.
Now Tesla investors and fans are sharing stories that buyers are crowding Tesla’s stores in China to buy following the price drops:
Crowd are buying telsa cars！$tsla @GerberKawasaki @elonmusk @garyblack00 @WholeMarsBlog @TeslaBoomerMama pic.twitter.com/UvfQiZ0qb8
Tesla’s stock has since turned positive and recovered from the drop that followed the price adjustment in China.
However, Electrek learned that most crowds going to Tesla stores are there actually to protest the price drops.
Several groups of recent Tesla buyers announced on Weibo that they were organizing protests at Tesla stores across the country. The protesters are sharing videos on China’s Weibo, and some of those videos are being shared in the US as customers rushing to buy following the price drop.
Tesla customers in China have a history of protesting following price drops. They first did so back in 2019 following a rare price drop from Tesla and then again in October 2022 following a price drop.
The company famously has a policy of having consistent pricing with no discount, but it has moved away from that strategy lately.
While reports of a price reduction were coming from China at the end of 2022, Tesla officials strongly denied them, but the company specifically mentioned that no further price increase would come in 2022.
Now, a few days after the end of the year, Tesla significantly dropped the price, and many customers who bought at the end of 2022 are frustrated.
Grace Tao, vice president of Tesla China, posted on Weibo today claiming that the price drop is actually linked to “engineering innovations” (translated from Chinese):
Behind Tesla’s price adjustments, h ere are countless engineering innovations, which are essentially unique and excellent laws of cost control: including not limited to vehicle integration design, production line design, supply chain management, and even millisecond-level optimization of robotic arm coordination Route… Start from “first principles” and insist on cost pricing. Respond to the country’s call with practical actions to promote economic development and release consumption potential. 2023 Let’s welcome a better life together.
However, many people are not buying this explanation. Historically, Tesla has increased gross margins with cost improvements and only adjusted pricing when needed to create demand.
Did you guys report that these price drops were coming as government incentives were coming to an end in China? I'll never understand people that get a government perk, rebate, etc and ALSO think they should have got the price drop. 
Normally, I wouldn’t get behind those protesters since they bought those vehicles for a price they agreed on, but it’s true that Tesla has been sending mixed messages to buyers in China.
Also, is anyone really buying Tao’s explanation? I see a lot of Tesla blogs running with it without questioning it, but that hasn’t been Tesla’s MO.
Why would you reduce pricing if people are buying at those prices? That has been Tesla’s way for the last two years.

2023/01/06,"Tesla is starting to offer a $700 round steering wheel retrofit for people who bought a Model S or Model X with a yoke steering wheel.
Yesterday, we reported on Tesla finally offering round steering as an option on Model S and Model X vehicles, which the automaker was only offering with its “yoke” steering wheel for the last two years. It was confusing to some why Tesla wouldn’t offer a regular steering wheel as an option in the first place.
Now it is finally an option for new buyers, and Tesla decided not to leave existing owners behind.
On its shop website, Tesla is now offering a Model S/X round steering wheel retrofit:
At a $700 cost, it is going to be a bit frustrating for current owners since it is now a free option on a new purchase, but they knew what they were buying.
Tesla writes about the retrofit in the description:
Travel in luxury. Enjoy the warmth of a heated wheel and the touch of premium vegan leather in a traditional form factor. No stalks or shifters.
The automaker also noted:
Note: This retrofit is only compatible with Model S and Model X vehicles configured with a Yoke Steering Wheel. Purchase price includes installation through Tesla Service.
Well, after 5 months with an X, I wish for 3 things: proper turn signals, a proper horn and a proper gear selector. I can handle the yoke, but in all fairness, it comes down to how well people will deal with it in an emergency - the 1% of the time. Grabbing for the wheel while maneuvering and coming up with air isn't a good thing.

I get what they're trying to accomplish, but in the end they're pushing the envelope too far as far as I'm concerned. If FSD was truly polished level 4 or 5, then I could see these items go. We're not there yet. 
According to the page, the retrofit will be available in March, but owners can put themselves in line for one already.
While some are calling this a “normal steering wheel retrofit,” it’s actually just a “round steering wheel retrofit” because it’s still not “normal.”
The shape of the wheel is just one of the novel features of Tesla’s “yoke” steering wheel. There’s also no stalk on the wheel, and Tesla is automating the functions of the stalks and replacing them with force touch buttons.
Many users expressed more issues with the lack of stalks than the actual shape of the yoke steering wheel.

2023/01/06,"Tesla has slashed Model 3 and Model Y prices by as much as the equivalent of $7,000 in China,  raising demand concerns in the important market. There is some good news, however: The $35,000 Tesla is back! 
We just reported earlier today that there are increasing demand concerns for Tesla in China.
One of the most significant indicators that Tesla is having demand issues is when the automaker decides to reduce prices.
Over the last two years, Tesla’s prices have consistently gone up until October in China, when Tesla reduced the price of its electric vehicles for the first time.
Now the automaker is again reducing prices of Model 3 and Model Y, the two vehicles it produces at Gigafactory Shanghai, and the price drop is significant.
Chinese Prices
USD Equivalents
The price has dropped by as much as RMB 48,000 for the Model Y Long Range. That’s the equivalent of a $7,000 USD price drop on the vehicle. You could argue that the price drop also brings back Tesla’s $35,000 Model 3.
The Model 3 rear-wheel-drive, Tesla’s cheapest vehicle that was once promised to start at $35,000 but starts at $47,000 in the US, has received a RMB 36,000 price drop to RMB 229,900, or $33,430 USD.
This is an all-time low price for the vehicle – even in China. The cut also follows with Chinese tax incentives ending at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. However, this is the second cut in recent months which has brought the overall price of the vehicles down 12-24% overall. 
Here are all the overnight price changes for each Tesla model in China:
Most models are also showing a 1-4 weeks delivery lead time, which is a short delivery timeline for Tesla in China early in a quarter. It would further point to Tesla not having a strong backlog of orders in the country.
I think we will continue to see Tesla's margins shrink. That does not necessarily mean Tesla is in trouble, it simply means the EV market is becoming more competitive and Tesla's huge margins will disappear.

But over the next couple of years for Tesla to hold onto their leadership position they will need to start becoming serious about Quality, Repairs, and meeting customers expectations (not simply letting Musk decide what the customer wants).   

While Tesla may still hold a lead, the other OEMs are much better at these issues.  So will Tesla improve quick enough?  Or will the other OEMs catch and pass them?
Tesla’s stock is down more than 4% in pre-market trading today on the news of the price cuts in China and is closing in on the $100/share price point. 
The good news is that these prices are likely going to make Tesla much more competitive with the increased EV competition in the country and could likely boost sales significantly in the important market.
However, it will massively cut into Tesla’s gross margin and overall profits.
We will keep a close eye on Tesla’s Chinese production and deliveries in the coming months order to track how the price drop affects Tesla’s performance in the country.

2023/01/05,"Tesla is finally giving up on only offering its controversial “yoke” steering wheel by starting to give the option of a round steering wheel for Model S and Model X.
When Tesla unveiled the new Model S with the “yoke” butterfly steering wheel, it was controversial. Some were worried about the actual shape of the wheel being problematic, while others were concerned about the lack of drive stalk to choose the drive mode.
As for the former, we thought that the automaker wouldn’t risk bringing the controversial yoke steering wheel to market without a nonlinear steering curve enabled by a steer-by-wire system – especially knowing that Tesla has been developing a steer-by-wire system.
However, as Tesla started deliveries of the new Model S Plaid last year, we were surprised to see that the wheel had a normal 14.0:1 steering ratio, and it is proving to be impractical at lower speeds.
As someone who has been driving on icy roads all of my life (Quebec born and bred), I can see it be a real problem for some maneuvers to regain controls in some slips. pic.twitter.com/ybJ5DOKRjJ
There are even some driving scenarios where the butterfly not only becomes impractical but potentially dangerous.
For example, if you lose control on an icy road, it could be harder to do some quick maneuvers to regain control.
CEO Elon Musk later confirmed that Tesla is indeed working on progressive steering, but it’s still years away.
As for the lack of stalks, Tesla replaced all of their functions with force touch buttons on the wheel, even for things like turn signals and the horn. Musk’s logic is that “all input is an error,” and that the car should automatically perform all the functions that were on the stalks (now on the force touch buttons).
However, much like Tesla’s self-driving program, the capability is not quite there yet.
Musk brushed off those concerns and indicated that the yoke would be the way forward as it offers “better visibility.”
But in February 2022, we started to see Tesla potentially offering the option of a round steering wheel and the backend of the configurator code, but nothing was offered all year.
Finally, Tesla updated its online configurator for Model S and Model X today to add the option of a round steering wheel:
There are many issues with the yoke:
Turn signals aren’t intuitive, and lack tactile borders to know when your finger is in the correct place.
The horn button is dangerous - you have to look down at the yoke to find the horn! This should be a center press on the yoke (or wheel).
The rest of the “buttons” also lack a tactile feel, so you must look down to use them. 
Having the auto-pilot-ish functions on the right scroll button/wheel is fine, but having its functionality be potentially different for each driver (click once/twice) violates many norms of a car interface (and is potentially dangerous).
The yoke becomes a terrible choice when using self driving in certain intersection - a tight turn will make the yoke spin rapidly and, again, is potentially dangerous to your hands.
The turn signal “buttons” get even more confusing when you have to go between two tight turns - the yoke is inverted, which button do you press? Look down at the yoke…
The yoke works well for regular highway driving.
The option doesn’t come with a different price, and it doesn’t seem to affect the delivery timeline.
It’s wild that this wasn’t an option almost two years ago when Tesla first launched the Model S refresh.
But the shape of the steering wheel was only one of the concerns with the yoke steering wheel. The lack of stalk was also a concern for many people.
Personally, I also share concerns with the automation of some of the tasks associated with the stalks, but I think the force touch buttons work well enough that the shape was my main concern. Therefore, I am happy to finally see it as an option.

2023/01/05,"Whether you’re a seasoned EV driver in cold climates or this is your first winter driving an electric vehicle, there’s always more to learn about how to get the best range and performance from your EV when the temperatures drop. 
Electrek asked two experts for smart winter EV driving advice. This is what Richard Reina, the product training director at CARiD.com, and Casey Donahue, an energy analyst working as the CEO of Optiwatt, a residential managed charging platform in North America, had to say.
Park in a garage if possible. “It’s always best practice in the winter to park your EV in a garage. Even an unheated garage provides some protection from the cold. A temperature difference of even a few degrees means that the battery of your EV can hold its charge longer. EV batteries lose some range with every degree drop in temperature.” – Richard Reina
Schedule departure. “Scheduling departure gives you the time needed to precondition your vehicle and lets users maximize range by allowing the battery enough time to charge. If you can, try to schedule your departure to allow for preconditioning as well as a full charge. For example, our Optiwatt app can precondition your car for you if you tell it when you want to leave.” – Casey Donahue
Precondition prior to charging. “It’s important to precondition your EV prior to charging because of the negative effects a cold battery can have on vehicle operation. For example, a cold battery drains much faster than a conditioned one. If users want to maximize range, they should warm up their EV just as they would a traditional vehicle. A cold battery can also have a negative effect on regenerative braking, and preconditioning the battery allows regenerative braking to kick in, maximizing the efficiency of the vehicle.” – Casey Donahue
Charge your EV strategically. “A lot goes into getting the most out of the battery in your EV, including when you should charge it, how long you should charge it and more. If you are able to charge at home, you should fully charge it overnight. EV batteries lose range in the colder weather, so starting the day with a full charge is smart and safe.” – Richard Reina
“It’s also important to consider the general wear and tear the harsh weather has on your vehicle, so park it in a covered structure if you can.” – Casey Donahue
[Editor’s note: It’s safe to assume you’re going to experience 30% range reduction in the winter, so plan trips with that in mind.]
Use Eco Mode and reduce use of electric features. “Eco Mode exists to boost your battery’s range by limiting energy supply and power consumption. It maximizes your battery’s efficiency, and it works during cold weather as well. While in Eco Mode, some of your car’s features receive less power so do not perform to the same level. For example, power for acceleration may be reduced. At the same time, consider limiting use of certain electric features. The EV’s heating system should be turned down a few degrees. Combined, these steps help conserve battery power.” – Richard Reina
[Editor’s note: Heated seats use less power than the heating system.]
Perform winter prep. “For internal combustion engine vehicles, it’s long been recommended that steps be taken to maximize fuel economy. For example, unnecessary weight should be removed from the car; tires should be properly inflated, rapid acceleration should be avoided, and cruise control should be used to maintain a steady speed. All these tips equally apply to EVs. Almost all EVs have a range meter visible to the driver, so the driver can learn which speeds and driving habits deliver the best driving range.” – Richard Reina
Be prepared for charging at public charging stations. “Public charging stations can get extremely crowded during the winter, especially around long weekends and holidays. Plan your route ahead of time and try to find a large charging site with an ample number of charging stations.” – Casey Donahue
Prepare for a worst-case weather scenario. “If embarking on a longer trip and/or facing the possibility of a storm, be prepared. Before departing, locate EV charging stations along your route. Ensure your cell phone is fully charged and carry a phone charger or portable battery. Have warm clothes, blankets, water, non-perishable food and a small shovel in the EV with you, in case conditions deteriorate and prevent you from continuing.” – Richard Reina
I put some R14 insulation in the walls of my garage and insulated the garage door. I did this well before I got an EV, but I think it provides a bit of benefit to EV battery and preconditioning in the winter. 

My garage used to be as cold as it was outside. Now it stabilizes right around 32, and only gets below that on the coldest days.
“During the winter, it’s always a good idea to prepare for power outages, especially if you live in a state that experiences blackouts frequently. Check regularly for winter weather advisories and try to charge your car to full battery prior to any severe weather.” – Casey Donahue 
And here’s a bonus tip, via Drive Electric Vermont: If you accelerate slowly, brake slowly, let off on the accelerator as you crest a hill, and anticipate stoplights and slow down, it will help maximize the use of regen braking that puts energy back in the battery instead of wasting it with mechanical brakes.

2023/01/05,"A Tesla Semi electric truck has been spotted being towed, and it is raising concerns about reliability, but it’s not too surprising early in the program.
Tesla unveiled the production version of its Tesla Semi class 8 electric truck and delivered the first units last month. 
PepsiCo took delivery of the first Tesla Semi trucks. Within weeks of taking delivery of the first truck, PepsiCo said that it was already deploying 36 Tesla Semi trucks.
Now a Tesla Semi truck owned by PepsiCo has been spotted being towed away by another truck.
The pictures shared on the /r/RealTesla subreddit, known to be negative about the company, has raised concerns about the brand new truck already facing reliability issues:
The truck was spotted in Sacramento, California, where PepsiCo has a facility where it said it planned to use 21 Tesla Semi trucks. It appears to have broken down, and it is being carried to an unknown location.
Before starting deliveries of the truck in December, we reported that Tesla had already started building a team to service Tesla Semi trucks in California, including mobile technicians to go to the clients.
Always not fun to see but if its a design flaw Tesla will presumably fix it, if it was a one off then life happens, if it was an accident then the details matter.
That said one vehicle being towed does not prove anything, and the naysayers grasp at everything they can find to perpetuate their confirmation biased ideology.
A Tesla Semi was also spotted broken down on a highway on ramp just a few weeks before the first deliveries to PepsiCo.
Tesla naysayers are jumping on this as an example of the Tesla Semi program failing, but this is to be expected early in a new vehicle program.
Obviously you don’t want it to happen, especially not in a commercial vehicle since when it’s not working it means you are losing money, but it is part of the growing pain of being an early adopter.
It’s certainly something to keep an eye on if it keeps happening often, but for now, I wouldn’t worry too much if some of the early units need more work. That’s why Tesla is delivering to PepsiCo, which is operating those trucks in North California – close to Tesla engineering and where Tesla builds the truck in Nevada.

2023/01/05,"Tesla’s sales dropped significantly in China last month, but it was anticipated with the production stopping at the end of the month. It is now resuming.
China is Tesla’s most important market and the most important EV market in the world. For Tesla, any significant change in output out of Gigafactory Shanghai or sales in China will have a significant impact on its overall performance.
December was expected not to be Tesla’s best month, as it was reported that the automaker stopped production at the end of the month.
Today the numbers were released, and Tesla delivered 55,796 China-made electric vehicles in December, according to the China Passenger Car Association. That’s down 44% month-over-month, but more importantly, it is down 21% over the same period last year. And that’s during a year that Tesla significantly increased its production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai.
In 2022, December was Tesla’s lowest production level since July.
The good news is that production has now resumed based on a drone flyover of Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai today:
However, there are some concerns for Tesla in China in 2023.
Tesla Long Range Model Y sells for around $52000 in China, and will likely go lower due to loss of government subsidy and fierce competition from BYD and NIO. Even if you factor in the labor cost difference it should never sell for $66000 in US. I expect we should see a big price reduction in US soon.
There have been some indications at the end of 2022 that Tesla was starting to have some demand issues in the country, despite the company’s best efforts to squash the rumors. It’s not helping the rumors that Tesla started 2023 by offering up to $1,450 in incentives in China for people taking delivery by February 28.
Tesla investors should certainly keep an eye on Tesla’s performance in China because if the automaker doesn’t do well in China, it’s likely not going to do well overall.
Many factors could negatively affect Tesla’s performance in China in 2023, in addition to the broader EV market in the country.
We will keep a close eye on Tesla’s early performance in the country this year.

2023/01/04,"A Tesla Megapack used on a mobile Supercharger caught on fire and completely burned down in Baker, California.
We previously reported on this contraption that Tesla sometimes brings to busy Supercharger stations.
It’s a trailer fitted with a Megapack, Tesla’s biggest stationary energy storage system, and a bunch of Superchargers.
The result is a mobile Supercharger station that Tesla can bring to Supercharger stations when more capacity is needed – especially during holidays.
That’s exactly what Tesla did at its Baker, California, Supercharger station for people traveling for the New Year, but the mobile Supercharger caught on fire on January first, according to Tesla drivers stopping by the station.
Plugshare user Jonathan posted “currently on fire!!!” on the station’s page on Sunday, and another user shared this picture:
It shows a Tesla Megapack on the mobile Supercharger trailer completely burned.
The Tesla commercial inverters on the left and the Supercharger stalls on the right appear to be untouched.
LFP is the only way to go with standard performance devices, especially stationary storage.
Half of the Supercharger stalls at the Supercharger station, which has 40 stalls, were apparently still usable later on January 1, according to another Plugshare user.
It’s not clear what happened. We reached out to the local fire department for a comment and will update if we get an answer. Tesla doesn’t have a press relations department in the United States anymore to ask those kinds of questions.
This is the second known Tesla Megapack to have caught on fire. In September 2022, we reported on a Megapack catching on fire at a giant energy storage project in Monterrey, California.
Tesla has deployed thousands of Megapacks around the world since the company launched the product back in 2019.

2023/01/04,"Tesla is hinting at making electric motors for airplanes, boats, and more in a new trademark filing that went unnoticed.
Update: It turns out a Tesla fan filed the trademark on behalf of Tesla – seemingly without the company’s knowledge. 
The automaker filed for a new trademark last week, but it went unnoticed until now.
Electrek spotted it today, and while it is for the name “Tesla” again, it still caught our interest because of the category it was filed in.
Tesla is extending its trademark to a new category to market electric motors “not for land vehicles.”
The definition of the category in the filing is a bit confusing, but it extends Tesla’s trademark on electric motors to “motors for airplanes,” “boat motors,” and “electric motors for toys.”
Here’s the filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
TESLA™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of asynchronous motors not for land vehicles; Motors for airplanes; Motors, namely, synchronous motors not for land vehicles; Permanent magnet motors; Boat motors; Drive system having two or more synchronous motors coupled through clutches to drive a common load; Electric motors for toys; Linear motors.
In the filing, Tesla specifies that it does not currently use the trademark for those categories, but the company “intends to use” it in the future.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long considered making an electric plane, and he even said that he has a design for an eVTOL aircraft, but he also always said that Tesla needs to focus on ground vehicles for now.
The CEO said that the automaker might venture into electric aircraft once battery energy density has improved enough to make them viable. Musk said that 400 Wh/kg would be needed, and some battery technologies are starting to get close to that, but they are not in commercial production yet.
As for boats, Tesla has not discussed any plan to make electric boats publicly, but there are already many electric boats on the market.
The “toy” category could mean many things. There’s the Tesla Cyberquad for kids, but that uses a generic electric motor not made by Tesla and the entire quad is made and marketed by Radioflyer.
The filing also includes “linear motors”, which are used in a lot of different products but are more famously used in trains.
It’s important to note that some companies can at times file trademarks that they end up not using.
Sounds like they are just future-proofing the trademark should they ever decide to get into electric motor production for other forms of transportation.
We don’t know if that’s going to be the case here, but it’s still an interesting filing – albeit a bit broad. It could mean that Tesla plans to use its electric motors in some or all of these products.
Either way, it’s exciting to think of Tesla potentially bringing its vast experience in making electric vehicles to making electric planes and boats.

2023/01/04,"A Tesla driver intentionally drove his car off a 250-foot cliff in California with his family inside, according to the police, but everyone miraculously survived without serious injury.
On Tuesday, it was reported that a family of four was rescued from a wrecked Tesla vehicle found at the bottom of a cliff known as Devil’s Slide in Northern California.
As of yesterday, the news was that all four occupants of the Tesla Model Y managed to not only survive the massive crash but also even reportedly didn’t suffer any serious injury.
Providence Holy Cross Medical Center, the employer of the driver, Dharmesh A. Patel, a physician living in Pasadena, commented:
Providence Holy Cross Medical Center is deeply saddened to learn of a traffic incident involving one of our physicians and his family. We are extremely grateful there were no serious injuries. We will not respond further, as this incident is under investigation.
Many people praised Tesla’s safety for saving the lives of the four occupants: Patel, his wife Neha, their 7-year-old daughter, and their 4-year-old son.
One of the rescuers even said that he was considering buying the Tesla after the rescue mission:
⁦@elonmusk⁩ Got me seriously wanting to buy a Tesla. Was on this rescue, 250 ft off Devils Slide, all occupants survived. #ThatsaTD pic.twitter.com/uCrlrAWsIX
As much as I've been down on Elon lately, it's seriously impressive how the car preformed.  The entire incident was a tragedy though.
Today, we learn that Patel intentionally drove the car off the cliff, according to the police.
The highway patrol stated following Patel’s arrest:
CHP investigators worked throughout the night interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence from the scene. Based on the evidence collected, investigators developed probable cause to believe this incident was an intentional act.
Patel will be booked into San Mateo County Jail once he is released from the hospital.
The Tesla Model Y has aced its safety test with NHTSA and achieved the highest possible IIHS safety rating. Model Y is considered one of the vehicles with the lowest probability of major injury, based on the crash safety test results.

2023/01/04,"Tesla released a new blog post defending its impact on California and says it now employs 47,000 people in the state.
California has been critical to Tesla’s success over the last 20 years. The state has helped Tesla in its time of need, and its strong climate initiatives and EV incentives have made it the biggest market for electric vehicles in the US and, therefore, Tesla’s biggest market.
However, the love story between Tesla and California ended somewhat abruptly in 2020. Early measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 resulted in Tesla closing its Fremont factory, which angered CEO Elon Musk to the point of threatening to move Tesla from California.
By 2021, Tesla delivered on the threat and moved its headquarters to Texas.
The automaker always maintained that it is still heavily investing in California and even had to walk back Musk’s threat to move the Fremont factory out of the state.
But the behavior of Musk over the last year resulted in Tesla’s popularity in what is still its most important US market plummeting. 
Since Tesla’s move to Texas, the CEO has made it clear that he is now Republican and even encouraged people to vote Republican during the last election – which is rare for a tech CEO to officially take a side like that. 
This didn’t help Tesla’s case in blue states like California. On top of that, Musk called the Democratic Party “the party of hate” and regularly makes negative comments on the left on his popular Twitter page.
In an apparent damage control effort, Tesla released a rare blog post defending its impact on the state of California.
In the post, the company listed all its primary operations in the state:
Tesla’s footprint in California is made up of Megapack production and vehicle castings in Lathrop, hardware and software engineering in Palo Alto, vehicle and battery manufacturing in Fremont, battery development and testing in San Diego and vehicle design in Hawthorne.
Tesla listed some of its economic impacts in the state of California based on IHS research:
Tesla confirmed that it now has 47,000 employees in California:
In 2022, we grew to 47,000 employees (direct employment) in California, and our production footprint continued to increase as our 2 millionth vehicle rolled off the lines in Fremont. Since 2016, we have made over $5 billion in capital investments in our facilities. We are confident that these trends will continue and that 2023 will be an even bigger year for Tesla in California.
That’s just a little less than half its global workforce still located in California.
I run an annual fundraising raffle for a climate nonprofit, Climate XChange.  For 6 years we raffled Teslas. This year sales are very slow - many people who bought tickets in the past told us they no longer want to win a Tesla. So we added the Rivian R1T pickup and R1S SUV as prize options, and sales are now slowly picking up. But we have a long way to go to our usual sellout by the late February drawing. 
Despite Tesla not having an official PR department anymore, I’ve seen an effort lately for the automaker to have more of its own communications directly with the public and not just through Elon Musk’s Twitter.
Since dissolving Tesla’s PR department, Musk made it so everything goes through him, and that has become a problem lately as he increasingly antagonizes part of the population in the US.
When you lead a company that sells products and services to consumers, it’s just bad business to become publicly political, like Musk has been doing over the last year.
It looks like Tesla is trying to have its own voice again by being more active on social media and, now, some blog posts like this recent one.

2023/01/03,"Neoen, a French energy company, announced a massive new 400 MWh Tesla Megapack project in Australia. It’s one of the biggest energy storage projects in the world.
Tesla Megapack has quickly become the prominent battery pack for large-scale energy storage projects.
Neoen actually played a part in that.
Before the Megapack, Tesla had the Powerpack, and it was selected by Neoen for one of the first-ever large-scale energy storage projects using lithium-ion battery cells.
The Tesla Powerpack project in South Australia became known as the “Big Tesla Battery” and popularized Tesla’s utility-scale energy storage system.
Neoen owned the project and it proved to be highly successful and profitable. Lately, Neoen has announced new projects, and this time, it is using Tesla Megapacks.
Now the company is announcing another massive Tesla Megapack in South West Queensland, Australia:
Neoen, one of the world’s leading producers of exclusively renewable energy, has provided notices to proceed to battery storage experts Tesla and to balance of plant contractor UGL, signalling the start of construction for its 200 MW / 400 MWh Western Downs Battery in South West Queensland, Australia. In line with the company’s develop-to-own business model, Neoen will be the long-term owner and operator of the asset, which is its fourth big battery in Australia.
At 400 MWh of energy capacity, it will be one of the most significant Tesla Megapack projects in the world.
The system will be used to provide grid services and help stabilize the Australian grid, which has been increasingly adding renewable energy capacity.
Neoen wrote about the project:
The battery, consisting of Tesla Megapack systems, will leverage the existing infrastructure of Neoen’s Western Downs Green Power Hub which includes a 460 MWp solar farm, currently nearing completion. It will be located next to the Western Downs substation with Powerlink delivering the connection works, including a dedicated high-voltage line which will connect the battery to the transmission network. Early construction works are underway, with the asset expected to start operating in the Australian summer of 2024/25. 
The project will bring Neoen’s energy storage in operation or under construction to 776 MW / 1279 MWh  – with most of it being from Tesla Megapacks.
Tesla recently updated the Megapack with more capacity.

2023/01/03,"Tesla has signed a new updated agreement to secure lithium supply from Piedmont Lithium as automakers rush to secure battery material.
In order to help accelerate the transition to electric transportation, Tesla has become increasingly involved in the raw material supply chain for battery cells.
Despite only now starting the production of its own cells last year, the automaker has been securing the supply of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and other minerals for its battery cell suppliers for years.
More recently, Tesla started to not only deal with established mining companies, but it also started to sign contracts for offtake agreements with junior mining companies looking to build new mining projects that would increase the supply of some critical resources for batteries.
This strategy helps those companies raise money to build their mining projects.
Piedmont Lithium is one of those mining companies.
In 2020, Tesla signed an agreement with Piedmont Lithium, a company developing a lithium project in North Carolina.
The automaker agreed to buy about one-third of Piedmont’s planned 160,000 tonnes of annual spodumene lithium production for at least five years.
The first deliveries were planned between July 2022 and July 2023, but the timeline has been delayed, as is often the case with those large mining projects.
Today, Tesla and Piedmont announced that they updated their agreement, with deliveries now planned in the second half of this year:
Piedmont and Tesla have mutually agreed to amend their previous offtake agreement with the terms of this new agreement, which are binding for a three-year term and include an option to renew for another three years. Under the amended agreement, Piedmont has agreed to deliver approximately 125,000 metric tons of SC6 to Tesla beginning in H2 2023 through the end of 2025.
Now it sounds like the lithium is actually going to come from Piedmont’s Quebec facility in partnership with Sayona Quebec.
Piedmont Lithium President and CEO Keith Phillips commented:
We are pleased to be able to partner with Tesla to supply lithium resources produced in North America. The electric vehicle and critical battery materials landscape has changed significantly since 2020 and this agreement reflects the importance of – and growing demand for – a North American lithium supply chain. This agreement helps to ensure that these critical resources from Quebec remain in North America and support the mission of the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster the U.S. supply chain, the clean energy economy, and global decarbonization.
The company’s stock is up 4% on the new agreement with Tesla today.

2023/01/03,"Tesla has been fined $2.2 million by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) for false advertising regarding its range.
Last year, we reported on the KFTC launching an investigation into allegations that Tesla violated advertising laws by overstating the range of its electric vehicles.
Korea uses the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), and therefore, Tesla uses the same range as it advertised in most other markets other than in North America, where it uses the EPA-rated range.
However, the KFTC’s main issue appeared to be the range drop in cold weather.
Now, the KFTC has announced that it is imposing a 2.85 billion won ($2.2 million) fine on Tesla for not clearly stating that its range might drop significantly in cold weather.
Following the decision, Tesla has now remedied the situation by adding fine print where the range is displayed on its website:
The new disclosure reads:
Performance and mileage may vary by model. The displayed drivable distance may vary depending on external factors such as speed, weather conditions and road conditions.
Honestly, range evaluation should include climate testing. Using an EPA methodology, test range at 0° (extreme cold), 31° (freezing), 70° (summer averages for most places), and 110° (extreme heat). It should also be done for any kind of vehicle, be it ICEV, EV, PHEV, or FCEV. That way everything is kept relative, consumers get the kind of information they need to make an informed choice, and automakers get a new metric to focus on in order to make their offerings more appealing to those in extreme climates.
That’s an expensive $2.2 million fine print right here.
So far, the new notice appears only on Tesla’s Korean website. Again, Tesla advertises the same WLTP range in most markets outside of North America and China.
There’s no doubt that range drops significantly in most EVs when operated in cold weather. More energy needs to go to the conditioning of the battery pack, and of course, the car also needs to heat the cabin.
I know nothing about Korean advertising laws, so I’m not going to venture into commenting on whether Tesla should have been fined here, but I think that there’s no doubt that there’s plenty of room for automakers, including Tesla, to better communicate how range can be affected by external factors – including temperature.

2023/01/02,"Tesla’s head of China, Tom Zhu, has taken over responsibilities for sales, service, and deliveries in North America, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Last month, we reported on a rumor that Zhu, president of Tesla China, would replace Musk as CEO of Tesla.
We were skeptical of the report as it came from a Chinese outlet that was just found guilty of spreading fake news about Tesla in China and was ordered to compensate the company.
However, other reports are starting to add validity to Zhu at least having a greater role at Tesla, albeit not necessarily the role of CEO.
We did report that Zhu was tapped to go lead Gigafactory Texas – though it’s unclear if the role is permanent.
Over the last few weeks, it was also reported that he has stepped down as the official representative of Tesla’s China corporation, and he is reportedly being groomed for a bigger role in the US.
Now Electrek has learned that Zhu has started to take a broader role in the US – starting with responsibilities for sales, deliveries, and service in North America.
Officially, Zhu’s official title remains vice president in charge of Asia/Pacific, but sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that he has now been added to the North American sales, service, and delivery organization chart.
Troy Jones is vice president of North America sales and service at Tesla. He is a long-time veteran at the company with 12 years of experience. He has been the head of sales in North America for a few years now and reported directly to Elon Musk.
Now he reports directly to Zhu – making him in charge of sales and service in North America.
Zhu is a rising star within Tesla. He was initially hired to develop the Supercharger network in China, but he quickly took over all responsibility for Tesla in China, and later Asia/Pacific was added to his responsibilities.
Under his leadership, Tesla grew significantly in China and built Gigafactory Shanghai, which is an extremely productive asset that contributes massively to the company’s bottom line.
The executive is taking over sales leadership at a critical moment for Tesla’s US operations since the new federal tax credit for electric vehicles is taking place and should accelerate sales in Tesla’s home market.
I think those people who are skeptical about Zhu need to understand it is super difficult to retain a Chinese executive in a global company like Tesla because lot of Tesla's Chinese competitors are willing to double the pay and poach Zhu away any time. This is why you don't see many Chinese executives with global position in American companies, compared to Indian CEOs that are everywhere.
It looks increasingly likely that Zhu is going to be made president of Tesla Automotive – a similar role that Jerome Guillen held a few years ago at Tesla before he went back to the Tesla Semi program and later left the company.
I’ve heard some pushback from some investors who doubt that putting a Chinese national in charge of Tesla’s American workforce will work out well. Their main point is that managing a Chinese workforce with a Chinese work ethic and compliance is way easier than working with an American workforce.
I certainly understand the concern, but I’m less skeptical than those investors. You can’t deny the guy’s success in China, and I’m sure he is aware of the cultural differences since he has been educated in the US, Duke University, and he has worked internationally – not just in China.
Hopefully, he can replicate some of Giga Shanghai’s success in Tesla’s US factories and streamline sales and service at the same time.

2023/01/02,"The design of the Tesla Semi battery pack has leaked, and it reveals how Tesla fits a massive ~900 kWh pack in the truck.
Tesla unveiled the production version of its Tesla Semi class 8 electric truck and delivered the first units last month.
At an event, Tesla described an electric truck that could truly disrupt the trucking industry.
However, we noted that there were a few pieces of information that Tesla omitted from the event that could really make a significant difference in the usefulness of the truck.
The two main missing pieces of information were the battery pack capacity and the weight of the tractor. Weight determines the load capacity since total weight with load and trailer is limited to 82,000 lbs.
More recently, CEO Elon Musk released a few details that allow us to confirm that the Tesla Semi battery pack has an energy capacity of about 900 kWh.
The battery pack has never really been visible on the Tesla Semi prototypes. Frankly, that’s impressive because how do you hide almost 1 MWh pack inside a vehicle like that?
Now thanks to Tesla hacker Green the Only, we get our first look at the Tesla Semi battery pack design and other important components:
pic.twitter.com/mL3I7wAOPb
The images appear to be from the parts catalog for the Tesla Semi. It singles out the components including the battery pack.
It also confirms that the Tesla Semi battery pack is located underneath the cabin at the base of the vehicle:
That’s not unusual for Tesla vehicles as the automaker attempts to keep the center of gravity low.
However, the pack design itself is quite different from anything else we have seen before.
It appears to feature nine large modules with two different sizes. The ones in the middle appear significantly larger than the ones on the sides of the vehicle.
I hope they make it easily convertible to an RV (open back panel with connectivity for a trailer with solar panels) & sell that version to other companies to customize.. there are more RVs sold in the US each yr then semi trucks; RVs won't help the environment much but  people pay 300k+ for a nice RV so its doable to increase economies of scale & sell alongside semis.

The modules are also much taller than any other Tesla battery pack, which previously only were the height of one row of battery cells plus hardware.
Now, it looks more like the Tesla’s old Model S battery modules being stacked together:
There are a lot of unanswered questions about the Tesla Semi battery. For example, we still don’t know for sure what cell Tesla is using in the truck.
It was believed that the automaker would use its own 4680 cells, but CEO Elon Musk indicated that this wouldn’t necessarily be the case.

Over the last few years, Tesla has started to hold regular events like ‘Battery Day‘ and ‘AI Day’ to give updates on some of its most important programs and recruit talent to build them.
Now it looks like the automaker is adding one to the list: Investor Day.
Tesla wrote about the event in a press release:
We plan to host Tesla’s 2023 Investor Day on March 1, 2023.  The event will be live streamed from our Gigafactory Texas, with the option for some of our institutional and retail investors to attend in person (details to follow). Our investors will be able to see our most advanced production line as well as discuss long term expansion plans, generation 3 platform, capital allocation and other subjects with our leadership team.
At first glance, it might sound like a shareholder meeting, which Tesla holds annually and generally in the summer.
However, it sounds like this is a separate event and potentially in reaction to Tesla having had the worst year ever on the public stock market with the stock down more than 60%.
The automaker says that it will be held at Gigafactory Texas and that the event will include a tour of the factory.
Blankpoint thinks that a $25k vehicle is ""nothing to see here"", which is one of most hilarious things I've read in a while. Tesla's margins position it to destroy the competition that can't even make profits at 50k and up. 
Tesla also stated that it would discuss “long term expansion plans”, which could mean that Elon Musk will finally release his ‘Master Plan Part Three‘ – something that he has been talking about releasing for the past year.
Interestingly, the automaker also mentioned its “generation 3 platform”. Musk has previously mentioned that Tesla’s next vehicle platform will enable cheaper electric vehicles.
Finally, Tesla also added that it would talk about “capital allocation” during its Investor Day. It could include the stock buyback program that Musk originally announced in October.
Tesla’s new shareholder platform is expected to play a role in the new Investor Day, but the details have yet to be announced.

2023/01/02,"Tesla announced that it delivered over 405,000 vehicles in Q4 2022. That sets a new record and means over 1.3 million EVs were delivered in 2022.
With the production ramp at Gigafactory Texas and Berlin, as well as continued improvements at Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai. It was undeniable that Tesla was going to have more vehicles than ever to deliver in Q4 2022. That’s thanks to the production ramp at Gigafactory Texas and Berlin as well as continued improvements at Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai. 
However, there were some concerns about deliveries as Tesla appeared to be facing some demand problems and started to offer a lot of discounts in December.
Wall Street analyst expectations ranged from 400,000 to 430,000 vehicles.
Today, Tesla released the official numbers for Q4 202. The automaker confirmed it delivered over 405,000 vehicles and produced over 439,000 vehicles during the quarter:
 In the fourth quarter, we produced over 439,000 vehicles and delivered over 405,000 vehicles. In 2022, vehicle deliveries grew 40% YoY to 1.31 million while production grew 47% YoY to 1.37 million.
Here are the details:
Tesla again blamed the discrepancy between vehicles produced and delivered on trying to smoothen the end-of-quarter delivery waves:
We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter.
Congratulations are in order to all the hard working Tesla employees worldwide. This year, with all of its challenges, had the potential to disrupt production more than it did, and these figures are a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team. As a shareholder, I thank all of them.

When Fred wrote about Musk reassuring employees about “short term craziness” (paraphrased), I wondered if he was foreshadowing a miss. This is at the bottom end of Dan Ives’ revised estimate, before he revised them slightly upward. 

Hard to imagine this not affecting the shares negatively, but often Mr. Market behaves differently than I expect.
With the Q4 numbers, we now have Tesla’s full-year delivery and production numbers:
The results little on the lower end of expectations. It’s a new record, however, and Tesla undoubtedly has the capacity to produce more long-range electric vehicles than any other automaker.
While I understand that there could be some concerns about Tesla’s demand going into 2023, we still have to acknowledge Tesla’s incredible performance in 2022. Over 1 million vehicles were delivered. That’s a 40% increase year-over-year.
Congrats to everyone involved in making this happen because that’s a lot more gasoline mileage converted to electric mileage in 2022.

2023/01/02,"Tesla is apparently preparing to launch a cheaper version of the Model Y electric SUV, according to an update to its online configurator.
In 2022, Tesla’s vehicle lineup remained primarily unchanged in North America.
It’s expected to shake up a bit in 2023, especially with the new federal tax credit for electric vehicles potentially incentivizing some changes.
For example, outside of North America, Tesla sells a cheaper rear-wheel-drive and shorter-range version of the Model Y. It’s an extremely popular option, but the automaker has refused to introduce it – or at least keep it – for the North American market.
Tesla actually briefly offered the cheaper Model Y in North America in 2021, but it removed the option from the configurator with CEO Elon Musk saying that he didn’t like the shorter range. However, Tesla continued selling the vehicle in Europe and Asia.
In North America, Tesla also offered the Model Y with 4680 cells built at Gigafactory Texas. The vehicle still had a dual motor all-wheel-drive powertrain, but the new battery pack resulted in 279 miles (449 km) of range.
In comparison, the current long-range Model Y has 330 miles of EPA-rated range.
However, this version of the Model Y has never appeared in Tesla’s Model Y configurator as it was only offered to Tesla employees or as a direct offer to some customers who had ordered a Model Y.
Now several Tesla configurator code trackers are reporting that the automaker has added a new configuration of the Model Y in the backend that seems to match this Model Y AWD with 4680 cells.
The new Model Y is listed at $61,990, which is also the price that Tesla used to offer the Model Y with 4680 cells. It’s also listed as a dual motor AWD version.
For now, the vehicle is only in the source code of the configurator and can’t be selected by buyers.
The new vehicle appears in the code just as Tesla confirmed that it is now producing enough 4680 battery cells to build over 1,000 Model Y vehicles per week.
Tesla now has the tricky task of unwinding the string of price hikes to re-balance supply and demand.  Simply dropping the prices on the current models is going to tick off prior customers as well as undercut their used car prices.  It would make sense that one strategy is to come up with slightly different models that could be priced slightly lower.
As we reported last week, the update from the US Treasury about the vehicles eligible for the new $7,500 federal credit has raised some questions about what it takes to be considered an SUV and have the $80,000 MSRP limit on an EV model to get the credit.
The Model Y only gets the limit with the seven-seat configuration and based on other models getting and not getting the limit, it may have to do with the gross vehicle weight.
Tesla might have to change a few things to make sure its buyers can take advantage of the credit on the Model Y.
But either way, Tesla needs a cheaper version of the Model Y to sell in North America. Now this one isn’t much cheaper, but it’s a start.
",tesla
2022/12/30,"Tesla is offering a new discount for Model S and Model X for just two days. Previously, it was only for Model 3 and Model Y.
As we have recently reported, Tesla has been having some rare demand issues lately – especially in the United States, due to unique circumstances.
It has been years since Tesla hit 200,000 deliveries in the United States, which meant the company no longer qualified for the US federal tax credit for electric vehicles. But Tesla buyers are soon expected to regain access to the incentive, which is valued at up to $7,500.
As the incentive is being put in place for 2023, buyers need to take delivery of their vehicles on or after January 1 to qualify.
This situation is incentivizing buyers to wait until after the new year to purchase a Tesla vehicle in the United States. We reported last month that it also contributed to an increase in cancellations as Tesla is not allowing buyers to delay orders to get them next month.
Earlier this month, we learned that Tesla started offering a $3,750 discount to buyers for Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in order to combat this issue. The amount was interesting since it is half the $7,500 tax credit.
Now Tesla is also bringing the $7,500 discount to Model S and Model X vehicles for new orders that can be delivered today or tomorrow, according to a source familiar with the matter. Previously, Model S and Model X buyers were only getting 10,000 free Supercharging miles for free and not a direct discount.
In this case, it has nothing to do with the upcoming tax credit for electric vehicles since neither the Model X nor the Model S will qualify due to their starting price being over the MSRP limit for sedans and SUVs.
IMO this sets a bad precedence for Tesla. Begs the question, ""why should I buy a new Tesla early in the month, quarter, or year when the price may be less at the end of the period in question. The one price policy encourages customers to buy with confidence. If I wanted games I would go to any franchise dealership. 

I use to sell cars for dealerships and it is common knowledge that the best deals can be made towards the end of a quarter or end of the year. Dealers are motivated to meet or beat their sales goals - let the games begin!
This shows that Tesla’s demand issues are a bit beyond the tax credit.
However, with only two days left in the year and with this discount being about Model S and Model X, it won’t affect too many deliveries.
Tesla is trying to remove any inventory it has at the end of the quarter. It’s a practice that has often been referred to as an “end-of-quarter delivery push.”
CEO Elon Musk admits that it’s not really efficient, but it looks better on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.

2022/12/30,"Tesla has announced the upcoming launch of Model S and Model X in China – with pricing coming on January 6 and deliveries in the first half of 2023.
Model S and Model X haven’t come to China since Tesla shut down production in January 2021 to refresh the models.
Difficulties ramping production back up after the design update have led to Tesla only delivering the vehicles in North America over the past two years.
Only over the last few weeks have Tesla’s two flagship vehicles returned to Europe.
In October, we saw indications that the Model S and Model X were coming back to China when the vehicles appeared in new Chinese government filings stating that the vehicles would be eligible for tax exemptions. 
Today, Tesla announced on Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like social media platform, that it will announce pricing and presumably start taking orders for Model S and Model X Plaid on January 6. Translated from Chinese:
Model S Plaid & Model X Plaid surprise debut at 2022 Auto Show! The two performance monsters will officially announce the price on January 6. The deliveries start in the first half of 2023.
The Chinese market was once an important one for Model S and Model X before Tesla cut off the supply from its Fremont factory in California.
Now, all Tesla vehicles sold in China come from the automaker’s Shanghai factory, but the factory only produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
By the end of 2020, there were over 30,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in China.
After a two-year absence, the vehicles are expected to be popular again in the market, but they are much more expensive than Model 3 and Model Y vehicles coming out of Shanghai. The vehicles are not just more expensive because they are bigger and more luxurious, but they will also be more expensive since they need to be imported from the US.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/12/29,"Tesla has confirmed that over 285,000 people bought its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package in North America. 
Not 1 million, but more than a lot of people thought.
The Full Self-Driving (FSD) package has evolved over the years with some features coming in and out of the package, but for the most part, it consists of a promise to eventually deliver a fully self-driving system through over-the-air software updates.
For now, it mostly gets you access to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta, which virtually enables the vehicle to do all the tasks related to driving on city streets, but it’s not at a level good enough to be done without driver supervision.
Drivers need to pay attention at all times and be ready to take control.
As we previously reported, people’s experience with FSD Beta varies significantly with some users enjoying it, but many also think that it makes driving more stressful as there are many disengagements.
Tesla has never shared the take rate of its FSD package. With the price varying from a few thousand dollars a few years ago to now $15,000, the take rate has likely changed significantly.
But the automaker has now released the first important piece of information about the popularity of its FSD package.
In a series of tweets today about a recap of its year, Tesla said that over 285,000 people have purchased FSD in North America:
– Continued to ramp vehicle production at Giga Texas & Giga Berlin, with both building 3k Model Y/week in mid-December– Reached 500k+ Solar Panel & Solar Roof installations 🏘⚡️– Enabled anyone in North America who has purchased FSD to request FSD Beta, reaching 285k cars total
As for the take rate, we can’t confirm exactly how many vehicles with the ability to get FSD that Tesla has delivered in North America, but Electrek estimates that it is over 1.5 million vehicles.
285,000 vehicles would mean about a 19% take rate for the Full Self-Driving package.
Elon Musk has previously said that Tesla had a goal to have 1 million people on FSD Beta by the end of 2022.
Hmmm... took delivery of my first Model 3 w/FSD in June 2018... 4.5-years and still no FSD. Very happy with the car, though.
As we expected, it’s nowhere near 1 million people, but if I’m being honest, it’s actually higher than I thought.
Especially, if it is around a 19% take rate. I would have expected something closer to 10-15%.
285,000 people at, let’s say, an average price of $8,000 would mean Tesla collected over $2 billion from FSD buyers.
But anyway, it’s not really about how many people bought it. It’s about delivering on its promise that it will eventually truly be a self-driving system, and so far, there’s no clear path to Tesla delivering on that promise.

2022/12/29,"The IRS has now released its full list of electric vehicle models eligible for the new and updated $7,500 US federal tax credit.
Here’s the list of Tesla models eligible.
The new $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles in the US is coming into effect on January 1, 2023, but there are still a lot of details we don’t know about.
The biggest unknowns regard the requirements of battery material provenance and component manufacturing. Recently, the US Treasury announced that it is delaying the guidances regarding those requirements until March and, therefore, they won’t apply until then.
In the meantime, the new tax credit is still coming next month, and now the IRS has released a list of vehicles eligible.
You can find a full list here, but we looked into the Tesla models eligible here because there is a surprise in the list:
The Model S and Model X are not on the list, but that’s not a surprise due to their starting price at over $100,000.
The surprise is that not all Model Ys qualify as an SUV, which enables a higher MSRP limit of $80,000 instead of $55,000 for all vehicles that are not pickup trucks, vans, or SUVs.
It looks like the IRS only considers the Model Y an SUV when it’s in a seven-seat configuration, but the rules don’t appear to be consistent across brands. For example, the Ford Mustang Mach-E is also limited to a $55,000 MSRP, and it doesn’t have an optional third row.
Well that is weird. I wasn’t sure if Y would get classified as an SUV or not, but I certainly didn’t expect 1/2 and 1/2.  
However, the VW ID.4 does get access to the $80,000 MSRP limit, but it is only for the AWD versions of the SUV. There’s no seven-seat option for the ID.4, either.
There appear to be some inconsistencies in the new IRS update. GM vehicles are also not in there, but that might be because they haven’t filed all the paperwork yet.
Either way, if it’s on the list for now, you should be able to claim it.
The entire situation should become clearer during the first quarter of 2023, but we expect some models to potentially see a reduction in the tax credit due to the battery sourcing requirements.

2022/12/29,"Tesla Model Y became the best-selling car in all of Europe in November. It’s for the second time, and not just for electric vehicles, but all cars.
Over the years, Tesla’s vehicles have often become the best-selling vehicles in certain European markets.
However, it never topped the list of best-selling cars in the entire European continent until this September when it took over the continent.
The automaker didn’t maintain its spot in October due to a lack of shipments coming from China, but now the November numbers are in, and Tesla is back on top with the Model Y.
According to data from Automotive News Europe, Tesla delivered nearly 20,000 Model Y vehicles in Europe last month:
Tesla sold 19,144 units of the premium midsize SUV, a gain of more than 260 percent on the same month last year. It was a big rebound for the electric model after it fell out of the top 50 in October, just one month after finishing as Europe’s overall top-seller.
December is expected to be an even bigger month based on early data coming in. For example, Tesla has already delivered 5,000 Model Y vehicles in Norway alone in December.
The Model Y’s rise in popularity in Europe coincides with Tesla ramping-up Model Y production at Gigafactory Berlin.
I've enjoyed my Model Y these past 2.5 years...  I think the car will eventually sell better (once backlogs are gone) if it had a softer ride option (not a sport suspension).   Tesla customer service needs to improve also of course.
The automaker recently confirmed that the factory is now producing 3,000 Model Y vehicles per week. All those vehicles are for the European market, and Tesla also ships cars from Gigafactory Shanghai to Europe.
Elon Musk said that Model Y could become the best-selling in the world, and it looks like he was right.
But as production ramps up, it is looking like Tesla will be able to soon produce over 100,000 Model Y a month, Tesla is likely going to have to focus on a cheaper version of the vehicle – something it has yet to do in some markets, like North America.
Once, it has a “standard range” version in North America, I think Model Y will undoubtedly be the best-selling vehicle in the world.

But there’s another group of people that is being significantly negatively affected by the drop in price and hasn’t been talked about much: Tesla employees.
A part of their compensation is made up of stock options, and when the price drops 69% in a single year, that is going to have an impact – both financial and on morale. 
Today, Electrek obtained an email Elon Musk sent to all Tesla employees to thank them for their hard work. In it he also told workers to “not be too bothered by stock market craziness”:
Btw, don’t be too bothered by stock market craziness. As we demonstrate continued excellent performance, the market will recognize that.
He also again reiterated that he believes Tesla will be the most valuable company on earth long-term.
The CEO also again asked employees to go “all out” for the end of the quarter:
Please go all out for the next few days and volunteer to help deliver if at all possible. It will make a real difference!
The email comes as Tesla is trying to empty out its inventory before the end of the year. As we reported last week, it is working, but the automaker had to offer deep discounts to make it happen.
Obviously, this is easy to say for a billionaire who has sold billions of dollars’ worth of the company’s stock over the last year – significantly contributing to the decline.
As usual Lambert makes a great case. I worked at company that paid part of my salary in stock options. Thinking the stock would only go up, I held until they were worthless. Word to the wise, if you are paid in stock options for a company you work at, sell them as soon as you can...
Also, I’d note that Elon has often used the fact that Tesla offers stock options to all workers to claim that Tesla’s compensation is better than anyone in the auto industry. If you are going to claim that, you can’t really tell employees to “not be bothered” by the stock price when it’s falling like a rock.
Tesla’s focus should undoubtedly be on execution and not the stock price, but there’s something that feels wrong about a billionaire who is partly responsible for the stock price falling telling non-rich people working for him who are affected by price declines to just ignore it.
But that’s par for the course lately as Elon seems not to be very self-aware nowadays.
Also, the entire reason that Elon is asking employees to go “all out” at the end of the quarter is due to “stock market craziness.” He himself admitted that these end-of-quarter pushes are inefficient, but it does look better on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter when there are no cars on inventory.

2022/12/28,"Tesla’s loss in market capitalization equals almost the entire legacy auto industry combined – one of the most significant losses in value of all time.
In 2020, Tesla became the most valuable automaker in the world. The company quickly blew past that and eventually reached a valuation of over $1 trillion. But that was last year, and 2022 has been tough for Tesla on the financial markets.
There are several macroeconomic factors at play, and the broader market is also significantly down in 2022, but Tesla has undoubtedly been tracking worse in a big way over the last few months:
Tesla is down almost 69% year-to-date and erased hundreds of billions in market capitalization.
Statista did the math and realized that the loss in market cap is worth almost the entire legacy auto industry put together:
The publication noted the drop in market cap:
Shockingly, Tesla’s drop in market capitalization, roughly $800 billion from its peak, is bigger than the combined valuation of pretty much any legacy car manufacturer you could think of. As the following chart shows, the combined market capitalization of Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, GM, Ford, Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler and PSA), Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Renault is still more than $100 billion shy of Tesla’s market cap decline.
It is putting a new perspective on the loss in value.
I felt insane over the last couple years reading all the justifications of tesla’s clearly overvalued stock price, and feeling like my brain was fundamentally broken. I feel bad for anyone who lost money in the process, but I do feel better personally that the evidence i was reading that tesla couldn’t justify the stock price was correct. 
Again, there are many different factors at play, but I think it’s important to note that the stock might have also just been overvalued in the first place.
That incredible loss in value followed an incredible rise in value.
Even Elon Musk said that it was overvalued just a few years ago when it was worth less than it is now, but that was also before Tesla was generating $3 billion in free cash flow per quarter.
Either way, it is setting up to be an interesting 2023 for the automaker.

2022/12/27,"Tesla used car prices are finally starting to drop. It’s good for the affordability of Tesla vehicles, but it will put pressure on the company’s new car demand.
Over the last few years, as Tesla increased its new car prices, Tesla used car prices have also been rising fast.
Earlier this year, used Model Y prices went out of control and started to sell for more money than new Model Y vehicles. With Tesla now offering discounts on its new vehicles this month ahead of the new federal tax credit coming into effect next month, we are finally starting to see used Tesla car prices come down.
Reuters reported on data showing that the average used Tesla price went down 17% since its peak in July:
The average price for a used Tesla in November was $55,754, down 17% from a July peak of $67,297. The overall used car market posted a 4% drop during that period, according to Edmunds data. The used Teslas were in dealer inventory for 50 days on average in November, compared with 38 days for all used cars.
The data also shows that the drop in price is killing the practice of people flipping Tesla vehicles.
With the price increases in 2022 and a long backlog, many people were flipping new Tesla vehicles for higher prices on the used car market for people who didn’t want to wait sometimes up to six months for a new car.
I'm delighted to see EV pricing start to normalize. Input costs are one thing but market demand and supply are quite another. A bumpy ride to be sure, but EVs getting to parity, and below, their gas guzzling doppelgangers is a huge win. This is a move in that direction. 
The data showed that by August, already a third of all used Tesla cars on the market were 2022 model-year vehicles.
Since it doesn’t use the franchise dealer model and it owns all its stores, Tesla has a great hold on its used car business.
In September, we noted that Jimmy Douglas, director of sales and delivery operations at Tesla, claimed the automaker’s used car business is “as big as some publicly traded used car retailers.“
This trend is going to help with the affordability of used Tesla cars, but it is also going to negatively affect the automaker’s growing used car business.

2022/12/27,"As Tesla prepares to bring the Cybertruck electric pickup truck to production, we explore the potential for the automaker to make a Cybertruck SUV with a third row and up to nine seats.
The Cybertruck is Tesla’s entry into the still-young but increasingly popular electric pickup truck market.
The pickup truck will be the automaker’s focus for a while, but it might be worth exploring Tesla using the platform to make other vehicles.
Tesla has always launched SUV versions on new vehicle platforms, like Model X following Model S and Model Y following Model 3.
Some electric pickup truck makers have done the same with their pickups, like Rivian launching the R1S SUV based on its Rivian R1T electric pickup truck.
Therefore, it’s not impossible that Tesla would eventually go a similar way and look to make an SUV version of the Cybertruck.
Scott Stewart from SAAW put together a few renders imagining what the Tesla Cybertruck could look like as an SUV and shared them with Electrek:
Now the obvious change over the pickup version is that you give up the functionality of the bed for a bigger interior cabin, and ideally, you use that extra cabin space for a third row.
There are not many electric vehicle options with a third row. Tesla offers some of them, but it starts around at least $115,000 for the Model X, and as for the Model Y, the size of the third row is pretty laughable.
A Tesla Cybertruck SUV could potentially have up to nine seats thanks to the deployable middle seat in the front row and how you handle the third row. And based on the Cybertruck platform, it could potentially be offered at a much cheaper price point than the Model X – making it an interesting new entry in the all-electric vehicles with third rows’ market.
I feel that a CyberSUV offshoot would likely be a very good seller and possibly even surpass the ""Truck"" if made available at a respectable price point.  If the seats could fold down or be removed for larger cargo moving  then it would make for a well rounded multi-use platform.
Here’s what the third row of a Tesla Cybertruck SUV could look like:
It could become an interesting option for people with big families and also for commercial purposes like taxi services.
If a Tesla Cybertruck SUV is in the cards, it isn’t likely to come until Tesla has ramped up production of the Cybertruck pickup truck to high volumes, which isn’t likely to happen before deep into 2024 or even 2025.
What do you think about a potential Tesla Cybertruck SUV? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/12/26,"A Tesla owner’s video went viral after he couldn’t get his Model S to charge at a Supercharger station in the cold.
Domenick Nati, a radio host in Virginia, was trying to charge his Tesla Model S last Friday ahead of his holiday travel, but he was having some issues.
It was reportedly 19°F – or -7°C – at the time.
Nati claims to have first tried to charge at home without success, and then he tried at a local Supercharger station where he posted this video on TikTok that went viral:
Tesla S will not charge in the cold. Stranded on Christmas Eve! #tesla #ev #cold #winter #winterweather #storm #christmas #christmaseve #coldweather #weather #blizzard #wow #car #cars #elonmusk #help #stranded #how #electric #electriccar #teslas #teslamodel3 #charge #mad #fail #merrychristmas #twitter #truck #trucks #storm
When plugged into the Supercharger, the car showed a message saying that it was warming up the battery pack in preparation for charging, but it never actually started to charge – even an hour later.
Nati claims to have reached out to Tesla about the issue, but he couldn’t get a response by Saturday.
The video and media reports on it are creating some confusion. Some are associating this with the normal problems charging in the cold.
First off, it’s true that electric vehicle charging is affected by colder temperatures, but this is not normal. 
There's a Youtube video that just came out that addresses exactly this. The channel is 'Out of Spec Reviews' and the title is ""I Deep Froze My Tesla And Immediately Plugged It Into A Supercharger To See What Happens""

He left his Tesla out overnight at -14°F and then charged it. I don't remember the details, but I think it took an hour of warming up the battery before it would start charging. He mentioned that normally you wouldn't do this--you have the car preheat the battery before you start charging (either before you get to the car or while driving to a charging station).

Maybe this guy's car is broken or he didn't wait long enough (was he monitoring his battery?)  In any case, any car that doesn't warm up the battery first when it has gotten to such low temperatures is risking damaging the battery.
It takes time for the battery pack to warm up enough to accept higher charge rates. That’s why Tesla built in a feature that enables the battery pack to condition itself for charging ahead of time if you enter a charge point in the navigation system.
So yes, there are issues with charging in colder temperatures, but this is not it – this is a malfunction with this gentleman’s specific vehicle.
I have charged Tesla vehicles and other EVs at way colder temperatures than -7°C without issue. It’s unfortunate, but it looks to be a problem with the owner’s specific car than hopefully is going to be covered by the warranty.
The biggest highlight, if anything, is that he couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Tesla for a remote diagnostic. That’s a big issue with Tesla’s service. It’s hard to get someone on the phone.

2022/12/25,"Now that Tesla launched Steam in its Model S and Model X, there’s a way to make your electric car your main gaming computer – a $100,000+ gaming computer.
In the latest Model S and Model X, Tesla included a new entertainment computer with capabilities similar to the latest generation of gaming consoles and gaming computers.
It’s going to be the new computer powering Tesla’s video game ambitions, which the automaker believes are going to be increasingly important inside vehicles amid the advent of self-driving technology.
In the meantime, Tesla is developing new video game apps for owners to play in their vehicles while parked or in the backseat screen in the Model S and Model X.
But now that Tesla launched Steam Beta in the vehicles, it even opens up the capacity to make your Tesla Model S or Model X your home gaming computer or console.
A Tesla owner on Reddit showed that Tesla’s native Steam app can be linked to an Apple TV through the Steam Link App – meaning that you can play games running on your Tesla gaming computer on any screen with an Apple TV in your house:
Your Tesla can basically become your main gaming computer in your house – albeit a pretty expensive gaming computer.
You need is to download the Steam Link app on your device.
For Apple devices, like Macbooks or Apple TVs, the company describes the app:
“The Steam Link app allows you to play your Steam games across all your computers. Just pair an MFI or Steam controller to your Mac, connect to a computer running Steam on the same local network, and start playing your existing Steam games.”
You only need to have your Tesla and the device on which you wish to stream your Steam game to be on the same Wifi network and then connect a controller to that device.
As long as your car is within range, you can have it power your gaming inside your house and enjoy any game in your Steam library.
It’s pretty cool that this works in the first place, but obviously, it’s not an ideal gaming setup.
You’d think that if you can afford a $100,000+ car and you are a gamer, you also be able and want to build yourself a more efficient gaming setup. I know I would.
But it’s still awesome that it is something that you can do if you are so inclined.

2022/12/25,"Tesla has confirmed that its 4680 battery cell production has now reached a level that can support the production of over 1,000 cars a week.
The 4680 battery cell is a new format that Tesla unveiled back in 2020 as the automaker’s first cell developed from the ground up.
In the past, Tesla had been involved in cell development, but it was mainly about tuning the chemistry of existing 18650 and 2170 cell formats.
Now Tesla planned to develop a cell of its own with a much bigger format enabled by a tableless design. Tesla also planned to manufacture the cells itself along through partnerships with existing cell manufacturers.
That was more than two years ago, and we haven’t had a clear look at the progress of Tesla’s own 4680 battery cell production.
Tesla has held tightly to its battery cell manufacturing data.
The last official data point that Tesla released was the first 1 million cells completed at its pilot plant in Fremont, and that was back in February 2022.
Since then, Tesla has only released a few statements about percentage increases in its production rate without confirming the actual production rate.
Today, Tesla confirmed the actual production rate for the first time – stating that the team produced 868,000 4680 battery cells over the last week:
Congrats to the 4680 cell team on achieving 868k cells built in the last 7 days—equal to 1k+ cars! 🔋 pic.twitter.com/CaC7Js9aEL
That’s enough to produce over 1,000 Model Y vehicles. The cells are used to produce one type of Model Y vehicle with a structural battery pack at Gigafactory Texas.
Alongside the pilot plant in Fremont, the automaker is also establishing higher volume production at the Texas plant for a shorter supply chain.
While Tesla battery supply constraints have eased up over the last year thanks to suppliers ramping up production, a lot of the automaker’s growth in 2023 is expected to be tied to its capacity to ramp up 4680 cell production.
The Gigafactory Texas has a huge storage area with stacks of assembled battery packs waiting to be put into the Model Y's.  It looks like they're already running a 4680 assembly line when Joe flew his drone past the windows to see inside.  Joe Tegtmeyer's very informative channel is on YouTube.
Therefore, this milestone is good to hit just ahead of the new year.
Tesla seemed to have a lot of issues hitting volume production with the 4680 cells, but those numbers could mean that Tesla worked through some of the bigger bottlenecks and now we could possibly see a smoother ramp from here.

2022/12/24,"Tesla is taking delivery of a little army of Kuka robots, and the timing suggests that they will be used to build the Cybertruck electric pickup truck.
We are not talking about an army of Tesla Bots… not yet.
Kuka robots are mostly industrial arm robots used in manufacturing. It is Tesla’s preferred robot for most of its production line along with some FANUC robots.
We reported on Tesla taking a massive delivery of Kuka robots at Gigafactory Texas to build the Model Y production lines last year.
Now Tesla is taking delivery of another large order of Kuka robots, according to a bill of landing spotted by Twitter user @gregtruck:
66 Kuka production line robots arrived in Houston on the 18th. The Kuka robots have been used on ALL Tesla production lines, just makes most sense at this time to be in regards to #Cybertruck $tsla Check out below! Incl. example of WHAT Kuka Robots are specifically! pic.twitter.com/3K4uwuSCaR
While a significant number, 66 robots are not actually that many for most automotive production lines.
Of course, this could be one of several shipments coming, but Tesla has also been working to simplify its production lines, and it has been able to significantly reduce production spaces needed and the number of robots over the last few years.
The timing of this shipment of robots matches Cybertruck production.
We have seen Tesla starting to take delivery and install production equipment for the highly anticipated start of production of the Cybertruck in 2023.
Tesla has been aiming for a start of production in mid-2023, but it has also always said that the focus of the production teams will shift to Cybertruck once Model Y reaches volume production at Gigafactory Texas.
The automaker recently announced that Gigafactory Texas achieved the production of 3,000 vehicles in a week. The goal originally was 5,000 vehicles a week, which is also what Tesla generally refers to when talking about achieving “volume production.”
Electrek recently reported that Tesla is planning for an average production rate of 5,000 cars a week out of Gigafactory Texas.
""Therefore, there’s still a chance for the Cybertruck to be the dominant electric pickup truck within a short period of time in my opinion""
Perhaps only for Elon-gated definitions of ""short periods of time"".
Here we're talking about a very unconventional truck of which only a few prototypes exist & for which Tesla has yet to figure out how to build in quantity.
That's not an easy task for any automaker.
It would coincide with a shift of focus on setting up Cybertruck production in the first few months of 2023.
While several other automakers have beat Tesla to market with electric pickup trucks, I still think that Tesla has a real chance to beat them in volumes within the next 12 to 18 months.
Rivian is having issues producing 10,000 vehicles per quarter, GM has signaled that it will only produce a few Silverado electric pickups in 2023, and Ford plans to reach a production rate of 150,000 F-150 Lightning by the end of 2023, but it isn’t likely to deliver 100,000 electric trucks next year.
Tesla has been able to ramp up electric vehicle programs to large volumes better than any other automaker. Therefore, in my opinion, there’s still a chance for the Cybertruck to be the dominant electric pickup truck within a short period.

2022/12/23,"This new Tesla Model 3 hearse shows that everything is going electric, even for your last trip in a vehicle.
Hearses are actually perfect for electrification.
They mostly drive relatively small distances from funeral homes or churches to graveyards, and they generally have plenty of time to charge between drives.
But they are mostly built aftermarket on top of existing vehicles, and it took some time for builders to go electric.
Some funeral homes and hearse makers have seen the opportunity for a while now, and we have seen them use Tesla vehicles and a Leaf to create all-electric hearses. As for the Tesla vehicles that were turned into hearses, it has mostly been the Model S.
For the first time, we now see a Tesla Model 3 hearse.
Netherlands-based hearse and limo maker Derks unveiled this impressive new Tesla Model 3 hearse for production:
The company says that it is built on a Model 3 Standard Range Plus:
The basis of the Tesla Hearse 3 is the Model 3, equipped with a Standard plus range package and rear-wheel drive, which means that the range after conversion is between 350 and 375 km.
That range is actually not bad with the modification since the official WLTP range of the Model 3 Standard Range Plus is 448 km, but it could be an optimistic range.
The modifications to the Model 3 are quite extensive and make the electric sedan much bigger:
The Model 3 hearse needs a softer suspension setup, otherwise bumpy road could wake up the dead.
It has a massive tailgate and electric curtains all around the back:
As a hearse, the Tesla Hearse 3 is built as standard with a tailgate and a 100% composite, lightweight body. The vehicle is equipped with small side doors with storage spaces behind them and an extendable box floor. As standard, the vehicle is equipped with electric curtains and LED lighting in the box area. A starry sky, extendable flower racks and a drawer under the floor are among the options.
We contacted Derks about the price of their Tesla Model 3 hearse, and we will update if we get an answer.
For an idea of pricing, we previously saw a Tesla Model S hearse for sale for $200,000.
Tell me you are not dying to get in this Tesla Model 3 hearse.

2022/12/23,"Tesla has authorized locations in North America to start selling display and test-drive vehicles as it aims to close out a record quarter despite the noise.
Over the last few weeks, we have reported on a lot of incentives Tesla has put in place to sell cars this quarter.
Tesla started offering a $3,750 discount to buyers for everyone taking delivery of a vehicle in the US in December.
Later, the automaker also started to offer 10,000 free supercharging miles to people taking delivery this month.
Earlier this week, Tesla increased the amount of the discount to $7,500 – equivalent to the federal full tax credit for electric vehicles that will be put in place for vehicles getting delivered next month in the US.
However, we didn’t report on how well these incentives have been working.
Now we learn that Tesla’s inventories are getting low in the US as the incentive program was successful.
Tesla barely has any Model 3 vehicles available in the Bay Area. It has some Model Ys. The automaker literally has a single Model 3 listed for the Los Angeles area and less than two dozen Model Y vehicles.
Tesla still has a few dozen Model 3 vehicles around New York City and a handful of Model Y vehicles. Florida also still has some inventory.
But most markets are starting to run low on inventory following the rare discount program put in place by Tesla. There are more cars coming off the lines in Fremont and Texas for the US market, but many of them are already spoken for.
Electrek has learned that Tesla started to authorize the sale of display and test-ride vehicles in several markets in the US yesterday, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Tesla is expected to beat its previous US delivery record by a significant margin in the US and globally.
The last record was achieved last quarter with over 343,000 vehicles.
In Q4 2022, Tesla is expected to deliver over 400,000 vehicles thanks to increased production capacity and a decent number of vehicles in transit at the end of the last quarter.
I believe Tesla is likely going to be around Elon’s magic number in Q4: 420K deliveries.
In some way I am happy, deflationary forces taking places, Tesla will be serving major market price bend 30-50 K , 65 K Model Y price was getting to the point most people just won’t pay that kind of money for vehicle, despite they could possibly afford it.
It would put Tesla at over 1.3 million deliveries in 2022 or about 39% growth versus the previous year. That’s not exactly the 50% rate Tesla has been aiming for, but it is still undeniably impressive in the current auto market compared to other brands.
The problem for Tesla is that a significant number of those 420,000 vehicles have been heavily discounted this quarter. Tesla has industry-leading gross margins that enable it to absorb those discounts profitably, but it is still going to affect its bottom line in a bad way.
Now in the US, the government is going to cover these discounts, in the US at least, starting next quarter.
It will be interesting to see how Tesla fares in the rest of the world in 2023 with a lot more production capacity.

2022/12/22,"Tesla owners are starting to receive messages on their cars offering a free 30-day trial of Enhanced Autopilot, with the message “Happy Holidays!” from Tesla.
The messages started showing up on social media, posted by owners in Australia and New Zealand. Notably, this started happening when it was early enough for people to be awake in those countries, but while it was late night or very early morning in the US and EU.
So we don’t know yet if this is a global giveaway or only in the Oceania region, but we suspect we’ll find out soon enough as the rest of the world wakes up and goes for a drive. We see no reason that it would be restricted to AU/NZ, so perhaps it just needs to propagate to the rest of the world as the day moves on.
The message reads “Happy Holidays! A complimentary trial of Enhanced Autopilot has been enabled for you to enjoy for 30 days.” It then describes to drivers how to enable various Autopilot features, which must be done while the vehicle is parked before the first time each individual driver profile attempts to use the system.
Ok this is pretty cool, users are reporting free trials of Enhanced Autopilot for 30 days. I already have it on the Model Y and FSD on the Model 3, but neat they are offering this. Auto Lane Change is definitely the most useful feature. pic.twitter.com/GSVhAj0Nti
All Teslas come equipped with Autopilot, Tesla’s brand name for its driver-assist technology. Basic Autopilot includes traffic-aware cruise control, which follows the car in front of you, and autosteer, which keeps the car in its lane on highways.
Enhanced Autopilot is an additional package that adds more capabilities. Tesla has offered it as a separate package on and off over the years, and brought it back in June with its current price point of $6,000 (or $5,100 AUD/$5,700 NZD, in the countries we’ve seen this giveaway in so far).
Enhanced Autopilot includes these features, over and above Basic Autopilot:
Then, beyond Enhanced Autopilot is Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving Capability,” which includes the above functions and also will start and stop the car for traffic lights and stop signs, and allows entry into Tesla’s “FSD Beta,” which comes with Autosteer on city streets.
All of these features still require active participation from a driver, and are considered “Level 2” autonomous driving systems, where the driver is primarily responsible for monitoring the driving environment. Thus, they are not “full self-driving” yet, though Tesla has repeatedly claimed that cars with FSD will eventually be able to drive themselves without driver intervention.
Tesla does have a way for owners to “try out” FSD by purchasing an FSD subscription for $199/month (assuming you have HW3.0; otherwise Tesla will charge you $1,000 for hardware you already bought, but you might be able to get that money back in small claims court). There is no similar subscription for Enhanced Autopilot, only the one-time purchase option.
But this trial comes at a somewhat awkward time. Currently, new Tesla owners are receiving cars without ultrasonic sensors, after Tesla abruptly removed them from new vehicles in October, saying they were redundant to Tesla’s all-vision sensing system.
As a result, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon are all disabled on these new vehicles until Tesla upgrades their software to use vision sensors instead of the previous ultrasonics. This means that new cars won’t get to use three out of the five Enhanced Autopilot features during this trial period, unless Tesla pushes a vision update within the next 30 days.
Since there is no other way to “try out” Enhanced Autopilot for most customers, this seems like an excellent way to show people what the system can – or can’t – do. Many owners are curious about whether the additional features would be worthwhile, but not a lot of people can toss several thousand dollars at something they don’t know will be worth it for them.
This will let those owners have a chance to try out the system for a pretty significant period of time – not just a couple days, but a whole month.
Some of this, such as parking, doesn't work on new MY where they removed the ultrasonic sensors. 
Bad timing just makes people realize what Tesla dropped from their new cars to save $144.
It doesn’t cost Tesla anything to activate this, and it might drive a few conversions if owners are happy with the system’s capabilities.
Personally, I don’t think EAP is worth the thousands of dollars being charged for it, at least not for me: 
They’re interesting capabilities for a car to have, but I’d rather keep the thousands of dollars myself. That said, the same may not be true for every other owner – and now everyone will have a chance to find out if it seems worth it to them or not.
Let us know in the comments below if you’ve gotten this message this morning and where you are in the world. We’re curious if this is a worldwide giveaway or only limited to AU/NZ.

2022/12/22,"You can’t buy the Tesla Cybertruck just yet, but you can now order a $300 Tesla wireless charging platform inspired by Cybertruck.
Tesla has been on a kick lately to sell very overpriced products on its online shop.
Just last week, we reported on Tesla launching a wildly overpriced solid-state drive for its vehicles.
Now it has another questionably priced product with the launch of the “Tesla Wireless Charging Platform.”
The automaker put the new product for sale for $300 on its website today and described it as being inspired by the Cybertruck:
Inspired by the angular design and metallic styling of Cybertruck, our Wireless Charging Platform provides 15W of fast charging power per device for up to three devices simultaneously. Its sleek design is composed of an aluminum housing, premium alcantara surface and a detachable magnetic stand that allows you to lay the charger flat or at an angle for better viewing. Featuring FreePower® technology, which charges your Qi capable devices such as phones or earbuds placed anywhere on its surface without precise alignment.
One thing you missed in the article is the tech in the device.  The freepower is different from the cheap pads because orientation and placement does not matter as much (has to be parallel with surface)  and can give a full 15W to each device.  All while being power efficient.  The cheapest freepower pro 3 device charger I could find was $360 on ebay.  Now is that tech worth the price vs other pads hard to say.  But based on the price of what I found this is reasonable for a selling price.
Here are a few images released by Tesla:
At $300, the device is grossly overpriced in terms of functionality since you can find plenty of three-device wireless charging platforms starting at about $40 on Amazon.
In order to justify the purchase, you would have to put a massive $200+ value on the somewhat Cybertruck-inspired design, Tesla brand, and the higher-quality material like aluminum frame and Alcantara mat.
But Tesla could make a killing with this product by only convincing a small percentage of the over 1.5 million people who reportedly reserved the Tesla Cybertruck to buy it.

2022/12/22,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined a Twitter space today to speak about the recent moves in TSLA stock and defends his recent actions from Tesla investors who have called for him to stop wasting time on Twitter, the social media site that he recently purchased.
Musk has faced many questions about his recent behavior with Twitter, as most of his public time recently has involved getting in fights with investors or trying to stop a routine spending bill.
Today he finally went into a public Twitter space to talk about these issues, including with Ross Gerber, the aforementioned investor with whom he has been feuding.
The main point of contention with Gerber has been regarding the source of TSLA’s recent price drop. Musk contends that fed interest rates are the primary contributor, both because it drives capital flight from equities and into safer bonds as bond yields go up, and because it suppresses demand for consumer products that are often bought with debt, such as autos (or, perhaps, Twitter itself, which Musk took on tens of billions in loans to buy).
But investment experts have countered the assertion that fed rates have driven TSLA stock’s fall, saying that Tesla’s performance has underperformed other stocks in the automotive sector even as bond yields have held steady. Surely they’ve had an effect, but Musk is perhaps overstating that effect.
Part of the difference could be related to Musk’s recent large sales of Tesla stock, having sold tens of billions over the course of the last year to fund his Twitter acquisition (aka disaster, aka dumpster fire). Generally, insider stock sales send a signal to the market that insiders, particularly the CEO, may not have full confidence in the company’s performance, and add negative pressure to a stock price.
Musk’s sales have happened in a high-profile way and for inopportune reasons, as well. Tesla investors don’t seem to see the upside of these stock sales for the future of Tesla, even though Musk says it will help the EV company in the long term.
Today, Musk stated that he wouldn’t sell any more stock:
I’m not selling any stock for, I dunno, a minimum of 18-24 months.  You can count on me, no stock sales until 2025 or something. I needed to sell some stock just to make sure there’s still some powder dry to account for a worst-case scenario… I won’t sell stock until probably two years from now. Definitely not next year under any circumstances. Probably not the year after either.
However, Musk has said this many times before, and has still sold Tesla stock. Despite routinely saying he would be the last person to sell TSLA stock for the last decade, Musk has sold large chunks of stock several times over the last year. So investors may be glad to hear that he is done selling, but they’ve heard that before.
No further TSLA sales planned after today
Musk also stated, “I’m somewhat paranoid having gone through two really intense recessions,” suggesting that his companies might want cash on hand to weather what he sees as an upcoming recession, or at least some sort of “macro drama.” This belief is likely behind Tesla’s hiring freeze and layoffs. Musk said, “If we do have another 2009 situation, the stock price of everything is gonna be lower.”
Given that Twitter is a private company wholly owned by him, and Musk’s wealth is largely concentrated in TSLA stock, we’re not sure what other major methods of fundraising are available to Musk to free up more “dry powder” other than selling more Tesla stock or taking on more debt.
On the contrary, Musk even talked about the possibility of a stock buyback. Despite his concern about a recession, he also stated that the stock price is currently low, and said his vote would be for a buyback. Though this statement was couched in the eventuality that we aren’t in another 2008-2009 recession situation, which Musk believes we might be going into.
While many have made note of Musk’s distractions with Twitter, he stated that “there’s not an important Tesla meeting I’ve missed the entire time. I’m not totally missing in action” and asked “is there anything I could have done in the last two months that would have helped with Tesla execution? I literally cant think of anything.” But he also referred to Twitter colorfully by stating “if you cross catnip with crack, that’s what Twitter is” – which is not exactly the sort of statement a person would make about something they aren’t addicted to.
Another question was asked by Earl Banning, known as 28delayslater on Twitter, a longtime investor and fan who referred to how Musk’s recent political statements have taken the shine off of Tesla for him and his family (including his children, one of whom is trans, a group that Musk’s tweets have recently negatively targeted). This is something we’ve seen in data, with Tesla losing popular support due to these divisive statements.
Musk said that he doesn’t hate trans people, and “doesn’t want to be a hater of anyone.” Banning attempted to ask a follow-up, but was cut off.
Well, this was quite a spectacle. It was nice to see Musk back to focusing on Tesla for once, after so much nonsense related to Twitter for so long.
But it sort of sounded like he was saying whatever anyone wanted to hear. On the one hand, he thinks there will be a recession, and on the other hand, he thinks Tesla could do buybacks. On the one hand, he wants companies to have dry powder ready, but on the other hand, he absolutely will not sell stock in order to free up cash (as he has stated before, and then still sold stock).
""No further TSLA sales planned after today""

Quite a stretch from stating ""no further stock sales"".
So with this recent history of conflicting statements, it’s hard to take any of them seriously. However, the market seems to have been comforted by Musk’s words, as the stock went up about two and a half percent in after-hours trading, mostly after his statement that he won’t sell any more stock.
But as for our answer to one pointed question he asked on the call: “Is there anything I could have done in the last two months that would have helped with Tesla execution?”
Yes, there is something. As Gerber said, Tesla’s stock has been flagging lately because it has been running without the focus of its CEO. For Tesla to function correctly, it either needs a focused CEO who can aid it in execution (perhaps by stepping down from Twitter, as Musk promised, then reversed that promise), or at the very least a COO who can take the place of the CEO while the CEO is busy with their “catnip crossed with crack.”
SpaceX has this in COO Gwynne Shotwell, who has executed well for that company. Perhaps Tesla needs someone similar (potentially Tom Zhu, head of Tesla China?).

2022/12/22,"I think it’s high time for Tesla to bring back a Press Relations (PR) department and have other ways to communicate than through the increasingly polarizing Elon Musk.
Tesla stopped answering press inquiries in 2020, and Electrek later reported that CEO Elon Musk dissolved Tesla’s whole press department.
At the time, the CEO told us that any question should go through him.
In 2021, Musk commented on someone asking for Tesla to hire a PR department again. He turned the idea down and suggested that having a PR department amounts to “manipulating public opinion.”
Over the last few years, the only way for journalists or the public to ask questions to Tesla has been through Elon Musk – mostly on Twitter.
Musk’s use of the social platform has evolved over the last few years. It used to be a great feedback loop for Tesla, but over time, Musk has become more resistant to criticism, blocked critics – including yours truly – and surrounded himself with sycophants on Twitter.
He is often seen retweeting and responding to tweets from people consistently praising him or even quoting him.
When I talk about Elon's feedback loop being hijacked by superfans, that's what I mean. This guy tweets Elon, mostly straight up praise, an average of 19 times/day. That's just one of them & as one of the most prominent accounts, Elon sees a lot of that.https://t.co/DP6vaeFUjr pic.twitter.com/Tkd8FSGCXe
More recently, Musk’s use of Twitter evolved again where he now regularly tweets about the “woke mind virus,” the “deep state,” and conspiracy theories.
The CEO still tweets about Tesla, but it’s becoming harder and harder for constructive criticism to get through the noise and reach Musk.
Over the last few months, surveys have shown that Tesla’s reputation has been going down, and the stock price is crashing further than the rest of the industry.
It’s kind of crazy that I have to make the argument for a major company like Tesla to have a PR department in the first place.
But now more than ever, Tesla needs to separate its voice from Elon’s. He alienated too many people. Tesla needs to build its own voice, and despite what Musk thinks, a PR department helps with that.
1- For $TSLA fans & investors holding on to the idea that ""it's just the stock price, fundamentals haven't changed, and the company is still as strong as ever"", I beg you to open your eyes to the fact that things have changed. Tesla's credibility, through Elon's, is crashing.
I didn’t like what Musk said about PR departments being about “manipulating the public.” Of course, it can do that, but it can also simply find ways to efficiently communicate Tesla’s missions, its products, and services.
It can also answer questions that the media has in order to ensure that the most accurate information is out there.
I would argue the strongest Tesla bulls are those who can be critical while still holding onto their shares. People like SMR, while I generally agree with, are totally wrong about how Elon has been conducting himself as of late. Fred is right, Elon surrounding himself w/ only praise isn't healthy.
Now I know plenty of you are thinking: “But I hate the media. Journalists are all biased assholes. There’s no point in engaging with them.”
Like in any industry, there are bad actors and incompetent people in the media, but there are also good people trying to do the best for their readers or audience. Sometimes, they are legitimate questions that need answering – and Musk is not doing that for the most part.
Tesla’s PR department was never perfect, and certainly understaffed for a company of that size and with the kind of media coverage they were getting, but they did correct a lot of misinformation and promote Tesla’s highly important mission.
Now at a time when Elon has become more polarizing and there’s a lot of confusion about several of Tesla’s programs, like Full Self-Driving, I think it’s more important than ever for the company to engage with the public – ideally through a strong PR department.

2022/12/22,"Tesla Model Y has beat the best-selling car record for a single year in Norway – taking it from the VW Beetle in 1969.
Norway has been the leading market for electric vehicles in terms of adoption per capita.
As many markets are introducing plans to “ban” gas-powered cars by 2030, 2035, and even later, Norway is aiming for each new car on the road to be all-electric by 2025, and it’s on pace to achieve that early.
The results this year have been nothing short of stunning, with the December numbers released today being no exception and showing us the whole year.
64.5% of all cars sold in Norway in 2021 were all-electric.
In 2022, it looks like the country is going to close the year at closer to 80% and 90% if you include plug-in hybrids.
A big part of this year’s growth is due to Tesla’s Model Y, which is having an incredible year in Norway.
The electric SUV has now even beat the record for the most car sold in a year in the country. It was held by the VW Beetle in 1969, with 16,709 units delivered.
Today, the Model Y has beat that record with 16,748 units registered year-to-date, according to several online trackers.
With another week left in the quarter and based on the current average number of deliveries per day, it looks like Tesla could deliver closer to 18,000 Model Ys in Norway in 2022.
While Volkswagen lost the crown to Tesla, the automaker also deserves credit for the record EV market share that Norway is going to achieve in 2022.
The VW ID.4 is second only to the Model Y in the country this year, with over 11,000 deliveries.
The third-best seller is the Škoda Enyaq iV, with over 7,000 deliveries. Škoda is also a Volkswagen brand.
Norway is awesome. I know it’s a small, rich country; therefore, it is not representative of other markets – but it also kind of is.
They certainly have advantages that make them able to adopt EVs faster, but as the cost of EVs comes down over time, these advantages will be less significant, and other markets will be able to go the same way as Norway.
I think Norway will be as close to 100% EV sales as it gets in 2024, and it is going to be clearer for the rest of the world that buying anything other than an all-electric vehicle at that point would be a terrible idea.

2022/12/22,"Tesla Megapack, the company’s utility-scale energy storage battery system, could be sold out for almost the next two years, according to Tesla’s own timeline.
Back in 2019, Tesla launched the Megapack; it was Tesla’s third stationary energy storage product after the Powerwall and Powerpack.
A single Megapack unit is a container-sized “3 MWh battery system” with integrated modules, inverters, and thermal systems. With the bigger size and integrated power electronics, Tesla claims that the Megapack is 60% more energy-dense than its Powerpack. It also comes on-site, ready to install and can ship in containers.
A few months ago, Tesla updated the Megapack with more capacity, 3.9 MWh, and made it a bit bigger.
Now several online commenters have pointed out that Tesla has updated its online configurator with the earliest delivery in Q3 2024:
The location, installation, or amount doesn’t seem to change anything. Tesla doesn’t list any delivery available until Q3 2024 – almost two years from now.
Megapack projects have been popping up left and right lately.
Tesla’s biggest energy storage product has quickly emerged as the leading battery system for large utility-scale energy storage systems. It enables electric utilities to make better use of renewable energy, like solar, and stabilize the grid.
Megapack helped Tesla’s energy division accelerate storage deployment, and the company has now built an impressive backlog of orders.
But Tesla is now working faster than ever through its backlog with 42 Megapacks per week produced at Gigafactory Nevada, in addition to the new Megafactory in California recently coming online and trying to ramp up to an ambitious capacity of 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.
That’s why it is impressive that despite the new capacity, Tesla is still trailing for about 20 months for new installations.
Once the Megafactory in California is at full capacity, Tesla will be deploying more energy storage capacity in a single quarter than it has over the entire existence of Tesla Energy until today.
We are hearing that the ramp-up at the factory has been going fairly well.

2022/12/22,"A new report claims that Tesla’s head of China, Tom Zhu, is in line for a bigger role at the automaker amid previous more sketchy rumors that he was taking over Elon Musk’s role as CEO.
Earlier this month, we reported on a rumor that Zhu, president of Tesla China, would replace Musk as CEO of Tesla.
We were skeptical of the report as it came from a Chinese outlet that was just found guilty of spreading fake news about Tesla in China and asked to compensate the company.
However, other reports are now starting to add validity to Zhu at least having a greater role at Tesla, albeit not necessarily the role of CEO.
We did report earlier this month that Zhu was tapped to go lead Gigafactory Texas – though it’s unclear if the role is permanent.
Now Reuters reports that Zhu is in line for “a more senior and wider-ranging role at Tesla” and that he appears to be leaving his role in China:
However, Zhu’s colleagues in Shanghai believe he is in line for a more senior and wider-ranging role at Tesla, the two people said.
A close aide to Zhu in Shanghai circulated a farewell poem for the China boss in recent weeks on social media, anticipating his new assignment, according to the message reviewed by Reuters.
Zhu has previously received praise and credit from Musk for Tesla’s success in China and especially for the success of Gigafactory Shanghai, which is now Tesla’s most productive factory.
A possibility here is that Zhu would take on a role of either president of Tesla or president of Tesla Automotive.
There’s precedent for those positions.
While no one currently holds those roles at Tesla, the company previously had Jon McNeil as “president of sales and services,” a wide-ranging role within the company’s operations before he left for Lyft in 2018. His responsibilities reportedly went to Musk when he left.
Even if Zhu is the best for the job, the political winds are changing re: China. Elon already got one party to hate him over Twitter. Naming a Chinese national to this position could get the other side to agree this is a national security concern, lending bipartisan support for a congressional hearing
Around the same time, Jerome Guillen was made Tesla’s first “president of automotive” in charge of “all automotive operations and program management” and reporting directly to Musk as part of a management reshuffle.
Guillen had been with Tesla for a long time in various critical roles at the company ranging from head of the Model S program to VP of operations.
By early 2021, Tesla transitioned Guillen away from his role as president of automotive, and he went back to just leading the Tesla Semi program. He left Tesla shortly after.
A role similar to this one likely is what the reports are actually talking about for Zhu rather than the role of CEO.

2022/12/21,"Tesla (TSLA) is increasing the discount, or price adjustment, as it calls it, to $7,500 on all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered this month.
As we have recently reported, Tesla is having some rare demand issues lately – especially in the United States due to unique circumstances.
It has been years since Tesla hit 200,000 deliveries in the United States, which meant the company no longer qualified for the US federal tax credit for electric vehicles. But Tesla buyers are expected to regain access to the incentive, which is valued at up to $7,500, soon.
As the incentive is being put in place for 2023, buyers need to take delivery of their vehicles on or after January 1 to qualify.
This situation is incentivizing buyers to wait until after the new year to purchase a Tesla vehicle in the United States. We reported last month that it also contributed to an increase in cancellations as Tesla is not allowing buyers to delay orders to get them next month.
Earlier this month, we learned that Tesla started offering a $3,750 discount to buyers in order to combat this issue. The amount was interesting since it is half of the full $7,500 tax credit.
Later, the automaker also started to offer 10,000 free supercharging miles to people taking delivery in December.
Now Electrek has learned that Tesla has now authorized staff to increase the discount to $7,500 for Model 3 and Model Y vehicles being delivered by the end of the month, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Elon Musk famously said that Tesla doesn’t do discounts. However, the automaker is calling this a price adjustment.
As we reported earlier today, Tesla plans to implement a hiring freeze and a new round of layoffs as investors are increasingly worried after the stock price dropped more than 60% this year.
It looks like Tesla is having some serious problems selling cars this month, but we anticipated that it would get more difficult as we get closer to the end of the month.
The amount and the timing of the change in the discount are interesting.
Tesla has many advantages by selling direct to consumers. This is a very painful downside of not having franchised dealers. GM can produce like crazy this month and recognize the sales revenue as soon as the vehicles get on a transport, the dealers take the hit until January 1. Tesla has to make a choice among three terrible alternatives:

Reduce production to align with deliveries they can ensure take place this year
Continue production normally and be ready to deliver tons of cars in January but take an awful earnings hit for Q4
The one they have chosen, continue with high volume but eat $7,500 per car sold the last 10 days of the year
This move tells me they are more worried about volume than margin at this point in the quarter, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.
As we noted when Tesla offered $3,500, that’s half of the full discount or what customers would get if the electric vehicle didn’t meet the battery material requirements.
We thought it could potentially indicate that Tesla expected not to get the full discount or it thought that offering buyers half of the discount would be enough to convince them to pull the trigger right now.
Now the discount has been increased to $7,500 and comes just after we learned that virtually all EVs produced in North America will get the full tax credit during the first quarter of 2023 because the US Treasury has delayed its battery material guidance until March.
It could explain the change in the discount.

2022/12/21,"Tesla confirmed that it is going to allow third-party charging stations in its navigation system, but the stations are going to need to meet the automaker’s high standards.
Right now, if you are looking for a charging station in the navigation system inside Tesla vehicles, you will only see Tesla charging stations.
This hasn’t been a problem, for the most part, as Tesla’s Supercharger network is the most extensive and considered the best charging network by most.
As we previously reported, surveys have found that Tesla dominates charging experience satisfaction – primarily because of its near-perfect uptime, while other charging networks often have charging stations not working.
But third-party charging stations have improved lately and grown significantly, especially in Europe, where Tesla uses the CCS connector like all other charging networks.
Now Tesla has announced that it is going to allow third-party chargers on its navigation system, but they will need to meet certain criteria:
Third-party fast chargers that meet our performance and reliability standards will be added to Tesla’s navigation automatically as Qualified Third-Party Chargers. The intent is to ensure a smooth charging experience for Tesla drivers. The following standards will first roll out across Europe and Israel.
The automaker says that the charging stations will need to meet these three criteria over a 60-day period in order to be added:
The stations will be removed from the navigation system automatically if one of the two criteria is met within 14 days:
As Tesla noted, the new “Qualified Third-Party Charger” program is starting with Europe and Israel, where it is going to have a more significant impact since Tesla vehicles are already equipped with a CCS connector like most third-party charging stations.
My wife's EV6 doesn't even have many newer chargers in the POI database that they update once or twice per year... there is a reason Tesla is so far ahead on these things....



The same program is likely going to make it to North America, but Tesla is likely going to prioritize charging network operators who use its charge connector, which Tesla recently tried to make the new standard in North America.
This is a great move. Most of the time, Tesla owners are going to want to use Superchargers for an optimized experience, but some third-party stations could be very useful, and having them in the navigation system is going to make things easier.
From my own experience and based on what I heard from European EV drivers, third-party stations are not bad in Europe.
In North America, hopefully it will encourage network operators to up their game and increase their up time in order to help attract Tesla owners, which there are more of than any other EV drivers.

2022/12/21,"Tesla (TSLA) has told employees that it is implementing a hiring freeze and confirmed that another wave of layoffs is coming next quarter, according to a source familiar with the matter.
In June, Elon Musk asked Tesla executives to “pause all hiring” and cut 10% of staff.
The CEO has given different reasons to different people for the layoffs, including that he has a “very bad feeling” about the economy.
Tesla has been growing fast over the years, and that often results in hiring inefficiencies that eventually lead to rounds of layoffs like this one.
The “hiring pause” was more worrisome as Tesla has several programs growing fast, and it needs to hire thousands of people at new factories in the US and Germany.
However, Tesla quickly reversed the hiring pause and started growing its hiring again during the second half of the year.
Now Electrek has learned that Tesla is implementing a new hiring freeze and plans further layoffs, according to a reliable source familiar with the matter.
Tesla has communicated to some employees that it is stopping hiring for now. On top of the hiring freeze, Tesla also said that teams will be expected to make layoffs during the first quarter of 2023.
It’s not clear how extensive the hiring freeze will be as Tesla is still planning to expand in some manufacturing locations. No further details were made available at this time.
The moves come as Tesla’s stock has been falling all year despite the company’s financials hitting new records virtually every quarter.
That’s partly due to a broader market downturn in 2022, but Tesla’s stock has not been tracking with the rest of the market over the last few months.
Here’s a comparison between TSLA and NASDAQ: 
The timing of the more recent drops matches Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and his selling of Tesla shares to finance the social media platform.
Some signs have also creeped in as of late indicating that Tesla’s problems are not just on the stock market.
The automaker has recently started to offer temporary discounts and perks on its vehicles – leading to the belief that Tesla is potentially facing some rare demand problems.
However, Tesla is not alone in implementing layoffs. Several other companies, including Goldman Sachs and Cisco, have announced upcoming rounds of layoffs lately in anticipation for changing macroeconomics in early 2023.
We are entering new territories right now. Until now, Tesla shareholders could still hold on to the thought that while the stock is doing poorly, Tesla’s financials and operations are still virtually unaffected.
Now it looks like there might be some worrying trends that Tesla is seeing internally leading to those moves.
My understanding was that Tesla demand in the US has been somewhat curtailed because the IRA will restore the $7500 tax incentives for Tesla's Y and 3 vehicles next year. Why buy now when a 15% discount is coming soon? But perhaps I misunderstood?
On Twitter, Musk has been talking a lot lately about macroeconomic trends and laughed at claims that his Twitter antics are the reason for Tesla’s stock price dropping. Instead, he blames mostly the fed’s rate hike.
He has also warned of an impending recession. These kinds of comments from a CEO, while not necessarily untrue, are often used to justify a bad quarter. With Tesla having to issue discounts and perks to sell cars at the end of the quarter, the company could be currently seeing some bad trends that could last into 2023. Hence the layoffs.
At least, if previous Tesla rounds of layoffs and hiring freezes are any indications, the company generally quickly goes back to growing its headcounts.
It’s inevitable with Tesla’s many manufacturing projects.

2022/12/20,"Tesla is expanding its electric vehicle business in Turkey, a market that has been asking for Tesla services for years now.
Despite the fact that Tesla is not officially in Turkey, there are many Tesla owners in the country who went to the trouble of importing the electric vehicles themselves and having them operate without access to services.
For years now, they have been asking Tesla to expand in the country with stores and service centers.
Back in May of 2018, CEO Elon Musk finally said that Tesla planned to launch in Turkey later that year. However, the plan was reportedly abandoned later in 2018 amid an escalating tariff war.
Now, four years later, Electrek learned that Tesla is finally launching in Turkey.
Ahead of a launch in a new market, Tesla generally does two things: plans the deployment of Supercharger stations and builds out a service network.
Tesla has already shared plans to build a Supercharger network in the country since 2020, and the map still shows upcoming Supercharger stations.
But now Electrek has found that Tesla has listed the first job openings in Turkey, and they are all for service employees in Istanbul.
More specifically, the jobs are going to be based in the Beşiktaş neighborhood of Istanbul – meaning that it’s likely going to be the location of Tesla’s first service center in Turkey.
Turkey is a country of 85 million people and has a significant automotive market, with over half a million passenger car sales to date in 2022.
However, the EV market is still small in the country, but Tesla developing a charging network and finally providing support to local owners should help it grow.
With the process of hiring service people now in place, I’d expect Tesla to start taking orders in Turkey in the coming months, and the first deliveries should happen in 2023.
But while those will be the first direct deliveries in the country, there are apparently already hundreds (if not thousands) of Tesla owners in Turkey.
This is also going to be good for them since they will be able to access Tesla’s service locally instead of having to rely on the infrastructure in other countries.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/12/20,"Tesla won’t tolerate any dissent against Elon Musk as it fired two employees over what it considered an “attack,” according to NLRB complaints.
Earlier this year, SpaceX fired several employees who were drafting an internal letter to let the company’s leadership know that Musk’s behavior is “a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment.”
The fired employees are fighting back in a labor complaint.
Now Tesla is finding itself in a similar situation according to new complaints filed with the National Labor Relations Board.
Bloomberg reports on the complaints:
Tesla Inc. allegedly fired two California-based employees in violation of labor laws for being part of a wider group that was discussing and drafting letters critical of Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, according to their attorneys and complaints they filed with federal regulators. 
One of the letters criticized Tesla’s return-to-work policy.
In June, Musk announced that all Tesla employees need to stop remote work and come back to the office for 40+ hours per week or they would be let go.
Tesla wasn’t even prepared for all the employees to come back to the office, and many weren’t even living near any offices at that time. Tesla ended up softening Musk’s request and made room for exceptions.
The other letter was closer to what the SpaceX employees were working on this summer prior to being fired.
It protested Musk’s tweets and claimed that they violated Tesla’s anti-harassment policy. Tesla said that it was an “attack” on the company.
One of the employees fired over the “attack” had just received a raise a month before being let go.
It looks like Tesla won’t tolerate any dissent against the great leader. 
Top notch engineers and scientists will take a lot of grief/discomfort as long as they believe in the work they are doing and the company. Everyone has a threshold, though, and if they leave a company or get laid off/fired it gets around really quickly. Tesla and SpaceX can be intolerant of criticism but they had better be fair about it or suffer an exodus.
Look, if you are drafting a letter complaining about your boss, you need to consider the risk. That comes with it. However, in this case, I understand the frustration and the feeling that you need to say something.
Also, they have a point about following Tesla’s own policies. If any other Tesla employee was tweeting some of the things Musk is tweeting, I wouldn’t surprised if they were reprimanded.
Musk’s behavior as of late has already undoubtedly negatively affected Tesla’s reputation, which is a problem. But it is also affecting employees and Tesla’s capacity to attract top talent, which is its biggest asset.
As of now, it is still topping the list of places engineers want to work, but I could see that changing if things continue the way they are going.

2022/12/19,"Tesla announced today that it has completed over 500,000 solar panel and solar roof installations to date. That’s 4 GW of solar capacity deployed.
Tesla’s solar division was created through the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016. The business has been going in a serious downward trajectory since the acquisition, but it has seen an uptick as of late.
Despite some supply issues in the solar industry earlier this year, Tesla has achieved a few record quarters in the US residential solar market. Today, Tesla announced that it has now completed over 500,000 solar installations to date:
We’ve completed 500k+ Solar Panel and Solar Roof installations—that’s equal to ~4 GW of clean energy ☀️ pic.twitter.com/Tjz6PzYuah
The company also confirmed 4 GW of solar deployed, which means that its installations have a capacity of 8 kW on average.
Lately, Tesla has also been increasingly relying on third-party installers to deploy its home energy products.
Instead of managing the installation, Tesla is gradually becoming more of a supplier, with its goal of owning the home energy ecosystem through products like the Powerwall.
This will allow Tesla to focus on manufacturing and scale, with the goal of supporting its new “Tesla Electric” electricity retailing product.
With its Powerwall and inverter, Tesla controls the brain of solar installations and energy storage systems, enabling the company to offer grid services, like its virtual power plant and, eventually, “Tesla Electric,” on a larger scale.
In line with that trend, we recently reported that Tesla has canceled solar projects in some markets and scaled back its own installation scheduling team.

2022/12/19,"Tesla Gigafactory Mexico is expected to be announced in the coming days as more details about the deal are coming to light.
Earlier this year, people crossing the border between Texas and Nuevo Leon were surprised to see not just the usual marked lanes for cars and trucks, but also one marked “Tesla” (pictured above).
We ended up finding out that Tesla had struck a deal with the state of Nuevo Leon to have its own lane at the border crossing in order to reduce wait times for cargo going through the border – or at least that was the explanation of Ivan Rivas, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon.
While it’s true that Tesla has several suppliers in the state, as we reported at the time, we suspected that the move might have more to do with Tesla potentially investing in a factory in the state.
Earlier this year, we reported on CEO Elon Musk confirming that Tesla is considering sites for a new factory in Canada, Mexico, and the United States when discussing its next plant in North America.
In October, rumors of a Tesla factory in Mexico ramped up as Tesla CEO Elon Musk visited the state and met with the governor. Local media reported that Tesla was particularly interested in a location in Santa Catarina, a municipality just outside of Monterrey. 
Following the visit, the government confirmed discussions of a possible investment in the state.
Last week, a deal to bring a Tesla factory to Mexico was reportedly achieved with an announcement expected within the next month.
Now another local report in Mexico states that the announcement could come as soon as Friday and includes more details about the project.
According to the report, Tesla plans to first invest $800 million to $1 billion into the factory outside of Monterrey, with the goal first of producing parts to supply other factories and then eventually producing full vehicles at the factory.
Over time, Tesla could invest several billion dollars into what is likely to be known as Tesla Gigafactory  Mexico.
As we previously reported, in order for Tesla to achieve its goal to ramp up its global production to 20 million vehicles annually by the end of the decade, the company needs to have 12 Gigafactories, which means it needs to announce eight new ones within the next few years.

2022/12/19,"Tesla has confirmed that Gigafactory Berlin has reached a new production rate of 3,000 electric cars per week – just after Texas reached the milestone.
During 2022, Tesla has been trying to ramp up production at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas simultaneously.
The goal was originally to produce 5,000 vehicles per week at each facility by the end of the year.
It was always ambitious amid the global supply chain crisis.
Last week, Tesla announced that Gigafactory Texas reached 3,000 vehicles in a week.
This weekend, Tesla announced that Gigafactory Berlin has also achieved the same milestone of 3,000 vehicles per week:
Congrats to the Giga Berlin team on building 3k Model Y this week! pic.twitter.com/uUTOTRrasX
If maintained, a production rate of 3,000 vehicles per week would result in an annual rate of 150,000 vehicles.
Tesla Gigafactory Berlin is currently only producing the Model Y. Once it reached a production capacity of 5,000 vehicles per week, the automaker is expected to start adding new models to the factory’s production schedule.
It looks like the goal of 5,000 vehicles per week will not be achievable by the end of the year, but 3,000 is not bad considering the circumstances.
I would expect Tesla to reach its original within the next few months.
That should make things interesting since Tesla should move on to integrating the production of other models at those two plants. The plan was to add Model 3 production – if that’s still the case, I’d expect it will be the expected new version of the Model 3.
It will be interesting to see how things play out because Tesla hasn’t elaborated much on the plans for the factory beyond Model Y.
Tesla is also expected to start battery production at the factory in 2023.

2022/12/19,"Elon Musk has put his role as head of Twitter up to a vote, and the people have spoken: He should step down as the leader of the social media platform he owns. 
It comes after pressure from Tesla investors, who feel abandoned.
As we reported over the last few weeks, Tesla investors have become more vocal about their dissatisfaction with their CEO, Elon Musk, spending a lot of time on Twitter and selling Tesla shares to support the company.
On top of it, many see him becoming more political through his own use and leadership of Twitter and believe that the trend is affecting Tesla as many car buyers have difficulties separating Tesla and Musk.
Tesla investors have been calling for Musk to step down from the role of CEO at Twitter and refocus on Tesla, but Musk has mostly ignored their pleas.
It reached a level where investors were starting to now call for Musk to step down from his role as CEO of Tesla instead.
Leo KoGuan, the third largest Tesla investor, told Electrek last week:
The point of no return, Elon has moved on permanently I think from Elon the engineer par-excellent to Elon the supreme political king-maker. Based on this assumption, only based on this assumption, Elon should find his own successor approved by independent BOD members. Of course, BOD should set up an independent search committee to find a new CEO.
Following a few more mistakes over the last few days, like suspending journalists and banning sharing links to other social media, both moves that were later at least partly reverted, Musk’s own leadership of Twitter has come into question as well.
Stuck between the two, Musk took to Twitter yesterday with a poll to ask whether he should remain the head of Twitter:
Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.
The CEO says that he will abide by the result of the poll – something he has done in the past over other matters.
Over 17 million people voted and a somewhat strong majority (57%) voted in favor of him stepping down. That’s impressive considering Musk has a block list preventing people he dislikes from seeing or voting in this poll and the poll went out to his own followers.
Musk doesn’t appear to have a clear successor to lead Twitter – though he tweeted with Lex Fridman, an AI engineer and podcaster, about potentially taking over.
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 5% in pre-market trading following news of the poll.
Well … pic.twitter.com/FGquRsfD8l
Let’s see what he means by “stepping down” here. He still owns the company and it is private. As far as we know, there’s no board in place yet nor a clear structure to find a replacement.
Therefore, I don’t think finding someone else to lead the day-to-day will resolve all the issues for Tesla shareholders, but it would certainly free up more time for the CEO to spend on the company.
However, the loss in credibility that he suffered through those Twitter antics is likely to have a lasting impact on both Tesla and Twitter.
Frederic, I do not think he ""abided by"" past polls. I think they were always, so far, fait-accompli's. Until this one, he has simply taken on fairly safe bets by making a poll which a pretty safe outcome, so as not to be accountable for his decision.

This time, that might even be the case too. ie he may have decided to leave. Or he's too torn and wants some random, non-representative and weakly-informed crowd to make a decision for him.

But in the past, they have been PR stunts, not plebiscites.
As for the latter, if Musk truly wants it to be a platform for free speech that serves the center rather than the extremes of both political sides, Twitter is probably better off with someone more apolitical than himself.
Fridman could potentially be a good option in my opinion. He does seem less political and more level-headed than Musk.
Either way, I hope that this means I can soon stop reporting on this Twitter nonsense and focus on more fun stuff again.

2022/12/17,"Today, we are featuring one of, if not the most insane, Tesla house projects. It features virtually all of Tesla’s home energy products.
Lately, Tesla has been increasingly relying on third-party installers to deploy its home energy products.
Instead of managing the installation, Tesla is gradually becoming more of a supplier with its goal of owning the home energy ecosystem through products like the Powerwall. 
This is going to allow Tesla to focus on manufacturing and scale with the goal of supporting its new ‘Tesla Electric‘ electricity retailing product.
One of those third-party installers is Good Faith Energy based in Texas. They have been doing some of the most impressive Tesla Solar Roof installations we have seen.
We reported on them last year after they showed how one of their Tesla Solar Roof installations fared against a hailstorm with baseball-size hailstones.
Now we are featuring one of their latest projects in Katy, Texas where they helped builder William David Homes build the ultimate Tesla house.
Good Faith Energy installed an impressive 11,000 sq-ft Tesla Solar Roof with a capacity of 30 kW. 
As you can see, it’s a big house, but not the entire roof needs to be equipped with solar tiles producing electricity. 
Tesla supplies both solar and non-solar tiles for its solar roof installations, and the solar tiles are installed to optimize the house’s electricity production based on orientation and shade.
Here’s the particular solar tile configuration for this project:
Each Tesla solar tile is about 45in by 14in and is rated at 72w. They give more flexibility than the usual solar panel. Jim Abercrombie, Director of Roofing Operations at Good Faith Energy, says that five tiles, which adds up to 360w, cover about the same square footage of most 360w solar panels.
But to be the ultimate Tesla house, you can’t only have a Tesla Solar Roof.
This project has virtually all of Tesla’s energy products, and a lot of them.
It is also equipped with 5 Tesla Powerwalls – providing up to 67.5 kWh of backup power.
The house is also equipped with 3 of Tesla’s 7.6 kW solar inverters – the company’s most recent solar product looking to compete with industry leaders, like Enphase and Solar Edge.
The Tesla solar tiles also give the house a very unique look:
Now as for what everyone wants to know about: the price.
It has become harder to get pricing on Tesla’s Solar Roof. The company doesn’t provide online estimates anymore. Pricing varies greatly depending on roof complexity.
I asked Good Faith Energy about it and Mohammed Abdalla, CEO of Good Faith Energy, said:
“The price of the Tesla Solar Roof varies quite dramatically based on a variety of factors including: Size of the roof, complexity of the roof, amount of PV or producing tiles, and the number of batteries. A roof with 4 planes can come in much lower in price than a similar sized house that is covered with ridges, valleys, turrets, and odd and complex shapes. In 2022, on average, our Tesla Solar Roof pricing came in between $35-$50/sqft, before the federal solar tax credit (assuming you qualify). This is about the cost of a luxury roof like slate or tile, plus the cost of a solar system added in. It isn’t just a roof, and it isn’t just a solar system. It is the only roof that looks this good, and can cover your electricity bill forever.”
Based on the $35-$50/sqft estimate and the 11,000 sqft of this project, we can estimate between $385,000 and $550,000.
What about a tight building envelope? Maxi-insulation? Heat pump HVAC and water heater?  One of the ways to limit the cost and complexity of the roof solar plant is to reduce the need for electricity in the first place.  Without addressing the whole house, this is like putting a Bugatti W-12 engine in a farm truck - waste of money.
That sounds like a lot, but again, it needs to be compared with other luxury roof options, like slates and tiles, and the cost of an equivalent 30 kW solar power system. This can’t be compared to a roof made of asphalt shingles.
We are also talking about multi-million dollar new build here.

2022/12/16,"Pepsi, the first customer to use Tesla Semi, has commented on the deployment of the electric truck in its fleet and made some strange remarks about its range.
When Tesla started deliveries of the Tesla Semi earlier this month, its first customer to take delivery was PepsiCo.
Now the company is commenting on the integration of the electric truck in its fleet for the first time in a Reuters article based on an interview with PepsiCo Vice President Mike O’Connell, but the article glosses over some very strange comments about the Tesla Semi’s range.
O’Connell confirmed that PepsiCo is currently deploying 36 Tesla Semis: 15 in Modesto and 21 in Sacramento. The company expects to take delivery of the 100 Tesla Semi trucks it ordered by the end of 2023.
Where things got strange is when O’Connell, according to the article, talked about the range of the Tesla Semi:
PepsiCo’s new Semis can haul Frito-Lay food products for around 425 miles (684 km), but for heavier loads of sodas, the trucks will do shorter trips of around 100 miles (160 km), O’Connell said.
O’Connell reportedly stated that the company’s Tesla Semi trucks still have 20% charge after carrying loads of chips over 425 miles.
But it’s unclear why the trucks only do 100-mile trips with loads of sodas.
Tesla has clearly stated that the Tesla Semi can achieve a range of over 500 miles with a full load at 82,000 lbs.
We reported that, unfortunately, Tesla hasn’t released the weight of the truck, and therefore, we don’t know the actual load capacity of the Tesla Semi, but we know that it can travel 500 miles at full capacity.
It’s true that a trailer filled with chips is going to be lighter than a trailer filled with sodas, but at the end of the day, they are both limited to 82,000 lbs in an electric truck as per regulations. Therefore, Tesla Semi should be able to travel 500 miles with a trailer of sodas at capacity.
As I stated in my article about the Tesla Semi’s battery pack and the missing information from Tesla’s presentation, we really need Tesla to confirm the weight of the truck to know the actual load capacity.
Pepsi has many more bottling facilities than FritoLay production facilities in California. If they are using the Tesla Semis for intra-company product distribution, soda doesn't need to travel more than 100 miles. Frito-Lay products need to cover more mileage between facilities. This is just my speculation, I haven't worked for Pepsi in over 20 years but this is a reasonable explanation that comes to mind.
I estimate the weight of the Tesla Semi to be about 27,000 lbs, which is certainly higher than most diesel semi trucks and would result in a lower load capacity.
But based on the information Tesla released, the truck can still travel 500 miles at 82,000 lbs total weight (truck, trailer, and load) regardless of the actual load capacity. That’s why it’s so strange that PepsiCo says it is limiting trips with sodas to 100 miles.
I don’t know if it’s based on a lack of knowledge or if there was some sort of miscommunication in the interview.

2022/12/16,"A company called Space Campers has launched a $24,000 bed-embedded camper for the Tesla Cybertruck. It’s one of now several companies already developing accessories for the electric pickup truck even though it’s not even on the market yet.
Tesla Cybertruck is not even in production yet, but several companies have been trying to develop accessories for it – especially in the camping space.
Due to its specs and utility, many think that it is going to be an interesting electric vehicle to turn into a camper.
We previously reported on Cyberlandr, a startup delivering a full camper to be deployed out of the Cybertruck. The project is extremely ambitious as it includes fitting a toilet, bed, and kitchen into the bed of the electric pickup truck.
The project is super ambitious by itself, but even more so when you consider the fact that they are developing it without access to the Cybertruck or even the final specs of the vehicle.
Now a project in the same vein has launched: Space Campers, a wedge-style camper for the Tesla Cybertruck.
The company released a video about the product today:
The project is similar to the Cyberlandr – albeit a little less ambitious with the use of more traditional designs and technologies already used for wedge-style campers.
With those simpler designs, it also comes in at about half the price of the Cyberlandr, but it’s still not exactly cheap starting at $24,000.
Here are the listed features for the standard version:
It’s important to note that some of these features, especially those that relate to using the Cybertruck’s system to power the camper, are aspirational since they are operating without actually knowing the truck’s final design.
With that said, it looks like a pretty cool project.
They are planning for a design that would allow Cybertruck owners to mount and remove the camper from the bed quickly:
There are also many different configurations for the bed where you can sleep in the extended tent, inside the bed, or even in a “star-gazing mode.”
The bed is 50″ by 6′ 0″:
They developed nothing except a render.
Space Campers is also planning a ton of different add-ons to the camper, including a kitchen, a deployable shower, and more.
Here’s a quick look at the kitchen accessory:
At this point, with so many camper projects for the Cybertruck even before it’s in production, it looks likely that at least one of them will be available one day.
Although I wouldn’t be surprised if they end up having to tone down some of their more ambitious features once they can work off of the actual electric pickup truck next year.

2022/12/15,"Tesla has authorized its sales staff to offer 10,000 free Supercharging miles to customers who take delivery by the end of the month as it tries to create some urgency for buyers to take delivery.
As we have recently reported, Tesla is having some rare demand issues lately – especially in the United States due to special circumstances.
It has been years since Tesla hit 200,000 deliveries in the United States, which meant the company no longer qualified for the US federal tax credit for electric vehicles. But Tesla buyers are expected to regain access to the incentive, which is valued at up to $7,500, soon.
The catch is, they need to take delivery of their vehicles on or after January 1 to qualify.
This situation is incentivizing buyers to wait until after the new year to purchase a Tesla vehicle in the United States. We reported last month that it also contributed to an increase in cancellations as Tesla is not allowing buyers to delay orders to get them next month.
Earlier this month, we learned that Tesla started offering a $3,750 discount to buyers in the United States in order to combat this issue.
Now we learn that Tesla is throwing another incentive into the mix to encourage buyers to take delivery this month.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla authorized sales staff to offer 10,000 free Supercharging miles (or km) to buyers taking delivery this month.
Here are the details of the incentive:
Tesla used to often offer free Supercharging miles as an incentive, and we learned that it plans to bring this approach back as part of its new Loyalty Program.
However, 10,000 miles is a better offer than usual. The incentive is worth about $500, depending on your vehicle and market since efficiency varies per vehicle and Supercharger prices vary per market.
Interestingly, the incentive is not only for the US market as buyers confirmed to Electrek that Tesla has made the offer in the UK also.
This is another piece of evidence that Tesla is currently having some demand issues.
Do we know that the Teslas will be eligible for the full $7500 subsidy as of Jan 1?  Or would they only qualify for half of it?  

I would also point that supply of all EVs has gotten much better in the last few weeks - with sizeable inventories of Tesla and VW building up.  
In the United States, the main reason is fairly clear: the impending updated federal tax credit. In this case, demand should revert to it’s prior strength next month once the credit is in place.
However, we can’t be blind to Tesla potentially facing other issues. First of all, its production capacity has increased significantly over the last few months, and there’s a possibility that demand hasn’t followed.
The other main concern that is harder to track is that people’s opinion of Tesla has been affected by Elon Musk’s Twitter antics. Is it affecting Tesla to the point that the automaker is having to come up with new incentives to create demand? It’s a real possibility.
However, in the United States, I think the tax credit is having a bigger impact right now.

2022/12/15,"Tesla has launched “Tesla Electric” to become an electricity retailer through its Powerwall owners – starting with some markets in Texas.
After gaining experience through its virtual power plants (VPPs), Tesla is taking things a step further with the launch of “Tesla Electric.”
Instead of reacting to specific “events” and providing services to your local electric utilities, like Tesla Powerwall owners have done in VPPs in California, Tesla Electric is actively and automatically buying and selling electricity for Tesla Powerwall owners – providing a buffer against peak prices. 
It’s a special electric plan for Powerwall owners. Tesla writes about its new product on its website:
Solar and Powerwall can help you and your community accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. With Tesla Electric, your Powerwall automatically decides when to charge and when to sell electricity to the grid. Together with other Tesla Electric members, you can maximize the value of your solar energy while using your Powerwall storage to add more renewable electricity to the grid. You can also achieve your own sustainability goals when importing electricity from the grid, as Tesla Electric offsets your usage with energy from 100 percent renewable sources.
The company notes that Tesla Electric’s retail plan is currently only available by invitation to select customers in Texas.
Tesla has been working on this new product for a while now, and it is a big step toward the company’s goal to become a “global distributed clean electric utility,” and it is starting in Texas, a place that badly needs an electric utility revolution.
In May, we reported on Tesla lobbying for any homeowner with solar and batteries to participate in Texas’s energy market.
The company was asking for a rule change with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an organization operating Texas’s electrical grid, that would enable electric utilities with customers with behind-the-meter solar and batteries, meaning people with residential solar, to bid on the extra capacity.
Earlier this week, we reported that Tesla received approval from ERCOT for “a statewide market design pilot for small distributed energy resources to provide grid service exports.”
It looks like the company was already ready to launch its new product.
I live in the Houston area and signed up just 1 hour ago. I have 2 Powerwalls and 24 panels (with another Powerwall and 12 panels coming in January). It was a seamless signup process, with the only disappointment being the requirement of paying via a checking account. No credit cards accepted (I get 2% cash back on mine). They give 90% of the retail price back from any excess energy I produce. Also their rates include TDU delivery charges which makes the 14 cents per kWh they charge much cheaper than the 22 cents (6.7 cents plus TDU) I currently pay.
This looks closer to what Musk described when he said he wanted Tesla Energy to become “a distributed global utility and could outgrow automotive business.”
It is starting with Texas, but I assume that Tesla is going to want to expand this product everywhere it also sells Powerwalls.
I think it is going to be a difficult regulatory market to navigate, but it adds enough value that it should be adopted. It will require a lot of work, though.
Hopefully, this deployment in Texas will be successful and Tesla, or Tesla Electric now, can use it as an example for new markets.

2022/12/15,"Tesla has reportedly acquired land in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, and it is on the verge of announcing a plan to build a factory on it.
Earlier this year, people crossing the border between Texas and Nuevo Leon were surprised to see not just the usual marked lanes for cars and trucks, but also one marked “Tesla” (pictured above).
We ended up finding out that Tesla had struck a deal with the state of Nuevo Leon to have its own lane at the border crossing in order to reduce wait times for cargo going through the border – or at least that was the explanation of Ivan Rivas, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon.
While it’s true that Tesla has several suppliers in the state, as we reported at the time, we suspected that the move might have more to do with Tesla potentially investing in a factory in the state.
Earlier this year, we reported on CEO Elon Musk confirming that Tesla is considering sites for a new factory in Canada, Mexico, and the United States when discussing its next plant in North America.
In October, rumors of a Tesla factory in Mexico ramped up as Tesla CEO Elon Musk visited the state and met with the governor. Local media reported that Tesla was particularly interested in a location in Santa Catarina, a municipality just outside of Monterrey. 
Following the visit, the government confirmed discussions of a possible investment in the state.
Given the proximity to Austin (360 miles) I would presume it would be a factory for components, to supply Giga Texas?  Otherwise, I find it difficult to justify putting another full car factory so close.    
Now rumors of Tesla investing in a manufacturing facility in Nuevo Leon are reaching a whole new level as local media Milenio claims Tesla and the state have reached a deal that will be announced in early 2023.
The source said (translated from Spanish):
Tesla will come to Santa Catarina. The investment will be finalized in the coming weeks; after the end of the year it will be announced. The commitment is that it must be completed immediately after the start of 2023. We know that it will generate employment and it will be located in the only area available, which is the west of that municipality. It is not possible to inform more, because there is a confidentiality contract.
According to the same report, Tesla has already acquired the land in Santa Catarina for the factory.
However, what type of factory Tesla plans to build in Mexico is still unknown. Tesla is best known for its Gigafactories, which builds electric vehicles and other products at an epic scale, but the automaker has lately also announced plans for factories producing battery cells and battery materials.

2022/12/14,"Elon Musk has sold another tranche of Tesla shares, this time worth $3.6 billion, amid ongoing chaos related to his Twitter takeover. The sale was announced in a Form 4 filing with the SEC on Wednesday night.
The sale represents almost 22 million shares of TSLA sold over the course of the last three trading days, at share prices between $156–$176. TSLA stock has fallen about 20 points in that time period, losing more than 10% of its value.
This drop has resulted in Musk losing his title as world’s richest man, a title he had first obtained in early 2021. He was supplanted by Bernard Arnault, the CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.
Yesterday Musk took to Twitter to reassure Tesla shareholders that they would “benefit long term” from his Twitter ownership. We now know that, at the time, he was currently in the process of offloading tens of millions of shares.
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
This is not the first time Musk has sold TSLA shares since he first announced his bid to take over Twitter. The first was last December after running a Twitter poll about whether he should purchase the company or not, after which he claimed to have sold roughly enough of his stake in Tesla to fund the purchase.
But that’s not the only time he said he was done selling Tesla stock related to the Twitter acquisition. In August, we reported on him selling $6.9 billion in stock, after which he explicitly said “yes” when asked if he was “done selling.”
Musk then went on to sell another $3.9 billion in stock this November, after both of these pronouncements. He told Twitter employees in an all-hands meeting that this was necessary to “save” the site.
Today’s sale is Musk’s fourth major sale of Tesla stock related to the acquisition, now totaling at least $16 billion worth. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, though he did gain additional funding in the form of loans from outside sources. Those loans have a total interest bill of about $1 billion yearly – a significant cost for a company that had heretofore lost on the order of $200 million per quarter, while it was publicly run.
While we don’t know about Twitter’s current financial situation as it is now private, available external signs point to trouble. There has been a drastic dropoff in advertising revenue, with advertisers pulling ads from the platform, and desktop visits to their ad manager software dropping by up to 85%.
Between additional costs for Twitter and dropping revenue, Musk seems to have seen the necessity of freeing up more funding for his new company. While Twitter’s new paid verification option may make up some of that revenue, it is unlikely to make a huge difference compared to the additional debt and loss of revenue that Twitter is currently facing.
In the past, Musk had repeatedly stated that he would be the last person to sell Tesla stock.
Yesterday’s message that Tesla shareholders would “benefit long term” from Musk’s Twitter ownership led us to wonder: but how? In hindsight, it perhaps had something to do with preparing shareholders for today’s large stock sale announcement.
I always thought if Elon left the company it would be a disaster for the stock. At this point I'm convinced the stock would improve if a new ceo was appointed. A smart ceo doesn't divide his consumers through constant political opinions. 
In the Electrek’s Take section for that article (which I encourage you all to read), Fred mentioned the echo chamber that Musk has created around himself, and that even the superfans allowed into that echo chamber are currently questioning whether Musk is fit to lead Tesla.
He certainly seems distracted, spending so much of his time on Twitter issues, and very little on Tesla issues. And now, more Tesla stock is being sold to “throw into the Twitter dumpster fire,” as Fred so succinctly wrote. This puts downward pressure on Tesla stock, which makes it difficult to believe that the Twitter takeover is helping TSLA shareholders or Tesla’s mission as a whole.
We here at Electrek are obviously interested in the electric vehicle revolution, as it is one of the most significant ways that we can decarbonize society. As such, we support Tesla’s mission and think that the leading company in automotive electrification should have competent leadership paying attention to the needs of the company.
It is clear that this distraction is harming the company’s perception in the public eye, and we would like to see less distraction from Tesla leadership.

2022/12/14,"Tesla drops the price on its already cheap home charging station for electric vehicles as it tries to make its connector the new standard for North America.
Last month, Tesla surprised many by announcing that it is opening its EV charge connector with the aim of making it the new standard in North America.
The automaker is challenging the J1772/CCS combo connector, which has been adopted by virtually all other automakers selling vehicles in North America, in the hope that its sleeker and more powerful design will win by force of sheer numbers.
Tesla dominates the EV market in America to such a degree that even though all other automakers currently selling EVs on the market are using the J1772/CCS connector, there are still more EVs in North America using the Tesla connector, now known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
Following the opening of the connector, Tesla has been making some moves to push its charging station – also known as Tesla Wall Connector.
For example, Tesla started selling its Wall Connector at Best Buy last month instead of only through its own website.
The Tesla Wall Connector was already cheap for a 48 amp, level 2 home charging station at $400, but today Tesla dropped the price to $350 on its website and Best Buy.
At $350, it makes it the cheapest option for a quality 48 amp charger with wifi connectivity.
I hope they succeed in making the connecter a North American standard. 

I have the wall connector installed in the garage for my Model 3.  It will make it easier to transition to my next car if that car is not a Tesla but can use the same connector. 
For comparison, JuiceBox’s 40-amp charger is $700:
It’s not clear if the $350 price is temporary because the price has also gone down on Best Buy, but it says that it is with a $50 discount that ends in six hours from the time of publishing.
Tesla is also selling its Wall Connector with a J1772 connector, but the price has stayed the same at $550.
The charging station with the J1772 connector is believed to be more expensive due to licensing fees for that type of connector.

2022/12/14,"Tesla is launching a new wildly overpriced solid-state hard drive to hold video games and Sentry Mode videos.
When we talk about storage inside vehicles, we generally talk about trunk space, but in this case, we are talking about digital storage space.
Why would you need digital storage inside cars?
The need for more storage has increased for Tesla vehicles after the release of features like Sentry Mode and TeslaCam. These features record videos from Tesla’s Autopilot cameras for security purposes, and they are stored on a drive plugged into Tesla’s onboard computer.
Tesla owners have been using USB drivers and SSDs for that reason for years now.
Now the need for storage is increasing in Tesla vehicles with the advent of video games inside the cars.
More specifically, Tesla just launched Steam in Model S and Model X vehicles, which are equipped with a gaming computer. Owners are going to need more storage space to install video games, which can reach 100 Gb in size.
Today, Tesla has launched a new Tesla-branded solid-state drive for its vehicles on its online shop:
The automaker wrote about the product on its website:
Store everything. From Tesla Arcade games to Dashcam footage, our 1 TB Solid State Drive (SSD) allows you to save all your vehicle data in one place. This automotive-grade external SSD is designed for durability withstanding extreme cabin temperatures, vehicle shocks and vibrations. With an extended lifespan compared to similar storage devices and read/write speeds optimized for gaming, the Solid State Drive supports Steam gaming.
Actually, the ""cheap drive"" linked here is only rated to operate in conditions up to 45C (113F). I don't know about you, but in summer time when my car is parked I've often seen 115 to 120F cabin temps. That would actually be out of specs for that $100 SSD... could it still work? Maybe. Would I rather have a higher rated drive for Sentry mode videos, yes. 

That cheap drive also doesn't have a warranty even though it says 5 years, if you read the fine print, the warranty doesn't cover continuous video recording.

""This warranty does not cover use of the Product in connection with the following uses or devices (as determined by SanDisk): (i) normal wear and tear, (ii) video monitoring, security, and surveillance devices, (iii) internet protocol/network cameras, (iv) in-car recording devices/dashboard cameras/black box cameras, (v) display devices that loop video, (vi) continuous recording set top box devices, (vii) continuous data logging devices like servers, or (viii) other excessive uses that exceed normal use in accordance with published instructions.""

That likely suggests that it's not an especially high endurance drive.

Again, the Tesla drive could be exactly the same and nothing special, but it COULD be a higher quality drive designed for more write cycles than these cheap drives...
Steam is currently only available on new Model S and ModelX vehicles, but Tesla says that the SSD is compatible with all Tesla vehicles – just like most SSDs.
Speaking of other solid-state drives, they are ridiculously cheap compared to Tesla’s.
Tesla is asking for $350 for a 1 TB drive seemingly without anything special about it other than maybe fitting nicely in Tesla’s glovebox. A good portable 1 TB SSD drive generally costs about $100.
The automaker has a history of charging for overpriced Tesla-branded products, like its $50 whistle.

2022/12/14,"The little data that is coming out of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta looks awful, and that’s putting it mildly. 
We challenge Elon Musk to prove otherwise by releasing disengagement and driver intervention data.
To be clear, the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta data in this article is very minimal, and therefore, it could not be fully representative of the actual capacity.
But that’s the point of the article. It’s unfortunately the best data available because Tesla has gone out of its way to not release disengagement data that other companies developing self-driving systems are making available.
A disengagement consists of the system disengaging whether by itself or by the driver in order to either avoid danger or comply with the rules of the road. Miles between disengagement have been useful data to track the progress of self-driving programs.
It’s not a perfect metric to track progress, but it’s one of the only ones we have right now and we should see improvements in it over time with more miles between disengagement or driver intervention.
While Tesla doesn’t release the data, a group of Tesla FSD Beta testers has been self-reporting data for a while now, and Taylor Ogan of Snow Bull Capital has tracked it to see the progress.
According to the data, miles driven per disengagement have gone down by 54% since March, and it currently sits around the same level it was around this time last year: 
Let's again use the only known crowd-sourced Tesla FSD beta data.The overall miles per disengagement rate on FSD beta is actually getting *worse*, down -54% Y/Y. pic.twitter.com/7cCUEHnjvg
Based on this again limited set of data, Tesla FSD Beta can only drive a few miles between disengagement, while other self-driving programs, like Waymo and Cruise, are reporting tens of thousands of miles between disengagement on average.
These results are disappointing, as they point to very little to no progress in the FSD Beta program over the last year – at least based on this metric. 
A few miles between disengagement has been my experience with Tesla FSD Beta in my own car.
Now that’s based on 72,000 miles of self-reported data compared to over 60 million miles driven on FSD Beta to date.
Therefore, I am completely open to the idea that the bigger dataset shows different results, but there’s no way to know unless Tesla releases that data. It’s not clear why the company is not doing it.
To be clear, I am not asking Tesla to release any sensitive information about the program here, but only data that all other companies developing self-driving programs have willingly shared for years now.
The data has been used to help gain confidence in these systems – some of which are already deployed commercially in California and Arizona.
Instead, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly told people to “try FSD Beta for themselves” in order to gauge its progress. As if anecdotal evidence would be better at tracking progress than hard data on miles per disengagement.
Wow. People are getting 3 miles before disengagement? That is way better than what I am seeing. Before the beta I could use autopilot in town and get 10-20 miles before I had to correct it. With the beta that is more like 500 ft. It makes terrible decisions on a regular basis.

The latest is rather amusing (or frightening). Was on a two-lane city road with a low median between the lanes. The beta decided the median was a lane and put on the signal and said that it was changing lanes to get out of the slow lane. This was right after re-engaging the beta because it failed to make a left turn properly (it was bad).
At this point, it’s hard not to be suspicious about the possibility that the reason why Tesla is not releasing the data is that it looks bad for them – especially compared to Waymo and Cruise.
But how else are we going to be able to gain confidence in the system if we can’t see any tangible data pointing to improvements?
This is not coming from a hater or a TSLA short. This is coming from someone who paid good money for Tesla Full Self-Driving Capability package and who is losing faith in the company delivering on its promise.
So, Elon Musk, please release Tesla FSD Beta data and show a path toward delivering on your promises. Otherwise, we have to rely on this data to track progress, and it doesn’t look good.

2022/12/13,"Elon Musk said that he “will make sure Tesla (TSLA) shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term” after they just lost billions of dollars.
But how is the question?
As we reported earlier this month, Tesla is having its best year ever by almost every financial metric other than its stock price, which is now at a two-year low.
The market is also down during the same period, but Tesla is undoubtedly being affected more heavily by other factors than just the broader downturn in the stock market.
For example, the market was up significantly over the last two days, and yet, Tesla’s stock plunged 10% as CEO Elon Musk made comments on Twitter that offended parts of the population.
Many analysts are linking Tesla’s drop to Musk’s acquisition of Twitter – both due to his financing of the acquisition by selling Tesla stocks and through his use of the platform since the acquisition.
In fact, Tesla is down a stunning 60% since Musk started selling TSLA stocks to acquire Twitter:
Over the last few weeks, many long-time supporters of Musk have started to change their tune and express concerns about the direction Tesla’s CEO is heading.
We reported on Leo KoGuan, a billionaire who is the third-largest Tesla shareholder, having some harsh words about Musk.
Gary Black, another big Tesla investor and long-time Musk supporter, said this yesterday:
My 2 cents: The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.
Despite many supporters voicing similar concerns, Musk doesn’t address them and instead decides to respond to this comment today:
I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term
The CEO didn’t elaborate on how he plans to make that happen.
Considering Tesla lost over $500 billion in value since he moved assets from Tesla to Twitter, it would be quite an achievement to turn that around.
Alright, this might turn into a rant, but I will go for it anyway. 
Over the last few years, I feel like Musk turned his own use of Twitter into a sort of echo chamber where he encourages his loyalists to praise him constantly and where he sees people who criticize him as “attacking” him with ulterior motives, often political.
To be fair, that’s sometimes the case, but he let it get to him to a degree that fair criticism has no or very little place in his Twitterverse.
This is a far cry from his use of the platform from years ago where he would actually use it for feedback about Tesla and to promote climate initiatives.
We have a great example here where he hasn’t addressed any of the many Tesla shareholders, most of whom are long-time supporters of his, expressing serious concern about his approach to Twitter and how it is affecting Tesla.
Instead, he decides to respond to Omar Qazi (Wholeblogmars), who is unarguably his biggest sycophant, framing the situation in a positive light. 
He says that it is an “unpopular opinion,” and that’s clearly because it is wrong. We just reported yesterday that surveys show the favorable opinion of Tesla has gone down since Musk acquired Twitter, and by any metric possible, including the obvious one being the stock price, the acquisition of Twitter hasn’t “elevated Tesla’s brand reach or marketing” one bit. On the contrary.
I have defended Musk and Tesla since the beginning. I love my Model 3 and have a couple shares in the company. However its quite clear that Elon has lost his way. I am not saying I am selling my stock or my car, but Elon needs to focus or Tesla needs to move on.

This has always been about the mission for me. If Elon no longer supports the mission then I no longer support him. Simple as that.
And it’s not clear either how that will change as Musk claims.
 It has gone so far now that every day I see a new Musk superfan suggesting that Tesla’s board should consider a new CEO. I am talking about people you couldn’t imagine saying anything like that just a few months ago.
I am having a hard time seeing how Musk turns things around here. I know people will get tired of the whole Twitter situation soon enough and things should die down, but the loss of credibility he has suffered so far is going to last a while.
I don’t think it will outweigh the tremendous impact he had on the electric revolution, clean energy, and space exploration, but his handling of the situation will be a stain on his record that will last a long time in my opinion.

2022/12/13,"Tesla has launched Steam integration inside its Model S and Model X electric cars with thousands of games now playable.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been investing heavily into integrating video games into its in-car entertainment system, but it still surprised many when Tesla said earlier this year that it planned to go as far as integrating Valve’s Steam, an online video game store and distribution platform, in its vehicles.
Steam offers a massive library of video games, and integrating it into Tesla’s EVs would result in a massive increase in games playable inside Tesla vehicles.
In July, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla should release a demo of the Steam integration by August. It didn’t come, but Musk reiterated the plan to integrate the video game library in Tesla vehicles.
Today, Tesla launched Steam Beta for Model S and Model X as part of its “holiday update”: 
We reported all the details of Tesla’s holiday update earlier today for most Tesla vehicles, but the Steam integration is only for the refreshed Model S and Model X produced over the last two years.
That’s because Tesla’s two flagship vehicles are equipped with a more powerful entertainment computer designed for video games.
With the unveiling of the new Model S and Model X, Tesla announced the new gaming computer:
Up to 10 teraflops of processing power enables in-car gaming on-par with today’s newest consoles via Tesla Arcade. Wireless controller compatibility allows gaming from any seat.
A known chip leaker, Patrick Schur, posted a diagram of Tesla’s new gaming computer powered by the AMD Navi 23 GPU:
The system is integrated and connects directly to two touchscreens inside the Model S and Model X to play games, watch entertainment, and perform other functions.
Apparently, this only works on ‘22 refresh S/X. All refresh S/X were marketed to have PS-5 console level gaming ability with images of The Witcher III on the center display. I look forward to hearing Tesla explain how they plan to fulfill that commitment to early refresh S/X buyers. 
Musk also revealed that the new computer has more storage space to be able to handle more games on the platform at the same time, which is going to be useful to handle your Steam library.
The website videocardz compared the specs with existing consoles from the latest generation – showing that it does indeed match up well based on the specs available:
As we previously reported, Tesla has a team of software engineers working on video games in Seattle, and it more recently started building a similar team in Austin. 
The automaker believes that with the advent of self-driving, entertainment – including video games – will become more important inside vehicles.

2022/12/13,"Tesla has released a video of the Tesla Semi electric truck getting tested for reliability and durability just as customer deliveries are starting.
At the Tesla Semi Delivery Event last month, the company unveiled the production version of its electric class 8 truck.
For the most part, Tesla delivered on the promises it made five years ago when it first unveiled the vehicle program, but there were also pieces of information that the company didn’t reveal.
Mainly, Tesla didn’t reveal the weight of the truck or its price – two very important pieces of information for trucking companies looking to invest in the electric vehicle.
The other unknown is how durable the Tesla Semi will be, and that’s a big deal in the trucking industry since the trucks are amortized over their entire life. 
Tesla did highlight the fact that a lot of the systems within the electric truck – including the electric motors, which are the same as the ones in Tesla’s Model S and Model X Plaid – have already been tested through millions of miles in other vehicle programs.
But it’s unclear how long and over how many miles the Tesla Semi will last.
Today, Tesla decided to share a new video of its Tesla Semi being tested for reliability and durability on LinkedIn:
The automaker wrote about the video:
Our engineers tested Semi in a variety of harsh conditions to maximize reliability and durability. 
Some of the footage appears to be a few years old from when Tesla tested the original Tesla Semi prototype in Alaska.
But the rest of the footage appears to feature the latest generation of the electric truck.
Tesla is now delivering the truck to customers but only to a handful of long-time reservation holders close to the company. The warranty details haven’t leaked, nor do we have data on longevity.
There are reasons to be hopeful, though, with some Tesla vehicles having extremely impressive longevity already. For example, I used to own a Model X with over 400,000 miles on the odometer.

2022/12/13,"Tesla has started to push a new software update that is known as its “holiday update” with Apple Music, Mahjong, and more features.
Every year around the holidays, Tesla is known to push a bigger software update with some features that are generally more about fun than being functional.
Tesla regularly pushes new features to its fleet through software updates whenever they are ready, but it sometimes bundles them together for a bigger step change update, which people have been referring to as the “holiday update.”
Today, Tesla has started pushing the update (2022.44.25) to customers, and we get to see the release notes for the first time.
It’s undoubtedly not Tesla’s biggest holiday update. Last year, for example, Tesla owners got a massive update with many UI changes and a bunch of new video games integrated into the vehicles.
This year, the biggest new feature is an Apple Music app being integrated inside its vehicles – joining other music streaming apps already in the cars, like Spotify and Tidal.
We already knew that Apple Music was coming, but now it’s officially here.
Tesla wrote in the release notes:
Stream over 100 million songs and 30,000 playlists ad-free. Listen to your entire library, discover new music, and tune into live radio stations. To access Apple Music, tap the Apple Music icon in the Application launcher, scan the QR code with your mobile device, and login with your Apple ID.
Note: A Premium Connectivity subscription is required to stream Apple Mucis over a cellular connection
All of Tesla’s more data-heavy applications inside its vehicles require the $10/month premium connectivity subscription to enhance the included cellular connectivity inside Tesla vehicles.
Tesla has been regularly adding games to its “Tesla Arcade” entertainment platform inside its vehicles.
With the holiday update, the automaker is adding Mahjong.
Tesla wrote about the addition in the release notes:
The relaxing tile match game has been elevated with a clean modern design, smooth animations, and calming sounds. Match identical tiles. A tile is playable if it is open on the left or right and isn’t covered by another tile. Continue pairing tiles to clear the board and your mind! To access Mahjong, tap the Application Launcher > Arcade.
The update also brings an update to Dog Mode, which enables owners to safely leave their dogs in their vehicles with climate control on.
Tesla is sort of combining the feature with its remote live-view feature that launched last year.
The company wrote in the release notes:
View the interior camera from the mobile app while using Dog Mode or Sentry Mode. [To] enable Live Camera, tap Controls > Safety > View Live Camera via Mobile App.
How about an Auto open trunk feature. When I approach the rear with a load of groceries, just swing my leg towards the rear camera to open trunk. Worked well on my 2014 BMW, why not a 2022 Tesla?
Tesla notes that owners also need the latest mobile app update for this feature to work since remote viewing works through the app.
The update also includes improvements to Tesla’s “Light Show,” a feature launched during the holidays a few years ago, and enables Tesla vehicles to make a light show with its headlights matching music.
Tesla now enables you to schedule the light show:
Schedule the Light Show for up to 10 minutes in advance or watch a multi-car orchestra by setting them to start simultaneously. Celebrate New Year’s with the Auld Lang Syne show or create longer custom shows.
To access LIght Show, tap the Application Launcher > Toybox.
The holiday update also includes a bunch a smaller features and updates to existing features that are fairly self-explanatory. Here are all of them directly from the release notes:
Climate Control Fan Speed
Adjust fan speed intensity while remaining in AUTO climate by selecting ‘LO’, ‘MED’, and ‘HI’ from the fan intensity selector on the climate control popup.

2022/12/13,"Tesla opening its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles is creating a weird problem that results in making some charging stalls useless.
Over the last year, Tesla has been working to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles.
In Europe, Tesla has already opened hundreds of stations in most countries it operates in. The automaker indicated that it planned to do the same by the end of the year in North America, but it has yet to do it.
However, Tesla hasn’t opened all its Supercharger stations in Europe as it is still testing the impact of more EVs on its charging network.
There’s one problem that not a lot of people saw coming when allowing non-Tesla EVs on the Supercharger network, which was designed for Tesla vehicles.
 It is perfectly illustrated in this video posted to the Tesla subreddit today:
The problem here that the Model 3 owner didn’t realize until he was already parked is that the Jaguar I-Pace parked to the right was using the Supercharger that would have normally been used by the Tesla parked in the middle.
That’s no fault to the I-Pace owner since it is the only way he could have plugged in.
The problem is that the Supercharger is designed to work with Tesla vehicles, which all have their charge ports on the back left side of the vehicles.
That’s not the case for other EVs. Some have it on the front left side, like the I-Pace. Others have it in the middle of the front end, like the Hyundai Kona EV.
The inconsistencies between charge ports on all the different models are something that Tesla didn’t have to adapt to with the Supercharger network until now.
Other charging network operators, like Electrify America pictured below, had to since they aim to serve every electric vehicle equipped with a CCS charge connector and they equipped their stations with longer cable attached higher up to be able to reach around a vehicle.
Tesla is going to have to adopt a similar solution as it continues to open its Supercharger network in more markets. Otherwise, it will create more of these awkward situations like the one in the video above.
It looks like Tesla is already aware of the situation because it is working on a new generation of its charging station, Supercharger V4, which appears to have a much longer cable.
Driver side location is easiest to reach
Passenger side is needed for parallel parking
Front is easier to park
Rear is easier to get out of parking spaces
Trailers also add their own problems.
Maybe there isnt a best location....
But the question is how and if Tesla will adapt existing stations to the issue because it already has over 40,000 Superchargers around the world.
While Tesla’s Supercharger cable has always been quite short and it is contributing to this problem, it feels like the EV industry needs a standardized charge port location.
They are currently all over the place when they should all be on the back of the left side like Tesla vehicles.
I feel like that’s a no-brainer. What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/12/13,"Tesla has started to deliver the refreshed Model S and Model X to customers in Europe – resulting in roughly two years without deliveries of its two flagship models in the region.
The automaker shut down Model S and Model X production in January 2021 to update its two flagship vehicles.
Europe has been starved of those models since then – coming up on almost two years now.
Tesla kept taking new orders, but production was delayed with the new refreshed Model S starting to be delivered in June 2021 and the updated Model X in October 2021 in North America.
With the production ramp being slow, Tesla took the rare decision to stop taking orders outside of North America starting in December 2021.
That turned out to be the right decision because Tesla was not able to start deliveries in Europe until now. We reported that Tesla opened orders back up in August, and now customers in Europe are reporting taking delivery of their vehicles that they ordered more than two years ago in some cases.
Those who placed their orders when Tesla reopened them in August don’t expect deliveries until next year. Deliveries are starting with the Model S and Model X Plaid – the top-performance version of Tesla’s two flagship models.
Tesla famously has a different approach to model updates. It often updates its vehicles with new hardware whenever ready and doesn’t wait for model year updates at the end of the year like most other automakers.
Every few years, it does bundle some of those updates together for a model “refresh,” like it did with the Model S and Model X in this case, but we have to point out here just how inefficient that model update was if it resulted in no deliveries in Europe and China, two huge markets for Tesla, for almost two years.
CEO Elon Musk even admitted that for the Model X update, Tesla shouldn’t have shut down production of the Model X at the same time as Model S since it resulted in about nine months without deliveries even in the US.
Now two years without deliveries in Europe for both models, that’s not great. I think Tesla should rethink how it does model refreshes after this experience.

2022/12/12,"A judge has ordered Tesla to upgrade a customer’s self-driving computer for free so that they can subscribe to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program without an additional cost. It’s a victory for customers frustrated with Tesla selling a self-driving package to customers before the company has actually delivered a fully functioning feature.
Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles produced since 2016 have “all the needed hardware” to become self-driving with future software updates.
The automaker has yet to deliver on that promise, and the company actually had to upgrade the hardware in vehicles produced since 2016. Most notably, Tesla had to upgrade the onboard computer on which it runs its self-driving software. The new computer is known as Hardware 3.0 or the FSD computer.
To make good on its 2016 promise that vehicles produced going forward would have “all the needed hardware” to become self-driving, Tesla offered a free computer retrofit to owners who ordered the Full Self-Driving package.
The fact that Tesla was doing the retrofit for free squashed people’s concerns about needing to update hardware to access self-driving.
However, things got more complicated last year when Tesla launched its Full Self-Driving subscription package for $199 per month. Instead of outright buying the Full Self-Driving package, which now costs $15,000, Tesla owners had the opportunity pay $199 a month to get the features available under the package.
The problem is that for owners who didn’t have the Full Self-Driving computer retrofit, Tesla was asking for $1,500 (later reduced to $1,000) to get the computer before they could get a FSD subscription.
As we pointed out in our article about the situation, this seemed to go against Tesla’s promise of upgrading hardware for free if needed in order to achieve the self-driving capability promised since 2016.
Now a Tesla owner has successfully tested this theory in court.
Tesla Model 3 owner Ian Jordan decided to bring his complaint to small claims court in the state of Washington after his requests for a resolution from Tesla were ignored.
His Model 3 had the hardware 2.5 computer and Tesla wanted to charge him $1,000 to upgrade to the new computer before he could subscribe to FSD. Jordan challenged that charge in the small claims court.
Tesla ended up not showing up to defend itself, so Jordan won. But, the judge’s ruling was still interesting.
Judge Matthew A. Skau wrote in the case’s conclusion:
Furthermore, Plaintiff purchased a second Tesla Model 3, relying on advertisement from the company that all Tesla 3 models come with all the necessary hardware for self-driving. Defendant learned that, in fact, installing the self-driving function would cost $1,106 in further hardware upgrades in violation of Tesla’s false advertising.
He is basically calling Tesla’s claim “false advertising.”
Jordan also made a separate claim against Tesla over lost functionality in his other Tesla vehicle that was equipped with the original MCU1 media unit. Even though it was still under warranty, Tesla said it couldn’t fix the issue and instead recommended a paid upgrade to the new generation of media computers (MCU 2).
The judge found that this was a breach of warranty and ordered Tesla to pay Jordan $1,657.50 – the cost of upgrading to the new computer. He even ordered a $500 award to compensate for the loss of AM radio since Tesla’s solution of upgrading to the new computer instead of restoring the functions of the original computer resulted in the loss of AM radio, which is not available in the MCU 2.
Jordan told Electrek that Tesla quickly paid what the court ordered.
This owner paved an interesting path for Tesla owners in similar situations to force Tesla to do the right thing. However, be warned that the difficulty of filing in small claims court varies in difficulty depending on location.
Customers are also exploring other avenues – including a class action lawsuit – of holding Tesla to its promises about hardware and delivering a functional self-driving feature.
Sounds reasonable. 

I don't plan to subscribe to or purchase FSD on my 2018 M3, so it doesn't affect me, but Tesla did advertise the vehicles as being hardware-ready for FSD. 
We reported last week that Tesla tried to get the lawsuit dismissed by saying that “failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud.”
For those willing to go through the small claims system, Jordan’s approach might be a better short-term solution.
Interestingly, Jordan said that he used our article about the FSD subscription situation as evidence in the case in front of the judge. Funny enough, Tesla CEO Elon Musk blocked Electrek’s and my personal Twitter accounts after we posted that article. 
We can’t confirm that it is the reason why we were blocked, but there was nothing else we posted around that time that could have triggered this.

2022/12/12,"Tesla is becoming a partisan brand – losing the support of Democrats and gaining support from Republicans, according to a survey.
Leaders of large companies selling consumer products, like automakers and tech companies, generally refrain from showing direct support to any political party, especially in the US.
Due to the polarizing nature of politics in the US and its two-party system, it’s better to stay away from definitive statements of support one way or the other since you risk alienating large parts of the population.
That’s why it was so surprising to see Elon Musk tell his over 100 million followers on Twitter to vote Republican during the midterm elections last month and going as far as calling the Democratic Party the “party of hate.”
Regardless of your political affiliation, from a business standpoint as the leader of a company selling consumer products, it was a questionable move, and the impact is starting to be felt.
A survey from Morning Consult reported by the Wall Street Journal has been tracking changes in opinion about Tesla from people with different political affiliations. It shows that the number of Democrats with a positive view of Tesla has been tracking significantly down, while it’s up for self-described Republicans:
Tesla’s net favorability among self-described Democrats in the U.S. fell to an average of 10.4% this month through Nov. 27, down from an average of 24.8% in October, according to Morning Consult. It rose to 26.5% from 20% among self-described Republicans during the same period.
Jordan Marlatt, tech analyst at Morning Consult, went as far as saying that Tesla is becoming a partisan brand:
It seems like Tesla is on its way to becoming a partisan brand.
Another survey from YouGov shows that Tesla’s popularity has been going down over the last year and recently dipped below 50%:
The YouGov survey also tracks opinions from different political affiliations and found that self-described liberals now view Tesla more negatively than conservatives, although conservatives also have a negative view of Tesla on average.
Quite the reversal since I can still clearly remember the days when many Republicans would say that Tesla and Musk are just greedy for government subsidies.
Fred, my city in west coast L.A. is virtually a showcase for Tesla adoption. You see hundreds in daily traffic. It’s now home to a massive new supercharger and service center/body shop. Folks in California made Tesla a success yet Elon bailed to a state where dealers prohibit their sale. Fair enough. But his current political posturing is hostile, inimical to a HUGE number of potential customers. What savvy businessman would alienate even one?

He’s dabbling in quicksand with the Twitter deal and may find that this impulsive and expensive move will prove to damage all his interests irretrievably.
If anything, this goes to show how people have issues separating Tesla and Elon Musk, as Tesla itself hasn’t become more political lately. Musk clearly has, though.
Some people actually think that this is on purpose, that Tesla exhausted its pool of left-leaning potential customers and Musk is going after Republicans, but I don’t subscribe to that theory.
Musk has actually stated several times that Democrats being mean to him has pushed him to the right:
Bizarre. Elon appears to basically confirm he became political (and certainly more right-wing) because some Dems were mean to him? Sounds a lot like political capture to me.Interestingly, he claimed that's what happened to me with Tesla in 2019. I got captured by $TSLAQ lol pic.twitter.com/6ifGMux7xx
Obviously there could be other factors at play, but this does sound like it’s one of them. Is it worth it if it is going to affect Tesla in that way? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below, but please don’t get political, and stay respectful. We are talking about the impact of Musk getting political on Tesla here. Not which side is best.

2022/12/12,"Tesla has been approved to create a “statewide market design pilot” for a virtual power plant (VPP) in Texas. The company will be able to band its Powerwall customers together to deliver grid services in the state and get them compensated for it.
We have seen Tesla putting a lot of effort into virtual power plants lately.
A virtual power plant consists of distributed energy storage systems – like Tesla Powerwalls – used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants.
Last year, Tesla launched a VPP pilot program in California, where Powerwall owners would join voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it. It helped Tesla prove the usefulness of such a system.
Following the pilot program, Tesla and PG&E (the electric utility covering Northern California) launched the first official virtual power plant through the Tesla app in June.
This new version of the virtual power plant actually compensates Powerwall owners $2 per kWh that they contribute to the grid during emergency load reduction events. Homeowners are expected to get between $10 and $60 per event.
Later, we reported that Tesla’s California VPP expanded to Southern California Edison (SCE) to now cover most of the state. Shortly after, the VPP had its first event, and it was extremely successful.
By September, Tesla’s California VPP had a capacity of up to 50 MW.
Tesla has been trying to build a VPP in its new home state this year, but it needed to change some rules with the local market authorities before making it happen.
In May, we reported on Tesla lobbying for any homeowner with solar and batteries to participate in Texas’s energy market.
The company was asking for a rule change with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an organization operating Texas’s electrical grid, that would enable electric utilities with customers with behind-the-meter solar and batteries, meaning people with residential solar, to bid on the extra capacity.
At the time, we speculated that Tesla could be seeking the rule change to enable a virtual power plant with its Powerwall customers in the state.
Sure enough, Tesla confirmed it a month later when it launched a virtual power plant demonstration in Texas in order to demonstrate to ERCOT the value that VPPs can bring to the grid.
The demo was opened to only about 200 Tesla Powerwall owners in the North of Texas, but apparently, it was successful because Tesla is now moving to a “statewide” VPP.
Arushi Sharma Frank, Tesla’s US energy markets policy lead, announced on LinkedIn:
With the unfaltering support of the Public Utility Commission of Texas and ERCOT, a couple of smart-as-hell staffers doing kickass project management including Tiffany Wu the ADER Task Force Chair and Vice Chair Jason Ryan and I got our formidable group of ADER task force members together this week in Austin to celebrate creating a statewide market design pilot for small distributed energy resources to provide grid service exports – and we did it in 45 days. We at Tesla cannot wait to get started with bringing the VPP experience to Texas consumers.
It sounds like Tesla has received the green light to expand their VPP statewide in Texas and offer customers who enroll their battery packs real benefits for services to the grid.
This is a big deal. The Texas electric grid has had a few tough years where it came close to a meltdown. 
They have been adding energy storage at the utility-scale, which can help stabilize the grid, and Tesla is participating in that too with Megapacks projects in Texas, but Tesla also has a lot of Powerwall customers in the state who can have a great impact together.
But the company needed for ERCOT to get on board and enable these customers to actually provide grid services through a VPP and get them compensated for those services.
I would expect Tesla to roll out the program fast, especially with the experience it gained in California this year.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/12/10,"Tesla has unveiled a new giant Megapack project in Belgium that is now the biggest Megapack project in continental Europe and one of the biggest energy storage projects on the whole continent.
Megapack projects have been popping up left and right lately.
Tesla’s biggest energy storage product has quickly emerged as the leading battery system for large utility-scale energy storage systems. It enables electric utilities to make better use of renewable energy, like solar, and stabilize the grid.
Megapack helped Tesla’s energy division accelerate storage deployment, and the company has now built an impressive backlog of orders.
But Tesla is now working faster than ever through its backlog with 42 Megapacks per week produced at Gigafactory Nevada, in addition to the new Megafactory in California recently coming online and trying to ramp up to an ambitious capacity of 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.
Last night, Tesla unveiled a new Megapack project in Lessines, Belgium:
In Lessines, Belgium, a World War II turbojet generator had been providing energy support to the community since the 1950s. To provide cleaner energy storage and add more renewable energy to the grid, the Deux-Acren project installed 40 Tesla Megapacks, making it one of the largest storage systems in Europe.
The company released a video about the project:
Tesla confirmed that the Megapack system will be used for “energy shifting and stabilizing services.”
With 40 Megapacks, the Lessines battery system has 50 MW of power and 100 MWh of energy capacity.
The company noted that it is the biggest battery system in continental Europe.
We reported last month on an even bigger Megapack project that Tesla recently deployed in the UK.
The financial experts all seem to be stuck on Tesla's car sales when they give their buy-sell-or-hold advice about the company's stock - but they'll no doubt have a whole bunch of reasons why that stock started to go up, when all of a sudden they wake up and realize that Tesla isn't a car company that makes energy products... it's an energy company that makes cars.
Tesla’s energy storage business has been on fire lately.
Last quarter, Tesla deployed a record high of 2.1 GWh in battery capacity – mostly driven by Megapack growth. The record is expected to be broken again shortly, thanks to the new capacity at the Megafactory allowing the company to work through its large backlog.
Tesla has also ramped up Powerwall production, contributing to that record energy storage deployment.
While Tesla doesn’t break down its energy storage deployment by product, the Megapack is believed to account for the majority of deployment as a much bigger utility-scale product.

2022/12/10,"A Tesla Cybertruck body has been spotted being worked on ahead of the electric pickup truck’s upcoming start of production in Texas.
There are about 1.5 million people interested in the Tesla Cybertruck, and they have been starved of information for a while.
An update on the production version with final specs and pricing has been expected for the past year, but the automaker has decided to stay quiet about the electric truck, which already had some delays.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory (that being delayed as well), it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023, and in June, Musk said that Tesla is aiming for production to start in mid-2023.
In its communications, Tesla has stuck to a mid-2023 timeline over the last few months, and it is starting to become more real than just words, with actual production equipment specific to Cybertruck coming to Gigafactory Texas.
Now the image of what appears to be a Tesla Cybertruck body has leaked through the YouTube channel Kim Java without much more information than the image itself:
The image appears to reveal the body of the Cybertruck that we saw arrive at Gigafactory Texas two months ago.
It shows large casting parts in the back of the truck. It’s hard to tell how many parts make up the entire back of the body since it appears to be partially coated.
The automaker appears to be using both aluminum-casted parts and steel for parts of the frame.
Tesla originally talked about the Cybertruck being equipped with an exoskeleton, although some dispute Tesla’s use of the word “exoskeleton” since it’s not clear that parts of the external body are structural.
Potential CTE mismatch if the stainless steel skins are indeed connected to an aluminum frame. The skins could very well provide structural advantages if they are rigidly mounted to the understructure. Stainless steel is very heavy 3x compared to aluminum so I doubt that under structure is going to be still. The truck will be assembled at room temperature but if you take it to negative 20 Fahrenheit that is a large shrink mismatch that could buckle the stainless steel skins. That indeed is going to be a problem the way that they would counter it would be a flexural mounting where the skins aren't rigidly connected to the aluminum subframe. I'm no car expert but but I understand CTE mismatch very well in space structures. 
Here’s how Tesla describes it on its website:
Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.
The picture of the body also doesn’t make any external structural parts clear.

2022/12/09,"2022 was undoubtedly Tesla’s best year ever financially and for vehicle deliveries, but it has not been for its stock (TSLA), and now investors are unhappy and telling the board about it.
If you were to just look at Tesla’s quarterly reports this year, you would think that Tesla shareholders are having a great year.
The automaker is delivering record earnings after record earnings, with deliveries going up and annualized production capacity nearing two million vehicles per year – more than any other automakers when it comes to all-electric vehicles.
It looks like Tesla’s vision is finally coming together.
Yet, you have retail investors like Leo KoGuan, a billionaire who is the third-largest Tesla shareholder, calling Tesla’s board of directors “missing in action”:
Tesla board is missing in action (MIA)!The market is NOT normalThat is why it is imperative the board is doing the buyback nowNow means nowNot hypothetical, NEW retail investors bought high and forced to sell low, not those who bought Tesla @$4 or less and sold them @$400 https://t.co/D3FD4AhVlt
We first reported on KoGuan last year when he became the third largest individual shareholder in Tesla behind Elon Musk and Larry Ellison. In September, we were able to confirm that he put more money into Tesla (TSLA) than Elon Musk himself.
He, along with many other prominent Tesla investors, is calling for Tesla’s board to initiate a share buyback program.
That’s because Tesla’s stock is down almost 50% since the beginning of the year:
Now the broader market also had a bad year, but Tesla is definitely having a worse go at it than its peers with the Nasdaq being down 29% over the same period. A lot of the discrepancy has been attributed to CEO Elon Musk who sold tens of billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock over the last year.
Tesla talked about a potential $5 to $10 billion share buyback program back in October, but there has been no official word on the plan since.
Now Tesla retail investors, including KoGuan, have been campaigning for Musk to comment on Twitter about the situation, but the CEO has remained silent.
As for KoGuan, he is seemingly growing frustrated with the lack of response:
Does Elon have Rousseau’s 2 personalities?One who loves and saves mankind and free speech; but Two who dislikes, ignores and fights his shareholders as inconvenient pests?I don’t know.But talking is bullshit + fake; doing is honesty + real https://t.co/r7JuuKH73K
I’m an investor and I’m not ‘happy’, and I also blame Musk for the latest development, but still I think Tesla is overvalued. So I can’t really complain, but if they could go back to overvaluing it some more, I’d appreciate that. 
But the third largest Tesla shareholder remains positive about the company long term as he states that he plans to invest an additional $2 billion into the automaker over the next three years.
In the meantime, the Tesla shorts, after years of getting burned, are finally making some money back. 
S3 Partners, a firm tracking short interest, confirmed this week that Tesla shorts have made up to $11.5 billion by betting against Tesla’s stock this year.
But who is going to have the last laugh? Do you think a stock buyback program will be enough to stop the bleeding? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/12/08,"A new ‘Tesla neighborhood’ has launched in Las Vegas with Tesla Powerwalls and solar power in every home.
Tesla neighborhood is a term that is being used for new developments where all the homes integrate all or part of Tesla’s power ecosystem, including the Powerwall home battery pack.
The best example is a new giant development project in Austin, Texas, by Brookfield Asset Management and Dacra where up to 12,000 new homes are being built offering Tesla solar roofs and Powerwalls.
Now a new project called The Arches in Las Vegas is becoming a new Tesla neighborhood.
Home builder Lennar announced the opening of the new project with 51 homes, each equipped with solar panels, a Tesla Powerwall, and electric vehicle charging stations:
The Arches is a unique Lennar community featuring included solar panels, the Tesla Powerwall, and two universal EV chargers at each homesite. All combined, these features make The Arches a net-zero solar community.
Sunnova, a Tesla Powerwall installation partner, is behind the solar and battery installations at the Lennar project.
They shared a few pictures of the opening of the project:
Lennar says that the Tesla Powerwalls are going to be used for both peak shaving and for backup power:
The Tesla Powerwall is a fully integrated AC battery system that acts as a partial home backup. Excess solar power is stored in the Powerwall during the day to use at night, during peak rate times or during a power outage depending on how the homeowner has the configuration set. In the case of a power outage, the Powerwall alone will keep the refrigerator running, keep the most critical lights on, power your garage door and allow internet and streaming access.
 Joy Broddle, division president of Lennar Las Vegas, commented on the project:
With incredible energy-saving initiatives and well-designed floorplans, The Arches has something for households at any stage in life. This community is ideal for anyone looking to live a more eco-conscious lifestyle and take advantage of the year-round sunshine that the Las Vegas Valley has to offer.
There are a lot of efficiencies that can be gained at the design and installation level for solar and Powerwall projects for new homes in communities like these.
I would like to know whether these homes are all-electric, or do they have gas appliances? When looking to buy a home here in Babcock Ranch, (America's First Solar city, LOL) I actually got into an argument with the Lennar real estate agent about that. She couldn't understand why I didn't want gas appliances. I found that out of around 6 or 8 builders here, Meritage Homes wes the only one doing all-electric. Needless to say, I went with them. Even on the new ""Innovation Way"", a street with demo homes that are supposed to incorporate all of the latest eco-friendly building practices, all of the homes I looked at had gas appliances. Really? Someone is getting kickbacks, IMHO.
Tesla has recently been deploying record energy storage capacity mostly due to a ramp-up in Powerwall and Megapack production.
We recently learned that Tesla has increased Powerwall production to 6,500 units per week. That’s 87 MWh per week. Megapacks contribute a lot more with fewer units since a single Megapack can deliver over 3 MWh of energy capacity.

2022/12/08,"Tesla (TSLA) has hired Chris Winton, former chief people officer at FedEx, in the automaker’s new role of “Champion of the People,” better known as the head of human resources.
Earlier this year, Tesla’s head of HR, Valerie Capers Workman, left the company.
Workman had brought some stability to the department that saw three different leaders over two years.
Tesla didn’t appear to have a replacement for her since she left in January, but it now has found a replacement: Chris Winton. 
Winton is coming off an impressive 35-year career at FedEx where he rose through the ranks to become chief people officer in March of this year. The longtime HR executive has confirmed on his LinkedIn page that he is now “Champion of the People” at Tesla.
Tesla is known to use unusual titles for its C-suite executives – with Elon Musk, CEO, becoming “Technoking” of Tesla, and CFO Zack Kirkhorn becoming “Master of Coin” last year.
Join me in wishing that “Champignon of the People” good luck and a long life at Tesla.

Seriously, it won’t be easy to keep the folks there motivated with the value of the salary stock options dwindling and all the Musk blunder and controversies. The Champignon better has some tricks up in his sleeve, the title alone won’t make it.

But then again, this is probably not what for a champignon of the people is hired and paid.
Winton will be moving from Memphis, where FedEx is based, to Tesla’s headquarters in Austin, Texas.
He confirmed to the Memphis Business Journal that his title of “Champion of the People” at Tesla is the “top HR role” at the company:
I am forever grateful to FedEx and its leadership for the amazing opportunities I was given during my career there. This role gives me a new opportunity to work with another world-class company in the top HR role.
The new Tesla executive is expected to be in charge of human resources for the more than 100,000 employees at the automaker and recruiting – a massive endeavor at Tesla as the company is growing rapidly and has several major manufacturing projects that require hiring over 10,000 people at one location.
Winton is also joining the company during a strange time for the automaker as CEO Elon Musk, who he reports to, is busy leading a major reorganization at Twitter, which he recently acquired.

2022/12/08,"Tesla (TSLA) is again facing rumors that it is cutting production in China amid lower demand, even after cutting prices on its electric vehicles.
Over the last few months, Tesla has pulled on several “demand levers” to boost demand in China.
We reported in October that Tesla reduced the price of the Model 3 and Model Y in China and launched a new referral program. It was the first time in two years that Tesla cut prices on its electric vehicles.
Later, the automaker also launched a new cash rebate with its insurance partners in China.
It led to reports that Tesla suffers from a demand drop-off in the country. The automaker denied those rumors last month, but without providing any evidence.
Earlier this week, the rumors began circulating with Bloomberg claiming that Tesla was now planning to reduce production output at Gigafactory Shanghai by 20% in December. Tesla China said the report was “untrue” without going into details.
Now Bloomberg is doubling down with a new report going into more detail about Tesla cutting production at the factory:
Tesla Inc. will shorten production shifts at its Shanghai factory as soon as Monday and has delayed the on-boarding of some new hires, people familiar with the situation said — adding to signs demand for the company’s electric cars in China isn’t meeting expectations.
The report claims that Tesla is cutting its 11 1/2-hour shifts into two 9 1/2-hour shifts per day starting Monday, according to a schedule seen by Bloomberg. The shorter shifts will reportedly lead to reduced monthly pay income for the Gigafactory Shanghai production staff.
The publication says that Tesla China declined to comment on the report.
Many Tesla fans think that once Tesla or Musk calls a media report “untrue,” that’s the end of it. It’s untrue and it has been shut down, but it’s not that simple.
There are many separate functions that go into making a car: stamping, casting, body in white welding, painting, general assembly. I know for a fact that the Fremont factory has different work schedules for these various elements because not all need to be operating 24/7 to maximize production. Production is limited by the throughput in cars or parts per hour of the slowest element.

Tesla recently upgraded production capacity in Shanghai by 25%. It's quite possible that one or more production elements are now more efficient than the slowest production element. That would result in a cutback in hours for the faster production steps. Bloomberg hears of a cut in production hours for part of the factory and concludes it is for the entire factory. Voila.
I agree that Musk and Tesla are subject to a lot of nonsense in the media that needs to be denied, but from experience, I can say that Tesla and Musk are not always completely honest regarding media reports.
For example, when I reported that Tesla had selected Austin for its next Gigafactory in the US, the automaker leaked to three publications that Tulsa was still in the running, which wasn’t true:
This is so funny. All 3 publications get the same anon source saying the same vague thing just an hour after my report. @tesla this is sloppy work to try to muddy my report. https://t.co/Ilq7Wj1pdq
At the time, we knew for a fact that Musk had greenlit the project to go to Austin; Tesla PR reached out to the publication off the record to try and muddy our report. We know because we have also been on the other side of that situation with Tesla.
In this case, with the additional information from Bloomberg and Tesla China now declining to comment, I think that there’s likely some truth to the reporting.

2022/12/08,"Elon Musk’s bankers are considering Tesla (TSLA) stock-backed margin loans to support Twitter, which is under heavy interest expenses.
Stock-backed margin loans are a popular way for billionaires whose money is tied up in stocks to get some cash.
You can be worth $100 billion on paper, but if all that money is tied up in a stock, like Tesla, it doesn’t mean that you have cash to spend. For those people, banks can offer loans backed by their stocks. If the stocks go down to a predetermined level, they have to sell to cover the loan.
Elon Musk has used this financing vehicle several times with several hundred-million-dollar loans backed by Tesla stock over the years.
To finance his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, Tesla-backed loans were reportedly considered, but Musk ended up selling billions of dollars’ worth of Tesla stock instead.
The rest was covered by investment partners and $13 billion in debt that is reportedly resulting in $1.2 billion in annual interest costs.
That’s putting a lot of pressure on the company’s financials, and now Bloomberg reports that Musk’s bankers are considering Tesla-backed margin loans again:
Elon Musk’s bankers are considering providing the billionaire with new margin loans backed by Tesla Inc. stock to replace some of the high-interest debt he layered on Twitter Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Hey stock newbies....growth companies don't buy back stock, they take profits, and reinvest it back into the company for growth and expansion to gain market share of whatever product/services its selling. A value company - one that is done with growth - has the luxury of stock buybacks and/or dividends. 
According to the report, the plan is not yet finalized. The loan amount is not known, but the discussions have reportedly focused on replacing a $3 billion loan at 11% interest.
Musk selling over $10 billion in Tesla stock has already put a lot of pressure on the stock and its shareholders.
That would just add more pressure as downturns in the stock’s price could result in Musk selling even more Tesla stocks.
At the same time, Tesla’s board is reportedly considering a stock buyback program to help the stock price. It would create a potentially strange ethical situation if Musk takes margin loans backed by his Tesla stock and then Tesla’s board spends billions of dollars of the company’s money to help maintain the stock price.

2022/12/08,"Tesla has reportedly tapped Tom Zhu, president of Tesla in China, to take over leadership of Gigafactory Texas as the factory is trying to ramp up production.
In October, Electrek reported that Tesla was still looking for a leader at Gigafactory Texas. That’s somewhat surprising considering Tesla started production at the factory a year ago.
Now we learn that Tesla has Tom Zhu, the executive in charge of Tesla’s operations in China, taking over the responsibilities of Gigafactory Texas, according to Bloomberg:
Elon Musk has tapped a longtime Tesla Inc. executive in China who oversaw construction of the Shanghai gigfactory to help run the electric carmaker’s newest plant in Austin, Texas, people familiar with the matter said.
The report doesn’t specify if the move is permanent or if Zhu will retain his responsibilities in China.
The news comes just after a report from China claiming that Zhu has been tapped to take over the role of CEO from Elon Musk at Tesla. However, we did note that the circumstances of the media report were strange. 
The news comes amid Tesla trying to ramp up production of both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin simultaneously. Tesla already confirmed that Giga Berlin is now producing 2,000 vehicles per week.
Tesla previously confirmed 1,000 vehicles per week at Giga Texas back in June, but it hasn’t updated the production rate since then.
Wow if Austin hit 1k/wk in June, yet only built #20k in October, simple math says barely producing even 1k/wk from Jun-Oct.  What's wrong in Austin?  With IRA, wasn't the focus to be Austin over Berlin, yet Berlin is doubling Austin output.  Hot mess!
Interestingly, the company announced that Gigafactory Texas produced its 20,000th Model Y in October, but that’s the total production to date, and it doesn’t tell us the current production rate.
However, Electrek recently reported that Tesla plans a massive production output ramp at Gigafactory Texas in the first quarter of 2023. The automaker is preparing for 75,000 Model Y vehicles coming from the plant in Q1 2023.
In November, Tesla reportedly brought about 200 engineers working at Gigafactory Shanghai to Fremont factory to help ramp production at the US plant.
Tesla appears to be trying to replicate the success it had at Gigafactory Shanghai at its US factories.

2022/12/07,"Tesla defended itself in a lawsuit over its self-driving claims brought by a customer by saying that “mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud.”
In September, we reported on a Tesla owner filing a class-action lawsuit against Tesla over “allegedly misleading the public regarding its Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving Capability (‘FSD’) technology.”
Since 2016, Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles produced going forward have “all the needed hardware” to become self-driving with future software updates.
However, the automaker has yet to deliver on the promise, and over the last few years, some owners have started to doubt Tesla’s ability to deliver at all – leading to the lawsuit now.
Last week, Tesla filed to have the lawsuit dismissed, which resulted in a rare comment from the automaker about not having delivered on self-driving yet.
In the motion to dismiss obtained by Electrek, Tesla argues that its failure to deliver on the goal doesn’t constitute fraud:
“Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud.” 
Calling Tesla’s advertisement that its vehicles will become self-driving a “long-term, aspirational goal” is the most cautious description of the goal from the automaker to date. But the approach will make it difficult for the plaintiffs. 
They need to prove that Tesla intentionally misled customers into thinking they were buying vehicles that would become self-driving. They would need to prove that Tesla knew it couldn’t deliver on the promise, which could be difficult to do.
Tesla never promised a specific timeline for delivering on the goal, but CEO Elon Musk previously said that Tesla would achieve self-driving in 2020. The goal has been delayed several times.
In the motion to dismiss, Tesla argues that the complaint actually shows that Tesla has been working toward the goal of self-driving:
To the contrary, allegations in the Complaint demonstrate that Tesla has been constantly improving its ADAS technology by releasing software updates, with a goal of achieving more and better autonomy capabilities in the future.
Tesla also references several comments made by the company and CEO Elon Musk that constituted warnings that there will be issues bringing self-driving to market. 
In addition, from early on, Tesla made clear that “there will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators.”
The company ends its argument by saying that “the Complaint identifies no specific timeline promised by Tesla to release fully autonomous capabilities to the general public.”
Aspiration goals are great for a tech. company. I don't doubt Elon and Tesla crew's long term visions because Tesla is still IMO the most likely candidate to achieve more driving autonomy than others (it might not be full FSD) . I paid for the FSD and honestly I don't regret it until I need to pay for it again for my new Tesla and only this time, I can't swallow the cost. Why? Because I literally got nothing out of the FSD I paid for and it's really expensive this time around and it can't be transferred nor Tesla really values it (they would say they valued it in the trade-in, but if they do, they value it very little :)). That's why I feel cheated this time around. They should have at least allowed a refund or a free transfer on a ""product"" that was never delivered. Life goes on.
It’s interesting that at least Tesla admits failure to achieve the goal because I’ve seen them moving the goalposts as of late.
Musk went from mentioning “1 million robotaxi on the road by the end of the year” to “1 million people with FSD Beta by the end of the year” to “anyone who bought FSD will get access to the Beta in North America by the end of the year.”
Tesla has now achieved that last version of the goal, but that’s so far from the original goal that it’s not in the same league.
On top of what we hear about a new sensor suite potentially coming, things are not looking great on the FSD front. As I have said for a long time, Tesla should at least offer refunds to those who bought the FSD package.

2022/12/07,"In a truly bizarre situation, media outlet Pingwest claims that Tesla has decided to replace Elon Musk as CEO with Tom Zhu, president of Tesla China, right after losing a lawsuit over fake news against Tesla.
Pingwest is a Chinese tech publication with a decent-size following on social media and dozens of employees, according to LinkedIn.
Last year, the publication published a damning article on Tesla titled “Giga-Sweatshop Meets Corporate Overlords: an Exclusive Look Into How Tesla China Runs its Shanghai Gigafactory 3.”
The article includes wide-ranging claims of quality problems at Tesla’s factory as well as poor working conditions and even questionable sales tactics.
Most of the claims are based on single unnamed sources that Pingwest says work at Tesla or Tesla suppliers. The claims range from simply serving bad food to workers to more serious offenses, like knowingly using defective parts.
In an extraordinary move, Tesla decided to sue the publication over the article a month after it came out.
Last week, more than a year later, Tesla won the case against Pingwest in front of the Shanghai Pudong New Area People’s Court. The publication was reportedly ordered by the court to remove the article, issue a retraction admitting the article wasn’t accurate, and even pay a small retribution equivalent to $14,000 USD.
Now a week after basically being forced to admit posting fake news about Tesla by the court, Pingwest now reports what would be major news about Tesla if true: Tesla replacing Elon Musk as global CEO with Tom Zhu, president of Tesla China, responsible for Tesla’s operations in Asia-Pacific. 
This is such a strange situation. There have been talks among Tesla investors about replacing Musk as CEO lately, due to his lack of focus on Tesla since his acquisition of Twitter.
I guess they calculated the revenue generated by a “fake news” article was greater than the fine.
In the past, Musk himself has referenced a scenario where he would like to step down as CEO of Tesla but remain at the company as “product architect,” letting someone take over the daily leadership of the automaker.
And while the name Tom Zhu doesn’t come up often as possible replacement, he would certainly be a contender considering Tesla’s incredible success in China under his leadership, with Musk praising him directly on a few occasions.
Zhu oversaw the development of Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai, which has become the automaker’s biggest manufacturing success.
However, the context in which this news is coming out of Pingwest a week after being found guilty of fake news on Tesla by the court is just so bizarre that we can’t put much weight on the report.

2022/12/07,"Tesla has officially launched in Thailand and opened orders for Model 3 and Model Y at competitive prices.
It has been a little while since Tesla has expanded into a brand-new market. The company was trying hard to enter the Indian market for years, but the effort was put on hold earlier this year after negotiations with the government stalled.
A few weeks later, we learned that Tesla’s new market team turned its attention to Southeast Asia, and more specifically Thailand.
The automaker filed to register its product for sale in the country. That was the first indication that Tesla planned to enter the market.
In September, we reported that Tesla started to hire in Thailand – indicating that a launch was imminent.
Today, Tesla has officially launched its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Thailand with a small event in a luxury mall in central Bangkok.
The automaker has started taking orders through a new Thai configurator for those two models. Tesla is offering all variants of the Model 3 and Model Y for sale in Thailand:
The Model 3 starts at ฿1,759,000 in Thailand, which is the equivalent of about $50,000 USD and fairly competitive compared to other luxury EVs in the market.
The Model Y starts ฿1,959,000, or about $58,000 USD.
Interestingly, while Tesla is starting to take orders through the new configurator, the automaker doesn’t list expected delivery windows in the country.
While we don’t know when official deliveries from Tesla will start in Thailand, there are already a decent number of Tesla electric vehicles in the country. 
They have been imported privately by the owners – and that’s a factor that Tesla takes into account when considering entering a new market. If many people are willing to go through the trouble of importing the vehicle, there’s a good chance that there’s a market for its vehicles in the country.
We even reported on the Thai police buying a fleet of Tesla Model 3 vehicles for police patrol back in 2020, pictured above.
The Thai auto market is more significant than most people would think. More than 750,000 cars were sold in the market last year, and it is expected to ramp up to 800K–900K this year. However, most of those vehicles are not in the same price range as Tesla vehicles.
Thailand is also a vehicle assembly hub with up to two million vehicles produced locally per year.

2022/12/06,"Tesla told the FCC that it plans to market a new radar starting next month. The move raises even more concerns about potentially needed updates to its hardware suite to achieve the promised self-driving capability.
Since 2016, Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles produced going forward have “all the needed hardware” to become self-driving with future software updates.
It turned out not to be true. 
Tesla already had to upgrade its onboard computer and cameras in earlier vehicles, and it has yet to achieve self-driving capability. Its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software is still in beta and doesn’t enable fully autonomous driving.
The automaker not only had to upgrade its hardware in some cases, but it even removed some hardware. First, it was the front-facing radar and more recently the ultrasonic sensors.
It’s all part of its “Tesla Vision” approach where the automaker believes that the best way to achieve self-driving capability is through cameras being the only sensors. The logic is that the roads are designed to be operated by humans who operate cars through vision (eyes) and biological neural nets (brain).
Tesla believes that the best way to replicate that is through cameras to replace the eyes and neural nets running on a computer to replace the brain.
The company removed the radars on its vehicles last year and the ultrasonic sensors earlier this year.
That’s why it was surprising earlier this year when we reported on Tesla filing with the FCC to use a new radar in its vehicles. The FCC had granted a confidential treatment to Tesla in order not to release the details of the new radar.
Those confidential treatments are generally good for six months, and it was coming up tomorrow, but Tesla has filed an extension:
@greentheonly Tesla is requesting short term confidentiality extension in HD radar documents, as it will be marketed Mid January. Any hints about this seen in code? pic.twitter.com/XzAStuPgZh
In the request, Tesla confirms that it plans to start marketing the new device in “mid-January.”
Tesla CEO Elon Musk told Electrek in June of last year after Tesla stopped using its radar:
The probability of safety will be higher with pure vision than vision+radar, not lower. Vision has become so good that radar actually reduces signal/noise.
However, the CEO also added that Tesla might still use radar if it had a “very high-resolution radar”:
A very high resolution radar would be better than pure vision, but such a radar does not exist. I mean vision with high res radar would be better than pure vision.
We saw some indications of Tesla working on that. We previously reported on Tesla looking to add a new “4D” imaging radar with twice the range of its previous radar.
Last weekend, we also reported on a Tesla Model 3 prototype that potentially featured a new Autopilot/Full Self-Driving hardware suite.
It looks like what Musk told us last year might be happening and Tesla is getting ready to put a more advanced radar inside its vehicles, and potentially a whole new sensor suite based on the Model 3 prototype.
I never understood the vision-only approach. If the point of autopilot is to be safer than humans, the system has to exceed human capabilities. My Tesla has AP1, which is radar-based, and it is extra reassuring to know that, while I am the one supplying the eyes, the car may be able to see what I can't.
There’s also the possibility that Tesla is referring to an in-cabin radar, which the company has introduced in the Model S before, but considering that the application is talking about an “HD radar,” it seems more likely that it is for driver-assist features.
Tesla was always going to keep improving its Autopilot/self-driving hardware so there’s nothing wrong with what’s happening, but it still feeds into the growing concerns that Tesla can’t achieve its promised self-driving capability with the current hardware.
So there’s a possibility that Tesla is going to unveil a new suite of self-driving hardware next month that just improves the capability and Tesla still plans to deliver self-driving on the current hardware.
But I think there’s room for concerns after Tesla has been wrong about self-driving several times already. It might be wrong about the current vehicles being able to achieve it.

2022/12/06,"Elon Musk told President Biden that Tesla is opening its Supercharger network, but the plan has been unclear since Tesla opened its charge connector.
Over the last year, Tesla has been working to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles.
In Europe, Tesla has already opened hundreds of stations in most countries it operates in. The automaker indicated that it planned to do the same by the end of the year in North America, but it has yet to do it. 
At first, we thought it was due to the added complexity of not having CCS connectors on its Superchargers as it does in Europe, but Tesla recently made the situation murkier by proposing its own connector as a new charging standard in North America.
It seemed like Tesla was going to offer CCS to Tesla adapters to non-Tesla EV owners or incorporate CCS adapters at its Supercharger stations.
The open-sourcing of its connector has now cast some doubts on those plans.
This weekend, President Biden tweeted about the US government’s plan to help build 500,000 charging stations:
We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country. The great American road trip will be fully electrified.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded by saying “or you can just buy a Tesla”:
Or you can just buy a Tesla
Musk seems to imply that Tesla’s Supercharger network already enables “the great American road trip,” which is a fair point considering that there are not many regions of the United States you can’t access with Tesla’s charging network.
Then the CEO added that Tesla still plans to “enable other EVs to use Tesla Superchargers”:
Worth mentioning that Tesla has open-sourced its charge connector and is enabling other EVs to use Tesla Superchargers
Musk confirms that opening the Supercharger network to other EVs is still in the plan, but it’s still unclear how it will happen.
As we previously reported, Biden’s federal government is now offering billions of dollars in incentives for companies to build charging stations to achieve the 500,000 stations goal that he mentioned. In order to be eligible, companies need to deploy stations available to EV models from more than one automaker – which is why Tesla needs to open up its network.
We don't know how difficult it is to add CCS1 to superchargers. We also don't know how difficult it would be to make a Tesla -> CCS1 adapter to purchase. I suspect  both are  viable plans. Tesla owners can now purchase a CCS1 adapter if they feel the need.

Even if the Tesla connector becomes the standard, it will take a while for existing auto makers to redesign, not to mention the already on the road EVs. The quickest solution (and most profitable for Tesla) would be to make the adapter. Many non-Tesla's would jump at the chance to use that network.
Based on Musk’s comment, it sounds like the open-sourcing of the connector and the plan to give access to the Supercharger network to other EVs are two separate things, which is my hope.
Some suggested that Tesla’s opening of its charge connector could replace the plan since Tesla would be technically “opening its Supercharger to non-Tesla EVs” as long as they use its connector, which is now the open-source North American Charging Standard.
And Tesla only needs a single automaker to take it up on the offer for its new Supercharger to get access to the new federal funding that President Biden is talking about in that tweet.
Right now, I still think Tesla plans to do both, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye on.

2022/12/06,"Tesla Gigafactory Berlin is reportedly in “total chaos,” according to a factory employee talking to Wired in a report highlighting labor issues at the factory.
The automaker is currently trying to simultaneously ramp up production at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin, both massive factories by any standard.
Tesla plans to have over 10,000 workers at each plant.
Hiring efforts on that scale are extremely difficult to execute, and now Wired reports that Tesla “can’t hire enough people, or keep them” at Gigafactory Berlin.
The publication describes a situation where Tesla has issues filing positions, retaining employees, and a high level of absenteeism at the factory. 
One employee told Wired:
One current employee, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing their job, describes the Berlin gigafactory as “chaos.” “Some people are off sick longer than they’ve actually worked. There are people who I haven’t seen working for three weeks in six months. Many people are signed off sick because the motivation isn’t there,” they say, blaming poor working conditions. The exits involve temporary staff and permanent employees who have been there for over a year, hired before the gigafactory opened, they claim. 
Tesla reportedly has 7,500 employees working at Gigafactory Berlin, and it currently has almost 400 open positions at the plant.
Interestingly, Tesla has gone outside of Germany to try to fill positions – almost 10% of workers are from outside the country, mostly from Poland. Gigafactory Berlin is only about an hour away from the German/Polish border.
Tesla is currently trying to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model Y vehicles per week at the factory, a goal that Tesla has been aiming to achieve by the end of the year.
In October, Tesla confirmed that it achieved a production of 2,000 units per week, but it hasn’t updated the production capacity since.
Germany has much higher labor standards than Tesla is used to. What worker's are willing to put up with in China and even the US, just won't fly in Germany.
I wouldn’t worry too much about this. It’s hard to overstate just how difficult it is to hire over 10,000 people in any location over a relatively short period – only a few years in this case.
You are going to run into a lot of growing pains.
However, the results need to be there. I wouldn’t be shocked if Tesla doesn’t achieve its goal of 5,000 units per week by the end of the year, but it needs to be closer to it than 2,000 units.
I would expect Tesla to release an update on the production rate by the end of the year.

2022/12/05,"The Tesla blogosphere is on fire today with the idea that Tesla revealed the design of a smaller two-door Cybertruck, but I am skeptical.
Not long after unveiling the Cybertruck prototype in 2019, Musk started talking about making the electric pickup smaller to fit inside a regular garage.
In 2020, the CEO was asked what the biggest change is to Cybertruck from the prototype, and he responded that Tesla “reduced the size by ~3%,” made the “center line more level,” and “lowered the window sill height.”
However, those plans were reportedly scrapped soon after as Tesla finalized the design. Instead, Musk hinted at a future version of the truck that could be smaller.
Now the Tesla blogosphere thinks that the automaker hid the design of that future version of the truck in plain site through its exhibition at the Petersen Museum:
Are we not going to talk about the beautiful artwork of a two door Cybertruck displayed at the @Petersen_Museum Tesla exhibit? 😍😍😍 pic.twitter.com/8oECERqfr4
Based on this tweet, several outlets are suggesting that Tesla might have revealed the design on a 2-door Cybertruck.
The design shown in the drawing is nearly identical to the original Cybertruck prototype.
I don’t think that design drawing is any indication of a future version of the Cybertruck. I am not saying that Tesla wouldn’t eventually release a smaller, or even two-door, Cybertruck, but I don’t think that’s it.
It is not uncommon for designers to produce design drawings without an accurate representation of the doors. Those sketches are generally more about the lines of the vehicle.
First they start making the long awaited CT. Then we'll talk about a possible smaller version of it.
And that’s something Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief designer, is known to do. Here are some of the original Tesla Model 3 design sketches:
Therefore, I would bet that the Tesla Cybertruck sketch is just one of the original sketches from when Tesla was designing the electric pickup truck and not a hint at an upcoming new version.
That said, I’m all for a smaller version of the Cybertruck – though maybe not a two-door. I’d be interested in something Ford Maverick sized, which is still a four-door.
What do you think about a smaller Tesla Cybertruck? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/12/05,"Tesla (TSLA) achieved record deliveries and exports in China in November with over 100,000 China-made vehicles in a single month.
However, reports are suggesting that Tesla is now slowing down its production output at Gigafactory Shanghai due to lower demand in China.
Update: Tesla China is now denying the reports of production slow down in Shanghai.
The China Passenger Car Association released its November data and confirmed that Tesla delivered 100,291 China-made cars in November.
That’s a significant new output capacity out of Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai.
Output is up almost 90% year-over-year and 40% month-over-month.
It should have been good news for Tesla this morning, but the company’s stock (TSLA) is down in pre-market trading because the release of the November data was accompanied by two reports claiming that Tesla is cutting down the output in December due to lower demand in China.
Bloomberg reported:
The output cuts will take effect as soon as this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. They estimate the move could reduce production by about 20%.
Reuters also came out with a similar report based on its own source – though it also references Bloomberg‘s report.
The publications are linking the reduction in planned production output out of Gigafactory Shanghai to Tesla’s demand in China softening.
We reported in October that Tesla reduced the price of the Model 3 and Model Y in China and launched a new referral program – a first sign that demand wasn’t where Tesla needed it to be.
Later, the automaker also launched a new cash rebate with its insurance partners in China.
The moves led to several reports last month claiming that Tesla’s Chinese demand was significantly down, but the automaker tried to squash the rumors.
There are still severe covid lockdowns in several parts of China, I would imagine that some of the potential Chinese Tesla buyers have other things on their mind.  
Maybe some of these cars could actually make it to places such as Austrailia?
Gigafactory Shanghai now officially has an output of 100,000 electric vehicles per month, which is absolutely insane. That’s 1.2 million vehicles per year virtually two years after starting production.
It would be a bummer if it had to already throttle that capacity down due to demand. 
But I’d take the reports with a grain of salt. When it comes to China, we have seen the information get quite murky before it arrives here. 
With that said, there have been some clear signs of Tesla trying to create more demand in China. Therefore, it’s not impossible that it is having some demand issues in the country at the moment. Enough to cut production by 20%? Production it could also export to other markets? I don’t know.

2022/12/04,"A new Tesla Model 3 prototype with camouflage has been spotted in California ahead of a rumored refresh coming next year.
Over the last week, there have been rumors that Tesla is working on a Model 3 refresh that would come during the second half of 2023.
The project is reportedly codenamed “Highland.”
For a few years now, Tesla has been integrating its large casting technology into Model Y with single large casting parts replacing dozens of parts in the electric SUV.
This new technology has enabled Tesla to greatly improve manufacturing efficiency with the Model Y compared to Model 3. CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla will bring the same technology to Model 3 eventually, but he couldn’t exactly say when.
The problem is that such an update to the Model 3 would temporarily slow down production, and Tesla couldn’t afford that while it was still ramping up Model Y production. However, Model Y production is now starting to exceed Model 3 production, and it could be good timing for Tesla to update the Model 3 using the technology. 
Now a new Model 3 prototype has been spotted in Santa Cruz, California, by Twitter user omg_Tesla/Rivian:
The Model 3 is equipped with manufacturer plates, which would indicate that it is owned by Tesla, and combined with the heavy camouflage in the front and back of the vehicle, it likely points to the automaker testing an updated version of the electric sedan.
However, not much can be discerned from the pictures thanks to the camouflage, which even covers large parts of the headlights.
I don't think it's a refresh. It looks identical to my Model 3. A new Autopilot sensor suite is more likely.
Nonetheless, some commenters on Twitter did notice what could potentially be a camera embedded in the corner of the front right headlight:
It’s barely visible and therefore unconfirmed, but it would make sense to place a camera around that spot since Tesla’s current self-driving sensor suite has a blind spot around the bumper. It could also help with the creeping forward to see traffic before taking a turn in Full Self-Driving – something FSD Beta has issues with right now.
Tesla has always said that it would keep improving its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving hardware, but current owners who bought vehicles with the promise that self-driving will be enabled through software updates are concerned that Tesla might find that it would need a new sensor suite to achieve the promise.
What do you think about this Tesla Model 3 prototype? Is the camouflage hiding a Model 3 design refresh? A new Autopilot sensor suite? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

2022/12/03,"Tesla Semi could make an awesome electric motorhome based on the specs released by Tesla this week and how incredible these renders of the electric truck look as a motorhome.
There’s something about the idea of an all-electric and solar-powered motorhome that is extremely attractive to many people.
During the day, you drive without emissions and can power your life from the same battery pack that moves you around. At night, you can charge up in order to do it all over again the next day.
With solar power, you can also take the entire experience off-grid.
There are a few electric motorhome projects that are looking to deliver that kind of experience to customers, but most of them are still in the concept stage or have a very limited range.
We recently reported on the new Mercedes-Benz eSprinter having impressive enough specs to potentially enable an electric “vanlife”, but what if you need, or want, something bigger?
Tesla Semi could make for an interesting platform for an electric motorhome.
The team at Jowua, an interior accessory maker, thought so while watching the unveiling of the production version of Tesla Semi this week and decided to build renders of what a Tesla Semi motorhome could look like: 
That’s pretty badass-looking and the electric truck as the specs to back up that look.
The biggest problem with most of the electric motorhome projects right now is that they have a limited range. For example, Winnebago built its own full-size electric motorhome, but it only has 125 miles of range.
With the unveiling of the production version this week, Tesla confirmed that the Tesla Semi has a roughly 900 kWh battery pack and can travel more than 500 miles with a full load at 82,000 lbs total.
And the Tesla Semi would likely achieve an even greater range as a motorhome since it would likely be lighter than 82,000 lbs. Some of the heaviest 40+ feet-long motorhomes today rarely weigh more than 50,000 lbs. Tesla Semi is heavier than most class 8 trucks, but there should be a way to build a motorhome on the platform and keep the weight under 70,000 lbs, which should result in efficiency gains.
You could likely drive over 600 miles in a single day in a Tesla Semi motorhome without charging and then charge overnight. You’d be able to cover impressive distances in just a few days. All without emissions.
My experience towing a small camper is that air resistance is the main factor in setting efficiency, not weight, so I would expect the range to be no more than the semi it’s based on unless they do something to make the rear of the motor home more aerodynamic. 
Jowua also produced a render of the interior of their vision of a Tesla Semi motorhome:
It would probably require some cooperation from Tesla, but there should be a way to power the living features of the motorhome with the powertrain’s battery pack. You add some deployable solar panels for when you are parked for extended periods of time and you are in business.
If Tesla doesn’t do it, I am sure that other companies will decide to build electric motorhomes based on the Tesla Semi – not unlike what Cyberlandr is trying to do with the Tesla Cybertruck.
In the same vein, famous DJ and music producer Deadmau5 said that he would buy a Tesla Semi and turn it into a travelling music studio.

2022/12/03,"At the unveiling of the production version of the Tesla Semi, the automaker announced a lot of things about the electric truck, but it didn’t say a word about it being equipped with Autopilot/Full Self-Driving technology.
That’s despite being equipped with the needed hardware.
When Tesla first announced the Tesla Semi in 2017, the automaker was still early in its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving efforts, but the automaker had already announced that all production vehicles going forward will eventually be capable of self-driving with future software updates.
The automaker didn’t go as far as talking about self-driving when it comes to the Tesla Semi, but the company did announce at the time that it will be equipped with Enhanced Autopilot.
That was the slide from the original presentation to unveil the electric truck:
Along with the safety features that Autopilot can enable, Tesla had also announced that Tesla Semi would be able to achieve a sort of convoy mode where you can get several semi trucks to follow each other closely autonomously on the highway.
Here’s the quick video demo of the feature that it released at the time:
5 years later and now that the production version of the Tesla Semi has been unveiled, Tesla has removed all mention of the electric truck being equipped with Autopilot or this convoy mode from its website.
Tesla also didn’t mention anything related to advanced driver-assist features during its presentation about the production version of the Tesla Semi.
While Tesla didn’t mention anything about it, it looks like the hardware is there to make it happen. Minimal Duck posted a video on Youtube giving a close look at the Tesla Semi trucks at the event and they were equipped with a wide array of cameras.
First off, there are 3 cameras on each side mirror:
One of them is used to feed the side views inside the vehicle and we expect that Tesla’s goal is to eventually be able to remove the mirror part of the side mirror to only use the camera feed and improve the aerodynamic performance.
Here you can see the side camera feeds inside the Tesla Semi cockpit:
As for the other two cameras on the side mirrors, they look like they are the equivalent of the fender and B pillar cameras in the Autopilot sensor suite found on Tesla’s passenger vehicles.
Tesla also appears to have integrated the same 3-camera array found at the top of the windshield of passenger vehicles in the Tesla Semi:
Therefore, it looks like Tesla has recreated its suite of Autopilot/FSD cameras in its passenger cars in the new electric truck.
Tesla also appears to have added a camera in the front bumper of the Tesla Semi:
In conclusion, it looks like Tesla has integrated its Autopilot/FSD hardware suite into the Tesla Semi, but it is not talking about enabling self-driving capacity like it is in its passenger vehicles.
I might have an idea why Tesla doesn’t want to talk too much about Autopilot or self-driving when it comes to Tesla Semi since right now, and likely for the foreseeable future, it is going to need truck drivers to get on board with the vehicle.
That might be more difficult to achieve if you talk about eventually replacing them with features already existing inside the electric truck. 
""However, according to American Trucking Associations (ATA) there are not enough drivers to go around. In fact, according to a 2021 report, the truck driver shortage hit a historic high last year, with 80,000 more drivers needed on the road in order to provide the optimal labor force to meet demand from shippers.""

I'm not sure why all the concern about putting truckers out of work. There is obviously a massive shortage... and it's only getting worse, with an annual turnover rate of 22%. I'd be more concerned about supply chain labor shortages than self-driving trucks. The latter will end up being a solution to the former...
That’s not really transparent, but it’s business.
Either way, I think truck drivers don’t have too much to worry about for a long time. Not only is Tesla’s  Full Self-Driving clearly not ready to have no one behind the wheel, but truck drivers also do more than just drive. They have responsibilities where they get their load and where they deliver and in between that have yet to be automated.
I think that for years to come, truck drivers will see some tasks related to their job being automated, including driving to some degree, but they will still be needed for likely more than a decade in my opinon..
If anything, I see Tesla Semi making truck driving an even more fun job.

2022/12/03,"Tesla has started to push a new software update to its fleet in order to improve Sentry Mode, a surveillance system built into its vehicles.
Tesla’s Sentry Mode is an integrated surveillance system inside Tesla’s vehicles using the Autopilot cameras around the car – it has been game-changing when it comes to vandalizing parked cars.
It builds on TeslaCam, an integrated dashcam system.
On several occasions, Sentry Mode videos went viral, and the vandals turned themselves in after the online pressure. In other cases, it helped police with video evidence to help them identify and find the vandals.
But it has also been capturing footage of strange events around Tesla vehicles and impressive moments showcasing the performance of Tesla’s vehicles. We built a list of some of those moments a few years ago.
Tesla has also been building on the feature to release new ones – most recently, a new live camera view feature.
Now Tesla is bringing more customization and new features to Sentry Mode through a new software update (2022.44.2) being pushed to the fleet.
The automaker wrote in the release notes (via NotATeslaApp):
Sentry Mode now allows for even greater customization, including:
— Camera-Based Detection, which allows users to disable use of cameras to detect threats.
— Sentry Mode Clip Length, which allows users to specify the length of the clip when a potential threat is detected.
To adjust these Sentry Mode settings, tap Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode.
The next feature is actually something that I thought Sentry Mode was already doing, but apparently, it wasn’t.
Tesla wrote in the notes:
When Camera-Based Detection is enabled, Sentry Mode will use the vehicle’s external cameras in addition to vehicle sensors to detect a security event while parked. If disabled, the vehicle will only save clips to the USB drive if a physical threat is detected. To adjust, tap Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode > Camera-Based Detection.
It might have to do with Tesla basically getting rid of all sensors other than its cameras recently.
The update also brings improvements to its automatic seat belt tightening based on Tesla Vision and the new energy app to more cars.
It also adds Thai to the language supported by the user interface, as Tesla is about to launch in Thailand.

2022/12/02,"Elon Musk has confirmed Tesla Semi’s efficiency at 1.7 kWh per mile, which means it has a roughly 900 kWh battery pack. It’s an important piece of information, but there are still more questions to answer before Tesla Semi can officially be a truly disruptive product.
Yesterday, Tesla unveiled the production version of its Tesla Semi class 8 electric truck and delivered the first units.
At the event, Tesla described an electric truck that could truly disrupt the trucking industry.
However, we noted that there were a few pieces of information that Tesla omitted from the event that could really be major difference makers.
The two main ones are the weight of the actual truck and its price:
After digesting yesterday's Tesla Semi presentation, Tesla has potentially a massively disrupting product on its hands, but it omitted two things that need to be confirmed to make it official: weight of the tractor and its price. I wish I could ask Tesla or Elon about it…
The trucking industry is all about the economics of moving products by the pound. The main thing that will drive that is the cost of operation per mile, which is mainly affected by the vehicle’s efficiency.
Tesla has already reported an efficiency under 2 kWh per mile which is impressive, but not exactly clear when you are trying to determine your cost per mile for electricity.
On Twitter last night, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that it is 1.7 kWh per mile. That’s more precise, and truck operators can input their electricity rates to get an idea of fuel costs and savings compared to diesel.
It also gives us an idea of the Tesla Semi’s battery pack. It’s not perfect since we don’t have the exact range of the truck. At 500 miles, which Tesla claims, that’s 850 kWh, but the pack generally has a buffer, and based on the 500-mile trip it completed, it looks like the electric truck might have some more in it. 
Now what we need to know is how much cargo can a Tesla Semi carry. A class 8 truck fully loaded needs to weigh 80,000 pounds or less as per regulations, but electric trucks have been allowed an extra 2,000 pounds.
In order to know that, we need to know the weight of the truck itself. You have to deduct the weight of the trailer, which is about 10,000 pounds for a 53-foot trailer, and the weight of the truck from the 82,000-pound limit.
Tesla says that it will roughly have the same capacity as a diesel truck, but diesel tractors have a wide range of weight from roughly 12,000 to 25,000 pounds. The Tesla Semi’s power would certainly need to be compared more to the higher end of that range, but at the end of the day, trucking companies want as much cargo capacity as possible.
The automaker hasn’t confirmed the weight of the Tesla Semi, but we can deduce from its load test with concrete blocks that it is around 27,000 pounds, but that’s unconfirmed at this point.
That’s not the best, but it would still give the Tesla Semi the capacity to move about 45,000 pounds of cargo, which still makes the vehicle super useful. Also, it is safe to assume that the number will improve greatly over the years as battery technology improves.
But nonetheless, it would be useful if Tesla could confirm the weight of the Tesla Semi.
Then we need the actual price of the truck. In 2017, Tesla said the trucks would be $150,000, $180,000, and $200,000, depending on the model, but those prices are expected to have changed over the last five years.
Those prices with that capacity would make the Tesla Semi revolutionary since it would pay itself back in about three years just from fuel savings in most markets, but we don’t know that for a fact without the official price.
This is pretty wild. We are super close to being able to confirm that the Tesla Semi can change the entire paradigm of the trucking industry, but Tesla just needs to release a few more pieces of information to make it happen.
The biggest “tell”, and the only thing that matters is if buyers buy them.  Semi does not need to haul the same weight.  If the truck meets the needs of the buyer for range / load / cost / specs / features / convenience … that is all that matters.  
The fact that Tesla doesn’t let the press into its events and only superfans is really a bad look for the company at this point. Yes, the press can be annoying, even malicious in some cases, and I don’t say they should let those people in, but there are also plenty of people whose goal is just to keep their readers as best informed as possible, and they would ask important questions at those events that need answering – questions that a lot of fans don’t bother asking. Everything Musk says is good enough for them.
I can’t ask any of those questions because Tesla doesn’t have a PR department, and the only official comments you can get these days are from Musk on Twitter, where he blocks me and surrounds himself with sycophants:
This is basically confirmed now. Here's the chronology:1- Elon announced a wave spam accounts being banned.2- Several of his top supporters get banned because they are indistinguishable from bots by the algo.3- Elon personally looks into it and reinstate the accounts. https://t.co/aCjnSgmNnt
This is just not how a company that aims to be transparent should operate. And obviously, I’m not talking about trade secrets here.
Anyway, the rant is over. I hope Tesla is going to release that information soon, and if it is on the right side, I’ll be the first to celebrate Tesla revolutionizing the trucking industry.

2022/12/01,"Tesla delivered its first Tesla Semi electric trucks to customers and revealed details of its production version of the vehicle – delivering on a five-year-old promise.
Today, the company held its Tesla Semi Delivery Event in Nevada.
As expected, Tesla delivered the first electric trucks to PepsiCo, a long-time reservation holder, and held a presentation to reveal more details about the production version of the Tesla Semi.
There wasn’t any big surprise during the presentation.
Tesla basically delivered on its original promises made in 2017 when it first unveiled the prototypes of the Tesla Semi.
Despite the lack of major changes, it’s still a big moment since the electric truck has the potential to change the trucking industry for good by eliminating emissions and significantly reducing costs.
The company started out by explaining why it is moving from making consumer electric vehicles to an electric class 8 truck. That’s pretty simple: Even if semi-trucks only account for about 1% of vehicles in the US, they account for about 20% of emissions:
Obviously, battery-electric class 8 trucks have an opportunity to greatly reduce those numbers.
But they need to be just as, if not more, capable than diesel semi-trucks in order to take over the market, and that’s exactly what Tesla claims to be delivering.
In terms of the technology powering the truck, things have changed since the original prototypes, but not in any major ways.
Tesla is now using a tri-motor drivetrain that is basically the same as in the Model S and Model X Plaid. 
Dan Priestley, Tesla Semi Program manager, explained that Tesla is using one of the motors for cruising speed geared toward peak efficiency at highway speeds and the two other motors are used for torque when accelerating in order to create a smooth driving experience never seen in a class 8 truck before.
To prove the capacity, Tesla shared a very impressive video of a Tesla Semi loaded at 82,000 lb. passing a diesel truck at 6% incline on the Donner Pass as if it’s nothing:
I've watched this like 10 times. Anyone who knows anything about trucks can tell this is extremely impressive acceleration with 80,000 lbs in a 6% incline. pic.twitter.com/cZzhLaZ3n6
Okay, it’s powerful, but can it travel long distances? Well, yes it can. Tesla promised a range of 500 miles with a full load five years ago, and it delivered on the promise.
Tesla shared data on a 500-mile trip with a full load of just under 82,000 lb. total with the tractor. It started out in the Bay Area with a 97% state of charge and ended up in San Diego with still 4% charge:
Tesla reiterated that it can achieve a less-than-2 kWh-per-mile efficiency, which means that trucking companies can achieve up to $70,000 in fuel savings per year depending on their cost of electricity.
Once the battery pack is depleted after 500 miles or so, you can expect blazing-fast charging thanks to the new 1-megawatt charging technology developed by Tesla. The automaker also said it will make it to the Cybertruck.
I felt like I was back in 2012 with the event as Elon Musk was again listing some basic benefits of electric vehicles that people coming from internal combustion engines wouldn’t necessarily be familiar with, like truck drivers who haven’t had the opportunity to go electric just yet.
Things like regenerative braking, which can greatly improve safety in trucks, and the millisecond reaction time of electric motors, resulting in greater traction control.
Tesla also unveiled several quality-of-life features for Tesla Semi drivers like an automatic suspension dump for easy latching to trailers, a cabin that you can stand in, and easy light checks for inspections.
There’s no doubt that the interior of the vehicle is cool and quite a change compared to most diesel trucks on the market today.
Now these machines are in the hands of customers for the first time starting with Pepsico/Frito Lay.
There was no major surprise out of the event aside from maybe that the Cybertruck will have the same charging technology, but that’s not really about the Tesla Semi.
It felt like it was more about delivering on the promises made five years ago, and they mostly did that, to their credit.
There are only two major points that Tesla didn’t discuss that I think are important and we should know about: the price and the weight.
Tesla didn’t update the price, which originally was $200,000. I have a feeling that it might have changed after five years, but no word from Tesla about it.
Quite a bit changed on the Tesla Semi from 5 years ago.  Originally, it was four Model 3 motors each driving a pair of drive wheels on one side of the semi.  Model 3 motors are 400v systems.  All the motors were continuously engaged with their respective drive axle via a simple gear reduction.  

Now we see a 1000v system with one motor continuously engaged with a drive axle that drives both sides of the semi, and two motors with disengagement clutches each driving only one side of the semi.  The disengagement clutches allow those motors to stop turning when the semi is at constant highway speed.  This allows higher efficiency of operation.  The two motors on separate axles is necessary to provide the anti-jack-knife capability by varying the regen force on each side of the semi to counteract the jack-knife forces.

What is still unclear to me is if the Tesla charging system is not compatible with the MCS (Megawatt Charging System) that CharIn finalized earlier this year.  It seems to me that Tesla went its own way on the chargers but I'm not completely sure since the MCS system does support 1000v systems.

500 real world travel miles at full load capacity is quite an accomplishment.  Trucking will change for the better with this new reality.
The other thing is the weight of the actual tractor, which is critical since the weight of the tractor dictates the weight of the load and the load is the trucking business. How much a truck can carry means how much money a trip can make up to a certain degree.
Class 8 trucks have a total limit (truck plus trailer with load) of 80,000 lb. and the tractor itself weighs between 12,000 and 25,000 lb. depending on the model. The difference is what it can carry.
Tesla only mentioned a total weight of 82,000 lb. (electric trucks are allowed an extra 2,000 lb.) during the event, but it never confirmed the weight of the Tesla Semi or load capacity. It would be important information to have.
Aside from the lack of those two important pieces of information, I feel like the event was impressive and Tesla might have a new very disruptive product on its hands.

2022/12/01,"With the unveiling of the Tesla Semi, the automaker confirmed that Tesla Cybertruck will also take advantage of the company’s 1 MW ultra-fast charging technology.
At today’s Tesla Semi Delivery Event, the automaker didn’t roll out a new Roadster from the back of a Tesla Semi as it did at the truck’s original unveiling five years ago, but there was still a “one more thing” moment during the event.
Tesla unveiled its new 1 MW DC fast-charging technology for the Tesla Semi.
We already knew that Tesla had a ~1 MW charging tech for the Tesla Semi, but at the event today, Tesla announced its new “immersion cooling technology” that enables it to achieve a much higher output in the same small form factor:
That’s massively impressive in itself, but also much needed for a large semi truck with a massive battery pack.
The big news was that Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed during the event that it will also be used by Cybertruck:
It will be used by Cybertruck too.
Dan Priestley, Tesla Semi Program manager, added:
This is coming to our Superchargers next year.
Recent plans for new Supercharger stations did show stalls dedicated to pickup trucks; now it sounds like those stalls will have a much higher capacity. It appears to be linked to Tesla’s new Supercharger V4.
Sorry Fred, but I disagree.  I heard that the cybertruck was getting the 1000v architecture (which is what the semi is using and MCS chargers off of).  So v4 will use 1000v to supercharge the cybertruck on, but NOT at 1MW, probably more like 500kw, since that's double v2.
During the event, Tesla also confirmed that the new 1,000-volt powertrain in the Tesla Semi will make it to other vehicle programs – without confirming that it will include the Cybertruck.
That’s big news – although not entirely clear. While the new technology enables over 1 MW charging, Musk didn’t make it clear if the Cybertruck would be able to achieve that or if it would just use the same technology.
It’s not impossible that it could, but it would probably be for only a short period of time at low states of charge.
Nonetheless, it means that we can expect blazing-fast charging speeds from the Tesla Cybertruck when it comes to market next year, and Tesla adds this new technology to not only its new charging stations for Tesla Semi for commercial purposes but also to Supercharger stations for regular Tesla drivers.

2022/12/01,"Tesla is holding its “Tesla Semi Delivery Event” today at 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) to deliver the first electric truck to customers. The company is also expected to have a presentation about the production version of the truck.
Here’s our news hub for the event, where you can watch the livestream and get updates.
Three years late, but it is now here. Tesla is going to deliver the first production version of the Tesla Semi electric truck to customers – to PepsiCo, to be more specific.
The Tesla Semi was first unveiled in 2017, and it was supposed to enter production in 2020, but it was delayed several times.
Now the automaker is finally ready to make the first deliveries after having started low-volume production at a facility outside of Gigafactory Nevada in October.
Today, Tesla is expected to deliver the first few units to Pepsi. After the launch of Tesla Semi in 2017, PepsiCo placed one of the biggest orders for Tesla Semi – 100 electric trucks to add to its fleet. The company planned to use 15 of those trucks for a project to turn its Frito-Lay Modesto, California, site into a zero-emission facility. Last year, PepsiCo said that it expected to take deliveries of those 15 Tesla Semi trucks by the end of the year before it was delayed again.
On top of the first deliveries, Tesla is expected to give an update on the specs and pricing of the electric truck, which are expected to be updated from the original 2017 unveiling.
Only in America do we embark on such a major technology and sustainability leap, beginning with delivering soda and potato chips.
Those are the base expectations for the event, but there could also be a few surprises since Tesla used the original Tesla Semi unveiling for a surprise unveiling of the Tesla Roaster.
We never know.
Here we are going to share posts based on the most important news coming out of the Tesla Semi Delivery Event:
It looks like Tesla has at least 5 Tesla Semi electric trucks at the event. 3 white trucks, one with Pepsi and one with Frito-Lays branding. Event starts in 20 mins #TeslaSemi https://t.co/Hw0hiHi3ki

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/12/01,"Tesla (TSLA) is giving a $3,750 discount, which it is calling a “price adjustment,” for every Model 3 and Model Y vehicle delivered in the US in December.
The move appears to be to encourage people to take delivery right now rather than wait for the tax credit to take effect in 2023.
Yesterday, we reported that Tesla is seeing some level of cancellation in the US right now for two main reasons:
We also noted that while there are signs of demand issues leading to Tesla not matching vehicles to buyers at the end of the quarter, it shouldn’t be a massive problem unless we see Tesla reduce the price of its vehicles.
Today, Electrek learned from sources familiar with the matter that it is offering “a $3,750 credit” for every customer taking delivery of a Model 3 or Model Y vehicle in the US in December.
Tesla communicated to its sales staff that the offer is temporary and only for customers taking delivery this month.
This amount happens to be half the $7,500 tax credit that is going to go into effect next month. Some automakers anticipate their electric vehicles to only be eligible for half the tax credit due to battery material and assembly origin requirements.
Tesla appears to be encouraging people to take delivery this month rather than wait for the tax credit in order not to be sitting on a lot of unsold inventory at the end of the quarter.
This is an unusual move for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has often stated that Tesla “doesn’t offer discounts” and that its policy is to have consistent and transparent pricing across all markets.
I would be shocked if Tesla or any other manufacturer escapes the effects of elevated interest rates, the prospect of a looming recession (arguably already taking place), growing layoffs, and inflation.  I work for a national homebuilder and we have been heavily incentivizing our homes recently to get every sale we can (and believe me,  there are hardly any as of late).  I would not bee too worried about a demand problem at Tesla.  I would be more worried about a general demand problem for ALL big ticket items being sold to consumers EVERYWHERE.  Tesla long term fundamentals are great,  but they are not going to be insulated from market forces.  That's also not a bad thing...its just the cyclical nature of the automotive industry or any industry that sells large ticket items that typically require a loan, proof of employment, etc.  What is important is to see just how well Tesla weathers the storm compared to a traditional automotive manufacturer. 
Well, I said not to worry about demand until Tesla starts to offer discounts. Here it is.
But again, I wouldn’t worry too much about it since it’s clearly due to special circumstances with the tax credit coming into effect.
Everything points to demand coming back in a big way next month when the tax credit comes into effect.
What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/12/01,"Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen gave a rare interview where he discussed the Cybertruck design and teased an upcoming new Tesla model.
At Tesla, it’s fairly rare for executives not named “Musk” to be authorized to talk to the media.
Franz von Holzhausen, who has been chief designer at Tesla for over a decade, is a rare exception as he sometimes gives out interviews. The chief designer gave an interview to CNBC where he discussed the Tesla Cybertruck’s design.
Here’s the video interview, and you can find some interesting quotes that we pulled below:
von Holzhausen confirmed that the truck’s radical design is the result of the manufacturing process that Tesla needs to adopt to build the electric truck with a stainless steel exoskeleton:
The Cybertruck is one of these rare moments where in a way, form followed function. A lot of times we put the form in front of the function. Especially in the automotive world. And it’s really tough to mix the two, but Cybertruck is really born out of the idea of a different way of manufacturing, a material that put toughness on the outside. So we really wanted to use stainless steel as a material so that the hardest part of the vehicle was on the outside, not the delicate paint. And it felt right for a truck that’s used in like a Swiss army knife in any kind of environment has to be tough.
The designer added about the limitations of stainless steel and how Tesla handled the design, despite those limitations:
So stainless steel is really tough to form, especially when you make it bulletproof or thicker to withstand impacts and not be damaged. And so we really looked at new ways of manufacturing. You could only break form and form it in one direction. You can’t do compound curves or things with the thickness of the stainless steel that we’re using. So it really led us to a design that was really planar, really simplistic, and it was also a chance to break the paradigm of what pickup trucks have been for the past 60 or 70 years. The same there’s kind of this three box shape, and we just thought from an aerodynamic perspective, having a covered back a sloping roof would also be helpful. And oddly enough, it may not look it, but the Cybertruck is an incredibly aerodynamic vehicle.
That’s fair, though I would add “for a pickup truck.”
von Holzhausen was asked about his favorite design at Tesla so far, and the designer said that it is “the one that’s coming,” but one that he “can’t talk about.”
I think I’m really tired about hearing about Robo taxis. Other than for companies, likely Lyft or Uber, or maybe even Tesla offering their own service, I just can’t see myself being interested in buying a car to create my own little taxi service. Plus, I think car is designed to be used as taxis should really be built for that specific function, like the English taxis. Boxy and square and easy to get in and out of. Nobody really cares what they look like. And have you ever ridden in a taxi in a major city like New York or Chicago? They all get pretty trashed on the inside. And not to mention the fact that by the time, TESLA does this, FSD will probably cost $25,000 or more. Add the cost of the car to that and who will be able to afford it just to run a taxi business to make extra money?
The next vehicle that Tesla is expected to unveil is its “robotaxi,” a new EV dedicated to self-driving and being used primarily as some kind of driverless Uber. 
Not much else is known about the vehicle, but CEO Elon Musk said that it will be “futuristic-looking.”
von Holzhausen also said that he is excited about the Cybertruck’s radical design being on the road as it should create some interesting visuals. Tesla is expected to bring the Cybertruck to production in mid-2023.
In terms of the production version, the chief designer said it will be extremely similar to the original prototype unveiled in 2019, except a few percentage points smaller.

2022/12/01,"Are we going to get a standards war in the EV space? I doubt it, but things are heating up between Tesla and CharIN, the association leading the CCS standard.
It’s awkward because Tesla is also part of the association.
Last month, Tesla surprised many by announcing that it is opening its EV charge connector with the aim of making it the new standard in North America.
The automaker is challenging the J1772/CCS combo connector, which has been adopted by virtually all other automakers selling vehicles in North America, in the hope that its sleeker and more powerful design will win by force of sheer numbers.
Tesla dominates the EV market in America to such a degree that even though all other automakers currently selling EVs on the market are using the J1772/CCS connector, there are still more EVs in North America using the Tesla connector, now known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
The Supercharger network is also undoubtedly the best and most extensive DC fast-charging network in the market.
These are good points for Tesla and NACS, but the automaker still faces an uphill battle to get the connector actually adopted as a standard, and now CharIN is entering the battle.
CharIN, or Charging Interface Initiative, is “an association with nearly 300 international members dedicated to promoting interoperability based on the Combined Charging System (CCS) and the Megawatt Charging System (MCS) as the global standard for charging vehicles of all kinds.”
Tesla, which has adopted CCS in Europe, is a member of the association – that is why it was sort of a surprise that after 10 years of selling cars with its own proprietary connector in North America and recently announcing that it will let non-Tesla CCS EVs on its Supercharger network, Tesla decided to now open its connector as a standard.
CharIN has now issued a statement about Tesla’s move to open the connector, and the association is clearly not happy with its member:
In response to Tesla’s announcement on November 11, 2022, to publicly release the North American Charging Standard (NACS), the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN e.V.) and its CharIN North America Chapter (operating as CharIN Inc.), would like to issue the following statement. CharIN is the largest global association focused on the electrification of all forms of transportation based on the seamless and interoperable charging experience enabled by the Combined Charging System (CCS) and the Megawatt Charging System (MCS). CCS and MCS are the global standards for charging vehicles of all kinds.
The association started out by congratulating Tesla for using DIN 70121 and ISO 15118-02 communication standards for the NACS and the company’s general contribution to electrification.
But it quickly scolds Tesla for moving away from CCS:
However, we encourage stakeholders to investigate ways to focus on market acceleration rather than the creation of yet another form factor alternative, which will lead to further consumer confusion and delay EV adoption. CCS has gone through many years of rigorous standardization processes, which is a required activity for any new standard proposal. After a decade of collaborative work, the domestic and international EV industry has aligned around CCS.
They added to the statement a list of reasons why the industry is backing CCS (I added some counterpoints in parentheses):
CharIN also suggests in its response to Tesla’s NACS that it will have difficulties passing the standard through standard bodies:

At a minimum, the Tesla proposal will have the hurdle of passing through an established standardization process via standards bodies, such as ISO, IEC, and/or SAE.
The association basically ends its statement by asking Tesla to come back into the fold with CharIN and CCS.
From a user perspective I certainly like the NACS experience better than my experiences with other standards especially when it comes to automatic payments and the whole seemless charger handshake experience. I also like the slim and light weight design of the NACS and its ability to deliver AC (like at home) or high power DC via the same connector.  NACS is truly “plug and play”.   I guess as long as CCS eventually becomes as seemless to use as NACS it won’t matter to most users - aside from perhaps the bulk of the CCS connector. In the meantime I’m enjoying my seemless, light weight, sleek, powerful and abundant NACS charging experience.  
I have doubts about Tesla really thinking that it can make it happen at this point. I think Tesla only wants a few automakers to adopt the standard, and Aptera already did, and that will fulfill the requirement for the federal charging infrastructure funding.
If Tesla had tried to do this five years ago and stuck to it until now, it might have worked, but not now.
Even though Tesla still dominates the EV market in North America by a wide margin, and therefore the NACS connector dominates, there are now too many major EV programs for other automakers using CCS in the works to make a change in my opinion.
But again, I think Tesla knows that.

2022/11/30,"Tesla (TSLA) is planning a massive ramp up in Model Y production output from Gigafactory Texas in Q1 2023. In the meantime, the situation is a bit more complex in the United States with the pending tax credit.
Tesla has been keeping us updated on progress in the production ramp at Gigafactory Berlin, which has been producing 2,000 Model Y vehicles per week since last month. The automaker is also simultaneously ramping production up at Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla is a bit more tight-lipped, however, on the production rate at the Austin factory.
Tesla confirmed a production rate of 1,000 Model Ys a week back in June and confirmed having produced its 10,000th Model Y in September. But, the company never confirmed a production rate of 2,000 units per week, like it did for Gigafactory Berlin.
Nonetheless, we now learn that Tesla is feeling extremely confident about the production ramp at Gigafactory Texas.
A reliable source familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is currently preparing for 75,000 Model Y vehicles to come out of Gigafactory Texas next quarter (Q1 2023).
That would put Tesla’s production rate at Gigafactory Texas at over 5,000 units per week throughout the whole quarter.
Even though Tesla is preparing for that kind of output in Q1 2023, it is not in a hurry to get there in Q4 as it is still establishing the logistics to be able to handle that kind of volume increase in the United States.
5,000 units per week is generally Tesla’s goal for volume production and where Tesla wants to be with the Model Y at Giga Texas before moving its focus to Cybertruck production.
Additionally, sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is dealing with some level of cancellations in the United States right now due to long wait times leading to some customers’ situations changing between the time they place their order and the actual delivery.
Furthermore, Tesla is also dealing with some customers looking to push their deliveries into next year to take advantage of the upcoming new EV tax credit. As we previously reported, Tesla is not as accommodating as other automakers when it comes to the new EV tax credit, and it is holding its customers to their order contracts.
They can’t push deliveries to try to secure the tax credit that comes into effect next year.
Due to this situation, Tesla appears to be nervous about finding itself with a lot of vehicles in inventory in the United States – like it did last quarter.
What a difference a day makes!  Yesterday it was all doom and gloom, today the sun’s out.  Pretty sure 2023 is going to be a standout year for Tesla, though.  Just my opinion...but we’ll see soon enough.
We have been starting to see signs that Tesla is having some demand issues in the United States, but it seems to be temporary, primarily due to the tax credit.
And if that’s the case, you can also expect a surge in demand when the tax credit comes into effect in January.
It appears that Tesla is getting ready with a massive new output at Gigafactory Texas.
You would think that the automaker could also try to ramp up production sooner in Q4 and build inventory for when that demand comes, but it looks like the automaker is being more cautious and trying to avoid having too many vehicles in inventory at the end of the quarter.

2022/11/30,"Tesla has secured a large fleet order from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), which is trying to electrify its vehicle fleet.
Caltrans, like other government agencies in California, is trying to electrify its entire vehicle fleet of about 1,200 vehicles by 2030.
They already have 54 Toyota RAV4 Primes (PHEV), 15 Chevy Bolts, 11 Nissan Leafs, and one Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup, but now they have placed their largest EV order yet.
The agency told Drive Tesla Canada that it placed an order for 399 Tesla Model 3 vehicles:
In a statement to Drive Tesla, a Caltrans spokesperson confirmed the 399 Model 3 sedans are the Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) variant, putting the value of the purchase at more than $18 million, making the previously unannounced deal the largest known EV fleet order from a US government department at either the federal or state level.
Government agencies have been criticized at times for buying Tesla vehicles because they are considered “luxury vehicles,” but the purchase was approved by the Department of General Services, and the agency argued that it offers the best value for taxpayers than any other all-electric vehicles.
Caltrans has reportedly already received the first 236 Model 3 vehicles out of the 399 vehicles it ordered.
Last year, Electrek revealed a similarly important fleet order of Tesla Model 3 vehicles placed by New York City.
Tesla has been having a lot of success with fleet orders from government agencies as of late.
It started with police departments that quickly found that Tesla vehicles were ideal for electrifying their patrol fleets. Since then, several municipalities, state, and even federal agencies have been placing orders with Tesla.
As of late, Tesla has also received even larger orders from companies like Hertz and Autonomy.
We reported that Tesla filed its end-of-quarter delivery slots with some of those fleet deliveries during the last quarter.

2022/11/30,"Tesla is losing Anders Bell, senior director of engineering in charge of vehicle interior, who will return to Volvo, which has been following Tesla’s interior design direction.
Electrek first reported Tesla poaching Anders Bell from Volvo back in 2016.
He was a big hire for Tesla in 2016, when the automaker wasn’t as well established; he was a more risky move for more senior automotive executives.
Anders was himself a well-established automotive senior engineer, having spent 17 years at Volvo and rising to the role of senior director of engineering in charge of interior engineering for the entire Volvo Group.
Volvo had a great reputation for its vehicle interiors, which wasn’t the case for Tesla. The electric automaker had been fairly criticized up to that point for its interior not being on par with other luxury vehicles.
Bell took over Tesla’s engineering team in charge of vehicle interiors based in California. He stayed in that role until last year when he was promoted to senior director of vehicle engineering for Europe based in Berlin.
But now The Independent is reporting that Bell is leaving Tesla to return to Volvo:
He returns to Volvo next month where he will head the team leading development on ‘computing, electrification, connectivity and autonomous drive.’
Interestingly, in Bell’s time away from Volvo, the Swedish automaker has been sort of following Tesla’s direction in interior design. Volvo also announced the return.
The interior of the recently unveiled Volvo EX90 electric SUV is extremely reminiscent of Tesla’s Model S/X interior before the 2021 design refresh:
Like the old Model S/X, it features basically no button, and the entire user experience is based around a large vertical center display and an instrument cluster.
The fans are also elongated and somewhat hidden within the dashboard.
We probably haven’t even seen most of Bell’s work yet, since Tesla haven’t really released any major new interior designs since he joined in 2016. The Model 3 design had already been unveiled by then. The Model Y interior is broadly identical to the 3, and the Plaid Model S/X refresh is fairly minor in terms of interior design.

I’m guessing the Cybertruck (and possibly the Semi?) are the programs that he had the most influence over.


Volvo has also decided to give up on building its own software experience on these screens, and it is going with Android Auto instead.
This is something that I want to keep an eye on going forward with everything that is happening with Elon Musk; Tesla’s biggest asset is undoubtedly its ability to attract and retain top talent.
I am not saying that it is the case right now, but if we do start seeing an exodus of talent, it is going to be a real concern.
It’s something to keep an eye on.

2022/11/30,"Tesla has started selling its charging stations at Best Buy in the US amid trying to make its charge connector the new standard in North America.
Earlier this month, Tesla surprised many by announcing that it is opening its EV charge connector with the aim of making it the new standard in North America.
The automaker is challenging the J1772/CCS combo connector, which has been adopted by virtually all other automakers selling vehicles in North America, in the hope that its sleeker and more powerful design will win by force of sheer numbers.
Tesla dominates the EV market in America to such a degree that even though all other automakers currently selling EVs on the market are using the J1772/CCS connector, there are still more EVs in North America using the Tesla connector, now known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
The Supercharger network is also undoubtedly the best and most extensive DC fast-charging network in the market.
All of that, on top of a clearly more efficient design, are strong points for Tesla’s connector, which still faces quite an uphill battle as it would need to be adopted by other automakers – aka competitors to Tesla.
Now Tesla has started selling its charging stations with both its own connector and the J1772 connector (part of the CCS family) at Best Buy in the US.
While Tesla has had deals with distributors in the past, they have been mostly through installation services.
It’s the first time that Tesla is selling its charging stations through a large direct-to-consumer retailer like Best Buy.
Unless Tesla transfers NACS to an independent standards organization, I don’t think this will get adopted. Imagine the risk of all your cars use NACS and Elon decides to stop allowing others to use it. 
The automaker is offering two products at Best Buy:
The prices are the same as they are on Tesla’s own website: $550 for the station with the J1772 connector, and $400 for the station with the Tesla connector. 
The move to sell through a third-party retailer could be an attempt to show that the company is not trying to own the entire distribution of the charging stations.
What do you think of this move by Tesla? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/11/29,"S&P Global Mobility released new EV sale data that shows Tesla still owns the US EV market, but it is losing market share.
But when you had close to 100% of the market, there’s only one way to go, and that’s down.
For years now, Tesla has dominated the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market, but for now, the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla’s production and deliveries.
For the entire year of 2020, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States. In 2021, that number went down to 69.95%, but that’s still impressive with EV delivery volumes significantly increasing throughout the year along with Tesla’s prices.
Now in 2022, new data released by S&P Global Mobility today shows that Tesla still dominates with 65% of market share this year through the first nine months:
Although U.S. electric vehicle registrations remain dominated by Tesla, the brand is showing the expected signs of shedding market share as more entrants arrive. Much of Tesla’s share loss is to EVs available in a more accessible MSRP range – below $50,000, where Tesla does not yet truly compete.
Out of the more than 525,000 EVs registered over the first nine months of 2022 in the US, nearly 340,000 were Tesla vehicles.
When you look into the luxury EV market (over $50,000), Tesla’s dominance is even clearer with 85% market share.
S&P Global Mobility predicts that the number of EV models available in the US will grow from 48 at present to 159 by 2025.
Tesla is expected to only contribute a single additional vehicle, the Cybertruck, to those 100+ new EV models, but S&P says that it will still only marginally affect Tesla, which is expected to still grow its volume during that time.
Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence for S&P Global Mobility, commented:
Before you feel too badly for Tesla, however, remember that the brand will continue to see unit sales grow, even as share declines. The EV market in 2022 is a Tesla market, and it will continue to be, so long as its competitors are bound by production capacity.
However, some of those new EV models from other automakers are expected to reach high-volume production within the next three years and start challenging Tesla’s dominance in the US.
In fact, S&P thinks that Tesla’s US EV share will drop to below 20% of the overall market by 2025 which means that either Tesla will have to falter or the rest of the industry will have to go all out in the next three years. Or more likely both.  
It's a near mathematical certainty that Tesla will continue to lose market-share for the next several years, no matter how many times they double production.  It's just what it is.  The only time to be worried is if Tesla starts to have an inventory backlog.
When you basically own the whole market, there’s only one way, and that’s down. So if I were Tesla, I wouldn’t worry too much.
It’s all about production volume. Whichever automaker is able to produce compelling EVs in large volume is going to dominate, and so far, that’s Tesla. There’s no doubt about it.
It’s important to note that Tesla dominates the EV market in the US right now, but the EV market is itself just about 5% of the US light vehicle market.
By the time there are a few dozen EV programs that have production capacities near a million units, the EV market will take a majority of market shares.

2022/11/29,"This is what the US car insurance industry really thinks about EVs, how it affects your premium, and how to choose an insurance company for your EV that really will have your back if you need help.
A recent white paper by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Argo Group, an underwriter of specialty insurance products, asserted that EV and energy storage battery factories offer a great opportunity for insurers. That’s because battery-making facilities “tend to be well-funded, low-risk enterprises with plenty of loss data to analyze.”
The white paper’s recommendations for insurers are also applicable in the EV insurance sector. It suggested that insurance companies refine their ranking systems used to determine favorability; ask for and engage with feedback from customers on what insurance products they need the most; and continue to model and compile new loss data across emerging industries.
And because EVs are rapidly being adopted in the US market, insurers need to also rapidly adopt change. Alex Hindson, the group chief risk & sustainability officer at Argo Group, said to Electrek:
Insurance is an industry that has a problem with innovation. It’s all based on data and appetite for risk. So if insurance companies don’t understand something, they’re cautious.” 
Electrek also spoke with a former claims director of a top five insurance company who asked to not be identified, so we’ll call him John Smith. He explained the current state of the US car insurance industry for context:
The US car insurance industry is hurting right now – losing a lot of money – because of COVID, because that’s when car production stopped. It’s difficult to obtain parts for vehicles due to supply chain issues. There’s also a chip shortage for new cars. So what that’s doing is raising the used car market prices by about 40%. 
If you have an accident in a used car, it costs the insurance company 30-40% more to repair it due to the cost of parts and labor. 
Insurance companies are trying to raise their rates to be profitable, and they’re throwing electric vehicles into this because they’re currently taking a bath. They actually don’t want to write new policies because they’re losing money.
And Hindson explained why some car insurance companies don’t offer competitive premiums for EVs:
If an insurance company offers high premium for electric vehicles, it’s for one of two reasons: They either don’t know what they’re doing and price high for uncertainty, or they do know what they’re doing and don’t want to do it.” 
In other words, car insurance companies exercise caution if they don’t understand something.
Gas cars often have lower insurance rates, and it’s not because they’re safer. It’s because there’s an enormous amount of data on gas cars that insurance companies can tap into. They’re a known quantity.
But some insurers have decided they want to pursue the emerging EV market, so they’re gathering their own data. So if their prices are more competitive, it may be because they’re building more of the market share.
Neither Hindson nor Smith cited EV fires as a risk factor for insurance companies. Hindson also noted that if an EV gets into an accident, it’s more likely to be declared totaled due to the weight and expense of the battery.
Some insurance companies are trying to partner with EV companies, and specifically with Tesla, because EV makers have the background knowledge and data they seek. 
Teslas need to be repaired by certified Tesla locations, so it takes a lot longer to do the repairs because they’re backed up. When it comes to non-Tesla EVs, many dealers require you to come to their facilities.
The average length of a car rental when your car is being repaired, Smith explained, is between 12-15 days. For Tesla drivers, it averages about 20-25 days. So it costs the insurance company about $36 per day on average for a rental car.
So the cost of premiums has more to do with repair bottleneck and the limited number of facilities to do the repairs than the car’s safety rating.
Smith shared the best way for EV owners to get a reasonable premium and good coverage:
Shop around, because so many insurance companies have a better EV book than others. Progressive and Allstate, for example, are good at using technology to understand data – they put something in your car to better understand your driving habits, and that brings down the premium. [Editor’s note: Smith did not work for Progressive or Allstate.]
Choose a company who wants to embrace and better understand electric vehicles.
When you’re shopping around, ask the insurance company, “Are you partnered with electric vehicle repair facilities?” If they’re not, move on to the next company. In the long haul, it will so much easier to repair if you have an accident.
Hindson also echoed this sentiment, advising that drivers seek insurance companies that use telematics, because car insurance companies love data. And data will eventually help them catch up.
Hindson said: 
[The insurance industry] can’t do well by excluding things. We can’t win by playing defense. The problem will solve itself with time.”
Smith echoed this sentiment: 
Driving an EV has so many positives. The world just needs to catch up.”

2022/11/29,"Tesla (TSLA) investors see the negative impact of Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition lasting on the company going forward.
There’s no doubt that Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter had a direct negative impact on Tesla and its investors, considering that the CEO had to sell billions of dollars worth of Tesla (TSLA) stock to finance the $44 billion acquisition.
The sale of that TSLA stock likely contributed to a sharp decline in Tesla’s stock price.
There’s also a less tangible impact on Tesla and that’s the perception of Elon Musk changing through his antics on Twitter. Many people have reported losing faith in Musk’s leadership after he made statements like sharing fringe conspiracy theories and asking his followers to vote republican on Election Day.
Sharing conspiracy theories and urging people to vote for a specific party are things that you generally don’t see from the CEO of major companies.
Now Morgan Stanley has surveyed its own clients who are Tesla investors to understand how they see the situation.
Analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients today:
Our investor survey reinforces our views that Elon Musk’s recent involvement with Twitter has contributed to negative sentiment momentum in Tesla shares and could drive some degree of adverse downside skew to Tesla fundamentals.
It would be a disaster in the short term if elon wasn't ceo, but I listen to every earnings call and to this day, the most competent one was the one he wasn't involved. He has assembled a good team, and I think it's time to let elon pursue his side projects. They're not the company of 2018 struggling to ramp, and they are on a good trajectory with or without musk. I think most Tesla investors believe Tesla will survive with or without him, but I personally would love less drama. 
Interestingly, a strong majority of Tesla investors in the survey believed that the impact will keep being negative going forward:
However, Morgan Stanley maintains a positive outlook on Tesla’s stock as they believe there are significant upsides based on the current valuation:
Tesla is the only self-funding pure play EV name we cover and has achieved a unique position to secure supply of the battery metals and related up-stream supply necessary to produce EVs at multi-million-unit scale. In a slowing economic environment, we believe Tesla’s ‘gap to competition’ can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary. The current price offers approximately 80% potential upside to our $330 price target which is the highest upside to target we have seen from Tesla in over 5 years.
Tesla’s (TSLA) stock is slightly up 0.3% this morning – trading at around $183 a share.

2022/11/29,"Tesla has released a new update to its mobile app that adds a good feature for lazy owners, like myself, and a change in the back end that points to an upcoming feature.
It used to be Tesla owners had to go inside their vehicles to start a software update.
Tesla would send a notification through your Tesla mobile app telling you that a new update was ready and you’d need to get to your car to start downloading and installing it.
Later, Tesla released a new mobile app update that enabled owners to start the update from the app.
However, you still needed to go inside the vehicle once the update was completed in order to read the release and know what the update was about. I am so lazy that I actually complained about this just last week on the Electrek Podcast.
Now Tesla has pushed a new version (Version 4.15.0) of its mobile app to the App Store, and the release notes confirm that the new update enables Tesla drivers to view release notes (meta, I know) from the app:
View vehicle software release notes (*)
*Vehicle software version 2022.40+ required.
It means that once you update your app and have the latest 2022.40+ vehicle software in your car, you’ll be able to push a new update to it and view the update from the app without having to go to your vehicle.
That was the only official new feature in the mobile app update released last night, but Tesla App Updates (IOS) on Twitter always dig inside the updates to find any change in the back end that could lead to new features.
They found that Tesla added references to the interior cabin camera:

It’s not clear what this is about exactly, but Tesla could be adding the cabin camera view to its Sentry Mode remote camera viewing feature released last year.
The feature enables owners to remotely get a live view from the Autopilot camera feeds in their vehicles directly from the mobile app. Right now, it only gives you the option to pull the camera feeds from the front camera, back camera, and one on each side.

2022/11/28,"Tesla, Quebec, LG, and others, through the Global Battery Alliance, are working on a new “battery passport” to help track battery materials.
The project is important to make EV batteries sustainable and is critical to the new EV incentive in the United States.
One of the biggest arguments from EV naysayers is that battery material mining is just as polluting as burning gasoline.
That’s plain false based on important studies, but it doesn’t mean that there’s no room for improvements in making battery material mining more sustainable and ensuring that all the resources come from ethical operations – especially without child labor.
Global Battery Alliance (GAB) is pushing a new solution called a “Battery Passport.”
GAB is an industry group made up of over 100 companies involved in the EV battery supply chain from mining companies like Glencore to automakers like Tesla and battery cell makers like LG. The group’s goal is to “help establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030.”
One of the first steps in making a sustainable battery value chain is to understand where all materials in a battery cell come from, which is harder than one might think. A battery cell is mainly made up of a cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte, and each of these parts is made of several different materials that need to be processed.
From mining to processing to assembly, it can be hard to know where every part of a battery cell came from, which is important to know to make sure the entire value chain is sustainable.
It also happens to be important for automakers to know in the United States since the new federal tax credit for electric vehicles includes a requirements that battery materials come from North America or countries with free trade agreements with the United States in order to get the full $7,500 credit for new EV purchases.
Some automakers are not even sure if they will get the full credit when it goes into effect in 2023 because tracking can be so difficult.
This is where the Global Battery Alliance’s battery passport comes in. The group describes the project on its website:
The Battery Passport is a digital representation of a battery that conveys information about all applicable ESG and lifecycle requirements based on a comprehensive definition of a sustainable battery. Each Battery Passport will be a digital twin of its physical battery enabled by the digital Battery Passport platform, which offers a global solution for securely sharing information and data. This platform aims to go beyond enabling the performance management of just one battery to that of all batteries across the full industry value chain.
The project is led by GBA’s steering committee, which is co-chaired by Tristan Mecham, Tesla’s project manager for responsible sourcing, and Simon Thibault, senior director of battery value chain for Investissement Québec, a public investment arm of the Quebec government. 
Interestingly, we recently reported that Tesla has been visiting local mining companies in Quebec, and it is looking for a potential factory location.
The group explains in more concrete points what the battery passport will consist of:
Years in the making, the group recently announced the first step in achieving its battery passport with the release of the first version of the Greenhouse Gas Rulebook.

2022/11/28,"Several Tesla blogs are reporting that Tesla created a joint venture to produce computer chips with a company that is clearly fake.
The reason behind the strange situation is unclear.
Over the last few days, Tesla blogs, including Teslarati and Tesmanian (with the latter having been promoted recently by CEO Elon Musk on Twitter), have reported that Tesla has “set up a semiconductor joint venture with Switzerland’s Annex Semiconductor” in China.
The report claims that Tesla, along with Annex, have invested $150 million to start the new joint venture and produce automotive chips.
Teslarati called Annex “a formidable partner” for Tesla and “among the global leaders in automotive system-on-chip (SoC), microcontroller (MCU), and processor, image sensor, and power device products.”
The only problem is that the company is fake.
It looks like the blogs only copy pasted from a report from Chinese website Ijiwei without verifying any of the information. 
I asked a few sources in the semiconductor business, and no one had ever heard of Annex Semiconductor.
After researching Annex, I couldn’t find anything about the company other than its own website and the new reporting from the Tesla blogs.
As for the website, it triggered my bullshit meter as it appeared extremely generic. My suspicions were confirmed when all the phone numbers on the contact page didn’t work, and I couldn’t find a single employee linked to the company.
The links to the company’s social media accounts were also not working, and I couldn’t find an actual social media presence. The address of its headquarters is not real, and all the other supposed offices don’t have any listed addresses.
On their website, they have a picture of “their chip”, which is obviously an AMD Ryzen chip with ‘ANNEX’ photoshopped onto it (badly I might add):
The reports from Teslarati and Tesmanian also both mentioned that Annex Semiconductor was bought by Zurich Fund back in June for $5 billion. The publications didn’t bother to verify that, either.
Zurich Fund also appears to be a completely made-up company. The website has the same design as Annex’s, and it is also full of vague and generic information. Its “our people” page actually profiles two executives, but they are both made up with stock images for their profiles:
I couldn’t find anyone matching those names and profiles. Like Annex, the only reference that I could find about the Zurich Fund is a press release about it buying Annex in June. No other information about the company is available nor does anyone claim to be working for the company.
That’s not normal for a company that is able to buy a chip maker for $5 billion.
However, the subterfuge is somewhat complex since the people behind t even bothered to create an ‘Investor Relations’ section with actual reports in them and even a Chairman’s letter to investors, but a simple Google of the text shows that whoever is behind this ploy simply lifted the text from Blackstone’s Chairman’s Letter and changed the names.
Why? The writers at Teslarati and Tesmanian are most likely TSLA stock owners (and there's a good chance Tesla owes them a free Roadster from the earlier referral program). They have every reason to pump Tesla.
Furthermore, a look at Annex’s website index suggests that it was created in China, which is strange for a company that is supposed to be Swiss. 
In conclusion, there’s nothing pointing to Annex being a real company, and even less so pointing to it being a $5 billion leader in automotive chip-making partnering with Tesla.
It’s a good reminder to be careful about what you read online. Even publications that claim to be experts in a subject, such as Tesla, often post things without ever bothering to look into the sources.
But it raises the question: Why the subterfuge? So far, I couldn’t find a clear reason for making up the fake companies and the partnership with Tesla beyond tricking lazy reporters. If there’s a company whose stock it would have helped, I couldn’t find it, but that’s a possibility. If you have any idea, let us know in the comments section below or reach out to me at fred@electrek.co.

2022/11/28,"Tesla is reportedly working on a Model 3 redesign codenamed “Project Highland” that is going to be released by the end of next year, but that’s according to a report that should be taken with a grain of salt.
Model 3 has been on the market for five years now without any significant redesign. It has sold well and keeps selling in many markets, but it is being overtaken by Model Y globally.
Now Reuters reports that Tesla is working on a redesign of the Model 3 codenamed “Highland”:
One focus of the redesign codenamed “Highland” is to reduce the number of components and complexity in the interior of the Model 3 while focusing on features that Tesla buyers value, including the display, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the revamp has not been announced.
The report doesn’t go into the details of the redesign, beyond that it will focus on cost reduction and that the vehicle should go into production at Gigafactory Shanghai and Fremont factory during the third quarter of 2023.
In terms of the actual design, the report only says that it is inspired by the redesign of the Model S released last year – without confirming if it will have the yoke steering wheel, which was the biggest new feature of the redesign.
It’s important to note that we recently reported that Reuters doesn’t have a great track record on its “exclusive” unnamed source-based reporting on Tesla, with several recent reports proven to be inaccurate.
I can't help but think the 3 would be a better vehicle with a hatch rather than a trunk, but I guess different strokes for different folks.
It’s extremely likely that Tesla is working on a Model 3 redesign at this point. That I can easily believe, but I’d take everything else in the Reuters report with a grain of salt – not that there’s much in there about the actual redesign beyond that it will focus on cost.
Reuters’ track record on Tesla exclusives has been so bad that we simply can’t take them at face value, unfortunately. Not at this point.
But the Model 3 is certainly due for a refresh, and it would make sense that the focus would be on cost, especially since Tesla hasn’t incorporated its large-scale casting technology into the vehicle program yet as it did with Model Y.
You can expect the next generation of the vehicle to feature large single-piece casting for more production efficiency. A potential switch to 4680 cells in late 2023 is also likely in the cards.

2022/11/27,"Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla Semi has completed its first 500-mile trip with a full load – quite a feat for a battery-electric truck.
Tesla Semi is an all-electric class 8 commercial truck that Tesla first unveiled in 2017, and it was supposed to be in production in 2019. However, it was delayed several times.
At the time, it was quite revolutionary to have a purely battery-powered truck with a full 80,000-lb. class 8 capacity capable of traveling between 300 and 500 miles, depending on the model.
Since then, several other companies have managed to beat Tesla to market with class 8 electric semi-trucks, such as Volvo, Freightliner, and Nikola, but they have only managed to come close to the lower end of the range.
Now Tesla is finally bringing its electric truck to market with deliveries expected to start this week, and it’s a 500-mile version of the electric truck.
Last night, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that a Tesla Semi has now completed a 500-mile trip with a full load:
Tesla team just completed a 500 mile drive with a Tesla Semi weighing in at 81,000 lbs!
It seems a bit last minute to complete the first 500-mile drive, considering Tesla is expected to deliver production versions of the truck to customers this week. But Tesla has presumably previously completed many shorter trips that confirmed the full range could reach 500 miles on a single charge.
Five hundred miles with a full load between charges is the sweet spot for a commercial long-haul semi-truck, because after about eight hours of driving, a break for the driver is mandatory.
With that capacity and a much lower cost of operation per mile than diesel trucks, Tesla Semi is expected to have a major impact on the trucking industry.
Tesla is going to hold an event for the first Tesla Semi deliveries on Thursday, December 1.
At some time in the future, I expect, most shippers and, receivers will have chargers at their docks. This will enable trucks to recharge for a fee, while loading and, unloading. 
I am really excited about this. If the price point is good, which could be confirmed at the event this week, it could truly be a game changer.
The 500-mile range on a full charge is going to be good to convince people that battery-electric trucks can take over the whole class-8 market. However, I think the best use cases at first are going to be for companies, like Tesla, that often need to move a lot of cargo between two locations that they control, like a factory and delivery centers.
That way, it can have charging stations at each location that charges the trucks while they are loaded, and then you get an all-electric and emission-free trip between the locations while massively reducing your fuel costs. 
What company will not want that? When it’s going to be time to update their fleets, companies will fight to get those trucks as production ramps up.

However, Tesla is not equipped to detect hands on the steering wheel. It can only detect torque being apply to it, so the automaker regularly asks drivers to apply some torque to the wheel in order to keep using Autopilot.
It pushed some people to use what has been called “defeat devices.” It can be as simple as jamming a water bottle in the steering wheel to apply some pressure to some custom-made devices to trick Autopilot’s driver monitoring system.
NHTSA even had to intervene and ban devices that were clearly marketed for that purpose.
One of those Autopilot defeat devices tried to come back as a phone mount, but it was shut down again.
Now Tesla is trying to address the issue through software directly.
I was happy to get FSD beta, until I realized that it was more of a hassle to tug constantly on the steering wheel than just drive yourself.
Teslascope, which digs into Tesla software updates, found something interesting in the latest FSD Beta update. Tesla can now detect Autopilot defeat devices, and it forces drivers off Autopilot if detected:
The latest version of Full Self-Driving Beta (V10.69.3.1) can detect some forms of autopilot defeat devices and will be slowly adapted over time as new methods are discovered by Tesla.If detected, it will result in a forced autopilot disengagement; resulting in strikes.
This is an interesting new approach to the problem as Tesla’s FSD Beta is getting into a wider release to anyone who bought the FSD package in North America. 
With the technology still in beta and undoubtedly dangerous if drivers are not paying attention, Tesla is trying to find ways to try to make sure drivers are really putting their hands on the wheel and ready to take control at all times.
Tesla has also been increasingly using its cabin-facing camera to monitor driver attention, and it has been known to send driver warnings when their gaze is not on the road.

2022/11/25,"Tesla issues a recall on 80,000 cars in China adding another one to a year with a lot of recalls, but most of them are easily fixed with software updates.
Earlier this year, NHTSA issued a series of recalls on Tesla vehicles that were highly reported in the media.
What was less reported, though, is that almost all of those recalls were fairly simple software issues that Tesla has been able to fix through over-the-air software updates.
Whenever there’s a safety-related issue, NHTSA has to issue a “safety recall,” even if the automaker doesn’t have to physically recall any vehicle, which leads to some confusion.
Again last month, a Tesla recall of “1 million vehicles” made many headlines when the recall simply consisted of Tesla changing how its software handled window operations. These instances have led Tesla CEO Elon Musk to complain about the term “recall” and how it is used against Tesla by the media.
Today, Tesla also announced more recalls in China on about 80,000 vehicles. 
According to Chinese authorities, the recall includes 67,698 imported Model S and Model X vehicles with a software problem related to the battery pack. Again, the fix is a simple software update.
However, this time there’s also a physical recall due to a seat belt issue on about 13,000 Model 3 vehicles: 2,736 imported and 10,127 made in China.
It’s been so nice to sit back with a nice cappuccino while I read later that my cars already been fixed autonomously by the latest s/w push.   Remember when we had to go in for these things - we maybe would combine it with an oil change, injector cleaning, new plugs, PVC valve replacement, and on and on. LOL
With now over 20 recalls in 2022, it has been a “Total Recall” year for Tesla – pun intended:
But Tesla is not the only automaker affected by large recalls this year. Ford just confirmed that it is recalling another half a million vehicles due to a fire risk, and many automakers have also recalled millions of vehicles this year.
If anything, the fact that the large majority of Tesla’s recalls are quickly fixed with over-the-air software updates – rather than having to bring the cars back to the dealership like other automakers – shows that Tesla’s level of connectivity in its vehicles is a major advantage in the industry.
It makes for an easier experience for the customers, and it is much cheaper and more efficient for Tesla.

2022/11/25,"A Tesla Supercharger in Tennessee was blocked by a Mercedes-Benz EQS owned by a local dealership amid a busy travel time for Thanksgiving Day.
Was it a publicity stunt or a clueless customer who didn’t know how to use the electric car?
Scott Hall, a Tesla owner, stopped by the Tesla Supercharger station in Knoxville, Tennessee, yesterday, like many other travelers for Thanksgiving. 
When he arrived, he found a Mercedes-Benz EQS, a performance electric sedan, parked in a way that blocked two chargers at the station.
Non-Tesla electric vehicles, like the EQS, cannot yet charge at Tesla Supercharger stations, nor was the vehicle attempting to. Rather, it was clearly intentionally parked to block access to both chargers at the end of the station amid an otherwise mostly empty parking lot (pictures via Scott Hall on Facebook):
It also happened to block a Supercharger stall reserved for people with disabilities. 
The vehicle was equipped with a dealer’s plate and stickers for the local Mercedes-Benz of Knoxville dealership, which means that the vehicle is owned by the local dealer. Mercedes-Benz of Knoxville dealership is located just a mile down the road from the Tesla Supercharger station.
Electrek contacted the Mercedes-Benz of Knoxville dealership to ask them if they have a comment about their EQS being left to block two Supercharger stalls. We will update if we get a response.
Update: Mercedes-Benz of Knoxville told Electrek one of their customers did this without their knowledge. The car is actually still there. They claim that it ran out of charge and was left there, and an employee will be sent to get it today.
Update 2: Electrek has now confirmed that the car was indeed low on charge, but it was able to be moved away from Supercharger on its own power at 10 AM this morning.
The Mercedes-Benz EQS has been the German automaker’s response to the Tesla Model S, which had been taking sales from the Mercedes S-Class for years.
It looks like the local dealer or one of its employees thought it would be smart to use one of its fleet vehicles left unused during a holiday to partly block the local Tesla Supercharger in order for Tesla owners to see the Mercedes-Benz EQS.
I think it's time for stricter legislation to punish ""icing"" a charging stall. Make it both a fine and possible towing to a holding lot which would generate even more fees to the offender when they go to retrieve their vehicle. Make it painful enough for offenders to hopefully curb future occurrences.
If the goal was publicity, it was successful, but it’s not good publicity. They are blocking charging stations meant for long-distance travel during an extremely busy travel time. That would only succeed in frustrating the Tesla owners stopping by – not spark their interest in the EQS.
For that, they could have just parked the car in front of the Supercharger station, which is in the middle of a giant mall parking lot with plenty of empty parking spots.
Update: the dealership now claims it’s a customer who did this. That’s their story and they are sticking to it, but I am skeptical. Conveniently, it’s an employee of the dealership that is going to pick it up at the Tesla Supercharger today. 
The dealer claims that a customer who happened to have a brand new EQS on loan on Thanksgiving decided to weirdly park the car to block two Tesla Superchargers in a giant mostly empty parking lot because they ran out of charge a mile away from the dealership. That’s a suspicious explanation, but not impossible.

2022/11/24,"Tesla has reduced Supercharging prices in many regions as its charging business starts to mature a little.
One of the biggest advantages of electric vehicles remains that their cost of operations is much lower than vehicles with internal combustion engines, thanks to electricity generally being much cheaper than gas.
However, the cost of both gas and electricity has been skyrocketing over the last year, especially in Europe because of the war in Ukraine and restrictions on Russian oil and gas.
It used to be difficult to pay more than $5 or $10 for a full charge at a Tesla Supercharger.
After several price increases throughout the last year, now many Supercharger stations are charging $0.50 per kWh, which can result in a cost of $30 to charge 60 kWh.
Earlier this year, we reported Tesla announcing a major Supercharger price hike in Europe – mainly because of the energy crisis, and later in North America, especially in California.
But what goes up must go down. 
Many Tesla owners across several markets have been reporting over the last few days that Tesla has reduced prices at their local stations.
There’s no way to track Supercharger pricing globally, but Tesla owners can see prices at stations around them through the navigation system inside their vehicles.
A Tesla owner in California reported that local prices are down by as much as 5 cents per kWh:
Tesla cut the price of supercharging across LA and parts of California it seems! Some superchargers are 5 cents/kWh cheaper on peak which adds up! Some superchargers did increase though for their on peak pricing. pic.twitter.com/F2uYSAIZvW
Some price drops in Europe are even more significant with prices going down by as much as $0.10 per kWh.
Charging stations are slaves to the electric utility rates, and they undeniably influence prices more than anything else, but the charging business as a whole is also evolving.
This does not seem to be true, at least in the SF Bay Area. At the same supercharger it just cost me $0.57/kWh to charge yesterday on November 24, 2022. (They increased the rates for the superchargers in the bay area in September 2022.) Back in April 2022 it was $0.48/kWh. And back in November 2021 it was $0.42/kWh. Hoping to see rates go down, but right now that's definitely not the reality in the SF Bay Area.
It’s only about 10 years old, and only now the volume of electric vehicles on the road is starting to be high enough that the business is maturing.
When it comes to Tesla, the automaker has been making a lot of moves to adapt lately, like expanding time of use rates to match high traffic times. Of course, it is also slowly opening the Supercharger network up to non-Tesla EV, which is turning the network into a real business rather than just a feature to help sell Tesla vehicles.
Tesla Supercharger network recently reached 40,000 chargers globally.
It is now starting to morph into its final form: a sustainable (both ecologically and financially) global fast-charging network that enables long-distance travel in electric vehicles.

2022/11/24,"Tesla is rumored to be working on integrating Dolby Atmos in its electric cars in order to deliver better surround sound.
Dolby Atmos is a surround sound technology developed by Dolby Laboratories. The company describes it as “expanding on existing surround sound systems by adding height channels, allowing sounds to be interpreted as three-dimensional objects.”
Being around for 10 years, it is not exactly new, but it was first integrated into movie theaters, then made it to high-end home theaters, and now only recently started making it to cars.
It started with Lucid integrating the technology in the Air, its electric sedan last year, and since then several other automakers – including Mercedes-Benz and Volvo – announced that it will integrate Dolby Atmos.
Now BGR reports based on unnamed sources that Tesla is working on integrating the technology in its vehicles:
One of Tesla’s upcoming software updates should give the sound systems in its current and new vehicles a considerable upgrade. According to our sources, Tesla has been working with major record labels for months to bring Dolby Atmos to Tesla cars. Once the software update rolls out, over 1 million Teslas that are currently on the road will support Dolby Atmos, including all newly manufactured vehicles.
In recent years, Tesla has put an emphasis on the sound system inside its vehicles. However, Tesla isn’t known to be “working directly with labels” when they mostly deal with providers like Tune-in, Spotify and even Apple Music.
The sound system in the Model 3 has been well-received by audiophiles, and the one in the new version of the Model S has also received positive reviews.
It has been compared to an expensive Bang & Olufsen system often found in premium vehicles, but for a fraction of the price.
When a reviewer made the comparison on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented:
Tesla audio engineers come from B&O & many other companies. They literally rock. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates.
Tesla indeed has several audio engineers from Bang & Olufsen, like lead audio engineer Markus Koch, who spent over a decade at Harman and Bang & Olufsen before joining Tesla in 2015. He briefly left for a stint at Byton before coming back to Tesla in 2019.
As a person with a 20+ year interest in multichannel music, I think that this is not so much about the height channels as finding a mass application of multichannel music in general.  The problem has always been in complicated formats and the dislike of many for proliferating speakers in their living rooms.  I endured the SACD/DVD-Audio wars where the software companies were recalcitrant in accepting any risk that their multichannel masters might be recorded by consumers, & thus crippled capabilities in the hardware, making things even more confusing for them.  By the time that streaming audio eliminated the roadblocks of disc formats and hardware costs, the public was burnt and resistant to home multichannel.  This in turn starved the $$$ needed to get multichannel mixes produced from the masters.

So now cars are left as the multispeaker listening rooms of the masses.  And getting over that public resistance means offering all possible advantages over CD-grade audio.  Which requires multichannel masters.  Dolby and some of the service providers seem to want a guaranteed market to get the money flowing for the masters.
More recently, Tesla also hired several engineers from Jawbone and Amazon Lab126, where they develop the Echo speakers.
The company has also been integrating different music streaming services directly inside its vehicles with apps built to work on its center displays.
Most famously, Tesla has integrated Spotify into its vehicles as the main music streaming app. Last year, the automaker also integrated Tidal. Earlier this week, we also reported on Tesla teasing Apple Music integration coming soon.
So while we don’t think Tesla is working directly with labels, we think there is a high likelihood that the company integrated Dolby Atmos into its cars, sooner or later.

2022/11/24,"Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta is now available to all owners who ordered the Full Self-Driving package in North America. It’s no longer limited to drivers with a high safety score.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program to improve performance with the goal of becoming safer than human drivers and adding more owners to it.
For the last six months are so, there have been over 100,000 Tesla owners in the program, but CEO Elon Musk said that FSD Beta would be available to every owner who bought FSD Beta in North America by the end of the year.
Today, Musk announced on Twitter that FSD Beta is now available to anyone in North America:
Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta is now available to anyone in North America who requests it from the car screen, assuming you have bought this option. Congrats to Tesla Autopilot/AI team on achieving a major milestone!
As we previously reported, the wider release is part of the FSD Beta v11 update, which merges Tesla’s FSD software stack (city driving) with Autopilot’s (highway driving). Tesla is slowly widening the release of this version until all owners with FSD receive it.
I wouldn’t call that a “major milestone” considering the goal it is replacing. It used to be “1 million robotaxis by the end of the year.”
I’ve had FSD for a year now, it’s been getting better with every release. I test it when we drive to a restaurant for dinner and with the last 2 versions it’s made it to the destination with no interventions more than a few times. Granted it’s usually less than 8 miles, but it does go through lots of city streets and traffic lights along with left hand turns and right hand turns. For right hand turns I see it merge into oncoming traffic when it see’s a gap, before it would just wait for no traffic on prior versions. I do question the route it takes though, sometimes down residential streets which I would never take. My wife still doesn’t trust it and doesn’t use it on city streets just the highway, but I have a growing confidence in it. Hoping they improve the summon and still waiting for the drop off and park. On summon I’ve seen it drive around an entire parking lot when just a simple U turn reverse would head it in the right direction.  
Then it was “1 million people with FSD Beta by the end of the year.”
Now it’s just “everyone who paid up to $15,000 for the Full Self-Driving Package gets access to a beta version of the program that doesn’t deliver on the promised performance.” And that’s likely nowhere near 1 million people based on what we are hearing about the FSD take rate. 
I would hardly call that a major milestone. I don’t even know if Tesla is doubling the number of people in the beta program with this move. Either way, I don’t see a clearer path to actually achieving self-driving with this “major milestone.”
What do you think? Let us know in the comments section?

2022/11/23,"Aptera has confirmed that it plans to use Tesla’s charge connector, now known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS), in its upcoming solar electric car.
Earlier this month, Tesla surprised many by announcing that it is opening its EV charge connector in the hope of making it the new standard in North America.
At the time, we reported that Aptera might have had a hand in Tesla deciding to open in charge connector to the industry.
Aptera is a California-based company building a battery and solar-powered super-efficient three-wheeler electric car. It claims a range of up to 1,000 miles and achieves that by making the vehicle extremely lightweight, with three wheels and a drag coefficient (Cd) of only 0.13.
When you are building a super-efficient vehicle like that, every little bit of volume and weight improvement is important down to the connector, and an early prototype of the Aptera SEV featured a Tesla connector.
A few months prior to Tesla opening its charging standard, Aptera launched a petition for Tesla’s charge connector to become the new standard for electric vehicles in North America. It gathered almost 40,000 signatures before Tesla got on board.
Now in an email to reservation holders and investors, Aptera thanked its community for helping push the petition and confirmed that it now plans to integrate Tesla’s connector, now the North American Charging Standard (NACS): 
Remember when our founders started a conversation about the need for a greater emphasis on efficiency and accessibility in EV charging infrastructure? Steve and Chris launched a petition urging policymakers to implement Tesla’s connector and plug (now NACS) as the standard for EV charging in the U.S. With your support, the petition continues to gain momentum. It has received over 40,000 signatures and counting. And just four months later, Tesla announced its decision to open its connector design to the world. We are willing to bet the buzz you generated around the petition played a part in this, and we look forward to incorporating NACS in our sEVs. Thank you for challenging the status quo. 
In the coming months, Aptera is planning to start production of its electric solar car, which starts at $25,900. Deliveries are expected to start next year, and there is already a lot of demand for the vehicle.
The company says that it has accumulated over 37,000 reservations, which each require a $100 deposit (or $70 if you use a referral code).
This could be an awesome development. Aptera would have the best connector design, and it’s going to be a lot easier to adopt now that Tesla has released the technical details.
On the other hand, it could also work great for Tesla.
As we previously reported, Tesla might have a less than altruistic motivation to open its charging standard – even though most people would agree it’s the best.
Win-win-win. Aptera gets the best connector in the industry and, presumably, the best network. Tesla gets to claim they've opened their network to others putting them in line for government dollars. Tesla's existing customers get the comfort of knowing that an Aptera is the vehicle that is least likely to actually need HVDC charging.
The US government recently unlocked billions of dollars in funding for EV charging stations, and while the government didn’t require those stations to work with the CCS connector, it did require that the charging stations receiving funding work with EVs “from more than one automaker.”
For now, this requirement disqualifies Tesla’s Supercharger stations, but if only one automaker decides to adopt Tesla’s connector, or now the North American Charging Standard (NACS), it would qualify Tesla’s Supercharger network for incentives.
If Aptera vehicles had the NACS connector and access to Tesla Superchargers, the automaker’s new charging stations would qualify for the subsidies. It would be a win-win for Tesla and Aptera.
I wouldn’t be shocked if Tesla got involved with Aptera. That would be awesome.

2022/11/23,"Tesla (TSLA) is getting help from Wall Street with several analysts pointing to the stock now being at a buying opportunity level, which is helping to stop the bleeding.
As we reported on Monday, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock is taking a beating, and investors are asking the board to help with a share buyback program.
Investors started a petition to ask Tesla’s board to approve a share buyback program, and it now has over 5,000 signatures. There’s a chance that it could happen since Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month that the board was considering a $5 to $10 billion share buyback program.
This would only be a small help, though, considering that Tesla has erased nearly $500 billion in market capitalization over the last three months.
But until the board decides on a buyback program, Tesla investors have to rely on another ally to help the stock: Wall Street. With the drop in stock price, several Wall Street analysts have issued notes to clients signaling that the stock is entering buying opportunity levels.
Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst covering Tesla, sees almost 100% upside to Tesla’s stock at this price. He wrote in a new note to clients:
In a slowing economic environment, we believe Tesla’s ‘gap to competition’ can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary. With respect to the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) we believe Tesla is by far the best positioned OEM in terms of potential eligibility for consumer tax credits (up to $7,500/unit) and for Section 45x production credits (up to $45/KWh). The current price offers approximately 100% potential upside to our $330 price target which is the highest upside to target we have seen from Tesla in over 5 years.
Citi analyst Itay Michaeli also changed his tune on Tesla following the stock price decrease.
Tesla doesn't need to spend $5 - $10B on stock buybacks.  That money would be much better spent on vertically integrating the battery chemical supply chain.  Over 90% of battery chemicals are refined and concentrated in China today.  Tesla needs to be independent from that, at the very least for vehicles assembled in the USA in order to qualify for IRA tax credits to consumers.
Michaeli upgraded Citi’s rating on Tesla’s stock to neutral, as he noted it now trades for an attractive near-term risk/reward profile.
Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities also came out with a new note on Tesla today with expectations for a strong Q4 with what he believes could be as many as 450,000 deliveries, which would be a major new record for Tesla.
Ives maintains a $250 price target on Tesla’s stock – representing a significant upside.
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is up more than 5% this morning following the notes from the three Wall Street analysts.

2022/11/23,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussed Tesla’s plan for its next Gigafactory in Asia with South Korea’s president – hinting that the country could be on the shortlist.
Tesla aims to increase its production capacity from currently roughly 2 million vehicles per year to 20 million vehicles per year by the end of the decade.
To make the ambitious goal possible, Tesla expects that it will need about eight new Gigafactories.
In order to have eight new vehicle factories running in about eight years, the automaker needs to get going and start announcing some locations in order to start building soon since it generally takes a few years to get a factory up and running.
CEO Elon Musk has previously indicated that Tesla should announce its next Gigafactory location by the end of the year, and he has talked about the next one being in North America.
There has been strong evidence that Tesla is seriously considering locations in Canada. There is also a rumor with some supporting evidence about a potential factory in Mexico.
But Tesla has also talked about building a new Gigafactory in Asia, and now we learn that Musk has discussed those plans with Yoon Suk Yeol, president of South Korea, in a recent virtual meeting.
The discussion between Musk and Yoon was revealed by the President’s office, and while a transcript is not available, they did disclose some topics of discussion (via Bloomberg):

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/11/22,"Tesla confirmed that it now has 40,000 Superchargers in operation around the world, making it the largest global DC fast-charging network.
The Supercharger network has been a critical part of Tesla’s success.
When Tesla first got into the electric vehicle business, it was in its infancy, and the automaker quickly realized that if it wanted to succeed, it couldn’t rely on third-party companies to develop the charging infrastructure to support its electric vehicles.
Instead, Tesla invested in building its own network of DC fast-chargers, the Supercharger network, in order to control the charging experience and not have to rely on other companies to keep up with its EV plans.
Now, 10 years later, the Tesla Supercharger network is the largest, and arguably the best, DC fast-charging network in the world.
Today, the company announced that it now has 40,000 Superchargers around the world:
40k Superchargers around the world — and counting pic.twitter.com/w6tShTkwPA
Those 40,000 Superchargers are located at over 4,000 different locations on the planet.
The network’s growth is also accelerating with Tesla adding over 10,000 Superchargers this year.
On top of deploying many new stations, the automaker is also planning several important changes to the charging network.
Tesla is gradually starting to open the Supercharger network up to non-Tesla electric vehicles, and in the process, it is becoming the largest EV charging provider. Tesla has now opened up hundreds of stations across Europe, and it is preparing to do the same in North America.
In that vein, the company also recently opened up its charge connector, which is the only connector on all Superchargers in North America, in the hope of it becoming the new charging standard in North America.
Furthermore, Tesla is also working on the fourth generation of its Supercharger. It is expected to have a higher peak charge rate and facilitate use for non-Tesla EVs. The first Supercharger V4 stations are expected to be deployed any day.

2022/11/22,"Tesla Cybertruck is getting closer to production, and as the automaker’s first new model in three years, the company badly needs it to gain its momentum back.
But can the electric pickup truck live up to Elon Musk’s hype and the 1.5 million pre-orders?
Musk has been hyping the Cybertruck as not only Tesla’s best vehicle yet but as possibly the best product ever. 
The CEO is known for his use of hyperbole, but he has some credibility when it comes to Tesla’s vehicle programs since each model has raised the bar in one way or the other in the auto industry.
While the launch of the vehicle in 2019 wasn’t without issue or criticism, with the unbreakable window demonstration failing and the polarizing design of the truck, the hype around it has been quite successful.
Musk announced that Tesla received over 250,000 reservations for the Cybertruck within a week of unveiling the vehicle.
Generally, Tesla receives a lot of reservations early after an unveiling, and then it tapers off – but that wasn’t the case with the Cybertruck.
Even throughout the pandemic, sources told us that some Tesla stores were getting hundreds of Cybertruck reservations per week, and Cybertruck pre-orders even helped boost sales.
By 2021, a crowdsourced Cybertruck reservation tally was putting the pre-orders at over 1 million units.
Now in 2022, the same tally put Tesla Cybertruck reservations at over 1.5 million units.
That’s unprecedented demand – though to be fair, Tesla is only asking for a $100 refundable deposit per reservation, which is not the strongest show of interest. But even if the actual order take rate ends up being relatively low, this is still extremely strong demand.
Lately, we have reported on several moves by Tesla showing progress in bringing the electric truck pickup truck to production at Gigafactory Texas. The company says that it is on track for starting production in mid-2023.
Will the production Tesla Cybertruck live up to all the hype?
I’m leaning toward yes. No matter what you think of Elon Musk or Tesla as a company, the automaker’s vehicle programs themselves have never disappointed.
Its latest, the Model Y, is on its way to becoming the best-selling car in the whole world.
If Tesla would deliver the Cybertruck at the price point and with the specs originally announced in 2019, I think it would undoubtedly beat the Model Y.
However, I think it’s clear that’s not going to happen at this point. Tesla might stick to roughly similar specs, but the price would have to be likely 10-20% higher due to inflation over the last three years. 
I think the author (Fred) got it right here. I also agree with his hesitancy and his cautiously optimistic outlook.  Let's be candid, Tesla still makes great vehicles, but Elon Musk has taken the love out of this love affair and multi-year delays and large price increases by Tesla are not as easy to overlook as they once were.  
I think the price range of the Cybertruck will be closer to $50,000-$90,000, and Tesla will – as always – start with deliveries of the higher-end versions.
Even with the higher price, I think the program should be highly successful as long as the specs are similar. I get the brutalist appeal of the stainless steel, paintless body of the truck. Combined with the utility of the vehicle, I think a lot of people will see the Cybertruck rise on the top of their list for a new truck.
Tesla is putting all its top people on it, including David Zhang, Tesla’s longtime Model S and Model X program manager. Zhang also led the Model Y program for a year and did the same for the Cybertruck until the design was locked and going to production.
When it comes to the actual vehicles, I have never been disappointed by Tesla, and I don’t expect the Cybertruck to break the streak.

2022/11/22,"A new Tesla Megapack project has become Europe’s biggest battery system capable of backing up power to around 300,000 UK homes for two hours.
Megapack has quickly emerged as the leading battery system for large utility-scale energy storage systems.
It helped Tesla’s energy division accelerate storage deployment, and the company has now built an impressive backlog of orders.
But Tesla is now working faster than ever through its backlog with 42 Megapacks per week produced at Gigafactory Nevada, in addition to the new Megafactory in California recently coming online and trying to ramp up to an ambitious capacity of 40 GWh of Megapacks per year. 
The new output is resulting in more projects coming online like this 196 MWh battery system, the Pillswood Project, near Hull in the UK.
Harmony Energy Limited, the project developer, announced that they completed the installation of the Tesla Megapacks and brought the project online – becoming what they believe to be the largest battery system in Europe:
The project will provide critical balancing services to the GB electricity grid network whilst also enabling the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy.
Tesla has been deeply involved in the project and managed the installation.
Harmony also confirmed that the project will be operated with Tesla’s Autobidder software:
The project will be operated through Autobidder, Tesla’s algorithmic trading platform, which has demonstrated a strong track record over the past two years in managing the Holes Bay and Contego projects – two existing battery storage projects also developed by Harmony Energy Limited in conjunction with FRV.
In 2020, Electrek spotted a previously unknown new product from Tesla: Autobidder.
It’s a real-time trading and control platform for energy assets like Tesla’s Powerpacks, Powerwalls, and Megapacks, optimized through machine learning to better use and more directly monetize the assets.
As of last year, Tesla Autobidder had over 1.2 GWh of energy storage under management, and it has been adding capacity fast.
Tesla Energy, the company’s energy division deploying stationary energy storage and solar power, is having record quarters one after the other.
Last quarter, Tesla deployed a record high of 2.1 GWh in battery capacity – mostly driven by Megapack growth. The record is expected to be broken again shortly thanks to the new capacity at the Megafactory.

2022/11/22,"Tesla is trying to quash rumors of low demand in China following new discounts offered by the automaker. Tesla China says there will be no more price cuts this year.
Over the last few months, Tesla has pulled on several “demand levers” to boost demand in China.
We reported last month that Tesla reduced the price of the Model 3 and Model Y in China and launched a new referral program. It was the first time in two years that Tesla cut prices on its electric vehicles.
Later, the automaker also launched a new cash rebate with its insurance partners in China.
At first, local media in China reported that these strategies to boost demand worked and even crashed Tesla’s Chinese website with people looking to configure a car.
However, now several media reports out of China claim that the incentives didn’t actually have the expected impact.
Sina Technology News reported that the demand levers only brought about half the amount of orders that were expected:
It is reported that Tesla has launched two rounds of heavyweight price cuts and promotions in the past month. However, the two rounds of promotions did not receive the desired effect from Tesla. After announcing the price cut, Tesla China’s official website was “paralyzed” by the influx of traffic, but according to Sun Shaojun, the founder of Auto Fans, only about 50,000 orders were received by Tesla in this round. Rather than the 100,000-170,000 rumored by the outside world.
In my view, its not the product pipeline.
The main reason is the current situation in China, multiple lock down, Real Estate bubble, wealthy people trying to flee the country.
Growth is significantly down, which is another reason for Wealthy people stay away from luxury goods such as Cars.
In China the Products from Western companies are status symbol, so not buying Tesla is the result of economic slowdown not the product pipeline or rumours.
In another report from Huxiu, it was rumored that Tesla planned to lower further its prices in China (translated from Chinese):
After two sales promotions, Tesla’s order increase is still lower than expected, and it will launch a new “price reduction method” before the end of the year to boost sales.
However, Tesla China has since denied the rumors – indicating that there will be no further price decrease this year, which ends either in under 40 days or 60 days depending which calendar they are referring to. 
Unlike in the US, Tesla still has a press relations department in China and still communicates with the press – sometimes denying reports like this one.
While Tesla denied further price decreases this year, it could eventually still reduce the price next year in China where rules for EV incentives are expected to change in 2023.

2022/11/21,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is currently taking a beating on the public market, and thousands of investors are now asking the company’s board to act to stop the bleeding.
While the overall stock market has seen a downturn over the last few months, there’s no doubt that Tesla has had it harder than most.
The automaker’s stock appears to have lost momentum, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk selling tens of billions of dollars’ worth of shares over the last year did not help.
Today, Tesla’s stock dropped almost 7%, which is a significant drop for a company of that size.
Over the last three months, Tesla has seen its valuation fall from nearly $1 trillion to close to $500 billion:
The company lost roughly half of its value over a relatively short period of time.
Now Tesla investors are asking the company’s board of directors to act to stop the bleeding with a share-buyback program.
A share-buyback program consists of a company buying its own shares at the market price. It’s generally a sign that the company believes its stock is undervalued and is a way to boost the stock price by taking some outstanding shares off the market.
Last month, Musk said that Tesla’s board was seriously considering a buyback program between $5 and $10 billion, but it is still up to the board to move forward with it – and it still hasn’t.
If I was a Tesla stock holder, I would prefer to see the company invest an extra $5-10 billion into something productive.  In this context, a stock buyback really feels like an admission of weakness.  
Now a Charge.org petition started by Alexandra Merz is accumulating an impressive number of signatures from retail investors asking Tesla’s board to implement a share-buyback program.
Merz wrote in the petition:
Retail investors in Tesla stock would like the Board of Tesla Inc. to consider Share Buybacks at the earliest convenience, to use the remaining six weeks of 2022.  The current stock price represents an excellent opportunity to buy a greatly undervalued stock.
The petition lists four main reasons for going forward with the program now:
The petition has already accumulated over 4,000 signatures, which should likely get the attention of the board.

2022/11/21,"Tesla has reportedly placed a massive order of chips for its next-gen Full Self-Driving (FSD) computer with Taiwan’s TSMC. The order is so large that it might make Tesla one of TSMC’s biggest customers.
Back in 2016, Tesla started building a team of chip architects led by legendary chip designer Jim Keller to develop its own silicon.
The goal was to design a super powerful and efficient chip to achieve self-driving in consumer vehicles without additional hardware like in custom-built autonomous vehicles operated by Waymo and Cruise.
In 2019, Tesla finally unveiled the chip as part of its Hardware 3.0 (HW 3.0) self-driving computer.
They claim a factor of 21 improvements in frame-per-second processing versus the previous-generation Tesla Autopilot hardware, which was powered by Nvidia hardware, while only barely increasing the power consumption.
When launching the new chip, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is already working on the next generation of the chip, and they expect it to be three times better than the new chip and roughly two years from production.
While it has been more than two years and the chip hasn’t come, there have been increasing rumors about Tesla working on bringing the chip to production.
For the first generation of its self-driving chip, Tesla had been working with Samsung to produce the device.
In 2020, it was rumored that Tesla was working with TSMC on the next generation.
Good to see TSMC apparently now has a big customer for their upcoming AZ fab, effectively on-shoring those chips from an increasingly at-risk Taiwan to the US.  Increasing supply chain security is a big hot button topic, nice to see Tesla making an improvement there.
TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, is one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
Now Tesla is reportedly moving forward with TSMC and has started placing large orders for its next-gen self-driving chip, according to reports coming out of China and Taiwan (translated from Chinese):
TSMC is receiving orders for vehicles, and it is reported that it has replaced Samsung and won a large order for Tesla’s new generation of fully automatic driver assistance (FSD) chips, which will be produced at 4/5 nanometers. Tesla is expected to become one of TSMC’s top seven customers next year. It is the first time that TSMC’s main customer has a pure electric car factory, which will help resist the impact of consumer electronics boom adjustments.
According to the report, TSMC plans to supply Tesla’s production from a factory in Arizona.
Not much is known about Tesla’s next FSD computer, but the automaker said that it is not required to achieve Full Self-Driving – though it would improve performance.

2022/11/21,"Tesla is teasing the integration of an Apple Music app into its vehicle software, and the info came from an interesting place.
While most other automakers are turning to phone mirroring with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to handle media playback inside their cars, Tesla is insisting on integrating music services and other apps directly into its own user interface.
For years now, the automaker has been integrating different music streaming services directly inside its vehicles with apps built to work on its center displays.
Most famously, Tesla has integrated Spotify into its vehicles as the main music streaming app.
Last year, the automaker also integrated Tidal.
Tesla has been talking about adding a few other major ones, like Apple Music and Amazon Music, for years now, but it has yet to happen.
Now it looks like Tesla owners could be on the verge of getting an Apple Music app as Tesla has been spotted running the app on its own internal vehicles.
Interestingly, the information comes from people going to the Petersen Museum, a car museum in Los Angeles that currently has an exhibit in partnership with Tesla that includes several prototype vehicles, including the Roadster and Cybertruck.
I've wanted this since I got my Tesla. Glad to see it and I hope we get full Dolby Atmos and high bit rate support (Hi-Res Lossless) even if only on wifi 👍
Some people spotted that Tesla is running software inside some of those vehicles that includes an Apple Music app (via Reddit):
The app appears to be fully functional inside Tesla’s own vehicles, but the feature is currently not available to customers.
Tesla generally plans a big “holiday update” in late November or December that includes a lot of new features. It’s possible that Tesla is waiting for that update to pass the Apple Music app onto customers.
With more music apps inside its vehicles, Tesla has made changes to its user interface inside its vehicles in recent software updates in order to more easily manage your music apps and quickly access your main one.

2022/11/18,"The beating that Tesla’s stock (TSLA) has been through has brought it down to near value stock level, says a Morgan Stanley analyst.
Tesla has been delivering record numbers of vehicles, revenue, and profit lately, but it’s not being reflected in its stock performance. The Tesla (TSLA) stock is down over 30% since August:
In comparison, the NASDAQ is down only 8% over the same period.
After trading at multiples over its revenue and earnings for years, Tesla is now getting into the range of a value stock, according to some analysts.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, came out with a new note to clients this week in which he noted that Tesla’s stock is getting closer to his $150 per share bear case and that makes it more attractive on an EBITDA multiple basis:
Tesla shares would trade at approximately 12.5x EV/EBITDA and 23x PE on our FY25 forecast (SBC burdened) which we see as excellent value for a self-funded, 20 to 30% top-line grower in top position to benefit from re-architecting the US on-shore/near-shore/friend-shore renewable supply chain at scale.
The analyst believes that it is creating a “window of opportunity opening for prospective Tesla investors.”
Morgan Stanley is reiterating its overweight (or Buy) rating with a $330 price target, which represents a significant upside over Tesla’s current stock price.
I think part of the reason for Tesla stock to drop is that it's apparent Elon isn't spending any time running Tesla right now, and it's unclear when he might start paying attention to it. Also, competition for Tesla's EVs is widespread, and coming in large numbers over the next couple of years. This will force Tesla to drop prices (as they are starting to do in China) and (hopefully) add more features, as the technological lead the company has is diminishing. Tesla's sky-high vehicle margins will be coming down, and this puts pressure on the share price.

I think Elon should find a good CEO for Twitter and for Tesla. Gwynne Shotwell has done a great job at SpaceX; Musk needs to find the equivalent for his other companies. My guess is Musk will stay focused on Twitter for some months, until he stumbles upon a plan for the future of the app that actually shows some traction. He hates to lose, and I'm sure if he keeps trying long enough at Twitter he'll find something that works. At least well enough for him to declare victory and go spend time on other companies.
It’s clear that Elon Musk is at least partly responsible for this drop in value – both directly by selling billions of dollars’ worth of Tesla stock during the period and indirectly due to some investors losing confidence in him over the Twitter situation.
But it is creating an interesting situation where Tesla seems actually concerned about its stock price for the first time since they actually needed it to be high in order to raise more capital.
The company’s board has confirmed talks about starting a stock buyback program worth between $5 and $10 billion. This would certainly help, but it’s hard to say by how much.
It’s better to focus on the core business which remains strong for Tesla, and it is expected to get stronger next year – especially in the US – after regaining access to the federal EV tax credit.

2022/11/18,"Tesla issued another “safety recall,” a term the company doesn’t like because the recall didn’t require a physical recall of the 30,000 vehicles affected. An over-the-air software update was the fix.
Earlier this year, NHTSA issued a series of recalls on Tesla vehicles that were highly reported in the media.
What was less reported, though, is that almost all of those recalls were fairly simple software issues that Tesla has been able to fix through over-the-air software updates.
Whenever there’s a safety-related issue, NHTSA has to issue a “safety recall,” even if the automaker doesn’t have to physically recall any vehicle, which leads to some confusion.
If it's safety related it's a recall even if it can be fixed in software. That's the way it should be. At the very least it lets owners know they need to install an update (or let it install) to get the fix.
Again last month, a Tesla recall of “1 million vehicles” made many headlines when the recall simply consisted of Tesla changing how its software handled window operations. These instances have led Tesla CEO Elon Musk to complain about the term “recall” and how it is being used against Tesla by the media.
We get another example today of such “recall.” NHTSA released a voluntary recall notice from Tesla for about 30,000 Model X vehicles related to airbag deployment behavior for small children in the front seat:
On certain 2021-2023 Model X vehicles, the restraint control module (RCM) calibration may result in the frontal passenger airbag deploying in an unintended configuration during certain low-speed collision events. This may result in noncompliance with FMVSS 208, Sections 21.4 and 23.4, when a 3- or 6-year-old front passenger, respectively, is unbelted and out of position.
According to the recall notice, Tesla started pushing an over-the-air software update to fix the issue earlier this week:
In a low-speed collision event where a 3- or 6-year-old front passenger is unbelted and out of position, the remedy OTA firmware update ensures that the frontal passenger airbag complies with FMVSS 208, Sections 21.4 and 23.4, whereas a firmware release without the remedy does not ensure compliance.
Here’s the chronology of the recall:

2022/11/18,"Tesla has expanded to Italy its pilot program to give Supercharger access to non-Tesla electric vehicles. It now covers most of Europe.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers. In November 2021, we saw Tesla take its first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands that allowed non-Tesla EV owners to charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it to test more broadly the user experience for both non-Tesla EV owners new to the network and current Tesla owners who will experience more traffic at Tesla charging stations.
In January, the automaker announced that the program was expanding to more stations in Norway and France. A month later, the program was expanded to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands. A few weeks after that, Tesla again expanded the pilot program, this time to include some Supercharger stations in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria.
In May, the automaker added more of Spain and the UK to the program. Tesla then expanded the program again to include Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.
A month later, Tesla opened up the pilot program to several more European countries.
In September, the automaker added Iceland, where now all EVs can access Tesla’s Supercharger network.
This week, Tesla announced another expansion of the pilot program by adding 18 Supercharger stations in Italy to it.
The pilot program, despite still only being a pilot program, now covers most of Europe with the exception of a few central and south European countries and the Balkans.
Also, not all Supercharger stations in those regions are part of the pilot program.
Tesla is still testing how opening the chargers to all EVs is affecting the usage rate of those stations before fully opening the Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs.
The company is expected to do the same in North America, where it is also trying to make its own connector the new charging standard.

2022/11/17,"EV seed-stage company Tenet, which offers consumer loans for EVs, today announced it has secured $25 million in a first-of-its-kind warehouse facility from NY Green Bank for EV loan financing that originates in New York State. 
If you’re not familiar with the term warehouse financing, it’s “a form of inventory financing that involves a loan made by a financial institution to a company, manufacturer, or processor.”
NY Green Bank, a division of New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, is providing Tenet a $10 million warehouse facility with up to $15 million in additional capital available.
It’s the first time a prominent government financial institution is funding an EV-only warehouse, and its resulting rates should help make EV ownership more affordable for New York State residents.
Andrew Kessler, president of NY Green Bank, said:
NY Green Bank is proud to support Tenet’s innovative EV financing model to help more New Yorkers access electric vehicles. Tenet’s model has the potential to provide substantial savings that reward individuals for adopting a climate-friendly lifestyle. 
Accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles supports the state’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 85% by 2050.
Just over a week ago, Tenet announced the first-ever EV-only warehouse facility, and today marks the first time a government green bank has funded one. 
Electrek asked Tenet what differentiates it from traditional lenders, and their spokesperson replied:
We offer rates that are competitive with other lenders (or in the case of Tesla’s financing, 0.25% lower), but unlike other lenders, we offer loan terms as long as 84 months. 
We also offer a deferred payment option that lets drivers immediately lower their monthly payments by deferring up to 25% of their down payment until the end of their loan term. 
$7,500 tax credits and federal rebates can be used to pay that final sum down, or many choose to refinance or trade in at the end of their term. 
Traditional lenders treat EVs and gas cars the same, not accounting for the better value retention of an EV over a gas car. 
In September, New York State set a goal to ensure all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

In September, we learned that Tesla has a plan to build a lithium refining facility on the Gulf Coast of Texas.
At the time, we knew very little about the project other than Tesla was planning on moving fast with hope to start building in Q4 2022.
Now it looks like Tesla is in the last stretch of the approval process with local authorities.
On Wednesday, local news KIII TV reported that Nueces County Commissioners unanimously voted to move negotiations between county leaders and Tesla to executive session, which implies in private.
Nueces County Judge Barbara Canales commented:
You don’t typically, put your lawyer on camera to give you legal advice that you’re supposed to listen to that helps you formulate your opinion. Because you’re negotiating with the other.
They confirmed that they are negotiating with Tesla on tax abatements for a piece of property near Robstown, Texas, 25 minutes outside of Corpus Christi.
More details about the project were revealed as part of the negotiations, including that Tesla would invest about $365 million in the lithium plant, which would employ about 165 people full-time plus another 250 construction jobs for about two years.
Tesla presented the project as the “development of a battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility, the first of its kind in North America, as well as facilities to support other types of battery materials processing, refining, and manufacturing and ancillary manufacturing operations in support of Tesla’s sustainable product line.”
The automaker is also touting its project as having a smaller impact on the environment than other lithium refining:
Tesla will process raw ore material into a usable state for battery production. The process Tesla will use is innovative and designed to consume less hazardous reagents and create usable byproducts compare to the conventional process.
In the application, Tesla made it clear that the final product from this new plant will be battery-grade lithium hydroxide:
The final product, battery-grade lithium hydroxide, will be packaged and shipped by truck and rail to various Tesla battery manufacturing sites supporting the necessary supply chain for large-scale and electric vehicle batteries.
Tesla also included a long list of improvements it plans to bring to the site including: supporting infrastructure and lithium refining equipment, operation buildings, laboratory for R&D (research and development) and quality controls, new access roadways, parking lots, loading docks, logistics facilities, process warehouse and maintenance buildings, utility distribution improvements including underground utility piping, structural foundations, pads, supports, electrical substations, rail spur for use exclusive to this project, cooling towers, fire prevention equipment, safety equipment, storm water management facilities, waste management facilities, and wastewater treatment infrastructure.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously called lithium refining a “license to print money” due to the high margins in the industry.

2022/11/16,"Elon Musk has a successor in mind to become the next Tesla CEO, according to new comments from Tesla board member James Murdoch.
Musk has always had a strange relationship with his role as CEO of Tesla.
He undoubtedly has had an incredible impact on the company, which is widely credited for significantly accelerating the auto industry’s transition to electric vehicles, but he originally didn’t want to be CEO.
Musk took over during a transitional period at Tesla that saw two CEOs – neither of which lasted for long – in 2008-2009 after co-founder Martin Eberhard was ousted amid difficulties in delivering the Roadster.
At the time, Musk put all his remaining cash from the sale of Paypal into the struggling automaker and took over as CEO. 
It took about a decade of struggling, but over the last few years and under Musk’s leadership as CEO, Tesla has become the most valuable automaker, and it can now produce millions of electric vehicles per year.
Over the years, Musk has talked about eventually stepping down as CEO and focusing on his other roles at Tesla, which include “product architect.” However, the CEO suggested that shift back in the days when he was still chairman of Tesla’s board, a role that he lost as part of a settlement with the SEC.
The South Africa-born engineer said that he would “always be with Tesla,” but it would not necessarily be in the role of CEO.
This possibility of Musk stepping down as CEO of Tesla has been in focus lately due to the fact that he added even more work to his plate with the acquisition of Twitter.
On top of the Twitter acquisition, Musk’s $54 billion compensation plan for his role as CEO of Tesla is currently on trial after an investor sued the company claiming that it wasn’t necessary to retain Musk at Tesla, and also over concern about Musk’s control over the Tesla board of directors around the time the compensation package was approved.
Tesla board member James Murdoch was on the stand today during the trial and made an interesting comment about Musk’s future as Tesla CEO.
At times in my life I had enough time to work long hours. At other times family kept me so busy I was lucky to keep up with 40 hours. In support of all those people in the latter category I would never take a job with Musk and I will no longer consider buying anything from him. Perhaps he saw a bunch of company dorms in China, thought it was a great idea, and then believes that we should all be working long hours in America. He seems as out of touch with humanity as Doc Martin - just without the humor. I just hope that the government is keeping a close eye on SpaceX to make sure that people aren't working 80 hours a week and making mistakes due to exhaustion.
During his prior deposition months ago, Murdoch said that Musk never mentioned a potential successor for his role of CEO at Tesla, but on the stand today, he said that Musk actually did suggest a potential successor since then.
The director didn’t specify who, but he did suggest that Musk mentioned the person in a somewhat recent conversation.
Tesla was rumored to have previously offered the role of CEO to Herbert Diess before he became CEO of Volkswagen. Diess recently left Volkswagen, and the long-time auto executive, who is known to have a friendly relationship with Musk, has yet to announce his next project.
Possible internal successors include CFO Zach Kirkhorn and Drew Baglino, SVP Powertrain and Energy Engineering.

2022/11/16,"A new survey shows a significant drop in consumer interest in buying Tesla vehicles, and we might know the reason why.
Kelley Blue Book has released its latest Brand Watch survey, and the company claims that it points to “plummeted” shopper interest in Tesla vehicles:
Meanwhile, shopper interest in Tesla plummeted quarter over quarter. Tesla fell to sixth from fifth in the rankings of most-shopped luxury brands, with 12% of all luxury shoppers considering a Tesla – down 3 percentage points from Q2 2022 and notably the largest quarter-over-quarter loss for any luxury brand. Shopping consideration for the Model 3 sedan declined by 10% from the second quarter, and the Tesla Model Y and Model S both fell off the Top 10 most-shopped luxury vehicle list for the first time in two years.
Despite the drop, the Tesla Model 3 remains the third-most-desired vehicle, according to the survey.
The Model 3 is also number one in the luxury category based on the new survey.
But, the more expensive Model Y had a somewhat significant drop in interest in the United States, and that might be explained by the fact that the SUV is expected to qualify for the new federal tax credit starting in January.
While Tesla has dominated the EV market in the United States for years despite being at a disadvantage against other automakers who still had access to the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, the impact of getting access back was expected to be felt more strongly as we get close to the new incentive.
Vanessa Ton, senior research and market intelligence manager at Cox Automotive, commented on the new report:
The third quarter also saw a noteworthy drop in consideration for Tesla, which could have been caused by a number of factors. Increased competition from other automakers offering more new electric vehicles, price hikes and a lack of new products all may have contributed to Tesla’s considerable decline. However, we have seen Tesla’s shopping numbers drop before and they always eventually rebound. It will be interesting to see if they rebound more slowly or quickly this time around.
Tesla's customer service is not great--repairs take a long time, insurance takes forever to respond, there are still flaws in brand new vehicles, etc.  Any repair not covered by insurance or warranty is incredibly expensive--to the point where you don't save money on repairs over an ICE vehicle. Which is very different from any other EV out there. And there are now other good options, especially for those actually able to pay Tesla prices. I believe that Tesla (and Elon Musk) will always have a fan base--but that's not the same as a customer base, which must be much larger for a company maintain and grow its profitability. For the average buyer who wants to switch to an EV, there's a lot more competition now. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk was recently asked about allegations that Tesla is seeing demand going down, and the CEO reiterated that he doesn’t see demand being a problem for the foreseeable feature.
I think demand slowing down at least some in the United States right now makes sense – especially for the Model Y, which should fully qualify for the tax credit.
Tesla has done extremely well without it, but it has a different effect when it is about to become available. People who would qualify for it will think twice about buying right now if it means that delivery could happen this year and they would miss out on $7,500 in tax credit.
But as Ton said, Tesla’s demand always bounces back, and this time, it should be a big one in the United States once the incentive is in place.

2022/11/16,"Tesla has reported two new fatal crashes involving Autopilot or Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta to NHTSA, but the automaker is not releasing a lot of details.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released its first report on “Safety Performance of Advanced Vehicle Technologies” earlier this year.
The report was about data on accidents involving vehicles equipped with driver-assist (ADAS) features, and as we reported at the time, Tesla Autopilot topped the list for the most crashes.
However, the data didn’t include miles driven with the driver-assist features, and Autopilot is suspected to also dominate on that metric, which would put the crashes in a different perspective.
Tesla has now reported dozens of new crashes to NHTSA, including two new fatal crashes while using ADAS features.
Here are the two reports of the fatal crashes:
The reports include a lot of redacted information that limit our understanding of those accidents.
From the table the vehicle was stopped and struck on the right side at the time of the accident.  Not quite sure what ADAS has to do with it, unless it is FSD Beta and put the vehicle in a dangerous position which seems unlikely.
It’s not clear if the crashes involved Autopilot or FSD Beta. NHTSA separates level 2 driver-assist systems and self-driving systems, but Tesla is reporting FSD Beta as a level 2 system despite its name. 
A lot of items are listed as “unknown” in the reports despite Tesla having access to a lot of telemetrics in its vehicles.
One of the accidents also happened back in December 2021, but it is just being reported now. The other happened in September 2022, and it was reported in the latest batch of crashes reported by Tesla last month.
NHTSA has currently several ongoing investigations related to Tesla’s driver-assist features.

2022/11/16,"A former Tesla executive has pled guilty to charges of insider trading in Australia after he bought stock in a lithium mine before a deal with the automaker was announced.
Despite only recently starting the production of its own cells, the automaker has been involved in securing the supply of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and other minerals for its battery cell suppliers for a while.
More recently, Tesla started to not only deal with established mining companies, but it also started to sign contracts for off-take agreements with junior mining companies looking to build new mining projects that would increase the supply of some critical resources for batteries.
This strategy helps those companies raise money to build their mining projects.
In 2020, Tesla signed such an agreement with Piedmont Lithium, a company developing a lithium project in North Carolina.
The automaker agreed to buy about one-third of Piedmont’s planned 160,000 tonnes annual spodumene lithium production for at least five years.
While the mine is located in North Carolina, Piedmont Lithium is an Australian company, and Kurt Schlosser, Tesla’s head for Australia and New Zealand, was told about the deal ahead of time.
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Australia equivalent of the SEC, announced today that Schlosser has pleaded guilty to two counts of insider trading:
On 16 September 2020, Mr Schlosser acquired 86,478 shares in the mining company Piedmont Lithium Limited after being informed, in his role as country director of Tesla Australia, of inside information regarding an in-principle agreement that Tesla Australia’s ultimate holding company, Tesla Inc, had reached with Piedmont for the supply of lithium.
After the agreement between Tesla and Piedmont was revealed, the share of the latter rose from $0.12 up to a high of $0.60 at one point.
According to ASIC, Schlosser pocketed $28,883.53 in profit from selling his shares after the news broke. He also shared the information with a friend – hence the second count of insider trading.
It is not known when Schlosser left Tesla and if it was related to the case of insider trading.
The former executive will be back in court on December 16 for sentencing.

2022/11/15,"Tesla is aiming to produce about 100 Tesla Semi electric trucks this year, which is a bit higher than what was anticipated.
After five years of waiting, Tesla is now finally in early production with the Tesla Semi electric truck.
Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near Gigafactory Nevada. At the time, we were told that the production equipment installed would be for about five electric trucks per week.
That would be only 250 trucks per year, but Tesla always planned to move to higher volume production at Gigafactory Texas.
Last month, the automaker disclosed that it is aiming to ramp up Tesla Semi production to 50,000 units per year in 2024.
However, we didn’t know much about the ramp-up between now and then.
Today, we get a new piece of data, and it is interestingly coming from the trial over Elon Musk’s CEO compensation plan at Tesla.
Robin Denholm, chair of Tesla’s board, was testifying today for the trial and she released the information that Tesla was aiming for 100 Tesla Semi trucks this year (via WSJ):
Tesla, for example, might produce 100 semitrailer trucks this year, Ms. Denholm said, years behind schedule. 
Hey Fred & Team Electrek -- I can only assume that your average number of comments per article is in the toilet compared to pre-redesign. Are you making changes soon? Part of the reason many people came here was the community in the comments (the good and the bad). Fewer comments will mean fewer repeat visits, I can assure you. The number of clicks now required to see comments... the new comment plug-in sign-up... ugh. I'm here now but may not stick around. Btw, I'm a usability expert (day job) so I'd be happy to help. If not, hope you can make some changes soon.
Tesla is going to be holding a delivery event for the Tesla Semi on December 1, but the electric truck has been in production since early October.
Considering the vehicle has been in production since early October, it is possible that Tesla has been building electric trucks for the last two months, and it will show up at the delivery event with already a few dozen trucks.
Nonetheless, 100 Tesla Semi trucks by the end of the year would be higher than expected and would set the vehicle program up for a decent year in 2023, leading up for its goal of a capacity for 50,000 trucks in 2024.
If Tesla delivers more than 40 Tesla Semi by the end of the year, I would be pleasantly surprised.

2022/11/15,"Construction workers at Tesla Gigafactory Texas are suing for labor violations amid claims of unsafe conditions at the sprawling site.
Gigafactory Texas is Tesla’s latest giant factory site under construction with several large buildings being built to support electric vehicle and battery production.
Tesla has been employing thousands of construction workers at the site over the last two years through contractors and subcontractors.
Now some of them are now filing a complaint and case referral with the federal Department of Labor, according to a new report from The Guardian:
Construction workers who toiled on one of Tesla’s sprawling so-called Gigafactories will file a complaint and a case referral with the federal Department of Labor on Tuesday detailing exploitative work conditions they say they experienced while building the plant.
The allegations in the complaint include claims of being forced to work in unsafe conditions, faking accreditations, and even wage theft.
One of the workers, only known as Victor, claimed to have been given fake, digital OSHA 10 and 30 certificates by his manager without ever receiving the required training. In the complaint filed by Workers Defense Project, which is helping the Gigafactory workers, the names of the contractors involved have been redacted.
Please fix the headline - the word ""sue"" is a bit ambiguous and most people interpret it to mean that a lawsuit has been filed. No lawsuit has been filed. Workers Defense Project has helped some construction workers make complaints to the Labor Department and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  DOL and OSHA will now review the complaints and send notices to the contractors and subs. If the contractors and subs fail to remedy the situation, they may face fines or lawsuits from DOL and/or OSHA.

Worker's Defense Project does this kind of thing routinely, because workplace safety violations and wage theft are not unusual in the Texas construction industry. It is unlikely that Tesla is responsible for these violations, or will be adversely affected by the DOL and OSHA complaints, due to the layers of contractors and subs that actually administer the project and perform the work.
Victor also described dangerous working conditions at the construction site:
He told the Guardian that his team was directed to work on the metal factory roof at night with no lights, labor on top of turbines that were blowing smoke without protective masks, and otherwise put themselves at risk without basic information on how to stay safe.
In one instance, Victor said he and his colleagues were expected to keep up production on a flooded first floor – despite observing there was live wiring all over the place and cords in the water. He remembers telling his wife: “I’m going to die in this factory.”
On another occasion, Victor worked with a man who was so desperate for money he returned to the job in a brace after breaking his arm on site.
As for the claim of wage theft, other workers in the complaint claimed that they were asked to keep working over Thanksgiving last year, but they claimed to have never received the double-pay bonuses they had been promised.
While none of these workers were directly employed by Tesla, Hannah Alexander, a staff attorney for Workers Defense Project, claimed the automaker could have still helped construction workers, but it “didn’t seem interested”:
“Tesla was not – didn’t seem – interested in using their power to ensure that everyone was able to go home at the end of the day without injuries, with all the money that they’re owed in their pockets.”
Now the case is in the hands of the Department of Labor. Tesla has yet to comment on the case.

2022/11/14,"Tesla investors are starting to get increasingly concerned that Elon Musk’s focus on Twitter is taking him away from the automaker as its stock is falling.
The CEO tried to reassure shareholders saying that he has “Tesla covered,” but he also said that he is sleeping at Twitter’s headquarters “until the social media is fixed.”
It is not hypothetical that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is negatively affecting Tesla.
The CEO had to sell billions of dollars worth of Tesla stocks to secure the transaction, which contributed to a significant decline in Tesla’s market capitalization.
Tesla has lost more in value since Musk’s acquisition of Twitter than the total value of the $44 billion acquisition.
Musk has even announced that Tesla will initiate a stock buyback program, pending board approval, to help boost the stock price.
Beyond Musk selling Tesla stocks, fans and investors are also concerned about the CEO spending less time at the automaker as he tries to implement his vision at Twitter.
One of those fans complained to Musk on Twitter, and the CEO responded that he has “Tesla covered too” and he will at Tesla “part of this week”:
I have Tesla covered too. Will be there part of this week.
However, Musk also said that he would be sleeping at Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco “until the org is fixed”:
I’ve been at Twitter SF HQ all night. Will be working & sleeping here until org is fixed.
The CEO has been known to spend a lot of time at his companies when they are facing challenges, including sleeping on Tesla’s factory floor when ramping up Model 3 production.
Tesla might be better off without Musk at this point.

Musk is clearly great at setting up companies and coming up with initial directions.  It's not clear he's good at leading an established company to optimize it's every move just right.  Tesla is big enough and has an established profitable revenue stream that is enormous (all of the auto industry) that going after that is enough for quite a while.  They don't need to come up with new things like optimus robots to find a new market.  The old one is good enough, and if that one isn't enough, then there's always solar roofs.

Musk is making a complete mess of Twitter, firing people responsible for their main revenue drivers and in other ways demonstrating he doesn't understand the major parameters of the company.  He's offended a large part of the twitterverse and many content providers who are the reason people visit Twitter are looking at ways to leave. 

Moreover he's also offended a number of potential Tesla customers.  Tesla's mission has been to save the world from the climate crisis, so why did he suggest people vote for the pollution party, just at a time when other companies are producing viable alternative BEVs.

He's demonstrated that he can't hang on to many of his most important executives.  As he devolves from the pressure of failing at Twitter, he may make more mistakes at Twitter.

Musk was great for a long time, but he's no longer indispensable.
With Musk running Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and Neuralink, investors were already worried about him spreading himself too thin.
Now that he is adding Twitter into the mix, the concern is more than fair – especially for Tesla shareholders since it’s an extremely large public company.
There have been talks before about replacing Musk as CEO of Tesla to have someone who can focus entirely on Tesla and have Musk focus more on his “product architect” role.
For the sake of Tesla’s mission, it might be worth revisiting that option. What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/11/14,"Elon Musk’s top lieutenant at Tesla, Omead Afshar, is now working at SpaceX after leaving Tesla over a strange controversy.
Omead Afshar’s official position at Tesla is director of the office of the CEO – Elon Musk’s office. But in practice, he has been seen as Musk’s chief of staff since Sam Teller, Musk’s longtime top lieutenant, left the company in 2019.
More recently, he was known to lead the construction of Gigafactory Texas, and he is often the go-between with Musk and his direct reports.
This summer, a report came out that claimed Afshar was about to be fired from Tesla over a curious controversy where he allegedly placed an order for a “special glass” for a “secret project,” which got flagged by the automaker’s finance department as suspicious – triggering an internal investigation.
The basis of the investigation was that an employee was using company resources to secure materials for a project that potentially wasn’t related to Tesla.
According to the report, Tesla had already fired employees related to the investigation, and Afshar was going to be next.
Now a few months later, we don’t have an update on the internal investigation, but a new report from Bloomberg claims that Afshar is now working at SpaceX, another company owned and led by Musk:
Afshar has been named vice president: Starship production at the company, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to two of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.
Tesla, SpaceX, Musk, nor Afshar commented on the report. Afshar hasn’t updated his LinkedIn profile, which still shows he works at Tesla.
Some people work simultaneously at both Tesla and SpaceX, but Afshar has not been seen at Gigafactory Texas, which is also Tesla’s headquarters, in weeks.
Tesla is very stingy about promoting execs (officially) to senior executive positions, where they would need to report whether they are still at the company or any insider trading.
In other companies, Afshar would have probably fit the requirements, but not at Tesla.
But now we probably will never know what happened here, but it looks like Musk might not be able to use Afshar at Tesla anymore so he is working at SpaceX now.

2022/11/14,"Tesla confirmed that it is going to hold an event on December 1 for the first Tesla Semi deliveries. More details about the production version of the electric truck could be released.
While Tesla used to hold regular unveiling events for new products and production vehicle programs, the automaker moved away from them since the pandemic and instead held Battery Day and AI Day events annually.
CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla wouldn’t unveil new vehicles for a while as it focuses on ramping up production of its existing vehicle programs.
But now we learn that Tesla will hold a rare event for the start of deliveries and unveiling of a new production-version vehicle: Tesla Semi.
While the automaker hasn’t officially announced the event, Martin Viecha, Tesla’s head of investor relations, confirmed it by announcing that Tesla will hold a random drawing for retail shareholders to join:
If you want to attend the Semi delivery event as a retail shareholder, please make sure you have a verified shareholder status on our IR website (unverified manual submissions are eligible if the paperwork is correct). We'll be doing a random draw where 1 share = 1 entry. https://t.co/odL8a0t43L
The executive is referencing the new Tesla Shareholder Platform that the company launched this summer to offer new features to its retail shareholders.
It now sounds like one of the first uses of the platform is going to be this drawing for the Tesla Semi event.
As is usually the case for Tesla delivery events, the automaker is expected to not only hand over the first vehicles to customers, but it should also hold a presentation about the vehicle program, which is long overdue for the Tesla Semi.
Tesla Semi was first unveiled in 2017, and the production version was delayed several times. Last summer, Tesla offered a small update on the production version, but the automaker is expected to release more details, including the price and more configurations beyond roughly “300 miles” and “500 miles” of range.
Published efficiency specs for Class 8 BEV Semi trucks (kWh/mile):
DTNA eCascadia 2.0 
Nikola Tre 2.2 
Volvo  FH 2.9 
BYD 8TT 3.8

The 500 mile version of Tesla Semi is rumored to have 650 kWh of batteries for an efficiency of 1.3 kWh/mile. This advantage is not surprising since the Tesla Semi was a brand new design while the other were made from existing diesel semi chassis and bodies.

More details on the efficiency of the truck beyond “less than 2 kWh per mile” that Tesla currently quotes would also be welcomed by customers.
We need more efficiency and pricing details to do the math on the Tesla Semi and really understand its potential impact on the trucking industry.
There could also be a surprise at the event. After all, Tesla unveiled the new Roadster as a surprise at the original Tesla Semi unveiling, and the Roadster is also due for an update.
It might be wishful thinking, but I think a new Roadster prototype, or even an early production look since the new Roadster is supposed to arrive next year, would be cool to see and bring back some of the fun that came with Tesla events.

2022/11/14,"Tesla is showing some strong resilience in California’s crashing car market and is helping boost EV market share to a new record.
With the slowdown that came with the pandemic and the more recent supply chain issues, the auto industry has yet to go back to pre-2020 levels of deliveries.
California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA) released its latest report based on new car registrations in the state and confirmed that the market is down 16% year-to-date as of September.
But there are some silver linings in the results.
The biggest one is that the EV market share in California is at a new high of 16%, and it is gaining momentum:
It looks like without electric vehicles, California’s auto market would be crashing even more.
Tesla vehicles still represent most electric vehicles delivered in the state, and brand registration stats highlight just how important the Tesla brand has become in California.
So far in 2022, Tesla is one of only two car brands, along with Genesis, to be growing in the state:
This decline from other brands has enabled Tesla to gain a 10% overall market share in the state with only four models available. It is even catching up to Toyota.
Tesla now has the top-selling passenger car, Model 3, and the top-selling overall vehicle in the state, including light trucks, Model Y:
As you can see in the chart above, Tesla Model 3 is even beating the Toyota Camry in sales – a feat it first achieved earlier this year.
Other electric vehicles are also contributing to the growing EV market share in California, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, but the CNCDA doesn’t break down the sales of Mustangs per model.
Not a surprise to see the ICE market starting to crumble. The constant talk of phase out dates and the rise of EVs should have most rational consumers either dipping their toe in the EV waters, or at least delaying the purchase till they can afford one or they decide the infrastructure is ready.
EV market shares in California already jumped from under 14% to 16% in 2022, but I think it could end the year near 20% with a strong Q4.
Tesla is likely going to increase deliveries thanks to the production ramp at Gigafactory Texas.
But next year is when things could truly go wild for EVs, and I could see market shares doubling to 40%.
The renewed federal incentive is going to help, but the biggest thing is going to be higher volumes of vehicles like the F150 Lightning and new model launches like the Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and many more.

2022/11/13,"Tesla will assist Chinese authorities in investigating a dramatic Tesla Model Y crash in Guangdong, China, which killed two and injured three. But rumors have been flying on social media about potential causes of the crash, most of which are untrue or impossible.
The accident happened on November 5, and video has been circulating on Chinese social media. The CCTV video shows (warning: graphic) a Tesla Model Y attempting to park, then speeding off on a two-lane road, swerving between lanes at high speed, sideswiping cars and motorcycles before eventually crashing into a storefront about 30 seconds and 2.6 kilometers later.
An unnamed family member of the 55-year-old male driver stated that the driver had issues with the brake pedal when he was about to pull over in front of the family store, as reported by Jimu News. As best we can tell, the driver survived with injuries.
Tesla, as is often the case, has claimed that vehicle logs show that the brake pedal was not applied during the incident, and that the accelerator pedal was pressed for a significant portion of the event, and cautioned against people believing “rumors” about the incident. CCTV video shows that the brake lights were not illuminated in rear shots of the car, though they appear to turn on shortly at about 23 seconds after the start of the incident.
Police in Guangdong will work with a third-party agency to assess vehicle logs and CCTV footage to determine the truth about the incident.
(Warning: People die in this video, though it is not immediately clear from the footage.)
Tesla has faced other accusations of malfunctioning brake pedals in the past, including from a Chinese customer who staged a protest at their Shanghai Motor Show booth claiming that an accident she was in was a result of a brake failure. These accusations are not just limited to China – Tesla has also received many complaints in the US, which it responded to in a blog post claiming “there is no ‘unintended acceleration’ in Tesla vehicles.”
These complaints were examined by the NHTSA, which found that incidents of sudden unintended acceleration in Teslas were a result of driver error, and not due to any design flaw in the vehicle. The NHTSA reminds drivers that there are 16,000 preventable crashes per year in the US due to pedal error and cautions drivers to be aware of this problem.
This didn’t stop social media from swirling with rumors about the latest Tesla crash, though. Both on Chinese and English-language social media, there have been many posts suggesting various causes without evidence, most of which do not stand up to basic scrutiny.
Some have claimed that the vehicle was attempting to autopark and then went haywire, running off at high speed. But the type of swerving, hard-accelerating behavior shown in the video is not characteristic of Autopilot, much less autopark, and both would have been disabled by a tap on the brake pedal at any point.
Others stated that the vehicle’s motor is too strong for the brakes to overcome, but given that the brake lights were not on and vehicle brakes are designed to overcome the force of the motor/engine, this explanation is not satisfactory either.
The accusations are similar to those that have happened with other vehicles. Famously, Toyota faced a “sudden unintended acceleration” recall in 2009-2011, where the automaker recalled various parts of their vehicles in response to an uptick in reports of unintended acceleration. While design flaws in floor mats or accelerator pedals may have contributed to some cases, most cases were found to be issues of driver error – and were more common among elderly and unskilled drivers. Increased reports tracked media coverage of the problem, with more reports coming in as media coverage intensified.
China is Tesla’s second-largest market. The company recently started pulling demand levers, including cutting prices, as a response to possibly softening demand in the country.
While it is entirely possible that there is some unexamined cause here, it’s almost certainly the same cause as it always is in these situations: Someone pressed the wrong pedal, and then kept pressing it when they panicked.
This doesn’t mean there can’t be a design flaw involved. I’ve noticed first-time Tesla drivers getting the pedals crossed (i.e., accidentally pressing both pedals at the same time) perhaps more often than I would expect in a vehicle. It’s possible that the position of the pedals is a little closer than they should be, though I am not an engineer with particular expertise in pedal safety regulations, so take that with a grain of salt. Also, whenever this happens, the car has popped up a warning about crossed pedals and automatically cut power to the accelerator, favoring the brake over the accelerator – so that couldn’t be the cause of this crash.
Brakes are hydraulic and are far more powerful than motors on every vehicle ever made.  Autopilot can not override manual inputs.  Driver most likely panicked or had a medical issue.
But crediting this to Autopilot just doesn’t make any sense. This is clearly not Autopilot behavior, as anyone familiar with the system (and aware of its downsides) can tell. I’d bet that the third-party investigation will find that the driver was just pressing the accelerator the whole time, and that this was human error, as is the case in many crashes. So why so much discussion of this Tesla crash specifically, and not the thousands of other “pedal errors”?
Tesla is a popular topic on social media – it’s a high-profile brand, it’s different, and it drives a lot of traffic for various reasons, one of which due to its firebrand CEO who loves to be the center of attention. Whenever anything happens with Tesla, people talk about it – there are deadly crashes in various cars every day, most of which do not generate nearly as much social media discussion or articles (such as this one, sigh) about them. People just always have something to say about Tesla.
The presence of the social media “rumors” Tesla warned against can especially be expected right now. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has attracted criticism lately due to the “dumpster fire” associated with his purchase of Twitter, the very social media platform where many of these rumors are circulating. His erratic behavior has led to public resentment that the world’s richest man would spend so much of his time and effort on polluting information streams instead of fixing his companies. So some number of people will be uninterested in seeing “his side” of the story, and will actively distrust anything that he or Tesla has to say.
If Tesla’s mission is to “accelerate the advent of sustainable transport” – and they are the company most responsible for electrification currently – then it doesn’t seem particularly productive for the CEO to spend so much time acting erratically on social media, turning public opinion against him and his company and its mission. We’d like to see less of that.

2022/11/12,"With the opening of its proprietary charge connector, Tesla has confirmed its Supercharger is way more powerful than we previously thought.
It points to up to 900 kW of potential total output.
Yesterday, Tesla surprised many by announcing that it is opening its EV charge connector in the hope of making it the new standard in North America.
Like the rest of the industry, we are still digging into all the documentation that Tesla released about its proprietary charge connector to convince people to adopt it.
While we haven’t finished reviewing everything, one thing is clear based on the new documents: Tesla’s Superchargers are capable of much higher capacity than is currently available.
In the documentation, Tesla describes two versions of its charging technology capable at operating at 500 volts and 1,000 volts, but they are interoperable.
Tesla writes:
Two interfaces are shown below, a 500V configuration and 1,000V configuration. The two interfaces are mechanically interoperable (i.e. the 1,000V inlet can mechanically receive the 500V connector and the 500V inlet can receive the 1,000V connector).
Here are the two designs:
The capacity to operate at 1,000v is new information that wasn’t known about Tesla’s charging capacity before other than for the upcoming Megawatt charging for the Tesla Semi truck.
Furthermore, Tesla noted in the documents that it has been able to operate at over 900 amps:
Tesla has successfully operated the North American Charging Standard above 900A continuously with a non-liquid cooled vehicle inlet.
900A at 1,000v would point to 900 kW of total output or more than 3 times the current stated capacity of Tesla’s most recent Supercharger stations.
This would back up Tesla’s statement in the blog post announcing its charging standard now named the ‘North American Charging Standard (NACS)’ that it is “twice as powerful” as CCS:
With more than a decade of use and 20 billion EV charging miles to its name, the Tesla charging connector is the most proven in North America, offering AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging in one slim package. It has no moving parts, is half the size, and twice as powerful as Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors.
Looks like Tesla is not kidding about this claim. Now, this is specifically about the charge connector, but Tesla wouldn’t have designed it with the capacity without also planning to have the rest of its charging technology capable of matching it.
It points to Tesla future-proofing its Supercharging technology for a much higher output.
The thing I like most about the Tesla charging connector is the size. The other ones are just too bulky.
This has some interesting implications. Tesla has yet to adopt 800-volt powertrain technology in its electric vehicles.
Other automakers have, but Tesla appears to have future-proofed its charging technology before trying to make it a standard.
Therefore, it’s possible that we are finally going to see Tesla moving to 800v for its upcoming new vehicles, like the Cybertruck.
Either way, it looks like Tesla’s charge connector is not a bottleneck for high charging output.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/11/12,"Tesla is starting the rollout of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) v11 update, which is supposed to be the wider release to everyone who bought FSD in North America.
It is both an exciting and scary step as it is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot highway stacks.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility rests with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system, despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
There are currently over 100,000 Tesla owners in the program, but CEO Elon Musk said that FSD Beta would be available to every owner who bought FSD Beta in North America by the end of the year.
Musk linked that wider release to the release of Tesla’s FSD Beta v11 update, which is expected to merge Tesla’s FSD Beta software stack primarily used on roads and city streets, with Tesla’s Autopilot software stack, which is used as a level 2 driver assist system on highways.
The CEO has now confirmed that Tesla has started rolling out FSD Beta v11 late last night.
We don’t have access to the release notes yet, but again, the main new feature is expected to be the merger of the two software stacks.
This is both exciting and scary. 
It’s an important step for the FSD Beta program, with a more complete product merging city and highway driving, and exciting for those who don’t have access to it yet. 
With FSD, we tend not to hear much about highway driving, because it's pretty boring to watch videos of highway driving where the car does what's expected. When Navigate on Autopilot came out, there were plenty of reviews and videos, and much of its behavior was tenuous. But three years later, it works well. People don't tend to make videos when there are no new features.  

With all the problems that FSD has on local streets, it's easy to forget that it's working as expected on highways, where it's the most valuable. 

With NoA, I wouldn't say that I trust it to follow a route of hundreds of miles with multiple freeway changes, but I would say that I'd expect it to do so. 

There are very rare occasions when NoA disengages for no clear reason. And it actually took a step back when the B pillar cameras were activated, since there are times when NoA will become not available, since the B pillar camera is being hit by the Sun on the horizon, even though it shouldn't affect highway driving. But if NoA can do so well, I'd expect FSD to fill the holes in. 
Though I don’t know that it will actually reach everyone who bought the package. Has Tesla upgraded all the cameras and computers it needed to upgrade?
It’s also scary because the FSD Beta is still far from deserving of its “Full Self-Driving” name and has been known to have widely varying performance, especially in different markets outside of California.
Tesla drivers testing FSD Beta need to be extremely careful and stay vigilant at all times, ready to take control. Please use the system with the most attention possible.
We will report back on the update when we have more details, and hopefully, we are able to test it soon.

2022/11/11,"Tesla announced that it is opening its electric car charge connector in the hope of making it the new standard in North America. Why is the company doing this now, 10 years after it debuted in the 2012 Model S?
Earlier this year, Aptera launched a petition for Tesla’s charge connector to replace CCS as the new standard for electric vehicles in North America.
The petition has received almost 40,000 signatures, which is impressive for such a niche subject as EV charging standards.
When Tesla started making electric cars, there was no dominant charging standard, and therefore, Tesla developed its own. Things have changed a lot since then, and now, CCS has become the dominant charging standard in North America and Europe.
While CCS has now been almost globally adopted, it doesn’t necessarily make it the best charging standard out there. Most experts agree that Tesla’s connector is a more efficient and elegant design, but it would be hard to make it the standard because Tesla is behind it and the auto industry is quite competitive.
However, Tesla is making a move today that could help make it the new standard.
The automaker announced that it is opening its connector to the auto industry and renaming it the North American Charging Standard (NACS). Tesla wrote in a new blog post:
In pursuit of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, today we are opening our EV connector design to the world. We invite charging network operators and vehicle manufacturers to put the Tesla charging connector and charge port, now called the North American Charging Standard (NACS), on their equipment and vehicles. NACS is the most common charging standard in North America: NACS vehicles outnumber CCS two-to-one, and Tesla’s Supercharging network has 60% more NACS posts than all the CCS-equipped networks combined.
Tesla noted that charging network operators “already have plans in motion to incorporate NACS at their chargers.”
We have previously reported on EVgo incorporating Tesla’s connector at hundreds of stations in the US.
Tesla has now published its design and specs online for anyone to access:
As a purely electrical and mechanical interface agnostic to use case and communication protocol, NACS is straightforward to adopt. The design and specification files are available for download, and we are actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard. Enjoy.
At this point, it’s unclear if Tesla had discussions with electric automakers to adopt the standard. Virtually every automaker producing electric vehicles for the North American market is currently delivering them with CCS connectors.
This is an interesting move by Tesla. The automaker is already in the process of accepting non-Tesla electric vehicles with CCS at its own Supercharger stations in North America.
The Tesla plug is much less clunky than CCS but Tesla should have done this long ago and may have missed the bus.
But what this move would actually do is enable automakers themselves to adopt the connector on their electric vehicles.
What’s important to keep in mind here is that the US government recently unlocked billions of dollars in funding for EV charging stations, and while the government didn’t require those stations to work with the CCS connector, it did require that the charging stations receiving funding work with EVs “from more than one automaker.”
For now, this requirement disqualifies Tesla’s Supercharger stations, but if only one automaker decides to adopt Tesla’s connector, or now the North American Charging Standard (NACS), it would qualify Tesla’s Supercharger network for incentives.
While some might see this as a loophole, it’s one for a good cause because Tesla’s connector is undoubtedly a better design than CCS.

2022/11/11,"Tesla is reportedly planning to start importing electric cars made in China to the US, according to a somewhat-questionable report from Reuters.
Update: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now denied the Reuters report via Twitter.
Reuters came out with a new report today that claims Tesla is currently validating a plan to import electric cars made at Gigafactory Shanghai in China to the US market.
The publication wrote:
Tesla is considering exporting made-in-China electric cars to the United States, two people with knowledge of the planning told Reuters, a reversal that would reflect the automaker’s deepening cost advantage at its Shanghai plant and slower demand from Chinese consumers.
The report states that Tesla is currently making sure that its China-made cars are compliant with US auto regulations before moving forward with the plan.
When first announcing plans to build cars in China, CEO Elon Musk clearly stated that it would only be to satisfy local demand and that Tesla wouldn’t export vehicles from China. That changed after Gigafactory Shanghai quickly surged to become Tesla’s most productive plant and the world’s largest electric vehicle factory.
It became Tesla’s main export hub – mainly exporting vehicles to Europe, Asia, and Australia.
Therefore, it would make sense for Tesla to continue expanding exports to other markets. However, we have some doubts about the credibility of the report.
This report makes no sense in my opinion. After years of producing cars in China, why would Tesla decide to now import them in the US just when the government put in place a big incentive for buyers to get cars built in North America?
That would be the strangest strategy.
But regardless of the logic, I have been rapidly losing faith in Reuters’ Tesla reporting.
While the publication is one of the most respected media companies in the world, I’ve been disappointed with their Tesla coverage.
Just last week, we reported on their misleading report that stated Tesla was aiming for volume production of the Cybertruck in late 2023.
The same journalist is behind this new report, and they don’t have a great track record of original reporting based on unnamed sources, like this new report.
Make no sense when you consider Austin is ramping up....Tesla has stated they want to produce closer to where vehicles are delivered, why would that turn around after a new functioning factory is in place in the US?
On top of the new federal tax credit making this a questionable move, Tesla’s strategy has been to limit transit time and localize production with a new Gigafactory in Europe and one in the US.
I think Tesla will look to satisfy North American demand in the short term with ramp-ups in Gigafactory Texas and Fremont Factory. Tesla even sent engineers from Gigafactory Shanghai to help ramp up production in the US.
Considering all those points, I’d file this report in the “very unlikely albeit not impossible” category.
Update: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now denied the Reuters report via Twitter.

2022/11/11,"Tesla is starting to integrate Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck, in its mobile app ahead of the start of customer deliveries. It shows the truck’s frunk, Megacharger port, and more.
Five years after unveiling the electric truck, Tesla finally brought the vehicle to production last month.
At the time, the automaker said that customer deliveries would start on December 1.
The date is expected to bring more than just customer deliveries as Tesla is expected to release more details about the production version of the truck – especially the price.
Ahead of the start of deliveries, Tesla is integrating the electric truck in its mobile app, which is one of the main ways that owners interact with their Tesla vehicles.
Now it looks like owners of Tesla commercial vehicles, like Tesla Semi, are going to enjoy a similar experience as Tesla passenger vehicle owners.
The company has now added a 3D model of the Tesla Semi in a new mobile app update:

The images don’t really reveal anything new, but people seem to be particularly impressed by the size of the electric truck’s sunvisor:
That’s a result of Tesla going with a centered driver seat for the electric truck’s cockpit.
The app also shows the Tesla Semi’s frunk and Megacharger port:
Based on this app update, which is still in the backend and not visible to customers, it looks like Tesla is getting ready to onboard Tesla Semi customers to its ecosystem.
Tesla’s mobile app should be quite useful for Tesla Semi customers. Some features that Tesla introduced for its passenger vehicles could be quite useful to manage a fleet of Tesla Semi trucks.
Things like “driver profiles,” which enable a Tesla owner to manage who can drive its vehicles is going to be particularly useful.
Tesla could also use its level of connectivity inside its vehicles and through the app to offer new commercial fleet management tools to owners.
The possibilities are virtually limitless. I can’t wait to see what the Tesla Semi team can come up with now that the vehicles are finally getting into the hands of customers.

2022/11/11,"Tesla critics are testing Elon Musk’s new Twitter policy about parody accounts, and they even forced the CEO to change it and ban them.
One of the first changes that Musk implemented after acquiring Twitter is rolling out the “verified” feature, which was originally intended to confirm that the person behind a specific account was the real person, into a Twitter subscription service – and then increase the price of that subscription service to $8 per month.
What that change did was give everyone who has $8 the ability to get the verified checkmark and make their account look more official.
Musk’s stated goal with the change was to curb bot accounts trying to scam people since they would have to pay $8 per month to look official – though the new revenue stream from something that was free before was likely also a significant driver of the change.
The move created a new problem though where scammers willing to pay the $8 per month would actually get a verified account, boosting their credibility and helping in whatever goal they had.
People illustrated that to Musk last week by changing their accounts to make it look like Musk’s and tweeting things that he wouldn’t. It forced Musk to institute a new rule that if you make your account look like someone else’s, you have to put in your profile’s bio that it is a “parody” account.
Following this new rule, a Tesla critic created a verified account that looked like Tesla’s official account, but it had a mention that it was a parody in its bio.
It started tweeting some wild things that made Tesla look bad, and some of the tweets were seen by tens of thousands of people:
Some tweets were more obviously not coming from Tesla than others, but the verified checkmark likely confused some people, and the account quickly gained thousands of followers.
It also quickly got Musk’s attention:
As the account was gaining traction, Musk quickly announced a policy change to force parody accounts to include the fact that it’s a parody directly in their name and not just their bio:
Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name, not just in bio
After Musk made the announcement, the fake Tesla account was quickly suspended. 
Twitter also suspended accounts of people making fun of Musk in a similar way after introducing the new parody account rule.
This is such a mess. Hopefully, not too many people got tricked by it, but you can clearly see how this can become a problem. 
It looks like Musk has succeeded in limiting the number of spam bots, but he also enabled them to be more impactful.
It's time for Tesla to dump Musk.  More and more his antics are hampering Tesla's stated mission 'to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy'.  Either by the absurd things he blurts out on Twitter, or by the fact that he got forced to sell a boat load of shares to fund the purchase of Twitter which is hurting the stock price of Tesla and thus it's ability to raise capital.
Though over time, the impact should be less as the verified tag loses value since anyone can buy it. 
Right now, some of the most-liked tweets on Twitter are just thousands and thousands of replies to Musk’s followers laughing at them for paying $8 to get the checkmark:
While I obviously disagree with a lot of what the fake Tesla account was saying, it looks like they were following the rules until Musk changed them. It doesn’t seem fair to ban them unless they try to scam people with the account, like selling fake Tesla merchandise.
When buying Twitter, Musk announced that you can now have fun on the social media platform again – just not at his or Tesla’s expense it looks like.

2022/11/10,"Tesla has canceled solar projects en masse across the US as the company says that it is shutting down its solar operations in some markets.
After years of its solar business slowing down since acquiring it through taking over SolarCity in 2016, Tesla’s solar division was finally getting some momentum over the last few quarters.
Tesla achieved a record US residential solar deployment in Q2 2022. Last quarter, Tesla also had a strong performance with 94 MW of solar power deployed – up 13% year-over-year.
However, the momentum was not without issue as Tesla had to stop scheduling solar roof projects in most markets in Q3. The automaker focused on deploying the product on new construction projects, like a large one in Austin.
Now we learn that Tesla is canceling many solar projects, including some in advanced stages, and the company is saying that it shutting down operations in some markets.
Over the last three days, Electrek has received half a dozen reports from Tesla Solar customers who have been informed by the company that Tesla would not be moving forward with their projects and canceling the order.
Those customers all received this email from Tesla this week:
Thank you for your interest in Tesla solar. Upon further review of your project, our team has determined that your home is in an area we no longer service. As we cannot complete your order, we have processed your cancellation. You will receive a full refund of any collected deposit within 7-10 business days to the card on file.
This includes customers who had solar panels or solar roofs on order and even some projects that were already designed and permitted. Based on social media channel checks, hundreds of Tesla customers are likely in this situation.
In the email, Tesla writes that it is no longer servicing the areas where those customers are located. We have received reports from customers in major solar markets including the greater Los Angeles area, Northern California, Oregon, and Florida.
The fact that Tesla wouldn’t be covering those areas would be a significant change of strategy as the company has previously talked about only expanding its solar division.
Electrek also learned that Tesla has laid off a number of employees in its solar scheduling, planning, and design department.
In the email to customers, Tesla refers them to “Tesla Certified Installers” in their area. 
We previously reported on Tesla’s certified installer program. It started with roofing companies trained to install Tesla’s solar roof, but lately, Tesla has also certified solar panel installers to deploy the company’s “Tesla Energy” ecosystem.
Considering the cancellations, referring to third-party installers, and the layoffs in its own solar planning department, it looks like Tesla might be calling back its own solar installations and instead plans to supply third-party installers.
So people have put in time and deposits and waited and eventually just get told to go somewhere else? Time and opportunity cost is something customers lost, but I'm sure the contract kept Tesla clear of any liability there. 
This would be a significant change in strategy and one of those bits of news where I’d love to reach out to Tesla to ask them what is happening, but you know, Tesla doesn’t need a press relation department according to Elon Musk…
In the meantime, it’s not a good look for Tesla to leave customers who spent time and even money on moving these projects forward – and now they are back to square one. 
If you find yourself in this situation or even just want to check out other options to make sure you’re finding a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage.

2022/11/10,"Tesla has publicly displayed the Model Y with the new multi-coat Quicksilver paint for the first time. What do you think?
Tesla electric vehicle buyers have been waiting for new paint options for a long time.
Back in the early days of the Model S, Tesla used to offer a variety of colors, but the automaker decided to streamline options, and it now offers only a handful of color options that have remained the same for the last few years.
CEO Elon Musk has been talking about Tesla finally releasing new colors, but it has been linked to a new “most-advanced paint shop” at Gigafactory Berlin.
The CEO talked about new multi-layered paints:
Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature.
Late last year, three new colors appeared in the Tesla app – hinting at potential new color options:
However, they have yet to make it to Tesla’s online configurator for people to order them despite Tesla having ramped up production at Gigafactory Berlin where it is operating this new paint shop enabling those new colors.
This is the new #quicksilver for the #modely from #gigaberlin @Tesla #Tesla #TeslaModely #electricity #ElectricVehicles #ElectricVehicle pic.twitter.com/clwMTwk6eu
In March, Musk finally confirmed that the first two new colors are coming – silver and red – but it wasn’t until last month that Tesla announced them officially and unveiled them in a new video.
The two new colors are “Midnight Cherry Red” and “Quicksilver.”
The Cherry Red has only been seen in Tesla’s own promotional video to announce the new colors, but the automaker has now brought a Model Y Quicksilver to the 2022 Zurich auto show in Switzerland.
The new paint looks great. I never liked any of the non-white paint, they just seem too extreme dark
People visiting the show have posted videos of the vehicle, giving us our first real-world look at the new color:
We can see the depth of the color resulting in different looks depending on the light, which is enabled by Tesla’s multi-coat paint that it is applying in its new paint shop at Gigafactory Berlin.
Since it is only produced in Berlin for now, the color is only available on the Model Y, the only vehicle currently in production at Gigafactory Berlin, and in European and Middle Eastern markets.
What do you think of the new Model Y Quick Silver? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/11/10,"Tesla is starting to hire workers specifically for Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas, according to job listings seen by Electrek.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023, and in June, Musk said that Tesla is aiming for production to start in mid-2023.
In its communications, Tesla has stuck to a mid-2023 timeline over the last few months, and it is starting to become more real than just words with actual production equipment specific to Cybertruck coming to Gigafactory Texas.
Now Electrek has even spotted the first job listings specific to Cybertruck production – confirming that Tesla is starting to hire for the electric pickup truck program in Texas.
Tesla currently has six job listings related to Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas. One is for someone to lead Cybertruck production, and the automaker just added five new listings for Cybertruck BIW:
BIW stands for Body in White, which is the step in the production process where the vehicle’s body is put together.
This is expected to be a challenge for Tesla when it comes to the Cybertruck since it has been designed with an exoskeleton stainless steel body, which is unlike the general method with a body frame with panels.
The company has ordered the world’s biggest casting machine in order to be able to build the electric pickup truck’s body, and since it’s a technology used on a new scale, Tesla is expected to have some kinks to iron out before moving to mass production.
Tesla wrote in the job description for Dimensional Engineer on the Cybertruck BIW team:
The Dimensional Engineer will work with Production Teams and report to the Dimensional Engineering Manager for BIW, Cybertruck. Working closely with Sustaining Engineering to understand, help define and ensure lines are following body accuracy, fit, gap and craftsmanship specs. From these Key indicators drive actions back to body lines.
Tesla is also still looking for a “Manufacturing Operations Leader” for the Cybertruck program.
The automaker wrote in the job description:
We’re looking for a highly motivated leader to build world-class teams and lead Cybertruck Operations at Gigafactory Texas. You will be responsible for meeting the production forecast and ensuring company goals are achieved. The ideal candidate will have a track record of significant achievements, tremendous drive, and a willingness to roll up their sleeves.
As we reported last week, Tesla is also still looking to hire an overall leader at Gigafactory Texas to oversee all manufacturing programs at the plant – more commonly referred to as a plant director.

2022/11/09,"Good news for Tesla tinkerers with salvaged vehicles. Tesla is establishing a process to allow them back on the Supercharger network – something that has been a big issue for them over the last few years.
In 2020, Tesla blocked access to Supercharging and third-party fast-charging to all salvaged vehicles.
It was a big blow to people who refurbished salvaged Tesla vehicles and got them back in running shape.
The automaker claimed that it was a safety issue, but it didn’t offer any path to inspect the cars and get them approved back on the Supercharger network, which is a big part of the value proposition of Tesla vehicles.
Last year, we got hope that Tesla was going to do the right thing and give back access to the important feature, but it was short-lived.
In 2021, Tesla started giving back Supercharger access to salvaged vehicles without any explanation, but it appeared that it was a mistake since the automaker reverted the move a week later.
But now it looks like it’s happening for real.
Electrek obtained internal Tesla documents that details a new process being put in place to inspect salvaged Tesla vehicles and give them back access to fast-charging.
In the document titled “Salvaged-Titled Vehicle Fast Charging Safety Inspection,” Tesla explains a two-step process that involves inspecting the high-voltage battery pack and all the components related to charging.
If the car passes the inspections, Tesla will reenable fast charging, and if it doesn’t, the company will offer repairs.
Here are the steps Tesla communicated to employees in the documents obtained by Electrek:
This new process is currently being put in place for all Tesla models.
This is great news. It’s important to note that many Tesla vehicles that end up with salvage titles are not necessarily completely destroyed – like the one pictured above. It doesn’t take a lot these days for an insurance company to consider a vehicle totaled.
On paper, it looks like the right thing to do: Offer a path to make sure refurbished salvage-titled Tesla vehicles can safely use fast charging and enable the capability if it is safe.
Will be curious to see how much both inspections will cost before I'd heap too much praise on Tesla here. Especially if a vehicle fails, will they be required to pay the inspection fees?
However, it remains to be seen how it is going to work in practice and whether or not Tesla will actually reenable Supercharging on most of these vehicles without charging for super expensive repairs.
It’s something that we will keep an eye out for.
As for why now and not two years ago, I suspect Tesla opening up its Supercharger network to other EVs might have something to do with it. Tesla has no way of knowing whether or not a VW ID.4 coming to use its Supercharger has a salvage title or not. It would be ridiculous to allow non-Tesla salvaged EVs to use its charging network but not its own vehicles.
It should greatly increase the value of salvaged Tesla vehicles, which is good since Tesla should encourage people who are fixing those since it’s literally recycling.

2022/11/09,"Tesla and Zoom have announced that they are officially teaming up to bring video conferencing inside Tesla vehicles.
Over the last few years, Tesla has invested heavily in features that are aimed to be useful for the in-car experience when its vehicles become self-driving.
I am talking about in-car video games and Tesla Theater, which integrates streaming apps like Netflix and Hulu directly into the center display of Tesla vehicles.
Until self-driving becomes reality, which has been delayed quite a few times in Tesla’s case, those features are used only when the vehicles are parked, especially when charging.
Now Tesla is going a step further with native apps in a new partnership with Zoom. During its Zoomtopia event yesterday, the video conferencing app announced an official integration with Tesla.
A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the announcement:
I can confirm that the Zoom integration for Tesla will be available on all new Tesla models soon.
The company released a video demonstration of the Zoom app inside Tesla vehicles:
When Tesla launched the Model 3, it equipped the vehicle with a standard cabin-facing camera located in the rearview mirror.
The feature has since made it to all other Tesla vehicles.
For the first three years since Tesla brought the cabin camera to production, the feature remained dormant. Later, Tesla started using it as a driver monitoring tool to help ensure that Autopilot and Self-Driving Beta users were paying attention when using the driver assist features.
Now Tesla is giving access to the camera’s feed to a third party for this Zoom app integration. 
The automaker first announced its plan to enable video conferencing inside its vehicles back in 2020 – shortly after the pandemic started and apps like Zoom gained in popularity.
This is one of those things that I hope Tesla is not spending too much time and resources on because it doesn’t actually seem useful. It sounds like it’s just one of those things that the company is doing because it can and it sounds good on paper.
But in practice, you are probably getting a subpar experience compared to just using the Zoom app on your phone or laptop inside your car.
That’s the case with several of those apps inside Tesla vehicles, though Tesla still has the best software of any other automaker by far.

2022/11/09,"Tesla is reportedly building a new “unique EV research, testing, repair, and maintenance facility” in Detroit’s backyard, but it sounds like it could simply be a collision center.
According to a report in Crain’s Detroit Business journal, Tesla has just received approval from Southfield, a town in the suburbs of Detroit, to build a “unique” new facility:
Southfield officials have signed off on Tesla Inc. opening what is being described as a unique EV research, testing, repair, and maintenance facility.
It’s not clear what makes this new facility unique and a “research and testing” location on top of a facility to perform “repair and maintenance.”
Terry Croad, Southfield’s planning director, said:
I’ve been told (by Tesla representatives) that it’s the first one in Michigan and the next closest one is Chicago,” Croad said. “It’s supposed to be able to handle 60 to 80 customers a week. There’s gonna be a lot of software updates. It’s not going to be your grandfather’s bump shop because of the sophistication of the chips and software. This is unique.
There’s nothing that sounds like that in Chicago, but what Tesla has in Chicago that it doesn’t have anywhere else in the region is a “Tesla Body Shop,” or collision center, where Tesla performs body repairs on its own vehicles.
Electrek looked at Tesla’s job openings in Southfield, and they all appear to be related a collision center:
Without any other details about what would make this location a “unique EV research, testing, repair, and maintenance facility,” it sounds like there might just be some confusion about what would become Tesla’s 18th body shop in the US.
Tesla has reportedly started work on the building at 21375 Telegraph Rd. north of Eight Mile Road. It will be expanding the square footage by 7,000 square feet to create a 34,500-square-foot property.
Michigan, where most of the US’s legacy automakers are located, has not been welcoming to Tesla.
The state has tried to block Tesla’s direct sale model, and it took years before the automaker could build its own service centers in the state.
In 2020, Tesla built its first service location in the state after successfully exploiting a loophole. Now Tesla operates two service centers in Michigan, and it looks like it will add a body shop to the list, too.
Tesla officially launched its own body shop program last year after many customers complained of long wait times for even just minor body repairs at third-party shops.

2022/11/08,"Tesla has disclosed that Elon Musk sold another $3.9 billion worth of Tesla (TSLA) shares, which the CEO is likely using to finance the dumpster fire that is his Twitter acquisition.
After years of promising that he would be “the last one to sell Tesla”, Musk started to sell billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares over the last year.
We later learned that his change of heart was partly to finance his costly acquisition of Twitter, the social media platform, which ended up costing a whopping $44 billion.
In August, we reported on Musk selling another massive $6.9 billion chunk of his Tesla (TSLA) stake and at the time, the CEO claimed that he was “done selling Tesla stocks” for the Twitter acquisition.
However, a week after officially acquiring the company and reportedly having some serious revenue issues after advertisers pulled their spending on the platform, we now learn that Musk is again selling Tesla stocks.
In new SEC disclosure tonight, Tesla has disclosed that Musk unloaded almost 20 million shares worth about $3.9 billion on the public market over the last few days.
It started with a massive 9.6 million shares worth about $2 billion on Friday, followed by over 5 million shares worth over $1 billion on Monday, and another 4.4 million shares worth $850 million.
Musk’s selling pressure on Tesla’s stock has contributed to the company losing about 30% of its value over this period, which is actually more value than Musk’s entire $44 billion Twitter acquisition.
Again, Musk shows that he will “be the last one to sell Tesla” unless it is to buy a dumpster fire of a social media platform.
In some ways, I applaud what he is trying to do with Twitter, but at the same time, I am really to doubting that he is the right person to do it. He is a too divisive figure at this point to lead a platform that is supposed to bring people together.
And what I feared most is clearly happening: this is negatively affecting Tesla and its mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
Despite his incredible exploits at Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is losing his credibility at a rapid pace over this Twitter situation and how he is reacting to it.

2022/11/08,"Tesla (TSLA) is now earning eight times more per car than Toyota, and they are starting to notice back in Japan.
The list of things that could have led to Tesla’s demise used to be longer than my arm. For most investors, the amount of money that the company was losing was at the top of that list.
Not only is it not on top anymore, it’s not even on the list.
Over the last two years, Tesla has been able to consistently deliver profits every quarter with increasingly impressive free cash flow, which reached a record of over $3 billion last quarter.
For years, many automotive investors decided to invest in legacy automakers instead of Tesla because they would deliver millions more vehicles than Tesla and make money doing it.
While it’s still true that some of the biggest automakers, like Toyota, deliver millions more vehicles than Tesla, it’s not true that they necessarily make more money doing so.
For example, Tesla reported $3.29 billion in net profit last quarter compared to Toyota earning 434.2 billion yen (roughly $3.15 billion USD). That’s despite Toyota delivering almost eight times more cars than Tesla during the same time.
This milestone of Tesla beating Toyota in earnings during a quarter is especially impressive when you consider that just a decade ago, Toyota owned about 3% of Tesla with just a $50 million investment. Now Tesla generates $50 million in free cash flow almost every other day.
Toyota divested and completely cut ties with Tesla in 2017.
While Toyota is still only tentatively entering the battery-electric vehicle space, people are starting to see times changing in Japan since the Nikkei, the country’s biggest business newspaper, led with “Tesla earns 8 times more profit than Toyota per car.”
While it is making waves in Japan, it feels like the Japanese auto industry might still have their head in the sand. 
That’s partly because Tesla beating Toyota on earnings is partially due to the latter seeing earnings go down due to “increased material and electricity costs for its suppliers.”
But personally, I think the trend of Tesla catching up to Toyota’s earnings might be one that will keep going. To me, it’s as simple as one producing compelling all-electric vehicles in large volumes while the other isn’t.
Now that trend might not currently be reflected in Tesla’s stock price, but that’s another story entirely.

2022/11/08,"Tesla has pulled on another demand lever in China by creating some urgency to get an insurance incentive worth ~$1,000 as it tries to increase sales at the end of the year.
Over the last few months, there have been increased concerns about softening of demand for Tesla vehicles.
It was enough for CEO Elon Musk to address it during the conference call following the release of Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results last month.
The CEO reiterated that “Tesla doesn’t have a demand issue.”
In terms of demand softening for Tesla, we reported last month that Tesla’s demand shouldn’t be seen as a concern until Tesla starts pulling on some “demand levers” – meaning that the automaker takes some action to actually create some demand.
For the last two years, Tesla has mostly coasted on organic demand, but it now looks like the automaker has to take action to boost sales – especially in China, which is an important market for Tesla.
We reported last month that Tesla reduced the price of Model 3 and Model Y in China and launched a new referral program. It was the first time in two years that Tesla cut prices on its electric vehicles.
Now we have learned that Tesla has added a new insurance incentive to new vehicle purchases in China, and it has modified the program to encourage buyers to place an order by December (via Reuters):
The U.S. automaker previously offered an insurance incentive of 7,000 yuan ($970) for orders between Oct. 1 and Dec. 30. But on Tuesday Tesla said the incentive for November was raised to 8,000 yuan and reduced for December orders to 4,000 yuan.
The insurance incentive comes in the form of a cash rebate with Tesla’s insurance partners in China.
In a post announcing the change on its official Weibo account, Tesla encourages people to order: “As long as you like it enough, pick up Tesla immediately!”
By putting this incentive in place, it seems like Tesla is looking to boost orders in China in November to have enough vehicles on order for deliveries in December.
With the increased capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla China is both producing more cars and having more allocations for the local market since the need to export from China to Europe is being reduced by Giga Berlin’s ramp-up.
With price cuts and direct incentives like this one, it could mean demand is slowing down for Tesla in China or the automaker could just be adapting to its new higher capacity in the market.

2022/11/07,"Retail sales of EVs have yet to fully take off in the US heartland states, according to new analysis from S&P Global Mobility. How come?
The top eight EV markets in the United States are all in coastal states, and those markets represent more than half – 50.5% – of total EV registrations in 2022. The greater Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas alone account for nearly one-third of total share of the US EV market, which should really come as a surprise to no one.
The 22 heartland states represented 27.1% of total US vehicle retail sales through August, and their EV adoption rate has remained stagnant from 2021 into 2022, at 15.5%.
Interestingly, S&P reports that there isn’t much difference in the demographic and psychographic profiles of coastal and heartland buyers that are buying EVs:
There are just more of those types of people in Coastal and Smile states.
Caucasian buyers with high household incomes dominate both regions’ adopter bases. The only difference is that the central markets skew more toward a slightly younger demographic.
But both markets are seeing a decline in share from Caucasian buyers and an increase in Asian-American buyers, and they skew younger – 48% of Asian-American buyers were age 18-44. S&P asserts that younger buyers tend to be more open to new products and ideas. 
So back to the original question: Why does the Midwest lag behind the coasts on EV adoption? S&P The report suggests:
A chicken-and-egg scenario might also be in play. The coastal cities have worked harder at creating charging infrastructures, as well as incentives for homeowners to install charging equipment in their garages.
James Martin, associate director of consulting for S&P Global Mobility, says:
There is no doubt that the lack of charger availability is an influence in midwestern states, but it is not the factor.
An equally strong factor is the availability of product in form factors that customers are willing to purchase.
There was no real option in terms of family-friendly, moderately priced CUVs. And some models, such as the Hyundai Kona EV, were initially not available in midwestern states – based on OEMsdeciding to focus on [the 12] Section 177 (CARB) states where automakers could accumulate credits. 
Now automakers are beginning to produce more mainstream electric vehicles. Availability of these vehicles will most likely be a factor in spurring installation of more charging infrastructure.
Tom Libby, associate director of Loyalty Solutions and Industry Analysis at S&P Global Mobility, sums it up:
That inflection point is when the product becomes generally accepted and it usually occurs when volume and exposure reach a level that influences all the reluctant outliers.

2022/11/07,"Tesla has applied to offer telecommunication services in Canada, including “machine-to-machine cellular data service” in its electric cars.
Starting with the Model S in 2012 and for a decade now, Tesla has been leading the auto industry in the level of connectivity inside its vehicles.
Tesla has made software a priority in its product, and internet connectivity enables it to push software updates over-the-air to its customer fleet as well as collect data from it, which has been particularly useful in its effort to develop self-driving technology.
At first, internet connectivity was completely free in all Tesla vehicles.
Basic connectivity is still technically free in all Tesla vehicles, but Tesla started requiring a new paid “premium connectivity” package for a monthly fee to access some of the more data-heavy connectivity features in 2018. Since then, Tesla owners have had to decide if they want to pay $10 per month for the premium connectivity service or not.
Lately, there have been indications that Tesla could take the level of connectivity in its vehicles to a new level.
Today, we learn that Tesla applied for a Basic International Telecommunications Service (BITS) license with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). If approved, it would technically allow Tesla to become a telecommunications reseller service in Canada.
In the application, Tesla made it clear that they don’t plan to operate transmission facilities:
Tesla does not, and does not intend to, own or operate transmission facilities in Canada.
Instead, Tesla noted that it plans to offer “machine-to-machine cellular data in-vehicle” (via Mobile Syrup):
Tesla’s application says it will provide machine-to-machine cellular data service for in-vehicle infotainment access, internet access, and “mobile terminating SMS to wake up vehicles.
Interestingly, CEO Elon Musk recently said that SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellite would offer connectivity to Tesla vehicles in the future.
Starlink recently launched its service for moving vehicles, and it looks like Tesla could adopt the technology instead of relying on a regular cellular data connection. 
At this point, it’s unclear if this application to offer telecom services in Canada is related to this effort.

2022/11/07,"ZOLA Electric, a Tesla-backed company providing energy to remote African villages through solar and batteries, has announced the deployment of a new microgrid system that is powering 1,000 homes, schools, and businesses in two villages in Rwanda.
We reported on ZOLA Electric back in 2015 when it was still called Off Grid Electric.
At the time, it was a Tanzania-based startup offering solar power and energy storage as a service to rural regions of Africa.
It got on our radar when SolarCity led two early rounds of financing of $16 million and $25 million for the company alongside a Tesla investor, DBL Partners, and SolarCity’s CEO at the time, Lyndon Rive, joined the company’s board.
By acquiring SolarCity in 2016, Tesla will become a major shareholder of ZOLA Electric, and it looks like Tesla hasn’t divested since the company still promotes itself as being “backed by Tesla.”
ZOLA’s approach is similar to Tesla Energy with Powerwalls and solar power, but it utilizes much smaller battery packs and solar panel systems to reduce the cost of deployment and power impoverished communities.
This was the company’s original system:
It was enough to power some lights at night, a radio, and allow a family to charge some appliances and devices, such as phones.
Over the last few years, the company has managed to grow quite fast, and now it has deployed battery systems and solar panels that power “over 1.5 million people and more than 300,000 homes and businesses.”
Recently, ZOLA has moved to a more robust and powerful system called INIFITY:
Today, ZOLA announced that it has deployed its INFINITY system to power a new “mini grid” in two villages in Rwanda:
The groundbreaking mini-grid project, installed in the agricultural villages of Gakagati I and II in Nyagatare, Rwanda – the country’s largest and second most-populous district – will deliver clean, affordable, reliable power via ZOLA’s innovative INFINITY technology, to over 1,000 homes, businesses, schools and clinics.
The project was completed over 10 months and financed by Facebook, the Shell Foundation, USAID, and Endev, and supported by NXT Grid.
The system deployed in Gakagati has a 120 kW capacity, but ZOLA says that it is modular and easy to expand. It expects to double the capacity to 240 kW over time.
Many villages that lack access to power, or where it is unreliable and expensive, have struggled to grow economically because of this. ZOLA believes that its solar and battery-powered microgrid approach allows access to power at a lower cost, and it can gradually scale with communities as they learn to use the power to help lift themselves out of poverty.
Interestingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted back in 2016, after Tesla launched its own battery and solar-powered energy division, that some developing countries would skip the traditional grid altogether and go straight to microgrids:
The advantage of solar and batteries is that you can avoid building electricity plants at all. So you can be in a remote village and have solar panels that charge a battery pack that then supply power to the whole village without ever having to run thousands of miles of high-voltage cables all over the place. It’s like what happened with landline phones versus cellular phones. In a lot of developing countries, they just didn’t do the landline phones. They went straight to cellular.
It appears that these two villages in Rwanda are an example of that.

2022/11/04,"Tesla is offering buyers to cover the cost of Germany cutting its EV incentive if the automaker can’t deliver by the end of the year amid a massive sale push in the country.
Germany is an important auto market in Europe and one that is difficult to penetrate for foreign automakers because of the strong local industry with companies like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.
Tesla has made some good early efforts in the country, but it is now expected to do much better with a local factory producing German-made Tesla vehicles. Last year, Tesla delivered just short of 40,000 vehicles in Germany.
Surprisingly, a report came out in September that stated Tesla is aiming to increase sales in 2022 to 80,000 units. That would be extremely ambitious, considering Tesla was just short of 35,000 deliveries as of September – and that while already having the best-selling car in the country.
But there is something that is going to help with Tesla’s goal to deliver a record number of electric vehicles in Germany during the fourth quarter: Starting next year, the country is significantly reducing its EV incentive from 6,000 euros to 4,500 euros for EV models that start at less than 40,000 euros and 5,000 to 3,000 euros for EVs that start at more than 40,000 euros.
Any reduction or removal of EV incentives in a market generally results in a rush to secure a vehicle before the incentives end.
That’s part of why Tesla believes it can deliver over 40,000 vehicles in Germany during the fourth quarter.
In order to provide some peace of mind to buyers, Tesla sent out a communication to prospective buyers and people with vehicles on order in Germany confirming that if they place an order right now and Tesla can’t secure delivery by the end of the year, it will cover the difference in the cost with the EV incentive reduction.
This is a generous program offer, but I assume Tesla has done the math, and they believe the peace of mind that it is offering should convince enough people to place orders that it will compensate buyers if they end up missing the delivery window on a few vehicles.
Obviously, Tesla is going to put all its resources available to try to deliver on all its vehicles; otherwise, it is leaving $2,000 on the table for each missed delivery timeline.

2022/11/03,"Humanoid robots, like the recently unveiled Tesla Bot, could be a $150 billion-a-year business within the next 15 years, according to a new Goldman Sachs report.
The idea of robots taking over menial tasks and reducing labor costs has been around for a long time, but it has taken on a different meaning.
Robots have already taken over many tasks and jobs, but we are talking about purpose-built and programmed robots for specific tasks – not the general-purpose humanoid robots that science fiction sold us.
But every now and again, there’s a resurgence of humanoid robots and some companies gather around projects, like the Honda Asimo.
Now Tesla is leading another humanoid robot resurgence with its Tesla Bot project, and this resurgence feels different because Tesla seems committed to not only delivering a new robot, but also to putting its manufacturing power behind it, making its Tesla Bot an actual widely available product.
Goldman Sachs has been keeping an eye on this humanoid robot resurgence led by Tesla and today, the firm released a new report about an early investment case for the market.
In the report, the firm estimates that the humanoid robot market could be worth $154 billion by 2035 – or about as much as the EV market – which has been Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s own prediction.
Goldman Sachs wrote in the report:
The launch of Tesla’s humanoid robot prototype, the “Optimus”, has again sparked debate about the financial opportunities of such innovation. The investment case for humanoid robots is sizable – we estimate that in 10-15 years a market size of at least US$6bn is achievable to fill 4$ of the US manufacturing labor shortage gap by 2030E and 2% of global elderly care demand by 2035E.
The firm also described its “blue-sky scenario”:
Should the hurdles of product design, use case, technology, affordability and wide public acceptance be completely overcome, we envision a market of up to US$152bn by 2035E in a blue-sky scenario (close to that of the global EV market and one-third of the global smartphone market as of 2021), which suggests labor shortage issues such as for manufacturing and elderly care can be solved to a large extent.
Interestingly, while Goldman Sachs admits that Tesla is behind the resurgence of humanoid robots, the firm instead recommends investing in motion component suppliers to take advantage of this new market.
I don’t disagree with this analysis, but I might be even more optimistic. 
I agree with the general consensus that the prototypes unveiled by Tesla in September were unimpressive, but that’s partly due to the company’s approach of focusing on making the robot for mass production.
I think that approach is going to result in rapid improvements in the humanoid robot sector.
I can see Tesla Bot reaching a valuable level of usability within the next 4-5 years and within 10 years, it could certainly reach a level where it could be a general-purpose robot that could perform a wide range of tasks on command. 
That’s really possible I think and therefore, it could lead to Goldman Sachs’ blue-sky scenario a few years before 2035.

2022/11/03,"Tesla’s recent price cuts in China are reportedly resulting in “significant cancellations” for Chinese EV brands. However, deliveries are down month-to-month in October.
Last month, Tesla announced some significant price cuts for the Model 3 and Model Y in China.
This was important news for Tesla since there have been early signs of a demand slowdown for the automaker, including much shorter delivery times.
It’s the first time Tesla actually pulled a demand lever since those signs of demand slowing down appeared.
The move was also significant since Tesla only cut prices in China, which is an extremely important market for electric vehicle sales.
Today, China’s Passenger Car Association released the country’s vehicle output for October 2022 and confirmed that Tesla’s output out of Gigafactory Shanghai was 71,704 cars – down 83,000 in September.
However, month-to-month is not really the best way to look at Tesla’s output in China, which can always be a bit cyclical. Normally, you are better off comparing it to the same month in the previous quarter, but that was July 2022, which was horrible for Tesla at only 28,000 units due to a factory shutdown.
The price cuts were also too recent to have an impact on deliveries, but according to Citi analyst Jeff Chung, the price cuts are having an impact on demand.
In a Thursday report, Chung said that they have checked with dealerships, and they believe that Tesla’s price cuts have led to “significant order cancellations”:
We sense Tesla’s recent price cut strategy has created a negative spill-over effect where a lot of China EV brands’ order backlog has suffered significant order cancellations according to our dealership channel checks.
He didn’t outright name the brands, but companies like NIO and Xpeng are seen as Tesla’s biggest direct competitors in China.
Based on the timing of the price cuts and Tesla increasing production capacity at Giga Shanghai, the impact will most likely be felt in the numbers in November and December.
There were rumors that Tesla was intentionally limiting the output of Giga Shanghai in Q4, but the automaker denied the rumors during its Q3 financial results.

2022/11/02,"Reports of Tesla Cybertruck production being delayed again are coming out, but these are based on a weak and confusing report.
There’s no evidence that the electric truck is not on schedule.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023, and in June, Musk said that Tesla is aiming for production to start in mid-2023.
In its communications, Tesla has stuck to a mid-2023 timeline over the last few months, and it is starting to become more real than just words with actual production equipment coming to Gigafactory Texas.
Now a report from Reuters based on two unnamed sources claimed that Cybertryc “mass production at the end of 2023”:
Nov 1 (Reuters) – Tesla aims to start mass production of its Cybertruck at the end of 2023, two years after the initial target for the long-awaited pickup truck Chief Executive Elon Musk unveiled in 2019, two people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.
The report is quite vague and doesn’t actually introduce new information, but it didn’t stop many other publications from claiming that it means Cybertruck production has been delayed.
In fact, if anything, the report would suggest that Cybertruck production is ahead of schedule because “mass production” generally doesn’t happen until about a year after the start of production.
Therefore, if Reuters claims that “mass production” would happen at the end of 2023 and the start of production is still planned for mid-2023, it would mean that Tesla would achieve its fastest production ramp ever with the Cybertruck.
One thing is clear: The Reuters report does not mean Cybertruck production is delayed.
As for meaning that is accelerating the timeline, I wouldn’t bet on that, either. Honestly no one, including Tesla, probably knows when mass production is going to be achieved.
Maybe the report is founded on some suppliers – based on the schedule that Tesla gave them – which is most likely more aggressive than it actually planned to be, to make sure that the suppliers are not the bottleneck.
That makes more sense to me, but ultimately, I think it’s safer to assume that Tesla will not produce significant volumes of Cybertruck in 2023.

2022/11/01,"Tesla is looking to replicate the massive success that it achieved at Gigafactory Shanghai in the United States by bringing some of its Chinese engineers to help improve production at the Fremont factory.
It’s hard to overstate the success that has been Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai.
Tesla was extremely successful in ramping up production at Gigafactory Shanghai, which became the most productive electric vehicle factory in the world at an incredible pace.
The automaker went from breaking ground in 2019 to starting production by the end of the year — something virtually unheard of.
Now the factory already has a production rate of 1 million vehicles per year, and it’s the largest electric vehicle factory in the world by volume.
On top of the impressive output achieved over such a short period of time, Giga Shanghai is producing industry-leading gross margins and costs.
CEO Elon Musk has often praised Tesla’s China team for the incredible success at the plant, which resulted in Tesla greatly expanding in the important Chinese EV market.
Now Tesla is reportedly looking to replicate the success of the factory in the United States by bringing some of its engineers from Giga Shanghai to the Fremont factory in California.
Bloomberg reported:
The Elon Musk-led carmaker will dispatch staff — in particular automation and control engineers — to assist efforts to increase output in Fremont, where Tesla produces the Model S, X, 3 and Y vehicles, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. About 200 people will head to California on assignments that will last at least three months, one of the people said. The first workers are setting off as soon as this month, the person added.
Tesla Fremont factory is producing vehicles at a rate of over 600,000 units annually, but Musk has recently said that he believes there’s still room to grow at the plant, despite the fact that it’s the highest production rate that the factory has reached in 30 years.
People like to undermine China’s manufacturing success by saying that it’s all about cheap labor. To be fair, that’s certainly part of it, but you can’t ignore Chinese manufacturing engineering talent.
In 2020, China produced 1.38 million engineering bachelor’s degrees. In comparison, the United States only gave out 197,000 engineering degrees (including computer science).
The country is producing engineers at an incredible rate, and with decades of building a strong manufacturing industry, a lot of engineering talent in China is going to manufacturing instead of flashier engineering fields.
This is a smart move for Tesla to bring some of that talent to the United States – even if it’s just for a short period of time.
You can bet that if this approach is successful, those same engineers are also going to take trips to Texas and Germany soon.

2022/11/01,"Tesla is starting to release a new Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software update that includes many high-level changes that should positively impact performance.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of driving capabilities.
Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
The company now has over 100,000 people in the FSD Beta program and plans to expand it to everyone who buys access in North America by the end of the year through a few more software updates to refine the system.
Considering we are already in November and it generally takes at least a month for Tesla to deliver a new FSD Beta update, we expect Tesla is one or two updates away from the promised wider release.
Today, the automaker has started pushing a new FSD Beta update (v10.69.3) to employees for internal testing, which generally means that it will expand to beta testers in the customer fleet soon.
According to the release notes below, the update doesn’t include any new features, but it includes a lot of high-level updates to Tesla’s neural nets to improve the overall performance of the system.
Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta Release Notes v10.69.3 Release Notes via Not a Tesla App:
– Upgraded the Object Detection network to photon count video streams and retrained all parameters with the latest autolabeled datasets (with a special emphasis on low visibility scenarios).
– Improved the architecture for better accuracy and latency, higher recall of far away vehicles, lower velocity error of crossing vehicles by 20%, and improved VRU precision by 20%.
– Converted the VRU Velocity network to a two-stage network, which reduced latency and improved crossing pedestrian velocity error by 6%.
– Converted the non-VRU Attributes network to a two-stage network, which reduced latency, reduced incorrect lane assignment of crossing vehicles by 45%, and reduced incorrect parked predictions by 15%.
– Reformulated the autoregressive Vector Lanes grammar to improve the precision of lanes by 9.2%, recall of lanes by 18.7%, and recall of forks by 51.1%. Includes a full network update where all components were retrained with 3.8x the amount of data.
– Added a new “road markings” module to the Vector Lanes neural network which improves lane topology error at intersections by 38.9%.
– Upgraded the Occupancy Network to align with road surface instead of ego for improved detection stability and improved recall at hill crest.
– Reduced runtime of candidate trajectory generation by approximately 80% and improved smoothness by distilling an expensive trajectory optimization procedure into a lightweight planner neural network.
– Improved decision-making for short-deadline lane changes around gores by richer modeling of the trade-off between going off-route versus trajectory required to drive through the gore region.
– Reduced false slowdowns for pedestrians near crosswalks by using a better model for the kinematics of the pedestrian.
– Added control for more precise object geometry as detected by the general occupancy network.
– Improved control for vehicles cutting out of our desired path by better modeling of their turning/lateral maneuvers thus avoiding unnatural slowdowns.
– Improved longitudinal control while offsetting around static obstacles by searching over feasible vehicle motion profiles.
– Improved longitudinal control smoothness for in-lane vehicles during high relative velocity scenarios by also considering relative acceleration in the trajectory optimization.
– Reduced best-case object photon-to-control system latency by 26% through adaptive planner scheduling, restructuring of trajectory selection, and parallelizing perception compute. This allows us to make quicker decisions and improves reaction time.

2022/10/31,"Tesla is still looking to hire a person to be in charge of the entire Gigafactory Texas – a role often known as a plant director. The search comes amid Tesla trying to ramp up production at the factory, but the company remains vague about the current output.
Over a year and a half ago, Tesla started a hiring spree for Gigafactory Texas in Austin. At the time, we noted that the automaker was still looking for a head of the plant.
Now a year and a half later, Tesla is already producing vehicles at the factory, but it apparently still doesn’t have a plant director.
Electrek spotted several Tesla employees at Gigafactory Texas sharing a job posting for “Senior Executive Manufacturing Leader, Gigafactory Texas.” The listing has been around for a while, but it is now being shared again by Gigafactory Texas executives and recruiters, suggesting that Tesla has yet to fill the position.
The list of responsibilities in Tesla’s listing makes it sounds like a position more commonly known as plant director in the auto industry:
Responsible for all operations, including production, maintenance, engineering, and future projects related to manufacturing at Gigafactory Texas.
Fortunately, Tesla already has other manufacturing leaders at the plant, including Jason Shawhan, director of manufacturing at Gigafactory Texas. Tesla hired him from Ford last year, where he had worked for almost 20 years and most recently was the assistant plant manager at Ford’s Kansas City plant.
The automaker’s search for a plant leader comes amid Tesla trying to ramp up production of both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin simultaneously. Tesla already confirmed that Giga Berlin is now producing 2,000 vehicles per week.
Tesla previously confirmed 1,000 vehicles per week at Giga Texas back in June, but it hasn’t updated the production rate since then.
Interestingly, the company announced this weekend that Gigafactory Texas produced its 20,000th Model Y:
20k Model Y built at Giga Texas to date! pic.twitter.com/8Rl5ZqgqQq
However, that’s total production to date, and it doesn’t tell us the current production rate.
To be fair, recruiting plant directors is no small task. We are talking about hiring a leader for eventually 10,000 workers. 
A factory like Gigafactory Texas is a giant asset for a company, and it makes sense to be careful about who is going to lead it. The plant director is not only in charge of a lot of people but basically responsible for an asset that Tesla plans to be generating $50 to $100 billion per year in revenue at some point.
That means that if the plant director’s work influences the output by just 1% one way or the other, they could be making billion-dollar decisions. That kind of stress is not for everyone.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/10/31,"Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former head of artificial intelligence, said that he could return to Tesla, especially to work on the Optimus robot and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Karpathy joined Tesla more than five years ago as a neural net and computer vision expert. He joined as Tesla was transitioning from using Mobileye’s technology for driver-assist features to its own system powered by computer vision.
The engineer is credited for building Tesla’s machine learning and computer vision team. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a big part of Tesla’s Autopilot team and the automaker’s effort to develop a full self-driving system.
As Tesla expanded its effort from self-driving to broader artificial intelligence, Karpathy was promoted to senior director of AI at Tesla.
In March, Karpathy announced that he was going on sabbatical for four months. At the time, we reported that it was worrisome since Tesla executives taking breaks has most often resulted in them not coming back.
Sure enough, Karpathy announced in July that he was not coming back to Tesla to focus on his “long-term passions around technical work in AI, open source and education.”
On the Lex Fridman podcast this weekend, the engineer elaborated on why he left Tesla. Karpathy said that his role had grown too managerial and consisted of too many meetings rather than actual engineering.
Interestingly, Karpathy also added that he could see himself coming back to Tesla in the future:
It was difficult because I love Tesla, I love Elon, I love the team really. I would actually be interested in revisiting [Tesla] – maybe coming back at some point, maybe to work on Optimus or AGI at Tesla. I think Tesla is going to do incredible things. It’s a massive large-scale robotics company with in-house talent doing incredible things.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded on Twitter by saying that the engineer would “always be welcome at Tesla.”
Karpathy was a big loss for Tesla, but he left only after helping to build a large, talented team, so his impact is likely going to be felt for a long time.
I understand his reason for leaving, but I feel like there might be more to it because if that was the only reason, he could have moved to a more hardcore engineering role and walked back his managerial duties. I am sure Tesla would have found a use for his talents.
But it’s nice to hear him be willing to come back to Tesla in the future.

2022/10/31,"Panasonic announced today that it aims to produce 30 GWh of battery cells during the first phase of its new Kansas factory expected to supply Tesla’s vehicle production.
Earlier this summer, Panasonic announced plans to build a new battery cell factory in Kansas to supply Tesla with more battery cells.
Today, the Japanese battery manufacturer released more information about the project.
We now know that Panasonic is planning to break ground in De Soto, Kansas, as soon as next month:
Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd., a Panasonic Group company, will begin construction in November 2022 of its new facility that will produce cylindrical Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EV). The facility in De Soto, Kansas will be the Company’s second EV battery facility in the U.S., following the Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA) facility in Sparks, Nevada.
De Soto is located just outside of Kansas City on the Kansas side:
Panasonic also clarified what it plans to produce at the new plant. It was believed that Panasonic might produce Tesla’s new 4680 battery cell format at the plant, but the company actually confirmed that, at least for the first phase, it will produce 2170 battery cells – pictured above.
Tesla is also the world’s biggest consumer of 2170 cells, which is used in most of its electric vehicles today.
Panasonic said that it is aiming for a production of 30 GWh during the first phase of the factory:
Initially, the new manufacturing facility in Kansas will expand the existing production of Panasonic’s 2170 EV batteries, which are currently in high demand from customers. Launching the facility with 2170 batteries ensures Panasonic can begin fulfilling customer orders quickly. Mass production is targeted to begin by the end of March 2025, with the initial production capacity of the new facility expected to be 30 GWh.
The company made it clear that it will expand beyond that capacity in future phases.
Kazuo Tadanobu, president, CEO of Panasonic Energy Co, commented on today’s announcement:
As the global shift to EVs accelerates, we are looking into ways to strengthen our battery production capacity in North America and meet the growing demand from our automotive partners. With our superior technology and extensive experience, we will drive the growth of the Li-ion battery industry, accelerate our efforts to achieve zero emissions in the future, and work toward our mission of achieving a society in which the pursuit of happiness and a sustainable environment are harmonized.
The 30 GWh capacity puts the new plant in the “Gigafactory” level and should enable the production of around 400,000 electric vehicles per year.
The factory is also strategically located in the middle of the US so it can supply growing electric vehicle production all around the country, including Tesla, which has been Panasonic’s biggest partner in battery production.
The new factory is going to be located around 700 miles from Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas, where most of the automaker’s new production capacity is expected to come from for the next few years in the US.

2022/10/31,"Tesla has showcased the strength of its actuator technology for Tesla Bot, its humanoid robot, by having a single leg actuator of the robot lift an entire piano.
Part of the logic for Tesla to venture into creating a humanoid robot, which doesn’t seem aligned with its mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy and transport, was that the automaker felt like its vehicles were already “robots on wheels.”
Tesla believed that a lot of its existing technology and expertise would transfer well to a bipedal robot, and therefore, it felt like it was in a good position to deliver on this potentially world-changing idea of having functional humanoid robots.
For example, like its electric vehicles, the robot is powered by batteries, it is equipped with the same self-driving computer and similar sensor suite to power its vision system, and Tesla already has experience developing electric motors and actuators, which are also used to power robots.
Konstantinos Laskaris, Tesla’s principal motor designer, has been in charge of developing electric motors and actuators for Tesla’s vehicles for over a decade at this point.
His team has now been tasked to develop actuators specifically for Tesla Optimus, the latest version of the Tesla Bot.
At Tesla’s AI Day last month, the company unveiled the latest Tesla Optimus prototype equipped with Tesla-designed actuators for the first time rather than off-the-shelves products.
Unfortunately, the prototype was so recent that Tesla wasn’t ready to make it walk just yet at the event.
The robot is equipped with 28 structural actuators including two primary leg actuators.
While it couldn’t show it walking, Tesla has decided to now release a new video showcasing just how strong Tesla Bot’s primary leg actuators are by having a single actuator lift a half-ton/500 kg concert grand piano:
Tesla’s Laskaris is the one playing the piano in the video.
At its AI Day, Tesla did note that it believes its latest robot equipped with its own actuators should be able to walk in the coming weeks.
Tesla doesn’t often produce marketing videos like this one, but maybe we will get one with a walking Tesla Bot soon.

2022/10/28,"Tesla is starting to clear another 170 acres of forest at Gigafactory Berlin to prepare for a massive expansion of the EV factory.
Gigafactory Berlin currently sits on about 300 hectares that Tesla acquired for the giant manufacturing project.
The site is located in a large forested area and the automaker had to clear a large part of the forest in order to create space for the construction of the plant.
It was a controversial project for some conservationists due to some animal species living in the area that could have their habitats affected, but the automaker was eventually approved to clear the area in 2020.
Here are the sections that Tesla cleared:
The first section cleared for the first phase of the factory consists of 90 hectares or about 220 acres. It was completed in early 2020.
Now we learn that Tesla is starting to clear another 70 hectares (approximately 170 acres) for an expansion (via rbb24, translated from German):
The US electric car manufacturer Tesla wants to expand its factory in Grünheide (Oder-Spree) in Brandenburg. The next expansion stage on the site is currently being prepared to expand production capacity, as the German Press Agency learned from the company on Friday. For this purpose, 70 hectares of pine forest would be cleared from this Friday.
The expansion is already attracting attention from environmentalists who again plan to voice concerns about the deforestation effort.
Last month, we reported on Tesla applying for permits for an expansion project at Gigafactory Berlin that includes building a freight depot, train station, training center, and kindergarten, as well as more logistics areas to support production.
The first phase of Gigafactory Berlin aims to produce 5,000 Model Y vehicles per week and the automaker is currently producing 2,000 units per week.
Tesla is also planning to build battery cells at the factory and eventually build other electric vehicles.
The company already employs 7,000 workers at the factory, but the number of workers is expected to increase to 12,000 at full scale.

2022/10/28,"Tesla Model Y took the top spot on the list of best-selling cars in Europe in September, and the electric SUV might stay there for a while.
Over the years, Tesla’s vehicles have often become the best-selling vehicles in certain European markets.
However, it never topped the list of best-selling cars in the entire European continent until now.
Reuters announced the accomplishment, which was based on new car registration data released by JATO Dynamics:
This is the first time that Tesla’s sports utility vehicle has led the rankings in Europe, London-based JATO Dynamics said on Wednesday as 29,367 Model Y cars were registered last month, up 227% from last year.
The Tesla Model Y took the top spot away from the Peugeot 208, which came in second, and Renault’s Dacia Sandero came third in the September best-selling car rankings. Both of those vehicles are also much cheaper than Tesla’s electric SUV.
The electric SUV was able to take the top spot due to wider availability thanks to Tesla ramping up production at Gigafactory Berlin.
Tesla confirmed that Gigafactory Berlin achieved a production rate of 2,000 Model Y vehicles in a week at the end of September. Those Model Y SUVs are superficially for European markets, and Tesla continues to import more Model Y vehicles in Europe from China.
Now that it has taken the top spot, I think that the Tesla Model Y could keep it for a while.
Tesla’s production rate of 2,000 units per week was only achieved at the end of September, and therefore, it will only impact deliveries in Q4.
Those vehicles are part of Tesla’s extra ~20,000 vehicles that were in transit at the end of the quarter.
Also, Tesla is not stopping at 2,000 vehicles per week. The automaker is looking to ramp production at Gigafactory Berlin to 5,000 Model Ys per week, which should greatly improve availability and wait times in Europe.
If demand can hold, Model Y should have no problem staying at the top of the best-selling car list in Europe, and maybe soon for the whole world.

2022/10/27,"Tesla Powerwall was powering 44,000 homes in Puerto Rico during the latest island-wide grid outage due to a hurricane.
The number of Powerwalls on the island is much higher than expected.
In 2017, Puerto Rico’s power grid was badly destroyed by a strong hurricane.
At the time, Tesla had somewhat recently launched its energy division and its Powerwall home battery pack. The company saw an opportunity to help the region and showcase its new product. Tesla focused its then limited Powerwall production on supplying Puerto Rico with battery packs that could provide backup power in case of outages.
We reported that the company focused on critical services. For example, along with the Powerwalls, Tesla deployed a series of Powerpack systems on the Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra for a sanitary sewer treatment plant, the Arcadia water pumping station, the Ciudad Dorada elderly community, the Susan Centeno hospital, and the Boys and Girls Club of Vieques.
The automaker’s energy division also deployed a solar+battery system at a hospital in Puerto Rico.
Less than a year after the natural disaster, Tesla claimed that it had 11,000 energy storage projects underway. That was a surprising number, but now a few years later, we learn that Tesla has kept going and now has Powerwalls at 44,000 homes in Puerto Rico.
Tesla made the announcement on Twitter in response to Powerwall owners reporting the performance of their home battery packs:
Powerwall powered 44k homes in Puerto Rico for an average of 5 days while the grid was down https://t.co/EwbgxFCRje
The report of the Powerwall performance in Puerto Rico comes after the island was hit by another hurricane in September.
Five years after the devastating hurricane Maria, the island’s power grid was still not ready to take on another strong hurricane and shut down for days in large parts of the island.
However, many homeowners added home battery packs, like Tesla Powerwalls, to their electrical systems over the last few years, and they managed to keep the lights on during the latest hurricane. Many of those battery systems are also connected to solar power, which enables homeowners to operate off-grid.
Tesla’s Powerwalls are not the only home battery packs on the island, though, as other companies have released competing products in recent years.

2022/10/27,"Tesla Cyberquad for Kids, a small toy ATV, is getting recalled after a 36-year-old, who probably had no business riding the toy, got a bruise.
In lieu of the actual Cyberquad, which is expected to be a full-scale electric ATV that is going to be an option with the Cybertruck, Tesla launched the Cyberquad for Kids in partnership with Radio Flyer last year.
It is equipped with a small 500-watt electric motor and 288 Wh battery pack capable of a top speed of 16 km/h (10 mph) and a few miles of range.
It’s basically a small working replica of the Cyberquad as a toy vehicle. You often see similar toys in the shape of a small Jeep:
The toy proved popular, and Tesla quickly sold out of the 5,000 units, which were sold for $1,900 each.
Today, Radio Flyer announced that it is recalling the Tesla Cyberquad for Kids at the request of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
The company sent the notice to customers today:
The reasoning appears to be based on the commission’s decision to consider the vehicle to be a “youth ATV” rather than a toy. The recall notice states that Tesla Cyberquad for Kids doesn’t comply with the safety standard requirements for this category:
The Cyberquad fails to comply with the federal mandatory safety standard requirements for youth ATVs, including mechanical suspension and maximum tire pressure. Additionally, the Cyberquad lacks a CPSC-approved ATV action plan, which is required to manufacture, import, sell, or distribute ATVs. ATV action plans contain numerous safety requirements, such as rider training, dissemination of safety information, age recommendations, and other safety measures. These ATV safety standards are in place to reduce crash and injury hazards, preventing serious injury or death.
That’s the “hazard” that led to the recall, according to the commission, but the commission also noted there was an accident that apparently prompted the process. It’s surprising that the accident was considered relevant, based on the incident report that the US Consumer Product Safety Commission included in the recall:
Radio Flyer has received one report of an incident where the single-rider Cyberquad tipped over when driven by an eight-year-old child and a 36-year-old adult female, resulting in a bruised left shoulder to the adult female.
The commission apparently thought it was relevant to the recall that a 36-year-old adult who decided to ride the Tesla Cyberquad for Kids, a single-rider vehicle meant for kids, got a bruise when riding the ATV with an eight-year-old.
As a result of the recall, owners who send back the drivetrain will get fully refunded. The drivetrain is easier to ship out than the full vehicle and removing it disables the Cyberquad – because it is such a hazard …

2022/10/27,"Tesla has issued a recall of just over 24,000 Model 3 vehicles over a seat belt problem. It’s a rare real “physical” recall for the automaker after many “recalls” that were just software updates.
Earlier this year, NHTSA issued a series of recalls on Tesla vehicles that were highly reported in the media.
What was less reported, though, is that almost all of those recalls were fairly simple software issues that Tesla has been able to fix through over-the-air software updates.
Whenever there’s a safety-related issue, NHTSA has to issue a “safety recall,” even if the automaker doesn’t have to physically recall any vehicle, which leads to some confusion.
Again last month, a Tesla recall of “1 million vehicles” made many headlines when the recall simply consisted of Tesla changing how its software handled window operations.
These instances have led Tesla CEO Elon Musk to complain about the term “recall” and how it is being used against Tesla by the media.
But to be fair, Tesla still sometimes has “real recalls” where the vehicles need to be physically recalled to a service center.
We have a new example today as Tesla started sending emails to Model 3 customers about a new recall:
Tesla has decided to proactively recall certain Model 3 vehicles manufactured between 2017–2022 to inspect the assembly of the second-row left-hand seat belt buckle and the center seat belt anchor to ensure components are fastened to specification. Our records indicate that your vehicle(s), 5YJ3E1EA8JF0XXXXX, may be affected by this recall.
According to NHTSA documents, the recall affects 24,064 Model 3 vehicles built since 2017.
In the defect notice, NHTSA describes the problem, which appears to have been caused by a service issue rather than manufacturing:
Servicing certain components in Model 3 vehicles requires disassembly of the second-row left seat belt buckle and center seat belt anchor, both of which are fastened with the same bolt. Both components may have been incorrectly reassembled after disassembly during a service action.
Tesla described the chronology of the events that led to the voluntary recall:
The good news is that the fix is fairly simple as described in the notice:
Tesla will inspect the reassembly of second-row left seat belt buckle and center seat belt anchor and, where necessary, fasten the components to correct specifications. The remedy will be provided free of charge.
Also, some customers might have already paid to fix this issue, and now that it has been determined to be a manufacturer defect, those Tesla owners are entitled to a refund.

2022/10/26,"Tesla is reportedly under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice in the United States over self-driving claims.
Over the last few months, there has been mounting pressure from regulators, politicians, and the media regarding Tesla’s self-driving effort.
Tesla Autopilot has been under NHTSA investigation for a year now, and Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has been under attack by a well-financed smear campaign that has reached politicians.
These are both challenges that Tesla has faced successfully in the past.
But now the automaker is reportedly facing something new for the company: a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice into its self-driving claims.
Reuters reported today that several sources have confirmed the probe:
Tesla Inc is under criminal investigation in the United States over claims that the company’s electric vehicles can drive themselves, three people familiar with the matter said.
According to the report, the Justice Department is looking into “whether Tesla misled consumers, investors and regulators by making unsupported claims about its driver assistance technology’s capabilities.”
Tesla always said that its current driver assist features under its Autopilot or Full Self-Driving Beta packages require constant monitoring and drivers need to be ready to take control at all time.
However, the company and CEO Elon Musk specifically have been criticized for marketing the features in a way that can be confusing to the public.
Reuters writes in the report:
The Justice Department investigation potentially represents a more serious level of scrutiny because of the possibility of criminal charges against the company or individual executives, the people familiar with the inquiry said.
The report also notes that there are competing investigations involving Tesla and Musk.
Let’s preface this by adding the classic disclaimer that I’m not a lawyer, but this sounds serious.
In terms of liability regarding accidents, Tesla has always been fairly careful in adding a lot of warnings through the activation of any driver-assist features.
I do think that buyers have a case against Tesla over the company not delivering on the promises of Full Self-Driving. But that’s going to be settled through civil litigation. There is already a class action lawsuit filed last month.
I don’t know how criminal charges could apply, but again, I’m not a lawyer.

2022/10/26,"Unplugged Performance is launching an aftermarket wheel for the Tesla Cybertruck – even before you can order the electric truck itself.
The hype is so strong around the Tesla Cybertruck that some people have been working on third-party accessories for the vehicle for a while now.
We previously reported on some wild ones like the CyberLandr, which is trying to fit a full camper into the electric pickup’s bed, and an accessory kit that turns the electric pickup truck into a catamaran.
Now we get a more realistic accessory for the Cybertruck, and it is coming from a company that already has a lot of credibility in Tesla mods: Unplugged Performance (UP).
The California-based company unveiled its CYBERHEX forged wheels designed for the Cybertruck.
UP wrote about the new product on its website:
The first aftermarket wheel designed for the Telsa Cybertruck through a collaboration between Unplugged Performance and accomplished sports car designer Sasha Selipanov, with all the right brutalist neo-futuristic design notes and incredible strength to take you anywhere on Earth or beyond.
Here are a few pictures of the CYBERHEX wheels in different colors: 
Ben Schaffer, CEO of Unplugged Performance, commented on the launch of the new wheels:
The Cybertruck represents an exciting phase and future for our brand. Having started as the first engineering house to enhance Tesla vehicles, we’re thrilled with the Cybertruck’s potential to cross all boundaries and surpass legacy assumptions of what a vehicle can do. We have enormous plans to support the Cybertruck future and this wheel debut is a sign of things to come as we re-write expectations. It remains our priority at UP to continue our partnerships with cutting-edge world-class factories as well as the brightest and best minds in design.
While the wheels are designed for the Cybertruck, they can also fit Tesla’s existing vehicles.
UP released a few images of the wheels on a Model S and Model 3:
While UP is unveiling the wheel and taking pre-orders now, the company made it clear that nothing will ship until it can do final testing with the Cybertruck, which is not expected to reach production until mid-2023.
On top of the wheels, Unplugged confirmed its intentions to develop other aftermarket products for the Cybertrucks, including performance brakes, suspensions, and even body mods.
Tesla has indicated that the Cybertruck is only going to be available with its stainless steel finish and therefore, there are going to be a lot of trucks that look the same on the roads. That should make aftermarket mods pretty popular.

2022/10/26,"Porsche and Tesla have built up a sort of rivalry between the Taycan and Model S, and now the German automaker is reportedly looking to take the rivalry to a new level with a tri-motor Taycan to compete with Tesla Model S Plaid, according to a new report.
After Porsche brought its brand-new Taycan electric car to the Nürburgring racetrack to break a record in 2019, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to use the famous proving grounds for the electric automaker’s own latest performance vehicle.
Tesla started testing early Model S Plaid prototypes at the track and achieved some impressive lap times. However, the vehicle was delayed, and it didn’t launch until two years later.
Last year, Tesla brought its then brand-new Model S Plaid to the Nürburgring track and beat Porsche’s record with an impressive 7:35.579 lap.
It appears that it created a sort of rivalry between the two companies, and more specifically, between the two flagship sedans.
Earlier this year, Porsche brought a Taycan back to Nürburgring and beat Tesla’s time by two seconds to again claim the fastest lap record for a production series electric car, but not without controversy since the automaker used a Taycan equipped with a new “performance kit” that is “only available in Germany and only for the 2023 model year Taycan Turbo S sports sedan.”
Now according to a new report from UK’s Auto Express, Porsche is testing a new Taycan with a tri-motor configuration – like the Tesla Model S Plaid:
The Taycan range kicks off with the entry-level rear-wheel drive version, and the new tri-motor variant should supersede the Turbo S as the fastest model available. Given the upgrades, we predict a slight increase over the Taycan’s £75,500 starting price, with the upcoming flagship costing well in excess of the £142,400 Turbo S.
Performance kit or not, this version could really make a mark in terms of performance.
It’s not clear when the new tri-motor version of the Taycan will hit the market, but it will interesting to see if it pushes Tesla to have a response when it does.

2022/10/26,"Tesla has unveiled its Megafactory in California for the first time as part of a hiring effort as it ramps up battery production.
Last year, Tesla broke ground on a new “Megafactory” to produce Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California. The goal is to have a new factory focused only on building the large battery pack for utility-scale energy storage projects.
CEO Elon Musk revealed that Tesla aims for Megafactory to produce an impressive 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.
Despite working on the new manufacturing facility for about a year, we didn’t hear much about Tesla’s effort until last month when the automaker started to ramp up hiring.
Now Tesla has unveiled the Megafactory for the first time in a LinkedIn video as it promotes a new hiring effort at the factory:
The images shown in the video include footage of Megapack production inside the factory:
It’s impressive that Tesla managed to achieve production at the facility roughly a year after breaking ground.
Electrek heard from sources familiar with the matter that Tesla has been making great progress at the Megafactory. Tesla had previously been producing Megapacks exclusively at Gigafactory Nevada, but production is now ramping up fast at Megafactory in California with already the capacity to produce up to 25 Megapacks in a single day, according to sources.
However, the production capacity is fairly recent, and, therefore, the deployment won’t be felt until Q4 and into 2023, when Tesla can install the battery packs and the energy storage projects can be commissioned.
Last week, Tesla reported a record quarter for energy storage deployment with 2.1 GWh deployed in a single quarter.
I don’t even know if Megafactory’s output had any impact on this record, but if it did, it was minimal.
In Q4 and deeper into 2023 is likely when we are going to start feeling the impact of the new factory’s output as the Megapacks get shipped, installed, and commissioned.
I think people should expect significant jumps in energy storage deployment at Tesla in the coming quarters.
Musk believes Tesla’s energy division can eventually rival Tesla’s auto business in scale. We won’t be anywhere near that with the output of the Megafactory, but it’s certainly an important step closer.
For comparison, there is as much as 50 times the Model Y’s battery energy capacity in a Megapack. So an output of 25 per day is equivalent to the batteries in more than 1,000 electric cars.

2022/10/25,"Idra, the maker of Tesla’s large casting press, confirmed that it is now shipping Tesla’s Cybertruck Giga Press, which is going to be the new world’s largest press.
Earlier this year, Idra teased a new 9,000-ton Giga press that would take the prize as largest in the world. Considering Tesla’s relationship with Idra, it was rumored that the new machine would be for the automaker.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has since confirmed that the machine is going to be used for the Cybertruck body at Gigafactory Texas.
Today, the Italian casting expert announced that the giant Giga Press is packed and leaving for Tesla:
It’s one of the most critical pieces of manufacturing equipment that Tesla will need to bring the Cybertruck to production. Tesla is expected to use the massive machine to build the stainless steel body of the electric pickup truck.
Speaking about how massive of a machine we are talking about, here are five grown men standing inside the Giga Press platen:
This picture was shared by Idra after a visit from the North American Die Casting Association last week before they packed the machine.
Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the automaker is currently installing the Cybertruck production line:
We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas.
It was a welcomed announcement for the many Cybertruck reservation holders who are tracking Tesla’s progress toward production after the vehicle program was delayed.
Tesla reiterated that it is aiming to start production in mid-2023, and Musk indicated that he should be driving a Beta Cybertruck prototype within the next few weeks.
Automakers are taking note of Tesla’s approach to casting.
Tesla’s investment in larger cast parts has been extremely successful so far. The automaker managed to produce the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle, and it is doing the same with the front underbody.
This greatly simplifies the manufacturing process and reduces costs.
Following the success of the integration of large casting technology, several other automakers are apparently looking to follow in Tesla’s footsteps.
Idra reported last year that half a dozen other automakers are currently in talks to adopt the technology, but it could take years before they can integrate it into any vehicle programs.

2022/10/25,"Tesla is expanding the hiring of recruiters and a support team for a “high-volume” hiring effort in Quebec amid rumors of a potential factory coming to the region.
Earlier this year, we started reporting on evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential location in Canada for its next Gigafactory.
Tesla plans to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade, and it is expected to need about eight more Gigafactories to do it.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America, and the CEO hinted at Canada for Tesla’s next Gigafactory, which he says should be announced by the end of the year.
Musk did it again at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting last month, and the effort was confirmed through a lobbying disclosure by the automaker with the Ontario government in Canada.
Later, a local report stated that Tesla had visited Vale’s nickel operations in Canada and was scouting sites for a factory in Ontario and Quebec.
We also reported that Tesla visited a graphite mining and processing company based in Quebec’s battery valley.
The biggest evidence that Tesla was looking to establish a factory in Canada, and more specifically in Quebec, came in the form of a job posting for a “high volume recruiter” in Quebec.
It was significant since Tesla has used similar language about “high volume” recruiting ahead of other big factory projects, like Gigafactory Berlin in Germany.
That was back in September and we have heard much since, but now Tesla has posted another interesting job posting.
Electrek found a new job posting for a ‘Recruiting Coordinator’ based in Laval, Quebec, which is just outside of Montreal. In the job posting, Tesla writes that the coordinator will “work closely with high-volume Recruiters”:
Work closely with high-volume Recruiters in a fast-paced organization. We see our candidates as our guests, and we are their hosts. Act as a guide for candidates through the onboarding process ensuring a smooth candidate experience.
The job posting makes it sound like Tesla is preparing to recruit and onboard a high volume of new employees in Quebec.
Musk has said that Tesla is looking to announce the location of Tesla’s next Gigafactory by the end of the year.
Being from Quebec, I admit that I am biased in wanting Tesla to invest in a facility in Quebec. So please take that into account in my reporting.
With that said, I think that it starting to look very good for Quebec to get a Tesla factory.
However, it might not be a new Gigafactory, which generally means high-volume vehicle and battery production. It could very well be a new factory that fits in Tesla’s fast-growing supply chain.
I am talking about a battery cell factory or even a cathode or anode material factory.
What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/10/25,"Tesla has produced a new guide to familiarize yourself with the sounds that its electric cars make. Even though EVs are quieter than gasoline-powered vehicles, it doesn’t mean they are noiseless.
Electric cars not only reduce pollution from harmful emissions at the tailpipe, but they also reduce noise pollution.
That’s a benefit that is often underappreciated, but a reduction in noise pollution has been associated with a reduction in stress, which is a silent killer in our society.
Studies have even directly linked electric cars and a reduction in stress to noise reduction.
However, for some, the lack or reduction of noise in electric vehicles is a downside. Many gearheads like the noise of engines and feel like the lack of noise in an electric car is a downside to the driving experience.
While electric vehicles do make less sound than gasoline-powered vehicles, especially when they accelerate, they do still make sounds, and all electric motors make different ones.
Interestingly, Tesla decided to help its owners familiarize themselves with the sounds that their electric vehicles make by putting a guide of “Normal Operating Sounds.”
Electrek found the guide released on Tesla’s support website last week:
While your Model 3 is incredibly quiet, it is not completely silent. There are some sounds your vehicle makes as part of its normal daily operation and are not a cause for concern. Below is a list of possible normal operating sounds your vehicle could make based on where the sound is coming from.
In the guide, Tesla includes sounds that it considers normal inside of its vehicles, like this “Humming, Whirring, or Wooshing Sound” when driving.
The automaker did start the guide with a quick warning:
This is a general guide to help you understand common sounds you may hear from your vehicle during its normal course of operation. It is not a diagnosis of your vehicle, and does not represent a comprehensive list of normal sounds you may hear. If you wish to schedule an appointment with Tesla Service for any reason, contact your local service center.
Here are some of the other “sounds of a Tesla”:
Vibration Sound/Feeling in Steering Wheel
This sound is specifically caused by the steering wheel vibrating because of Lane Departure Warning alerts.
Whirring or Whining While Driving at Low Speeds (if Equipped with Pedestrian Warning System)
That’s just the pedestrian warning sound that Tesla is forced to add as part of regulations regarding “quiet vehicles.”
Noise in Driver’s Footwell When Brake is Pressed
This sound is related to the “Hold” function that may initiate after coming to a stop.
Tesla has also included sounds that you may hear when the vehicle is parked.
Clicking, Clunking, or Thumping Sound From Floor of Vehicle
This sound has an interesting origin. Tesla writes in the guide:
When Parked, Model 3 opens the HV Battery contactors to help conserve energy. This sound occurs when you start the vehicle after it’s been Parked, and signifies that the high voltage contactors are closing the circuit between your vehicle and the Battery.
Creaking or Cranking From the Tires or Brakes
As the name of the sound indicates, this is as simple as the brakes being released.
Banging, Clunking, Popping, or Thumping Noise While Supercharging
This sound while supercharging apparently can be explained by the metal components in your vehicle’s battery pack naturally expanding or contracting to accommodate ambient temperature changes.

2022/10/24,"Tesla is rumored to be looking to invest in Nuevo Leon, a Mexican state bordering Texas, as CEO Elon Musk meets with the governor.
Earlier this year, people crossing the border between Texas and Nuevo Leon were surprised to see not just the usual marked lanes for cars and trucks but also one marked “Tesla” – pictured above.
We ended up finding out that Tesla had struck a deal with the state of Nuevo Leon to have its own lane at the border crossing in order to reduce wait times for cargo going through the border. Or at least that was the explanation of Ivan Rivas, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon.
While it’s true that Tesla has several suppliers in the state, as we reported at the time, we suspected that the move might have more to do with Tesla potentially investing in a factory in the state.
Earlier this year, we reported on CEO Elon Musk confirming that Tesla is considering sites for a new factory in Canada, Mexico, and the United States when discussing its next plant in North America.
Now Reuters has reported that Musk recently met with Nuevo Leon Governor Samuel Garcia, along with other local officials, and Ken Salazar, the US ambassador to Mexico.
According to a source talking to the publication, Tesla is interested in Santa Catarina, a municipality just outside of Monterrey, where many automotive companies, especially tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers are located.
It is located about 400 miles or a seven-hour drive from Tesla Gigafactory Texas in Austin.
The publication couldn’t say what Tesla would be investing into in the region, but as previously mentioned, Tesla has been considering Mexico for its next factory in North America.
I know there have been a lot of indications that Canada might get the next Tesla Gigafactory. Not only could that still be the case, but I can certainly also see a scenario where everyone gets a new Tesla factory.
Based on Tesla’s plans, the automaker is going to need eight more Gigafactories by the end of the decade. 
On top of that, the company has shown intentions to invest in other factories, like anode and cathode material production for batteries, to boost its supply chain. We expect several more of those projects to be announced soon.

2022/10/24,"Toyota is struggling with its shift to electric vehicles, and it is reportedly considering major changes in its EV plans driven by Tesla’s manufacturing strategy.
However, it may slow down some of its existing electric vehicle programs.
For years, we have been reporting on how Toyota has been lagging behind the competition in the shift to battery-powered electric vehicles. The automaker has been known for (delusionally) investing in hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid vehicles instead.
Toyota has continued to be highly critical of going all-in in battery-electric vehicles despite announcing its own plan last year to bring 30 battery EV models to market by 2030. The plan is only a year old, at least publicly, and yet, Toyota is reportedly considering a major overhaul of its EV plan.
Reuters reported today:
Toyota is considering a reboot of its electric-car strategy to better compete in a booming market it has been slow to enter, and has halted some work on existing EV projects, four people with knowledge of the still-developing plans said.
Toyota reportedly has a working group evaluating significant changes to its EV platforms that will revamp its EV plan.
A decision is to be made early next year, and work is reportedly stopping on some EV programs in the meantime.
Toyota didn’t confirm or deny Reuters’ report, but it did comment:
In order to achieve carbon neutrality, Toyota’s own technology – as well as the work we are doing with a range of partners and suppliers – is essential.
According to the report, the review of Toyota’s EV plan, which is led by Shigeki Terashiwas, was triggered in part by Tesla “winning the factory cost wars on EVs.”
Toyota was reportedly surprised by the successful use of some manufacturing technology by Tesla, including the “giga press” that is enabling the Texas-based automaker to produce larger casting parts. It leads to manufacturing efficiency.
One of the Toyota sources in the report said:
What’s driving Mr. Terashi’s effort is the EV’s faster-than-anticipated takeoff and rapid-fire adoptions of cutting-edge innovations by Tesla and others.
Toyota has been seen as a leader in manufacturing in the auto industry. While Tesla’s manufacturing has been criticized in the past, in the EV shift, there’s no denying that the company is emerging as a leader.
Tesla now has the capacity to produce millions of long-range electric vehicles, and it does it with an industry-leading gross margin.
According to the report, Toyota is taking notes and looking to potentially develop a new EV platform from the ground up based on those notes.
On top of the Tesla inspiration, Toyota is also inspired to change EV plans due to the lack of success with its own lone battery-electric vehicle program in the US.
Toyota had to stop selling the bZ4X electric SUV because it was plagued by some bad recalls.
Some good and some bad here. I often say that other automakers, even well-established ones like Toyota, should look at Tesla’s success in mass-producing electric vehicles.
If Toyota is finally doing that and improving its own EV platform, that’s good.
However, it sounds like it is going to slow down some existing EV programs that Toyota is already working on. Considering the fact that the company is already late to the EV party, another revamp of its plan right now could delay existing programs that should have been launched in the next few years.
It’s probably too early to judge how Toyota’s EV shift is going to play out, but to me, it looks like the company is scrambling after finally realizing that it was wrong to dismiss battery-electric vehicles for so long.

2022/10/24,"Tesla has released a new software update (2022.40.1) that delivers improved charging efficiency for faster charge time and reduced energy costs, along with a few other goodies.
Some Tesla owners are waking up to a new software update bringing new features and capabilities to their vehicles.
All Tesla vehicles built over the last 10 years are equipped with over-the-air software capability, and the automaker has taken full advantage of that capability with regular software updates.
Those software updates sometimes bring new games and fun features as part of Tesla’s mission to make the Tesla ownership experience as exciting as possible, but sometimes they also bring new capabilities and even more efficiency to the powertrain.
This new 2022.40.1 software update being pushed to the Tesla fleet right now fits into both categories.
Not a Tesla App posted the release notes showing the biggest part of the 2022.40.1 software update is improved charging efficiency.
Tesla wrote in the release notes:
During DC fast charging, the thermal system controls have been optimized for each charging station’s power capability, improving both charging and on-route battery preconditioning efficiency. This results in fast charge time and reduced energy costs.
It sounds like Tesla has found a way to deliver faster charge times and more efficiency through software.
The update also includes a bunch of smaller new features, including some kind of a combination of Tesla’s existing Dog Mode and Sentry Mode. Dog Mode is intended to keep your dog safe inside the vehicle alone by maintaining climate control and showing a message on the screen that the dog is not in danger. As for Sentry Mode, it is a surveillance.feature that uses Autopilot cameras all around the vehicle to detect people approaching the vehicle and either start an alarm or record any event.
Tesla wrote about the new feature leveraging these modes in the release notes:
Your vehicle and pets can be kept safe by activating Dog Mode and Sentry Mode at the same time. Sentry Mode alarms are silenced if Dog Mode and Sentry Mode are both enabled. Mobile app notifications will still be sent and video footage will still be saved.
Tesla is also releasing a new “Driver Door Unlock Mode”:
When Driver Door Unlock Mode is enabled, long pressing the interior driver door switch will unlock all doors and the trunk. To access Driver Door Unlock Mode, tap Controls > Lock > Driver Door Unlock Mode.
And finally, Tesla is also adding radio station logos to the media players:
The Media Player now displays radio station logos for improved discoverability when searching for favorite stations.
As usual, Tesla’s update can take time before it reaches all vehicles in the fleet.

2022/10/24,"Tesla has decided to pull on demand levers in China with the launch of a new referral program in the market and cutting prices on Model 3 and Model Y. The TSLA Stock price is down in pre-market.
Over the last few months, there have been increased concerns about softening of demand for Tesla vehicles.
It was enough for CEO Elon Musk to address it during the conference call following the release of Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results.
The CEO reiterated that “Tesla doesn’t have a demand issue”:
I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far in the future as we can see.
In terms of demand softening for Tesla, we reported earlier this month that Tesla’s demand shouldn’t be seen as a concern until Tesla starts pulling on some “demand levers” – meaning that the automaker takes some action to actually create some demand.
To be sure Tesla has a full quiver of such levers. One example is that Tesla recently announced new colors out of its German factory. Those cars are now sold out for months longer than previous colors, even with a €3200 premium. 
For the better part of the last two years, Tesla has been coasting on the demand front and didn’t do anything to encourage it.
In fact, Tesla did the opposite by continuously increasing prices throughout its lineup and even stopped taking orders on some models because its backlog was getting too big.
Now we are seeing the tide changing for the first time in two years.
One of the biggest demand levers you can pull is reducing prices, and that’s exactly what the automaker is doing in China.
Today, Tesla reduced the starting price of its Model 3 built in China to 265,900 yuan (~$36,800) from 279,900 yuan. The Model Y SUV in China also saw a price reduction into the Chinese subsidy range to 299,988 yuan (288,900 after subsidy, ~ $40k USD) from 316,900 yuan. That subsidy will last until the end of the year and sales tax abatement will continue into 2023. 
Furthermore, Tesla has pulled another demand lever in launching a new referral program in China.
We have been reporting for a while that Tesla has been working on a new referral program for vehicle owners after shutting it down completely last year. Last week, we reported on how Tesla should be launching it soon based on some new code in the Tesla mobile app.
Now Tesla has launched a version of the new referral program in China.
The automaker is calling it the ‘”Treasure Chest” Points Rewards’ program. Like the previous referral program, Tesla owners can get rewards if new buyers order through their referral links. The new buyers also get rewards through buying through these new referral links shared through the Tesla app.
The only difference is that instead of directly receiving awards, like free Supercharging miles, both the Tesla owner and the person who made the referral receive “points,” which can later be exchanged for awards like in-vehicle software upgrades, Tesla accessories, or free Supercharging miles.
The points also enter Tesla owners into quarterly and annual raffles.
Here are the prizes for the first quarter 2023 raffle:
And here are the prizes for Tesla’s first “annual sweepstakes”:
It is too early to see just how popular these demand levers are, though we’re already hearing that the increased demand initially brought down Tesla’s Chinese ordering site.

2022/10/21,"The language used by Elon Musk about Tesla’s self-driving effort is changing, and it is muddying the timeline for the automaker to deliver on its promise.
Musk use to make statements that made him sound supremely confident that Tesla could soon deliver a self-driving system and virtually all vehicles the automaker produced since 2016 through a software update.
During Tesla’s Autonomy Day in 2019, he made so many comments that promised that Tesla would achieve full self-driving capabilities that we were able to produce a video of three straight minutes of Musk promising Tesla delivering a self-driving system:
As you can see in this video, Musk was talking about “robotaxis” and “not having to touch the steering wheel” or even not needing to “look out the window” at the time.
He was also talking about Tesla delivering those capabilities in 2020.
Two years later, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Capability, or FSD, is still in beta – it requires the driver to be attentive at all times, and system disengagements are quite frequent.
Tesla is not only behind Musk’s schedule to deliver on the system, but now Musk has been changing the goalpost lately.
The CEO has already stopped talking about the biggest promises, like “1 million robotaxis by the end of the year.” Instead, he has been talking about a wider release of Tesla’s FSD Beta, which again is extremely far from a robot taxi service.
Now during a conference call following the release of Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results, Musk is again being much more careful about the language he uses around Tesla’s self-driving effort.
He again talked about a wider release of FSD Beta:
This quarter, we expect to go to wide release of Full Self-Driving Beta in North America. So, anyone who has ordered a Full Self-Driving package will have access to the FSD beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
But where things got dicey was when Musk was directly asked by an analyst when will Tesla deliver a level 4 or level 5 self-driving system. Those are the levels where drivers don’t have to pay attention.
Musk’s answer was vague, to say the least, and the comment was much weaker than his previous promises:
Well, there’s this debate of what’s the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per mile. Like we’re not saying that that’s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel. It’s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers. So, like when I came to Giga Texas from a friend’s house today, I never touched any of the controls already here.
And then there is a longer process called the march of 9s, which is how many 9s reliability do you need before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it? And there’s some subjectivity as to how many 9s you need. But I think we’ll be pretty close to having enough 9s that you’re going to have no one in the car by the end of this year. And certainly, without a question, that’s in my mind next year.
The CEO then added that Tesla plans to have an FSD update next year that will be used to “show to regulators that the car is safer than the average human.”
Musk is obviously being more careful in his choice of words, but he is still talking about Tesla achieving level 4 or 5 next year.
The most frustrating part is that he obviously doesn’t have much credibility when it comes to this timeline anymore, but he keeps justifying this prediction by saying “you just have to look at the performance of Tesla FSD beta.”
My experience with FSD Beta certainly doesn’t suggest that, but some have had better experiences, especially in California, where there are more owners to train the system.
However, talking to the more unbiased FSD Beta testers, I found it hard to see a clear path to Tesla achieving level 4 or 5 autonomy within the next year.

2022/10/21,"Tesla’s infrastructure is growing at a new record pace with more stores and service centers added in the last quarter than ever, but it’s still not growing as fast as its deliveries.
The phrase “victim of its own success” is something that you can often apply to Tesla, especially when it comes to service.
The automaker has been growing its production and deliveries so fast that it has been hard to keep up the infrastructure to support such a fast-growing customer fleet. However, we are now seeing Tesla deploy new infrastructure at a record pace based on the new data released in Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results.
Tesla’s store and service center count increased to a record 728 locations last quarter. Last quarter, Tesla added 41 retail and service locations. That’s significantly more than 18 to 25 new locations it opened every quarter for the past two years:
While this is a new record number of locations opened in a quarter, it is still only growing 16% year-over-year compared to 42% growth for Tesla’s deliveries during the same period. To be fair, locations don’t equal service capacity as Tesla has been investing lately in bigger service centers, and it has been changing its service process to increase capacity.
Tesla has also been growing its mobile service fleet, which consists of vehicle technicians traveling in cars and vans equipped to do the most common service tasks performed on Tesla vehicles. The company added 79 new vehicles to that fleet for 29% year-over-year growth.
Service is not the only infrastructure that Tesla is growing at a record pace. Tesla deployed 2,718 new Superchargers in Q3 2022. That’s more than the 2,508 Superchargers it deployed the previous quarter, which itself was a record. The automaker now operates 38,883 Superchargers at 4,283 locations around the world. It grew 33% year-over-year – again lagging a bit behind Tesla’s 42% global delivery growth.
In the case of the Supercharger network, you can’t even just compare it to Tesla’s delivery growth since the automaker is also opening up the network to non-Tesla EVs, and it is starting to become a significant revenue stream.
Tesla noted in its Q3 shareholder’s letter:
Paid supercharging grew more than 3x compared to the prior year and we are working to further accelerate our deployments. We continue to expand Supercharging pricing from fixed to variable to better manage vehicle flow through our network.
The automaker has been investing in bigger Supercharger stations with more connectors per station, which has also been contributing to total charging capacity deployment.

2022/10/21,"Tesla has added two new paint colors, Quicksilver and Midnight Cherry Red, to their Giga Berlin paint lines. The new colors are available now – but only for European and Middle Eastern customers.
The colors are a slick-looking medium silver and a deep red metallic color. They replace the former Midnight Silver Metallic (which is more of a gray) and Red Multi-Coat paint colors, but only on Performance and Long Range Model Ys. Other models, and the base rear-wheel-drive Model Y, keep the old color lineup.
The Midnight Cherry Red does look slightly like the original “signature red” color, which early Model S and Model X were available in, though the new color is both darker and has more depth, at least from the few photos and videos that Tesla has released so far. Same with the silver – Tesla used to have a silver color, but recently has only offered a darker gray, but the new Quicksilver does seem to have more depth than the old metallic silver colors.
But these new colors are only being applied in Tesla’s Berlin factory, due to the paint shop there being able to apply more fine layers of paint than Tesla’s US factories. Tesla says that the paint shop can apply “up to 13 layers for depth, dimension & a hand-painted look.”
This means that right-hand drive customers won’t get access to these paint colors – currently, the UK and Ireland Tesla sites show the old gray and red colors. Nor will the US, though Tesla CEO Elon Musk did state that US customers will get a new paint option soon, though we don’t have a timeline on that.
The new colors also come in at a higher price. Previously, gray was €1,600 and red was €2,000, whereas now Quicksilver is €3,000 and Midnight Cherry Red is €3,200. That’s quite a stiff charge for a paint color, though the paint colors do look quite nice.
These colors were expected as early as a year ago. In an app update last October, Tesla leaked three potential new paint colors: “Deep Crimson,” “Mercury Silver,” and “Abyss Blue.” Musk confirmed that two of those would come from Berlin’s paint shop, and we now see what they look like and their updated names.
But we don’t know what happened with Abyss Blue. Could that be the new US color hinted at today, or another color that might come from Giga Berlin?
This actually isn’t the first Midnight Cherry Red Tesla we’ve seen. The color appeared on Musk’s original Tesla Roadster that was launched into space on a SpaceX rocket. It was a one-off custom color at the time, and now European and Middle Eastern Tesla customers can have a similar color on new Teslas.
What do you think of the new colors – and of the higher price for them? Let us know in the comments, and see them in action in Tesla’s video below:

2022/10/20,"Tesla has opened their planned Supercharger voting site, allowing the public to cast votes for upcoming Supercharger locations.
Tesla Superchargers have reached high penetration levels already – earlier this year, Tesla deployed its 35,000th Supercharger stall globally. This represents about a 35% year-over-year increase in the last few years. The Supercharger map shows that there are very few routes left uncovered by Tesla’s network, and Tesla dominates charging experience satisfaction compared to other charging networks.
But they’re still growing the network and hoping to fill in gaps, particularly on less-common travel roads away from the main interstate highway system.
So last month, Tesla decided to “crowdsource” their network development and sent out a tweet asking for location suggestions to be included in a voting system for upcoming Superchargers. The company included the locations that got the most “likes” in the poll. (Seth’s Bennington, Vermont, suggestion and Fred’s Shawinigan, Quebec, suggestion both made the cut, so if you can’t decide where to cast your fifth vote, those are a couple of Electrek’s suggestions.)
Today, Tesla has opened up that poll, and you can now vote on the 183 suggestions which made the cut. These locations seem to pretty much cover all the regions Teslas are available in – North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.
In order to vote, you need to head to Tesla’s Supercharger voting site, log in to your Tesla account, and then look at the list and click on your top five suggestions.
Even non-Tesla owners can vote on the suggestions if they have a Tesla account, which could be important, especially given that Tesla is planning to open Superchargers to non-Tesla EVs (and is running a trial of the same thing in Europe).
It seems that this system will be persistent, as well – each person gets five votes during every three-month voting cycle. After three months, votes are reset, and you can vote again. Tesla is taking suggestions for more new locations as well, and popular suggestions will be added to the next three-month voting round.
Tesla says that these votes will “help us decide on new Supercharger locations” – so the votes aren’t, in a sense, “binding” for the company. It’s merely another way for them to gather information about what routes the public might be having difficulty with on top of the large amounts of information they gather from the public fleet of vehicles and from current Supercharger station use.
And Tesla still has its own plans for Supercharger deployment – the company briefly leaked all upcoming Supercharger locations earlier this month, so development is still happening regardless of this vote.
There are some parts of the country where noninterstate routes have very little Supercharger coverage. Particularly, North-South routes in the Great Plains region have little coverage.
But in other parts of the country, like rural Northern California and the Oregon coast, even off-interstate drives are still extremely easy to do, as I recently showed on a 2,200-mile electric road trip with no prep and almost no time spent waiting for charging. (Hopefully, we’ll get more sites like the excellent Harrisburg, Oregon, Supercharger and their food truck/wine tasting table!)
So this is a good move by Tesla because there are definitely some routes that can still be difficult, and this will help fill in gaps that they can’t fill by reading fleet data alone.
However, I think there could also be a public relations reason for this. Any time someone gives Tesla flack for not having a Supercharger in their pet location, Tesla can now point at the poll and say, “OK, go vote for it.” This could take a minor amount of heat off the company because now it’s the voters’ fault for not voting enough, rather than their fault for not installing at such-and-such niche location.

2022/10/20,"Tesla gave an update on the progress of ramping up 4680 battery cell production. It sounds like they are making progress, but the automaker also appears to be reducing dependence on the new cell.
At its Battery Day in 2020, Tesla unveiled its 4680 battery cell and made a big deal about how the new battery cell format could revolutionize the industry by cutting costs by almost 50%.
At the time, the automaker was already operating a pilot production line in Fremont, California.
However, Tesla has admitted that there are several parts of the process of producing the cell in volume that has been harder to deliver than expected.
It has been hard to track the progress, as Tesla is sharing the production capacity of the 4680 cells rather than how it compared to other quarters.
Nonetheless, it sounds like Tesla is making some progress in an update that came with the release of Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results:
The total number of 4680 cells produced (cells sent to formation) increased 3x sequentially in Q3.
That would be impressive if we knew how many cells Tesla produced in Q2, because if the number was low, a 3x increase is not really impressive.
But Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn did share an additional piece of information during the conference call following the release of the financial results:
The ramp is going well, as Elon said – total output is up 3x quarter over quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter.
At 60 kWh per car, it would mean 60 MWh of weekly 4680 battery cell production or 3 GWh on an annualized basis. That’s not a massive production capacity, but it is certainly significant.
Interestingly, Tesla also made new comments that show the automaker is aiming not to be dependent on ramping up 4680 cell production for new vehicle programs.
CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is not using the 4680 cells in the Tesla Semi electric truck.
Musk was also asked if the Cybertruck is going to be affected by the 4680 production ramp. While the CEO didn’t say that the vehicle doesn’t use the cells, like Tesla Semi, he said that he doesn’t expect the electric pickup truck to be affected.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/10/20,"Tesla is aiming to ramp up Tesla Semi production to 50,000 electric trucks per year – as soon as 2024. It would make Tesla one of the largest class 8 truck manufacturers.
After five years of waiting, Tesla is now finally in early production with the Tesla Semi electric truck.
Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near Gigafactory Nevada. At the time, we were told that the production equipment installed would be for about five electric trucks per week. 
That would be only 250 trucks per year.
However, Tesla always planned to move to higher volume production at Gigafactory Texas.
During the conference call that followed the release of Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is “tentatively” aiming for 50,000 Tesla Semi electric trucks in 2024:
It takes about a year to ramp up production. So, we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America. And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
Musk didn’t want to communicate the price of the vehicle, but he did say:
And these would sell… I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
Interestingly, Musk also confirmed that Tesla Semi doesn’t use 4680 battery cells. He didn’t confirm which cells it uses, but it is presumably the same 2170 cells found in most Tesla Model 3 and Model Y in production today.
The fact that Tesla doesn’t have to rely on 4680 cells for the Tesla Semi should greatly help with the rapidly increasing production of the electric truck.
This is good news because Tesla Semi could have a massive impact on the transport industry at scale. It will not only reduce emissions throughout the industry, but it also has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of operation per mile.
Reducing the cost of transport per mile has an impact on virtually all products that are transported by trucks, and basically anything you can think that has been in a truck at some point.
",tesla
2022/10/20,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla’s engineering team had turned its focus on a next-generation electric car platform that will be half the price of the Model 3/Y platform.
For years now, Tesla has been talking about making cheaper electric vehicles, but inflation and high demand for electric cars have led to prices going up instead.
The automaker has been talking about a next-generation platform enabling a $25,000 electric car in the past. At one point, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla was aiming to release the cheaper vehicle as soon as 2023.
However, Musk announced that Tesla wasn’t working on the cheaper electric car in 2022 as its focus shifted to the Optimus robot and ramping up Model Y production.
The CEO even suggested that cheaper electric vehicles might not be in Tesla’s plans anymore due to self-driving having a bigger impact on cost per mile.
During the conference call that followed the release of Tesla’s Q3 2022 financial results, Musk confirmed that it is still in the plans and that Tesla has shifted its engineering power to developing the next-generation EV platform that will enable cheaper electric cars:
It’s the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously. At this point, we are done with the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi. So, it’s obviously what we’re working on, the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably be about half the cost of the 3 and Y platform. It will be smaller, to be clear.
It sounds like a smaller Tesla vehicle platform that will enable electric cars between $25,000 and $35,000 is in development.
Musk added that this new platform aims to produce more volume than “all of Tesla’s other vehicles combined.”
He added:
Obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi into that platform. But we are on a 2-for-1 target. We’re trying to get to that 50% [of cost] number again.
The CEO believes that Tesla’s next-gen vehicle platform is going to be able to produce electric cars for half the cost, labor, and factory space that it takes to produce a Model 3, which currently starts at $47,000.
Glad that we get a confirmation that cheaper electric cars are back in the cards for Tesla, though we should take the cost predictions with a grain of salt since Tesla doesn’t have a great track record on that.
The Model 3 was supposed to start at $35,000, which it only briefly did and that was before the inflation crisis, and the Model S was supposed to start $50,000, which it also briefly did but with a software-locked version that was quickly discontinued.
Therefore, I am not putting that much weight into the cost predictions, but if the goal is cheaper mass production of smaller electric cars, Tesla will certainly end up with a platform that enables smaller and cheaper electric cars, which will increase the EV market.

2022/10/19,"Elon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) could soon be worth more than Apple (AAPL), and the company is putting its money behind this position with a $5 to $10 billion share buyback.
Today, Tesla released its Q3 2022 financial results. The automaker delivered a small miss on revenue-based on expectations, but it beat earnings expectations.
Tesla has been having a hard time on the stock market over the last few months, and the Q3 results didn’t help.
After the release of the results, Tesla held a conference call with analysts during which CEO Elon Musk took the microphone in a clear attempt to calm investors. The CEO started out by announcing that Tesla’s board has discussed a share buyback program, and it is in agreement that it would make sense to proceed with a $5 to $10 billion share buyback.
A share buyback program consists of a company buying its own shares at the market price. It’s generally a sign that the company believes its stock is undervalued and is a way to boost the stock price.
Musk did say that the plan hasn’t been finalized, but it looks like Tesla is going to be moving forward with a share buyback program soon.
After announcing the buyback program, the CEO commented on Tesla’s valuation:
A while ago, I said on an earnings call that I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was worth about $700 billion at the time.
Tesla is now worth about $700 billion based on its market capitalization. 
Now Musk has a new goal for Tesla’s valuation:
Now I’m of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple’s current market cap. I see a path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined.
Apple is now worth $2.3 trillion, and Saudi Aramco is worth about $2 trillion.
The CEO also emphasized that even in a bad recession, Tesla could still generate “meaningful cash” next year. Hence his belief that it would make sense to initiate a share buyback program.
Musk doesn’t include Tesla Optimus, the company’s planned humanoid robot, in his equation, and says that it would take a lot of work, great execution, and some luck to achieve Apple and Aramco’s valuation.

2022/10/19,"Tesla (TSLA) announced that its energy storage division delivered a record number of batteries in Q3 2022. 
Today, Tesla released its Q3 2022 financial results. The automaker missed on revenue expectations, but there was a silver lining: Tesla Energy.
Tesla Energy is the company’s energy division that installs solar panels, solar roofs, and stationary energy storage products, like Powerwall and Megapacks.
Energy storage deployment was at a record high of 2.1 GWh last quarter, truly an impressive deployment of batteries.
Tesla gave some details about the new record in its shareholders’ letter:
Energy storage deployments increased by 62% YoY in Q3 to 2.1 GWh, by far the highest level we have ever achieved. This level of growth was accomplished despite semiconductor challenges continuing to have a greater impact on our Energy business than out Automotive business. Demand for our storage products remains in excess of our ability to supply. We are in the process of ramping production at our dedicated 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California to address the growing demand.
A ramp-up in Tesla Powerwalls and Megapacks is responsible for the new record.
We recently learned that Tesla has increased Powerwall production to 6,500 units per week. That’s 87 MWh per week. Megapacks contribute a lot more with fewer units since a single Megapack can deliver over 3 MWh of energy capacity.
Electrek heard from sources familiar with the matter that Tesla has been making great progress at the Megafactory. Tesla had previously been producing Megapacks exclusively at Gigafactory Nevada, but production is now ramping up fast at Megafactory in California.
However, the production capacity is fairly recent and, therefore, the deployment won’t be felt until Q4 and into 2023, when Tesla can install the battery packs.
Tesla’s solar power deployment was also good in Q3 at 94 MW. It’s up 13% year over year.
The solar deployment was down from the previous quarter, which Tesla blamed on commercial solar deployment.

2022/10/19,"Tesla (TSLA) has released its financial results and shareholders letter for the third quarter of 2022 after market close today.
We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders’ letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information.
Yesterday, we posted our Tesla Q3 2022 earnings preview with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $22 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.00 per share.
These would be new records for Tesla thanks to new record deliveries of over 343,000 electric vehicles during the quarter. However, the automaker had over 20,000 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter which negatively affected profits.
Just after the market close today, Tesla released its financial results and confirmed that it managed to meet expectations on earnings, but it was down on revenue.
The automaker reported revenues of $21.5 billion (about $500 million less than Wall Street expected) and earnings per share of $1.05 (Non-GAAP versus $1.00 expected by Wall Street).
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is down 5% in after-hour trading seemingly because of the miss on revenue expectations, but Tesla technically delivered record revenue, operating profits and free cash flow.
The automaker had an operating free cash flow of $3.3 billion last quarter and increased its cash balance to a record $21 billion.
One of the most important metrics is Tesla’s automotive gross margin, which is the percentage of profit on sales of new vehicles. It stayed at 27.9% this quarter, which is high for the auto industry.
We will be posting our follow-up posts here about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts):

2022/10/19,"Tesla is coming out with a new owner’s referral program after completely revamping the program, which was initially costly.
It’s a rare demand trigger that the automaker is pulling.
The automaker doesn’t like to spend on marketing or advertising, and instead, relies on its user base to promote its vehicles and reward them in the process.
At the core of the referral program, new buyers can use referral links from current owners when buying a new Tesla, and each party gets prizes.
The prizes have changed a lot over the years.
At the peak of the program, Tesla was giving away free new Roadsters to owners who accumulated enough referrals.
An impressive number of people ended up reaching that level, and we estimated that Tesla would be giving away about 80 new Roadsters on top of giving out significant discounts to many more.
CEO Elon Musk later announced that Tesla is killing its referral program due to cost concerns associated with all those Roadsters, which the automaker has yet to deliver.
Tesla didn’t end up killing the program, but it did reduce the prizes to 1,000 free Supercharging miles on both sides of the transaction, though that went away, too. Over the last two years, the only referral incentives left were for solar products.
However, we reported last year that Tesla was starting to work on a new version of its referral program for vehicles.
According to a source familiar with the matter, Tesla planned to eliminate or reduce the use of referral links, which owners often spam on social media, and instead turned to an app-based referral program promoting in-person referrals.
The plans were not entirely clear at the time, but Tesla planned to update its mobile app to have more features for non-Tesla owners as it moves to allow non-Tesla EV owners to use the Supercharger network and integrate referral features through the app.
Now a year later, Teslascope, which can dig into Tesla’s mobile app software update, found that there was some code in the background of Tesla’s latest app update that shows a new referral program:
Tesla's referral program might be making a comeback very, very soon!The latest mobile app update has some new text strings referring to redeeming referrals for Supercharging miles and even official merchandise and vehicle accessories.
It appears that Tesla is working on bringing back free Supercharging miles and adding new prizes for vehicle referrals.
This is a rare demand trigger that Tesla would be pulling amid some rumors that the automaker is having demand issues, despite achieving record deliveries.
We might hear more about the new referral program during the conference call following the release of Telsa’s earnings today.

2022/10/18,"Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q3 2022 financial results on Wednesday, October 19, after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management are scheduled after the results.
Here we’ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.
As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q3 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drives the vast majority of the company’s revenue.
Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 343,000 electric vehicles during the third quarter of the year.
This is a delivery record for Tesla, but the automaker actually came in under expectations because it had over 20,000 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter.
Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results.
For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $22.005 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $22.370 billion.
This would be a record quarter for revenue, thanks to the record deliveries.
Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green:
Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now.
For Q3 2022, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $1.00 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $1.11 per share.
It’s going to be harder to determine earnings this quarter due to the over 20,000 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter, which is going to negatively affect Tesla’s results. Analysts are still expecting positive earnings, but Tesla is going to be lower than it would have with fewer vehicles in inventory.
Here are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green:
In the shareholder’s letter and the following conference call, Tesla generally shares additional details about not only financial results but also other important metrics on how the company is doing.
CEO Elon Musk is not always on the call, but this time, he confirmed that he will be on it.
Every company is reporting earnings these days with economic uncertainty in the background.
Musk is expected to address that, in addition to how he plans for Tesla to get through a potentially rougher time at the macroeconomic level.
Furthermore, Tesla investors are likely going to want Musk to explain his plan around Twitter since he has now finally agreed to buy it. Managing the social media platform could potentially take a lot of his time away from Tesla.
On the operational front, Tesla shareholders are also going to be looking for an update on the production ramps at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
An update on Tesla Semi could also come with the earnings results since Musk has announced that production started and deliveries are expected to start in December.
Electrek previously reported that Tesla had set up a production capacity of five trucks per week at its facility in Nevada, but that might have changed since last year.

2022/10/18,"Foxconn, the Taiwan-based manufacturing giant, says that it wants to build electric vehicles for Tesla like it builds iPhones for Apple.
At its annual Tech Day today, Foxconn unveiled a new electric pickup truck and a new electric crossover.
The manufacturing company has now unveiled a full lineup of electric vehicles that it can produce at several factories that it acquired in Asia and in the US over the last few years.
Despite having unveiled several electric vehicles at this point, Foxconn apparently still doesn’t plan to be a consumer-facing brand, and plans to work with other automakers to sell its vehicles.
Like it does with some of Apple’s products, Foxconn wants to take over the entire manufacturing process of electric vehicles – or license the electric vehicles – it has already unveiled.
During the event today, Chairman Liu Young-way said that Foxconn is aiming to manufacture 5% of the EV market by 2025, and that the company even hopes to manufacture vehicles for Tesla:
Based on our past records for the PC and cellphone markets … we’re at about 40-45% of the overall market share. So, ambitions-wise, hopefully we are able to achieve the same kind of achievement like in the ICT (information and communications technology) industry, but we will start small, which is about 5% in 2025. I hope one day we can do Tesla cars for Tesla.
The company believes that its supply chain resilience would be really attractive to automakers.
Liu Young-way commented:
Supply chain resilience has always been Foxconn’s DNA. Our global footprint in 24 countries gives us a huge advantage to meet EV industry demands.
Foxconn has done relatively well for Apple amid a global supply chain crisis that has been especially affecting the electronics industry.
What Foxconn is offering is not exactly new in the electric vehicle industry, or the auto industry, period.
For example, Magna has been known for building and assembling vehicles for other automakers and it has done EVs for Jaguar, and it is about to build vehicles for Fisker and Lordstown Motors.
But would Tesla want Foxconn to build its vehicles?
My guess would be no. CEO Elon Musk has made it clear that he aims for Tesla’s main competitive advantage in the future to be manufacturing. Therefore, if that’s the goal, it would make no sense for the company to contract manufacturing to another company.
I would be shocked if we ever see Tesla work with Foxconn, but I do like their ambitions to manufacture 5% of the EV market as soon as 2025.

2022/10/17,"Tesla has launched a home charging station, or Wall Connector as it calls it, that works with other electric cars and not just Tesla vehicles.
Unlike all other electric automakers, Tesla uses its own proprietary connector for vehicles produced for the North American market. This means the company’s charging network and products, like home chargers, only work with its own electric vehicles.
Tesla’s design has been praised for being much easier to handle and more efficient than the CCS/J1772 standard that has been adopted by the rest of the industry.
Earlier this year, there even was an effort to make Tesla’s connector the new standard, but it looks to have been in vain.
Tesla has been leaning toward opening up its own charging network and products to electric vehicles from other automakers.
The company has been indicating that it will add CCS connectors to Supercharger stations in North America like it already did in Europe.
Last year, Tesla even briefly launched a new version of its home charging station, the Wall Connector, with a J1772 connector instead of its own. It meant that the charger was geared toward non-Tesla EV buyers.
However, the product didn’t stay available for long.
Now, Tesla has launched a brand new version of its J1772 Wall Connector for $550 on its website:
Our J1772 Wall Connector is a convenient charging solution for Tesla and non-Tesla electric vehicles alike, and is ideal for houses, apartments, hospitality properties and workplaces.
Here are a few pictures of the new Tesla Wall Connector:
Based on Tesla’s description, it looks like the automaker might be going after the commercial charging market:
If you are a developer, manager or owner of commercial real estate and interested in purchasing more than 12 J1772 Wall Connectors, visit Commercial Charging.
But at a price of $550, it is extremely competitive with any home charging station on the market, especially when you consider the power-sharing and connectivity features:
With up to 44 miles of range added per hour, a 24-foot cable, multiple power settings and a versatile indoor/outdoor design, J1772 Wall Connector provides unparalleled convenience. It can also power-share to maximize existing electrical capacity, automatically distributing power and allowing you to charge multiple vehicles simultaneously.
Tesla’s own vehicles can also use the station, but they will need to use an adapter that comes with the vehicle.
Otherwise, Tesla owners will have to use Tesla’s original Wall Connector, which is equipped with the Tesla proprietary plug and is cheaper at $400.

2022/10/17,"Tesla is now ramping up its hiring effort following a round of layoffs earlier this year. Job listings have ramped up 50% since the layoffs.
In June, Elon Musk asked Tesla executives to “pause all hiring” and cut 10% of staff.
The CEO has given different reasons to different people for the layoffs, but Tesla has been growing fast over the years, and that often results in hiring inefficiencies that eventually lead to rounds of layoffs like this one.
The “hiring pause” was more worrisome as Tesla has several programs growing fast, and it needs to hire thousands of people at new factories in the US and Germany.
A new report now shows that the hiring pause didn’t last long because since a drop in the job listings in June, the listings have increased 50% (via Reuters):
Tesla this week listed over 6,900 jobs on its career website, almost a 50% surge since mid-June, when Reuters began tracking the data. That compares to a 2022 peak of over 7,400 job ads in May, according to data similarly tracked by Thinknum Alternative Data and hedge fund Snow Bull Capital.
The data also doesn’t include listings from Tesla China:
The leading categories in the surge in job listings are Engineering & Information Technology, Vehicle Service, and Manufacturing.
Tesla is always looking to hire more engineers to staff its programs. Manufacturing is always a top category when the automaker is staffing new factories like Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
As for vehicle service, Musk announced a significant effort to improve service, especially in North America, and get wait times down.
According to the report, Tesla is ramping up hiring in its energy storage and solar division. It is especially looking for installers to accelerate deployment in the US.
We previously reported that Tesla achieved its best solar deployment in years last quarter, and it is looking to keep the momentum going.
Tesla’s hiring rebound comes amid worries about the economy with fear of a recession over the next year. Many companies have announced or are considering rounds of layoffs to better prepare themselves for an economic downturn.

2022/10/17,"Tesla has released a new mobile app update that includes a solution if your car has frozen door handles.
During Model 3’s first winter, we reported on the electric car having some issues in cold weather, and Tesla said it was investigating the situation.
Several owners in cold weather regions were experiencing difficulties entering their vehicles because the door handles wouldn’t open, the windows would jam, and even the charge port would freeze shut.
A week later, Tesla released a software update to help with some of those issues.
Later, it also released a new software update to use the climate control to help thaw the charge port when it gets frozen.
The new door handle design that Tesla used on Model 3 and Model Y had a tendency to freeze shut at times, like in this video:
Now Tesla has released a new version of its mobile app (Version 4.14.0) in conjunction with a new vehicle software update (2022.36+) that helps with this issue in case of emergency.
Here are the release notes:
Lock Screen widget to display vehicle battery range.Quick control to unlatch Model 3 or Model Y driver door, helpful if door handle is frozen (*)*Vehicle software version 2022.36+ required
The app now enables Tesla drivers to directly unlatch the driver’s door remotely, and as Tesla notes in the release notes, it is “helpful if the door handle is frozen.”
Now Tesla drivers were previously able to lock and unlock doors through the app, but the door would still only unlatch once activated physically.
This new update apparently directly unlatches the doors through the app, which removes the need for the handle altogether.
However, as you can see in the video above, the door handle is not the only failure point of the door when it is extremely cold. Since Tesla uses a frameless window design in its doors, the window also needs to come down a little to get past the trim before opening the door. It is supposed to happen automatically when using the door handles, but it can also be frozen. 
While the app may unlatch the door, you’d need to force it past the trim if the window is frozen.

2022/10/14,"What appears to be either new Tesla Cybertruck bodies or prototypes were spotted at Gigafactory Texas ahead of the start of production.
The Cybertruck is one of the most highly anticipated electric vehicles to launch ever. Tesla is estimated to have a backlog of over 1 million reservations for the electric pickup truck, which means that there are a lot of eyes on the vehicle program and people are trying to track progress toward production.
The current official timeline for production is not exactly clear. CEO Elon Musk mentioned both a “start of production in mid-2023” and “volume production in mid-2023,” with the latter indicating a start of production sooner in 2023.
We don’t have a lot of ways to track progress with Cybertruck production, but several people are often flying drones over Gigafactory Texas, where the Cybertruck is going to be built. Now one of them, Joe Tegtmeyer, has spotted what appears to be two new Cybertruck bodies:
Breaking! Two new Cybertruck prototypes delivered to Giga Texas today, 14 October 2022! Located on N end near paint shop, arrived just as I was ending filming. Check these out! Much more in my video later today! @JoeTegtmeyer pic.twitter.com/ixl7E7ovc6
Tegtmeyer refers to them as “prototypes,” but that’s hard to confirm. There are for sure at least Cybertruck bodies since the proportions are perfect.
As noted by the drone pilot, it appears that the Cybertrucks were delivered to the plant rather than made there. They are likely validation units.
Tesla was only known to have a few Cybertruck prototypes until recently. These two units could double the number of electric pickup trucks in Tesla’s fleet.
The automaker is expected to take delivery of the new world’s largest casting machine soon. Over the last few years, Tesla has been heavily investing in casting and alloy technology to enable larger casted parts, which then can greatly simplify manufacturing.
The company acquired several units of the biggest casting machine in the world. These giant multimillion-dollar machines are developed by Idra. Tesla’s first Giga Press, which was installed at the Fremont factory, was put into operation in 2020. The machine was the first of its kind at the time and has a clamping force of 55,000 to 61,000 kilonewtons (5,600 to 6,200 tf).
Tesla has already been producing the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle. Now, Idra has been working on a new 9,000-pound Giga press that will produce the Cybertruck’s body.
The company recently completed the machine, and the fact that Tesla is taking delivery is expected to be a significant step toward production.

2022/10/14,"Tesla is reportedly running into problems establishing battery cell production at Gigafactory Berlin, and it is moving battery manufacturing equipment to Texas.
For over two years now, Tesla has been working to build its own battery cells with a new 4680 format. The plan is critical to the company’s long-term growth as it powers its next generation of electric vehicles using a new structural battery pack architecture.
Tesla is currently building the cells at its pilot plant in Fremont, California, but the automaker’s goal was to achieve volume production of the 4680 battery cell by the end of the year at Gigafactory Texas. The automaker also planned to establish battery cell production at Gigafactory Berlin on a similar timeline.
Now a report from Germany’s Handelsblatt suggests that Tesla is putting the plan on hold in Berlin:
The fact that Tesla will not start full battery cell production in its German plant in Grünheide for the time being apparently has other reasons than lower energy costs and new tax incentives in the USA worth billions. Several sources close to the electric car manufacturer report a significant delay in a crucial but highly complex production technique.
The publication had previously reported that Tesla planned to move some battery cell manufacturing equipment from Gigafactory Berlin to Gigafactory Texas. The move was suspected of having something to do with the new tax credit for electric vehicles in the US that forces automakers to use battery cells produced locally.
Now they report that only the machines for electrode production are going to remain on site and everything else is going to be moved to the US.
The reason behind the move is not completely clear, but Handelsblatt says that Tesla wants to focus on successfully deploying its dry coating of the electrodes in the US first:
This is not a rejection of Grünheide. Tesla boss Elon Musk wants to continue to build a battery cell plant in Brandenburg in the long term. But before that, the electric car manufacturer has to get the so-called dry coating of the electrodes under control. A total of five experts, two of whom are close to Tesla, report that test systems with the technology are currently running quite successfully, but that implementation in large series is lacking.
Tesla has previously disclosed that the dry coating process is part of the bottleneck preventing the automaker from achieving volume production of the battery cells.
The last official comment from the company is that it was still confident that volume production would be achieved at Gigafactory Texas by the end of the year.
It would indeed make sense to nail the production process in one place before deploying it in another. Also, if the rumors about Tesla getting blade battery cells from BYD for Gigafactory Berlin are true, Tesla might already have the cells it needs to ramp up production at Gigafactory Berlin.
It would explain why Tesla is OK with falling behind with cell production in Germany.

2022/10/13,"Many industry watchers are claiming Tesla is facing “demand destruction,” but if that’s the case, why isn’t Tesla pulling on some demand levers?
In a new note to clients this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the top analysts covering Tesla, noted that he believes Tesla is experiencing “demand destruction” at the margin:
Is Tesla experiencing demand destruction? Very likely, at the margin, although this would be reflected in shorter lead times and price declines in coming months as even EV customers may be feeling the effect of inflation fatigue/buyers strike.
He lowered the firm’s expectations for the company.
Another analyst who has been tracking Tesla’s backlog of orders believes that it just hit an almost two-year low:
Hi everybody. Tesla's order backlog was 317,000 units on Sep 21, equal to 78 days of global production. The drop happened in China.This calculation is based on the production rate for each model and the wait times for new orders shown on Tesla's website.Part 1/2 pic.twitter.com/OJxdNP56qT
This would indicate that Tesla’s demand has significantly slowed down, but as we previously reported, wait time tracking can be deceiving as Tesla shifts production for different regions.
If demand were a problem for Tesla, we would be starting to see some demand triggers being pulled, which is not the case.
The biggest one to pull is generally pricing. Tesla’s prices have been going straight up over the last two years, and its gross margin on vehicles is at an all-time high.
The automaker could afford to reduce prices a little, which would be a significant demand driver, but it has yet to happen.
But there’s another complication now: the new EV tax credit.
Tesla buyers can technically regain access to the $7,500 tax credit if they take delivery next year. There are many factors that restrict access to the credit, but it could still have a significant impact on demand for the lower-priced Model 3.
As we previously reported, Tesla is not accommodating buyers who are eligible like other automakers are, and therefore, it might be experiencing some cancellations as contract time runs out and some buyers decide to wait until next year.
In short, I believe that it’s not worth worrying about Tesla’s demand until you start seeing the automaker pull on some demand levers.
But even then, those demand levers are likely going to be quite successful and fix the issue.
If Tesla really starts to see a slowdown in demand, especially in the US, I think we could see the automaker finally launching a standard-range Model Y in the market and there would likely be unlimited demand for that, especially with the tax credit.

2022/10/13,"An investigation into Tesla using special code marked for crash-testing vehicles hasn’t found any evidence that the automaker cheated on its crash tests.
Tesla has an incredible record when it comes to crash safety. Its electric vehicles have consistently achieved top safety ratings with auto safety agencies around the world.
The latest safety accolade came from Euro NCAP and Australia’s ANCAP, which released their own testing results for the Tesla Model Y, and the electric vehicle achieved the highest Euro NCAP overall score under its new protocol.
The incredible achievement was quickly put in doubt last month after a report revealed that Tesla has been adding code that involves crash-testing agencies, including ANCAP and EuroNCAP, to the vehicles involved in the safety testing.
According to Tesla hacker Green, who found the code in Tesla’s software, he was able to confirm that Tesla has been giving “one-off builds” to crash-testing agencies and that the tweaks that the software code brings are “non-visible settings on the autopilot side.”
The report triggered an investigation by Euro NCAP, which has now given an update to CNN.
Euro NCAP program director Aled Williams says that there’s no evidence Tesla used the code to cheat the tests:
The integrity of its star-rating scheme is of utmost importance to Euro NCAP and we will continue to do all we can to ensure the rating reflects the safety which consumers can expect from their vehicles. So far, Euro NCAP’s investigations have not revealed any evidence of an attempt to “cheat” the tests by Tesla.
The organization has reportedly “examined Tesla’s software updates to test vehicles and not found any fault.”
The biggest fear was reportedly geofencing for some features like Tesla does for its FSD Beta program for example, but the agency says it is not the case:
It is possible that GPS location is used to identify that the car is at a specific test track. It’s one of the possibilities we put to Tesla and they absolutely deny that this is done.
Now as to why Tesla has code referencing the safety agencies in the first place in its software, Euro NCAP has reportedly been told that the software code referencing Euro NCAP and ANCAP “are used only to identify the region for which the car is configured.”
Williams added:
Different regions (such as Europe, Australasia, etc.) differ in terms of legislation as well as road conditions/markings, etc. The recent addition of ANCAP to the code of Model Y coincides with the start of sales of that vehicle in Australasia.
This explanation is not satisfactory to everyone. Green, the hacker who originally raised the red flag, noted Japan uses different road markings as well, and it is not in the software with Euro NCAP and ANCAP,  which would indicate that there’s another way for Tesla to identify the regions in the software.
Euro NCAP is continuing its investigation, and it will try to replicate its original safety tests.

2022/10/12,"Tesla is reportedly going to implement a new vehicle hazard warning system through a partnership with Emergency Safety Solutions, Inc. (ESS), creator of the Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (H.E.L.P.®).
Emergency Safety Solutions describes the H.E.L.P. system for disabled vehicles on the highway:
ESS’ Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (H.E.L.P.®) is designed to provide highly conspicuous lighting and digital communication using existing vehicle lighting systems, in-vehicle telematics, OEM cloud platforms and navigation application systems.
It utilizes a multiprong approach that improves hazard lights with a higher refresh rate, which is apparently proven to improve safety.
But the most important part of the product is a system that notifies nearby vehicles that there’s a disabled vehicle ahead through cellular devices.
Here’s a video demonstration of the H.E.L.P. hazard warning system:
Today, the company announced that it is working with Tesla to implement the technology in its lineup of electric vehicles:
Emergency Safety Solutions, Inc. (ESS), creator of the Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (H.E.L.P.®) which revolutionizes vehicle hazard warning systems to help prevent crashes into disabled and vulnerable vehicles and their occupants, announced today it has signed a global agreement with Tesla, Inc. to deploy H.E.L.P. on Tesla models initially in North America via over-the-air software update.
Tom Metzger, CEO of ESS, commented on the announcement:
This is great news for significantly increasing roadside safety. Tesla is a leader in bringing first-time innovation to passenger vehicles and is leading the way by implementing H.E.L.P. technology on potentially millions of Tesla vehicles worldwide. It’s a monumental step in the effort to overcome the troubling safety issue of crashes into disabled and vulnerable vehicles, which tragically injure or kill tens of thousands around the world each year.
The new hazard warning system is expected to be pushed through an over-the-air update to “a range of Tesla vehicles.”
According to ESS, there are more than 72,000 people yearly in the US that are affected by incidents with disabled vehicles with 15,000 either injured or killed.

2022/10/12,"In a recent interview with German media, NIO CEO William Li covered a plethora of topics pertaining to the relatively young Chinese automaker, including its expansion in Europe and its plans for the US, which may now be on hold. Speaking of the US market, Li had some bold (and funny) words to say about Tesla and Elon Musk. 
NIO ($NIO) is a publicly traded EV automaker founded in 2014 that currently sits as one of the leading electrified brands in China, despite only beginning to deliver cars four years ago. The automaker has a keen focus on the overall experience of its customers, a huge reason for its quick success and its ability to expand to consumers beyond its home country.
In May of 2021, the automaker announced plans to enter new markets outside of China, beginning in Norway. Germany was soon announced as NIO’s next target in Europe, and the first outside of China that will receive deliveries of its ET7 sedan.
During the launch of its ET5 sedan last December, NIO shared plans for additional expansion in Europe, including the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark. Overall, the automaker said it intends to have a presence in 25 different countries and regions by 2025.
We have often speculated about NIO’s intentions to enter the US market based on its previous movements, but the automaker has always denied any plans. Now, in a recent interview, NIO’s CEO said the US has been on the to-do list, but may be delayed because of the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act. 
Still, NIO is already competing with Tesla in China and now Europe, and will eventually bring the battle to the American automaker’s home turf… and it could garner a dance-off. 
In a recent interview with heise Autos out of Germany, NIO CEO William Li spoke to the automaker’s recent entry into Germany, (potential) plans for the US, and why it will become a profitable company much more quickly than Tesla. Better yet, Li wants NIO to become a top-five-selling automaker by 2030. To begin, Li spoke about what sets NIO apart from other car companies:
First of all, we are younger than the others (laughs). But joking aside, there are actually some differentiators. It starts with the fact that our product has been developed for the future. With the ET7, sensors such as the LIDAR radar are clearly visible and the interior follows the concept of mobile living space. We also offer an all-round carefree package with the battery-changing stations. We are more than a car manufacturer. We already have a community in China and want to find one in Europe as well.
Li gave a lot of credit to established German automakers who currently sell twentyfold what NIO does around the globe. He said that companies like Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group know how car building works, and NIO can still learn a lot from them. Another automaker Li said NIO can still learn from is US automaker Tesla, although the CEO was also quite critical:
Tesla is a respectable car manufacturer and we can learn a lot from them. For example direct sales or how they have trimmed their production for efficiency. But NIO and Tesla are two different companies. Tesla focuses on technology and efficiency. Technology is also important to us, but we focus on the user. Tesla has played an important role in transforming the automotive industry toward electric mobility. Still, Tesla is under pressure. If they don’t improve their products fast enough or don’t provide good services, they will quickly be pushed out of the market.
Li cites staying power as a vital factor in finding success in the automotive industry, and believes NIO is in a marathon race while Tesla has been in more of a sprint. The next decade will truly show who is successful and who isn’t. When asked how he is different from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Li had another cheeky response, setting the stage for a potential dance off:
I write my own Facebook posts to communicate directly with our users and not just make a Twitter statement. Besides, I’m the better dancer…
As the largest automaker by market cap, Tesla has had a target on its back for years, but if NIO does inevitably decide to bring its premium EVs to the US, it could make for one hell of a battle. When asked if and when NIO might start selling its vehicles on US soil, Li was quite candid about the company’s previous plans, and explained that a lot is up in the air right now. A similar sentiment shared by many foreign automakers hoping to qualify for federal tax credits. Per Li:
We only become active in a market when we have the right product and the right services for this region, and we planned to also become active in the USA by the end of 2025. But the US government recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, making it harder for foreign automakers to produce and enter the market. We will therefore monitor developments closely.
Looking ahead, NIO will focus on ever-popular SUVs as well as smaller cars via its upcoming sub-brand, expected to begin delivering EVs by 2024. With this influx of quality vehicles offering better user experiences across multiple brands in global markets, NIO’s chief believes it will move out of the red and into profits sooner rather than later:
As a startup, it takes a while to be profitable. We have invested a great deal in the development of our cars and in the infrastructure, and thus in the future. We have a finely tuned plan to generate profits step by step. It took Tesla 16 years to become profitable. With NIO, this will be the case much faster.
We shall see.

2022/10/12,"Tesla has updated its in-car energy app to give a comparison between real energy use and the projected range, and it even gives you range advice to get closer to the optimal range.
Range calculations are difficult regardless of the type of powertrain – electric or internal combustion engine.
There are just so many factors that can affect the efficiency of a vehicle on a road that it is hard to determine how far it can go on a full battery pack or tank of gas.
But it is important. I’d even argue that accurate range prediction is better at curbing range anxiety than longer range.
Tesla has been a leader in efficiency and long-range electric vehicles for a long time, but despite that, it still has issues predicting the energy consumption of a trip.
When entering a destination in the navigation system, Tesla gives the driver the expected range remaining at the destination, but Tesla drivers know that most of the time it’s actually going to be much lower than the estimate.
In 2018, Tesla added more environmental factors (elevation changes, weather, etc.) in the calculation. It helped, but it is still far from accurate. You put a destination in the system and Tesla’s trip advisor tells you how much energy you will have left by the time you get there, but it’s not rare to see the amount of energy go down fast as you drive.
Earlier this year, Tesla put a renewed focus on range prediction using “crosswind, headwind, humidity, and ambient temperature” in a software update.
Again in July, Tesla released a new update that went even further by adding several other factors in its range calculations, including tire pressure and even phone charging.
These changes are now leading to a more in-depth in-car energy app for Tesla vehicles:
Your Tesla now shows energy consumed vs projected & gives range tips pic.twitter.com/ABSPLTdGVg
As you can see, the new app gives a more detailed description on how and when you are deviating from the projected range:
It even gives you “range tips” to get closer to your optimal range projection. The examples above are the most obvious ones, which are generally “slow down” and “keep climate control down.”
Tesla’s new energy app also now breaks down energy consumed in “miles” from more sources, including sentry mode and screen time:
This added information on where your car’s energy is going other than propulsion can help you make better decisions to optimize for range instead of comfort when needed.

2022/10/11,"Tesla’s market shares slip in the US, but the automaker still owns two-thirds of the rapidly growing market.
For years now, Tesla has dominated the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market, but for now, the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla’s production and deliveries.
For the entire year of 2020, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States. In 2021, that number went down to 69.95%, but that’s still impressive with EV delivery volumes significantly increasing throughout the year along with Tesla’s prices.
Now we have been tracking Tesla’s market share erosion in 2022. New market entrants are having an impact, there’s no doubt, but Tesla is still responsible for most EV sales in the US.
According to new registration data from Experian, Tesla now has about two-thirds of the EV market in 2022 as of August.
Ford and Hyundai are making strides with second and third place, but there are still extremely far behind Tesla, which still has four of the top five best-selling electric vehicles in the country:
Tesla’s supremacy is not expected to be challenged much in the short term due to the massive lead, but several electric vehicles are expected to see significant ramp-ups in the short term.
GM recently announced a boost in Bolt EV deliveries in Q4, and Ford’s F-150 Lightning production is still slowly ramping up.
It’s really interesting how different those volumes are at this point. Tesla is the only automaker with models in the six figures and by a wide margin.
And there’s no demand problem in sight.
I am convinced that GM could sell Chevy Bolt EV and EUV in the six figures, if it could produce them. It should get closer to it next year with a production of 77,000 units next year.
The Ioniq 5 and EV6 could also likely be six figure-vehicles if the capacity was available.
As I have been saying for years, the winners of the rEVolution are the automakers who were early to invest in production capacity, and Tesla is still clearly the one reaping the rewards in the US.

2022/10/11,"While Tesla has been rolling out its global network of 30,000 fast chargers for years, Renault has announced its own plan to build a network of 200 EV ultra-fast-charging stations across Europe, kicking off first in its native France.
Mobilize, Renault’s newly named e-mobility unit, is partnering with Renault and Mobilize dealerships to install the charging stations at dealer locations close to major roads. Dubbed Mobilize Fast Charge, the company plans to place a station every 150 kilometers (or 93.2 miles) on major highways. The first stations will open up in Southern France in a few months, followed by some 200 more by mid-2024 in Belgium, Spain, Italy, and France.  
For comparison’s sake, Tesla has so far installed 10,000 individual Superchargers in 30 European countries.
Mobilize says that in order to relieve stress on the grid, each charging station will use a stationary storage system the size of a small container. Stations can charge up to six cars of any make at the same time in about 30 minutes while delivering 600 kW of power, even when multiple EVs are charging simultaneously, which Mobilize says tops what’s available so far in Europe. 
Leaning heavily on the charging “experience” modeled by Tesla and others, each Mobilize Fast Charge station will be accessible 24/7 and offer a lounge, snacks, Wi-Fi, and playing corners for children.
Renault is moving forward with its plan to split its EV and ICE businesses into two separate companies. Renault plans to go purely electric by 2030, with a plan to keep its high-profile EV business in France while relocating the combustion division outside of the country.   
Europe has been a huge adopter of EVs, selling some 5.6 million plug-in EV and light commercial vehicles last year, according to the ACEA (and the fuel price crisis is likely pushing demand even further). Major plans are underway to expand the European EV charging network, with 2.8 million charging points expected by 2030.

2022/10/11,"It looks like Tesla’s flagship Model S and Model X are finally coming back to China as the electric vehicles now appear on an updated list of cars receiving tax exemptions.
Tesla is different from most other automakers in many ways, and the way it handles model updates is no exception.
Instead of taking the usual model-year route, Tesla introduces changes to its production vehicles whenever they are ready.
Every now and again, the automaker will package more changes together at once and create what has been referred to as a “design refresh,” but those can come at any time. Tesla doesn’t wait for a model-year update.
These design refreshes are rarely significant enough to shut down production for a long period of time. However, in early 2021, Tesla did shut down Model S and Model X production for its biggest design refresh to date, and the impact is still felt today almost two years later.
The update took way longer than anticipated, and Tesla was without Model S production for months and didn’t deliver any new Model Xs for almost a year.
Now almost two years since starting the refresh, production is finally getting back to pre-design refresh levels.
No markets outside of North America have received any new Model S or Model X vehicles since the refresh, but that’s finally about to change.
We recently reported that finally Tesla started taking new Model S and Model X orders in Europe with deliveries expected by the end of the year.
Now we learn that China is also finally getting some new Model S and Model X vehicles. 
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) released its update “Catalogue of New Energy Vehicle Models Exempted from Vehicle Purchase Tax,” and it included new Model S and Model X variants.
Interestingly, it’s the first indicator that Tesla is bringing back Model S and Model X in China since the automaker has yet to update its Chinese online configurator like it did in Europe.
Furthermore, a Tesla Model S Plaid has been spotted in China for the first time:
BREAKING: The Model S Plaid was photographed for the first time in China, and I wonder if it's an official pre-test before delivery.@WholeMarsBlog @SawyerMerritt pic.twitter.com/LORd6yViho
Since Tesla is now self-sufficient in China for Model 3 and Model Y with production at Gigafactory Shanghai, the return of Model S and Model X should almost mark the return of Tesla exporting US cars to China.
There’s still no word on the timing for deliveries.

2022/10/10,"Tesla has managed to secure the best-selling car spot in Germany, a tough auto market known for preferring local brands.
Germany is an important auto market in Europe and one that is difficult to penetrate for foreign automakers because of the strong local industry with companies like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.
Tesla has made some good early efforts in the country, but it is now expected to do much better with a local factory producing German-made Tesla vehicles. Last year, Tesla delivered just short of 40,000 vehicles in Germany.
Surprisingly, a report came out last month that stated Tesla is aiming to increase sales in 2022 to 80,000 units. That would be extremely ambitious considering Tesla was just short of 25,000 deliveries as of August. 
Now it looks like Tesla has some momentum to make it happen. The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) reported today the vehicle sale numbers for September in Germany and Tesla had a record month.
The automaker delivered 9,848 Model Y vehicles, making the electric SUV the best-selling vehicle in the country, which is quite an achievement for a foreign automaker. Tesla has had best-selling cars in a few markets before, but getting one in Germany is certainly a noteworthy achievement.
It dethroned the VW Golf, which came in with just over 7,000 units in September.
The Tesla Model 3 also had a decent month with 3,878 vehicles delivered in September, based on registration data released by KBA.
This would put Tesla just short of 39,000 deliveries so far in 2022. The automaker would need a massive fourth quarter to make that reported goal of 80,000 deliveries.
It sounds almost impossible, but Gigafactory Berlin could help significantly.
Tesla recently reported that production has ramped up to 2,000 Model Y vehicles per week. That number is expected to keep going up in Q4 and a significant percentage of those vehicles are going to stay in Germany.
The market is still getting Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from Gigafactory Shanghai, and it might even get some new Model S vehicles for the first time in a long time.
I’d still be surprised if Tesla can deliver 40,000 vehicles in Germany in Q4, but I think it’s possible with this kind of momentum.

2022/10/10,"Tesla’s (TSLA) output in China increased to 83,000 electric vehicles in September – their new best month ever.
Last week, Tesla reported deliveries of 343,000 vehicles and production of around 365,000 vehicles.
Now China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) has released its results for September and confirmed that Tesla China contributed 83,135 China-made electric vehicles to those results last month.
With 28,000 vehicles in July and 77,000 vehicles in August, this means that China contributed about 188,000 vehicles to Tesla’s results in Q3.
Tesla China briefly commented on the result:
The record high sales of China-made Tesla cars showed electric vehicles have been leading the mobility trend.
The results beat Tesla’s previous record of 78,000 vehicles achieved in June before Tesla had to shut down Gigafactory Shanghai due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Following the shutdown, Tesla invested in increasing production at the factory, and now we are seeing the first results from this capacity upgrade.
Tesla has previously mentioned that the upgrade would enable a production capacity of 22,000 EVs per week.
At this point, it’s starting to look like a possibility that Tesla China is going to have an output of 100,000 electric vehicles per month – maybe even by the end of the year.
That would be insane.
We thought that most of Tesla’s new capacity in 2022 would be coming from Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, but Gigafactory Shanghai is the actual unsung hero.
Considering production started less than three years ago, an output of 1 million vehicles per year is extremely impressive. 
I imagine Tesla is studying the factory obsessively to try to replicate its success in Texas and Berlin.

2022/10/10,"Tesla has doubled down on its plan to build sales and service centers on tribal land as a loophole to get around New Mexico’s dumb direct-sale ban.
New Mexico, like a few other states, still has laws prohibiting direct sales of electric vehicles to the public without going through third-party dealerships.
These bans come from old laws that were meant to protect car dealers from their own automakers supplying the vehicles.
The idea is that automakers couldn’t open a company-owned store next to a third-party dealer after they have made the investment to sell their cars.
However, now car dealerships are using those old laws to prevent automakers that never had deals with third-party franchise dealers, like Tesla, from selling their vehicles to the public, even though it’s fair competition.
Tesla has been fighting those laws in many states with some success.
It hasn’t been the case in New Mexico where Tesla hasn’t been able to establish an official presence.
In 2019, Tesla tried to push a new law in the state with the help of some favorable legislators, but the local car dealer associations flexed their political muscle and it was dropped quickly.
Last year, we reported on Tesla finding an interesting loophole. Tesla managed to open its first store and service center in the state by opening inside an old casino north of Santa Fe, and it did it by partnering with the First Nation of Nambé Pueblo and opening the location on their tribal land.
The new Tesla Center now covers the Santa Fe area.
It sounds like the automaker has been happy with the arrangement since it has now doubled down on the loophole and decided to open its recent Tesla Center in New Mexico.
Tesla is again building on tribal land, this time thanks to a partnership with the Santa Ana Pueblo, which is located closer to Albuquerque –enabling Tesla to give the city some service coverage.
Ironically, legislators, who are the ones who could end the state’s direct-sale ban, are applauding Tesla for going to the tribal land to build the new location:
Now with Albuquerque and Santa Fe covered, Tesla has service stations covering two of the most populated centers in the state. 
While there’s another big population center, around Las Cruces in the south of the state, it is somewhat covered by the service center in El Paso, Texas.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/10/07,"Tesla appears to have accidentally leaked all the upcoming Supercharger locations around the world, but it fixed the issue.
The Supercharger network is already the largest EV fast-charging network in the world, and it is growing fast.
Tesla is slowly opening the network to non-Tesla electric vehicles, which is going to change the nature of the Supercharger network.
Lately, we have seen Tesla deploy new stations at a record pace.
It’s much harder than people think to deploy a DC fast-charging station. Once Tesla knows what it wants or needs to open a new Supercharger in a specific area, it needs to find a property to build it on and get the property owners to agree to a contract.
The automaker then needs to design the project and get it approved by the municipality and the local electric utility. Then, it needs to schedule a local contractor to do the installation and work with the local utility to get it activated.
Any problem at any step can cause significant delays or even cancel a project, which is why Tesla rarely shares the actual locations of upcoming Supercharger stations until they are ready.
That’s why it was strange yesterday when some internet sleuths spotted Tesla including specific addresses for all upcoming stations on its location page:
If anyone's wondering what's going on right now and why I'm so excited, it seems that Tesla has accidentally leaked addresses for virtually ALL future Superchargers in their Find Us lists (confirmed in the US and Canada). @SawyerMerritt @Tesla @elonmuskhttps://t.co/Q1swxs2RLG
It was clearly a bug as Tesla quickly rectified the situation by removing the specific addresses and instead only including the town or city where the new stations are planned.
But here’s what it looked like before Tesla fixed its own leak:
Now I’d note that it doesn’t mean those addresses are going to be the exact locations of these new Superchargers. Tesla might be using them as potential locations – the number one choice for those areas – or even placeholders, really.
However, the few locations that I checked myself made sense in terms of the local amenities, so they might be locations that Tesla is actually working on.
If you missed the leak and want to see if Tesla is planning stations that would be important to you, don’t worry, because some people downloaded the addresses and are creating a map with them. The map currently only features Canadian stations, but it is still being updated. It’s going to be a long process since there are a lot of upcoming stations.

2022/10/06,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla is starting Tesla Semi production and that Pepsi is going to get the first electric trucks starting December 1.
Tesla Semi, an all-electric class 8 truck, was unveiled back in 2017. At the time, it was supposed to come as soon as 2019. The vehicle program was delayed for years, and until recently, it wasn’t expected to go into production until 2023. However, Elon Musk surprisingly announced in August that the Tesla Semi would actually start shipping later this year.
Today, the CEO confirmed that Tesla has started production of the electric truck:
Excited to announce start of production of Tesla Semi Truck with deliveries to @Pepsi on Dec 1st! pic.twitter.com/gq0l73iGRW
Musk reiterated that the vehicle has a range of 500 miles (805 km) on a single charge.
Tesla Semi electric trucks are being produced in Nevada near Tesla’s Gigafactory. Last year, Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near the Gigafactory. At the time, we were told that the production equipment installed would be for about five electric trucks per week. Tesla plans to move to higher volume production at Gigafactory Texas.
In today’s tweet, Musk announced that Pepsico would get the first Tesla Semi deliveries on December 1. After the launch of Tesla Semi in 2017, PepsiCo placed one of the biggest orders for Tesla Semi: 100 electric trucks to add to its fleet. The company planned to use 15 of those trucks for a project to turn its Frito-Lay Modesto, California, site into a zero-emission facility. Last year, PepsiCo said that it expected to take deliveries of those 15 Tesla Semi trucks by the end of the year before it was delayed again.
While the company didn’t get its Tesla Semi trucks last year, Tesla did install a Megacharger station for the trucks at its Modesto facility, which led many to believe that it would be the first to take delivery of the electric truck.
This is exciting. Tesla Semi has real potential to change the game in the trucking industry with its useful 500-mile range and efficiency of less than 2 kWh per mile. At $0.20 per kWh, that’s a $0.40 cost of operation per mile. That’s about half the cost of operation of a diesel truck.
Considering companies can spend up to $80,000 on fuel per year per truck, you can imagine how it could be really attractive to go electric. If successful, it could quickly electrify the trucking industry and significantly cut emissions from freight transport.

2022/10/06,"Tesla (TSLA) has been officially upgraded to investment grade long-term credit rating by S&P Global Ratings.
Despite delivering profits for more than two years straight and building a cash position of over $18 billion while sitting on very little debt, Tesla was still rated as a “junk bond” by rating companies like S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.
Earlier this year, we reported that the rating agencies are finally changing their opinion on the electric automaker and considering upgrading their ratings.
Today, S&P Global Ratings announced that it raised its long-term credit rating on Tesla from BB+ to BBB, which is the automaker’s first investment grade rating.
The rating company wrote about Tesla in its explanation for the upgrade:
We now view Tesla’s credit profile more favorably because it continues to demonstrate market leadership in electric vehicles (EVs), with solid manufacturing efficiency that supports strong EBITDA margins and sustained positive free operating cash flow (FOCF), above our previously established upside triggers.
S&P Global Ratings admitted that Tesla has surpassed its expectations on many metrics.
The company believes that Tesla will continue to maintain low debt while delivering strong profits:
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Tesla will maintain low debt levels as it sustains its solid market share, profitability, and strong liquidity amid a weakening economy and an increasingly competitive environment for EVs.
While this upgrade may not be important for the average investor and Tesla shareholders, it is a big deal for some large funds that often have a policy not to invest in companies that have anything less than an investment grade rating – often referred to as “blue chips.” This has been preventing some large funds from investing in Tesla.
This was a long time coming. Tesla has been generating billions of dollars in net income every quarter for a while now, but it got the cold shoulder from those rating agencies until now.
Now Tesla is basically a “blue chip” stock, which could open up more investments in the company.
Obviously, I think that some funds are still going to have issues holding Tesla’s stock for other reasons, like how controversial Elon Musk can be for some people, but for the most part, this is the last of the manageable hurdles.

2022/10/04,"Tesla announced today that it is moving away from using ultrasonic sensors in its suite of Autopilot sensors in favor of its camera-only “Tesla Vision” system.
Last year, Tesla announced it would transition to its “Tesla Vision” Autopilot without radar and start producing vehicles without a front-facing radar.
Originally, the suite of Autopilot sensors – which Tesla claimed would include everything needed to achieve full self-driving capability eventually – included eight cameras, a front-facing radar, and several ultrasonic sensors all around its vehicles.
The transition to Tesla Vision means shifting to only use camera-based computer vision in the Autopilot system instead of inputs from both cameras and radars.
You would think that more data would be better, but Tesla’s idea is that the roads are designed for humans who navigate them using a vision-based system – the natural neural nets in their brains. The automaker believes it best to try to replicate that purely with cameras and artificial neural nets and not let the radar data pollute the system.
This shift resulted in some Autopilot features being limited in vehicles without radar. For example, Tesla limited the Autosteer speed of Tesla Vision vehicles to only 75 mph until May of this year.
Now Tesla is announcing that it is going a step further and removing ultrasonic sensors and replacing them with its Tesla Vision technology:
Today, we are taking the next step in Tesla Vision by removing ultrasonic sensors (USS) from Model 3 and Model Y. We will continue this rollout with Model 3 and Model Y, globally, over the next few months, followed by Model S and Model X in 2023.
The ultrasonic sensors were primarily used for short-range object detections in applications like auto-park and collision warnings.
Tesla explains how its vision neural nets are replacing the USS:
Along with the removal of USS, we have simultaneously launched our vision-based occupancy network – currently used in Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta – to replace the inputs generated by USS. With today’s software, this approach gives Autopilot high-definition spatial positioning, longer range visibility and ability to identify and differentiate between objects. As with many Tesla features, our occupancy network will continue to improve rapidly over time.
Tesla confirmed that moving toward a camera-only approach will again result in some feature limitations:
Over time, Tesla will push new software updates to improve features and release Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon using its occupancy network.
While this shift might be perceived as another cost-cutting effort by Tesla, which now will not have to embed ultrasonic sensors in its body panels, the automaker truly believes that its vision system is a better approach.
Unfortunately, Tesla again decided to roll out the change before being ready to replace all the features.
It’s going to be interesting to track the progress of Tesla vehicle features without USS over the next few months.

2022/10/04,"Tesla has unveiled “Cybertruck on Mars” designs generated by its AI as part of a demonstration of its AI software stack running on its Dojo supercomputer.
Tesla’s AI Day presentation wasn’t for everyone. As CEO Elon Musk warned, it was very technical, and after the first hour, the next two hours of the presentation were extremely technical and aimed at AI and robotic experts.
The company described in great detail its many AI-related programs.
As I am myself no AI expert, I rewatched the presentation a few times over the last few days to both get a better understanding of Tesla’s program and shared some of the most fun parts for those who might have missed them after being lost in all the details.
One of the more interesting parts of the presentation was the progress made by Tesla’s Dojo team on its supercomputer.
While the headlines have focused mainly on the hardware developed by Tesla for its Dojo supercomputer, the company has also made some great advancements in software.
Rajiv Kurian, principal engineer at Tesla who focuses on hardware-software codesign for micro-architecture, explained in a presentation how Tesla is making the best of its Dojo supercomputer AI accelerator through software.
The presentation goes into detail about how Tesla developed its stack in order for the Dojo compiler to be able to run neural nets out of the box quickly.
Kurian gave an example:
We expect most models to work out of the box. As an example, we took the recently released Stable Diffusion model and got it running on Dojo in minutes. Out of the box, the compiler was able to map in a model parallel manner in a 25 Dojo dies.
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image deep learning model that is able to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions.
He released some pictures of “Cybertruck on Mars” generated by Stable Diffusion running on Tesla’s Dojo:
Regarding the results, Kurian aptly noted:
It looks like it still has ways to go before matching the Tesla Design Studio team.
There are some that indeed don’t make much sense, but some of the designs show some promises if they get cleaned up.
What do you think? Can this be used as a design tool for designers to get inspiration? Let us know what you think in the comment section below.

2022/10/03,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is free-falling today as its newly unveiled robot is getting ridiculed, but Elon Musk claims people don’t understand the value.
Tesla’s stock is down 8% today while the Nasdaq is up 2%. This is one of Tesla’s biggest drops of the year, and it comes off of two separate events that happened since the last market close on Friday.
Yesterday Tesla disclosed its Q3 delivery and production results, and it came a bit short of expectations, though it was because of about 20,000 vehicles in transit to customers.
The second event contributing to Tesla’s stock falling is the AI Day event held late on Friday.
The market is still digesting the event, but the general consensus appears to be disappointment, mainly that Tesla didn’t communicate clearly how much closer it is to its goal of delivering a self-driving system.
Tesla did disclose some significant progress with its Dojo supercomputer program and impressive new technologies to improve its self-driving program, but there’s still no clear path to delivering on its promise.
Then there’s the Tesla Bot.
After pulling opinions from analysts and social media, it appears that the consensus is mainly that the two prototypes unveiled were mostly underwhelming. 
One of them couldn’t even walk, and the other was barely able to walk and wave to the crowd. Tesla did release some videos of the robot completing other tasks, but those were mostly unimpressive, and it looked like purpose-built robots would make more sense for those tasks.
Musk again said that “only a few people understand the value of Tesla Bot,” and he believes that the humanoid robot can eventually increase economic output by an order of magnitude.
Some of the critics of the Tesla Bot are missing an important point. Yes, it is unimpressive in many ways, especially if you compare the prototypes to what Boston Dynamics has shown so far.
I have seen dozens of comments similar to this one over the last few days:
Tesla just unveiled its much-hyped robot, which is meant to replace human laborers. There were 4 handlers to keep the robot from falling over.Meanwhile live footage of Boston Dynamics HQ: pic.twitter.com/LWcaTDfHWg
But Tesla is not trying to make a robot as agile as Boston Dynamics’s products. The company is trying to make a robot that can be useful and manufacturable on a large scale in order to keep the costs down.
We don’t know how much Boston Dynamics’s bipedal robot costs, but we know they’re selling the much smaller dog robot for $75,000, so it’s fair to say that it would be much more expensive than Tesla Bot, which is supposedly going to be “less than $20,000.”
But it’s a fair question to ask about how useful the Tesla Bot could be. I think it’s clear that Tesla is focusing on a fairly high level of dexterity in the hands, the ability to move from one location to the next, and a high level of ability to understand and navigate its environment through Tesla’s computer vision capability.
I do think that there are many use cases for a robot being able to do that.
However, I just don’t understand Musk’s claims that “only a few people understand the value of Tesla Bot,” and I think it comes with a fundamental problem with Musk’s feedback loop.
Anyone who has spent any amount of time thinking about the value of a cheap, useful bipedal humanoid robot understands just how much value it would bring to the economy.
If there’s doubt about the project, there are mainly doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver such a product, especially because of how behind the automaker is on its self-driving program. 
Some skepticism on that front is healthy, but if Tesla can deliver on the product, then yes, the impact is going to be tremendous.
But it looks like Musk needs to reevaluate his own credibility when it comes to that stuff with anyone who is not a superfan. Tesla fans on Twitter telling him how great FSD Beta is and taking everything he says as the gospel is taking a toll.
It results in him thinking that people can’t see his vision just because they have doubts regarding whether or not he can deliver the vision.
Now he has this habit of retweeting people directly quoting him word for word and commenting something like “that’s true” or “exactly,” which is just bizarre.
Musk can deliver on his vision as he has done many times in the past, but he needs to better manage expectations because he has obviously done a terrible job at that with the Tesla Full Self-Driving program.

2022/10/03,"Tesla is finally planning to expand the Gigafactory Nevada building after years of being “stuck” at about “30% of its final size.”
Tesla Gigafactory Nevada was the first major step in Tesla’s effort to secure battery cell supply for its ambitious growth.
The automaker partnered with Panasonic to deploy new battery cell production capacity at the facility, and Tesla used those cells to build battery packs for its vehicles and energy storage products.
When originally announcing the plan for the factory, Tesla was talking about the plant producing 105 GWh of battery cells per year and 150 GWh of battery packs per year once completed.
It was supposed to become the largest building in the world.
However, the factory is currently about 30% complete, and Tesla hasn’t expanded the facility for years as both the automaker and Panasonic have focused on optimizing the current production capacity.
Here’s what the factory is supposed to look like once completed (yellow) and the existing sections with Tesla’s operations (red) and Panasonic’s (blue):
However, Tesla hasn’t expanded the footprint of the factory in five years at this point, as it focused on optimizing this one and building new ones that include vertically-integrated vehicle production.
Now Electrek has learned that Tesla is finally expanding the factory’s footprint with a building expansion.
According to sources familiar with the matter, Tesla plans to start building at Gigafactory Nevada again, starting with an expansion of the “C” section of the building:
As shown above, the new section is expected to be used for battery cell manufacturing.
Tesla and Panasonic are currently working together to produce Tesla’s new 4680 battery cell format that is expected to support the production of the automaker’s future electric vehicles.
There’s no clear timeline for Tesla to start the construction project, but it sounds like it’s going to happen as fast as possible, like everything else for the automaker.
Currently, the building has a footprint of “more than 1.9 million square feet,” but it houses “approximately 5.3 million square feet of operational space” since it has several floors.
The expansion project is expected to bring the factory’s output closer to its original goal of about 105 GWh of battery cell production and over 150 GWh of battery packs.
Tesla would eventually like to also have raw material processing at the factory location.

2022/10/01,"Tesla has unveiled its latest version of its Dojo supercomputer, and it’s apparently so powerful that it tripped the power grid in Palo Alto.
Dojo is Tesla’s own custom supercomputer platform built from the ground up for AI machine learning and, more specifically, for video training using the video data coming from its fleet of vehicles.
The automaker already has a large NVIDIA GPU-based supercomputer that is one of the most powerful in the world, but the new Dojo custom-built computer is using chips and an entire infrastructure designed by Tesla.
The custom-built supercomputer is expected to elevate Tesla’s capacity to train neural nets using video data, which is critical to its computer vision technology powering its self-driving effort.
Last year, at Tesla’s AI Day, the company unveiled its Dojo supercomputer, but the company was still ramping up its effort at the time. It only had its first chip and training tiles, and it was still working on building a full Dojo cabinet and cluster, or “Exapod.”
Tesla has unveiled the progress made with the Dojo program over the last year during its AI Day 2022 last night.
The company confirmed that it managed to go from a chip and tile to a system tray and a full cabinet.
Tesla claimed it can replace six GPU boxes with a single Dojo tile, which the company claims costs less than one GPU box. There are six of those tiles per tray.
Tesla said that a single tray is the equivalent of “3 to 4 fully-loaded supercomputer racks.”
The company is integrating its host interface directly on the system tray to create a big full host assembly:
Tesla can fit two of these system trays with host assembly into a single Dojo cabinet.
Here’s what the Dojo cabinet looks like closed and opened:
That’s pretty much where Tesla is right now as the automaker is still developing and testing the infrastructure needed to put a few cabinets together to create the first “Dojo Exapod.”
Bill Chang, Tesla’s Principal System Engineer for Dojo, said:
We knew that we had to reexamine every aspect of the data center infrastructure in order to support our unprecedented cooling and power density.
They had to develop their own high-powered cooling and power system to power the Dojo cabinets. 
Chang said that Tesla tripped their local electric grid’s substation when testing the infrastructure earlier this year:
Earlier this year, we started load testing our power and cooling infrastructure and we were able to push it over 2 MW before we tripped our substation and got a call from the city.
Here’s how the Tesla Dojo Exapod looks opened and closed:
Tesla released the main specs of a Dojo Exapod: 1.1 EFLOP, 1.3 TB SRAM, and 13 TB high-bandwidth DRAM.
The company used the event to try to recruit more talent, but it also shared that it is on schedule to have its full first cluster, or Exapod, in Q1 2023.
It is currently planning to have seven Dojo Exapods in Palo Alto.
It’s a fair question. Why is an automaker developing the world’s most powerful supercomputer? Well, Tesla would tell you that it’s not just an automaker, but a technology company developing products to accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy.
Musk said it makes sense to offer a Dojo as a service, perhaps to take on his buddy Jeff Bezos’s Amazon AWS, and calling it a “service that you can use that’s available online where you can train your models way faster and for less money.”
But more specifically, Tesla needs Dojo to auto-label training videos from its fleet and train its neural nets to build its self-driving system.
Tesla realized that its approach to developing a self-driving system using neural nets training on millions of videos coming from its customer fleet requires a lot of computing power; it decided to develop its own supercomputer to deliver that power.
That’s the short-term goal, but Tesla will have plenty of use for the supercomputer going forward as it has big ambitions to develop other artificial intelligence programs.

2022/10/01,"Tesla confirmed today that Gigafactory Berlin has been able to ramp up production to 2,000 electric cars a week for the first time.
If this new production rate is maintainable, it is a giant achievement for the automaker.
Every automaker in the world is currently navigating an extremely difficult supply chain crisis in order to ramp up electric vehicle production and survive the fast transition to electric vehicles that is sweeping the industry.
Tesla has been a leader on that front for a decade now, and it is not slowing down as it is currently simultaneously ramping up production at two major new factories: Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas.
Today, Tesla announced an important milestone for Gigafactory Berlin, which produced 2,000 vehicles in a single week:
2k Model Y built at Giga Berlin this week 🤘 pic.twitter.com/4u4I517wdV
Production started earlier this year, and in June, the automaker previously disclosed having achieved a production rate of over 1,000 Model Y vehicles per week at Gigafactory Berlin.
This means that Tesla managed to roughly double the production rate in about three months.
This is impressive, but the automaker would need to do even better over the next three months if it wants to achieve its existing goal of 2022: a production rate of 5,000 vehicles per week.
Regardless, 2,000 Model Y vehicles per week out of Gigafactory Berlin will have a major impact on Tesla’s operations globally.
Those vehicles are sold in Europe, which means that Tesla doesn’t have to export 2,000 vehicles from China or the US every week to satisfy European demand.
This is going to greatly improve Tesla’s logistics and transit times on top of increasing its overall production capacity.
Congrats to everyone involved in achieving this milestone. We are talking about taking annualized production rate from 0 to 100,000 vehicles in less than 10 months from the start of production.
This is incredible.
However, I have some doubts about achieving 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year, but it is not impossible.
The fact that Tesla announced the milestone for Gigafactory Berlin – but has yet to do that for Gigafactory Texas – would indicate that the latter has yet to produce 2,000 vehicles in a week.
Last month, Tesla confirmed that Gigafactory Texas has produced 10,000 Model Y vehicles to date, but it didn’t confirm the weekly output.
But I would bet that it is not too far behind Gigafactory Berlin.

2022/09/30,"Tesla has unveiled its Optimus humanoid robot at its AI Day 2022 today and Elon Musk believes Tesla can bring it to market for “less than $20,000”.
As expected, the event started with Tesla unveiling a working prototype of its humanoid robot – a project first announced at Tesla’s AI day in 2021.
There were two prototypes unveiled at the event.
Tesla started by unveiling Bumble C, which is the first version of the bot and it was developed with “semi off-the-shelves” actuators. It served as a testing bed for Tesla’s first robot developed with in-house parts.
Here’s a picture of Bumble C as it walked on stage at the event:
It didn’t do anything impressive on stage, but it was able to walk around and wave at the crowd.
Tesla did show some videos of the robot performing some tasks in a controlled environment to demonstrate some level of usefulness.
The automaker even showed the robot performing a task at an actual workstation at the Fremont factory.
But after Bumble C, Tesla brought on stage the first generation Optimus robot.
The reason why Tesla didn’t lead with it and showed an earlier and rougher prototype is that it couldn’t actually get the new one to walk yet. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the new robot should be able to walk within the next few weeks, but he wanted to show it today since it looks more like the version of the robot that is going to go into production:
It also couldn’t do much on stage other than wave at the crowd and had to be carried by Tesla employees.
Musk noted that this version was equipped with Tesla-designed actuators, battery pack, and power electronics.
Tesla revealed that it had the first prototype in February of 2022, which led to this new version that is now supposedly about to walk in the next few days.
Tesla did share some specs of Optimus, including a 2.3 kWh battery pack, which the automaker claims should be good for about a day’s worth of work.
As Tesla announced last year, it is also equipped with the same “self-driving computer” inside Tesla vehicles:
After the presentation about the specs and main features of the bot, Tesla moved on the a more in-dept presentation about the robotic and AI approach to developing it.
Again, Tesla’s AI Day is about recruiting and Tesla is basically showing off what it is working on to help attract talent that would be interested in those details.
On a consumer level, Musk highlighted the fact that while people have seen plenty of impressive humanoid robots before, he insists that Tesla’s effort is different because it is focused on developing a robot that is manufacturable in high volume – unlike one-off projects that we have seen in the past.
Furthermore, Musk said that Tesla’s advantage is that its bot is going to be powered by its AI, which has been primarily developed for self-driving technology. He believes Tesla is going to be able to leverage this work to enable the robot to navigate the real-world and perform useful tasks.
The CEO reiterated previous comments about how Optimus can bring a “fundamental change in civilization as we know it” by virtually “ending poverty” through improving economic output when used in industry.
He believes that the robot should cost “less than $20,000” to make. He didn’t update the timeline to production, but he previously said Tesla planned to bring to production as soon as next year.

2022/09/30,"Tesla is holding its AI Day 2022 tonight in Palo Alto, California, and Electrek has you covered with the livestream and all the news coming out of the event.
It depends on who you ask. If you ask Tesla fans, it’s the event where the automaker is going to reveal how close it is to releasing a Full Self-Driving system and a functional humanoid robot.
If you ask Tesla naysayers, it is a promotional event to pump the stock and present other products that are nowhere near ready for primetime.
But if you ask Tesla, it is just a recruiting event for its AI programs.
The truth is probably a mixture of all of these things, as Tesla plans to give updates on its many AI programs to the public and attract top AI talent.
Elon Musk, along with Tesla’s top engineers and executives working on AI programs, will be holding presentations about those programs.
We expect Musk and Ashok Elluswamy, director of autopilot software at Tesla, to give an update on Tesla’s development of its Full Self-Driving system through its FSD Beta.
Some words on Tesla’s previously announced robotaxi are also likely.
Tesla is also expected to give an update on its Dojo supercomputer program. Last year, Tesla unveiled its Dojo chip and tile. This year, we are hoping to see a full cluster.
Finally, the star of the show is expected to be a working prototype of Tesla Optimus, a humanoid robot.
Musk said to expect a lot of hardware demonstrations at the event, presumably of the robot, and a lot of technical details – again reiterating that it is more for experts as part of a recruiting effort than for the wider public.
You can watch Tesla’s AI Day 2022 livestream below through Youtube starting at 9:15 p.m. ET (if Elon Musk is on time):

2022/09/30,"Tesla is teasing the hands of its humanoid Optimus robot that is going to be fully unveiled at its AI Day event later today.
Tesla is expected to hold its AI Day 2 in Palo Alto starting at 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) today.
The automaker is going to give an update on all its different product programs related to artificial intelligence.
Tesla owners are particularly interested in the company giving some updates on when they plan to deliver on the promises made about self-driving vehicles, but the wider public is likely more interested in CEO Elon Musk saying that Tesla is going to unveil a working prototype of its humanoid Optimus robot at the event.
Ahead of the event, Tesla unveiled the hands of the robot in a tweet:
AI Day tomorrow pic.twitter.com/oVenZDbVMQ
Last month, Tesla teased another version of the robot hands that looked a little less complete than these new ones.
The hands are one of the most difficult parts of creating a humanoid robot, and Tesla is setting the bar high by claiming that the robot will have “human-level” hands.
That’s a big goal, but it could be the difference maker for Tesla Bot since human-level, or near-human-level, hands can enable a lot more tasks that the robot is going to be able to complete.
The hands that Tesla is showing in the Twitter teaser don’t look quite human-level, but they do appear to have a high level of functionality.
It will be interesting to see if Tesla has achieved any breakthroughs that are going to impress roboticists.
Tesla’s main goal with the event is to recruit more AI and robotic experts by showing them what specifically they would be working on. The company has had a lot of success recruiting engineers, and part of the success has been linked to the attraction of developing AI products that are quickly shipped to customers and are less based around research.
The company said that the first version of Tesla Bot will be focused on completing simple repetitive tasks, which will make the robot useful in a factory setting.
Last week, we reported on Tesla saying that it plans to have “thousands of Humanoid Robots within its factories.”
Join us on Electrek later today for our coverage of Tesla AI Day 2.

2022/09/30,"Tesla Solar Roof and Powerwall owners are showing how their energy products fared in Hurricane Ian after it hit Florida.
Yesterday, Hurricane Ian hit Florida, and the state is still accessing the loss of lives and damages that the storm left behind.
At least 10 people lost their lives in Florida, but the death toll is unfortunately expected to rise as officials sort through the chaos.
As for the property damages, the storm surge, flooding, and winds of over 150 mph have had devastating affects on many vehicles, homes, and other structures.
While the loss of lives and homes are obviously tragic, it also serves as a great real-world extreme weather test for Tesla’s Solar Roof tile products.
The company has installed many Solar Roofs in Florida, and some of them were directly in the path of Ian.
Kelly Roofing, a roofing company based in Southwest Florida that participates in Tesla’s third-party Solar Roof Installer Program, shared some images of a Tesla Solar Roof that they installed at a customer’s home that was hit by the hurricane:
@TeslaSolar roof stood up to #HurricaneIan with 155mph winds and a 10’ storm surge! This Powerwall was underwater for hours and is still working perfectly.@elonmusk @Tesla #powerwall #solarroof pic.twitter.com/fVHmChyXUm
Kelly Roofing says that the roof is still functional, despite being hit by the storm surge and extreme winds.
The pictures show the solar roof in a good state, despite the clear destroying power that went through the area:
Maybe even more impressively, like many Tesla Solar Roof projects, the house was also equipped with Tesla Powerwalls, and those were at some point completely submerged in water for hours, according to Kelly Roofing.
And yet, they are reportedly still working fine:
This is going to allow the homeowners to return to their house more quickly since the combination of Solar Roof and Powerwalls enables them to have power off-grid, and there are currently over 2 million homes in Florida without power due to Hurricane Ian.
It’s not the first time that we have seen the Tesla Solar Roof being put through the test of real extreme weather events. Last year, we reported on how Tesla Solar Roof fared against a hailstorm with baseball-size hailstones.

2022/09/29,"Elon Musk says that Tesla Cybertruck is going to be “waterproof enough” to cross rivers and serve as a boat for short periods.
It looks like Musk read Electrek this morning when we reported on the world’s first fully electric amphibious 8×8 XTV vehicle because he quickly announced that the Tesla Cybertruck will pretty much be amphibious.
The Tesla CEO announced on Twitter today:
Cybertruck will be waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat, so it can cross rivers, lakes and even seas that aren’t too choppy.
Musk added that the goal is for a Cybertruck to be able to cross the water between SpaceX’s Starbase and South Padre Island in Texas:
Needs be able to get from Starbase to South Padre Island, which requires crossing the channel.
This would mean that the Cybertruck would need to be able to travel in the water for about 360 meters (1,100 feet), which is the shortest distance in the Brazos Santiago Pass that separates the island and where Starbase is located:
It’s not the first time that Musk has talked about Tesla vehicles being able to be used as a boat.
A few years ago, the CEO said that the Model S could almost be used as a boat after a Tesla Model S was spotted driving (or swimming) through a flooded tunnel – although the CEO made it clear it wasn’t recommended.
In 2020, he did say that people would be able to turn the Cybertruck into a boat, and some plan to take that to a whole new level.
We previously reported on a company developing a conversion kit that can quickly turn a Cybertruck into a catamaran, pictured below.
But now, it sounds like the Cybertruck is going to come with an undercarriage “waterproof enough” to be able to float, and with the propulsion from the wheels, drivers should be able to get around slowly in calm water.
People looking forward to the Cybertruck as an off-road vehicle will be happy that some water shouldn’t make them too nervous.
The Tesla Cybertruck is expected to enter production in mid-2023 at Gigafactory Texas.

2022/09/29,"A Tesla employee was reportedly hit by a car in a bizarre ICEing incident at a Supercharger station in Austin, Texas. The police are now asking for the public’s help in finding the suspect.
When used in reference to a charging station, the term “ICEing” in the EV community is used to describe the scenario where ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles occupy spaces for EVs at a charging station.
Many places have implemented fines for parking at a charging station without charging, which has discouraged people from doing it, but in markets where those don’t exist, it can be a real problem.
Normally, ICEing incidents are just annoying, but every now and again, there are more extreme situations, and this is what we have here.
The incident reportedly happened on Monday, August 29, 2022, when an unidentified man seen in the photos below was involved in a “disturbance with a Tesla employee” at a Tesla Supercharging station, according to the Austin Police Department (APD).
The APD described the bizarre ICEing incident in a post on Facebook:
The preliminary investigation shows that before the disturbance, the man parked his non-Tesla vehicle in one of the charging spots. After entering a restricted area at the Tesla Supercharging Station, the man began to urinate and argue with the Tesla employee. Then the man hit the Tesla employee with his car before leaving the scene.
The report doesn’t specify if the Tesla employee was hurt in the incident.
Here are the two pictures of the suspect that the APD has released:
APD asks “anyone with information about this incident, such as the man who fled or other violent crime, to call” their Aggravated Assault Unit at (512) 974-4940 or Crime Stoppers at 512-472-TIPS, or use the new Crime Stoppers App to report the incident. They are even offering up to a $1,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest.
It’s not the first time that Supercharger ICEing incidents have been somewhat extreme. We previously reported on pickup truck owners getting together to block Tesla Supercharger stations in the US.
At one point, we even saw a pickup that was ICEing a Supercharger lifted from the space by a crane to be removed.

2022/09/29,"Elon Musk has set some expectations for Tesla AI Day 2, which we now know is going to feature “lots of technical detail and cool hardware demos.”
While it has been a long time since Tesla had a proper product unveiling event, the company started to hold somewhat regular annual events with specific subjects at the center of the presentation – not unlike Apple with its annual “Apple Worldwide Developers Conference” and regular fall event.
It started with “Tesla Battery Day” in 2020 when the automaker unveiled its new 4680 battery cell and planned to produce its battery cells for the first time.
Last year, the company held what it called “Tesla AI Day,” which focused on the company’s self-driving program. The automaker also unveiled its Dojo supercomputer and “Tesla Bot” humanoid robot plan – now known as Tesla Optimus – at the event.
Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla will hold a new AI Day in August, but he quickly delayed it to September 30 to allow more time to unveil an actual working prototype of Tesla Optimus at the event.
Tesla started sending out invites for the event, and we now know that Tesla plans to hold the event starting at 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) and it will run until 11 p.m. PT (1 a.m. ET), but only the first part is expected to be live streamed.
The rest is expected to be a recruitment event with some live demos.
Now Elon Musk is adding to expectations by saying that this person on Twitter “pretty much” got it right:
Pretty much. AI/robotics engineers who understand what problems need to be solved will like what they see.
The CEO also reiterated that the event is mainly for recruitment and, therefore, will be “highly technical”:
Note, this event is meant for recruiting AI & robotics engineers, so will be highly technical.
Musk also added that there will be “lots of technical detail and cool hardware demos” during the Tesla AI Day 2.
Those demos are expected to feature Tesla’s first working prototype of its humanoid robot.
Some technical updates on Tesla’s AI programs from the Dojo supercomputer to FSD Beta are also expected at the event
While the comment is kind of a joke, I think that each reaction has some truth. The media and analysts finding it “disappointing and/or a distraction” is too far from the truth as those events are often a letdown, but we have to give it the benefit of the doubt for now.
As for a distraction, that’s a very real concern considering Tesla’s AI team has yet to deliver on its self-driving promises.
The comment about the masses’ reaction is hopefully 100% a joke.
As for TSLAQ, the people calling Tesla a “fraud” will never stop, and Tesla unveiling a humanoid robot definitely won’t help, especially if it doesn’t do much more than the person in a suit that graced AI Day 1. 
The reaction of AI and robotic experts is going to be the most interesting one since it is going to get us an idea of how cutting-edge Tesla’s AI and robotic technology are compared to what is already out there.
As for Tesla investors’ reaction, they have been drinking Musk’s Kool-Aid for a long time, and they will get excited no matter what.
Join us on Electrek tomorrow for coverage of all the most important news to come out of the event.

2022/09/28,"Tesla Megapacks arrive in Hawaii with the state’s last coal shipment as it shifts its grid to renewables supported by energy storage enabled by batteries like the Megapacks.
In the transition to a sustainable energy economy, we take every small victory we can get, and this one is significant.
Hawaii aims to reach 100% green energy by 2045 and already has the highest amount of solar capacity deployed per capita. However, in order to handle all that renewable energy, the state needs to balance it with energy storage capacity since the sun doesn’t always shine.
Tesla has been deploying batteries in Hawaii for years in order to help toward that goal. The company works with Hawaiian Electric on giant new battery systems and on a virtual power plant using Powerwalls.
Earlier this year, we reported that Tesla is deploying Megapacks at a new energy storage project that will replace Hawaii’s last remaining coal plant.
Today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reported that some Megapacks for the projects were delivered at the same time as Hawaii received its last coal shipment:
Last coal shipment arrived in Hawaii at same time as Tesla Megapack batteries that will enable 24/7 sustainable energy pic.twitter.com/zlqJHLsAQq
The port where the coal shipment came is located right next to the Kapolei Energy Storage facility (KES).
You can see on the image shared by Musk that more recently delivered Megapacks are sitting waiting to be installed:
Once completed, the Kapolei Energy Storage facility (KES) will become one of the largest battery systems in the world with a capacity of 185 megawatts/​565 megawatt hours. It is a project in partnership with Plus Power and Hawaiian Electric – the former decided to use Tesla Megapacks to power the system.
In total, it is expected to have 158 Megapacks.
When we last reported on the project in June, it was supposed to be operational by September 2022 when Hawaii’s last remaining coal plant, which is located just down the road from KES, is expected to be retired.
The coal power plant is used to maintain grid frequency – something Tesla’s energy storage products have proven capable of doing – and that’s what KES is aiming to do along with absorbing excess solar power during the day and discharging during the evening.
Now it looks like Tesla and its partners have some pressure to finish the project in time since the coal plant is apparently going to start burning its last shipment of coal.

2022/09/28,"Tesla (TSLA) announced today that it appointed Joseph Gebbia Jr., best known for being an Airbnb co-founder, to its board of directors.
Earlier this year, Tesla announced that billionaire Larry Ellison is leaving its board of directors. At the time, the automaker said it had no immediate plan to replace him on the board.
Today, in an SEC filing, Tesla confirmed that Joseph Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb, will be filling the seat:
On and effective as of September 25, 2022, Joseph Gebbia was appointed to serve as a member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”).
The company noted that he hasn’t been appointed to any committee on the board and that he declined to be compensated until next year at the earliest.
Tesla wrote about Gebbia:
Gebbia, a designer and entrepreneur, has spent the last 14 years of his career as co-founder of Airbnb. The service he built with his co-founders transformed the hospitality industry, allowing travelers seeking local experiences to book homes in nearly every country around the world. Since the 2007 inception in his San Francisco living room, Airbnb has enabled mutual trust for over 4M hosts to share their homes. Hosts have since welcomed more than 1B guest arrivals and earned over $150B, creating economic impact worldwide. As the original designer and host, Gebbia helped shape Airbnb’s product, interface, and brand to become a household name. His entrepreneurial instinct also led to the formation of their community-powered non-profit, Airbnb.org. With the mission to open homes in times of crisis, their emergency response efforts have housed over 200,000 people during natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global refugee crisis.
Gebbia doesn’t have any known relationship with Tesla or CEO Elon Musk. The company hasn’t disclosed if Gebbia, who is estimated to be worth $7 billion, has invested in the company. It will have to shortly.
Tesla has previously partnered with Airbnb to install charging stations at hosts’ homes.
The automaker added some information about what its new board member has been up to recently:
Most recently, Gebbia departed his full-time operating position and transitioned to an advisor role while serving on the Board of Directors of both Airbnb and Airbnb.org. He’s begun working on his next startup, acquired a minority stake in the San Antonio Spurs, gives back via his commitment to the Giving Pledge, and serves on other boards and councils such as his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Olympic Refuge Foundation, UNHCR, Tent.org, Malala Fund, and the Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity.
When leaving his operational role at Airbnb earlier this year, Gebbia confirmed that he will be focusing on being a dad. He also launched a collection of modular office furniture.

2022/09/28,"Tesla has announced a Supercharger price hike in California that is adding to the price increases throughout the last year. It’s still not the price of a tank of gas, but it is now starting to get expensive.
One of the biggest advantages of electric vehicles remains that their cost of operations is much lower than vehicles with internal combustion engines, thanks to electricity generally being much cheaper than gas.
However, the cost of both gas and electricity has been skyrocketing over the last year, especially in Europe because of the war in Ukraine and restrictions on Russian oil and gas.
It used to be difficult to pay more than $5 or $10 for a full charge at a Tesla Supercharger.
After several price increases throughout the last year, now many Supercharger stations are charging $0.50 per kWh, which can result in a cost of $30 to charge 60 kWh.
Earlier this month, we reported Tesla announcing a major Supercharger price hike in Europe – mainly because of the energy crisis.
Now Tesla is announcing something similar in California. The automaker wrote in an email to customers (via Reddit):
Starting Wednesday, September 28, charging rates and off-peak hours will change at select Superchargers. Avoid the rush and save on charging costs when you begin your charging session during off-peak hours. Tap the Supercharger map pins on your in-vehicle touch screen to view rates.
In California and a few other popular EV markets, Tesla has been using the model of cheaper “off-peak hours.”
The hours vary depending on the stations, but they are most often in the middle of the night, which is not exactly convenient for most drivers.
Tesla owners in California say that many Supercharger stations now cost more than $0.50 per kWh, but there are still a few stations at closer to $0.40 per kWh during peak hours.
Prices during off-peak hours, depending on the station, are generally offered at about a 30-40% discount.
Electricity rates are going up across the board, and Tesla looks to be reacting to them. There are also demand charges that are resulting in much higher rates – hence why there are off-peak hours.
I feel like Tesla should just list the price that it has to pay the electric utility and then disclose the premium on top of that to cover its own cost. It would make the situation clear and consistent.

2022/09/27,"Tesla is making large fleet deliveries at the end of the quarter as it pushes for a new all-time delivery record.
Over the last few years, large fleet operators, like rental car companies and car subscription services, have started to invest heavily in electrifying their fleets. This means large orders of new electric vehicles when electric vehicles are already seeing overwhelming demand and significant supply constraints.
Earlier today, we reported that Tesla is expecting a “very high volume” of deliveries over the last few days of the quarter this week.
Now Electrek has learned from sources familiar with the matter that Tesla is focusing on delivering large fleet orders at the end of the quarter.
Tesla is delivering large portions of orders from rental car companies, like Hertz’s order of 100,000 Tesla vehicles, and EV subscription companies.
Last year, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles. More recently, the company added Model Y vehicles to the order.
The rental car company said that it expects to have all 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022, and it is getting a lot of them this week. More are expected to be delivered in Q4.
The Hertz deal has gotten a lot of attention, but other rental car companies, like Avis and Enterprise, have been buying Tesla vehicles, too.
Scott Painter, CEO of EV subscription service Autonomy, told Electrek today that they are expecting to take delivery of about 500 Tesla vehicles by the end of the week.
Autonomy announced its service earlier this year. At the time, the company disclosed having 100 Model 3 vehicles and said it planned a lot more by the end of the year.
It has been more difficult than expected to secure those vehicles amid the supply chain crisis. In July, the company was taking delivery of about 200 Tesla vehicles per week, but Painter said that supply all but dried up over the last two months.
Deliveries are finally starting to pick up again and are expected to grow in Q4. Autonomy is currently buying everything it can get its hands on since about 5,000 customers are waiting to get an EV under its monthly subscription service.
Last month, the company ordered 23,000 electric vehicles, and Tesla got the largest portion by a wide margin, but only a small portion of that order
Painter said that, like Hertz, the company is not getting any discount or preferential treatment on delivery timelines from Tesla for its large order.
Large fleet orders and deliveries are kind of new for Tesla, but right now, production capacity is the name of the game. 
The demand keeps increasing for EVs at an incredible pace, and the companies that will take the most advantage of it are those who have the highest production capacity and the ability to ramp up the fastest.
In the United States, Tesla currently has the capacity to produce about 15,000 vehicles per week. All other automakers producing electric vehicles combined probably have half that capacity.
Tesla is the name of the game for now. Other automakers, like GM and Ford, are currently adding a lot of capacity fast, but Tesla is also not slowing its growth. It’s going to be interesting to see how the market shares will play out in the EV space over the next few years.

2022/09/27,"Tesla is expecting a “very high volume” of vehicle deliveries during the end of the quarter, and it is asking all employees to help – even those outside of the sale and delivery organization.
Over the last year, CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla would try to move away from its model that results in large pushes for deliveries at the end of each quarter, but it had a difficult time achieving that.
Last quarter ended up being another “nutty” one, according to the CEO.
While the end of Q3 was expected to be a more manageable delivery push, we have been starting to get indications that it could be another intense delivery push.
Earlier this month, we reported that Tesla moved back sales employees that it sent to service in order to address the end-of-quarter push.
Today, Electrek can report that Tesla is expecting a “high volume” end of the quarter. Tesla management wrote in an email to employees obtained by Electrek:
We will be delivering a very high volume of vehicles to eagerly waiting customers during the final days of Q3. To help ensure we can delight as many customers as possible, the delivery team is requesting additional support with key delivery-execution tasks.
In the email, Tesla requests that all employees, even those who don’t work in the sales and delivery department, help with the tasks to deliver vehicles to customers at the end of the quarter. 
These tasks can include moving vehicles around, washing and preparing vehicles, delivering vehicles directly to customers, and answering customer questions on delivery day.
In the past, Tesla had engineers, managers, and even executives come down to delivery centers to help with those tasks during end-of-quarter delivery pushes.
Virtually all analysts are predicting that Tesla is going to deliver a record number of vehicles during the third quarter. Most delivery estimates place Tesla’s deliveries in Q3 between 350,000 and 370,000 units.
It would be significant jump from its previous all-time delivery record of ~310,000 units back in Q1 2022.
Tesla is expected to report its delivery and production numbers during the weekend.
While there are negatives to these end-of-quarter delivery pushes, people shouldn’t underestimate how much of a difference they can make.
During some of the pushes, Tesla has been able to deliver extra tens of thousands of vehicles.
There’s no doubt that this quarter is going to be another delivery record, but the last few days of the month could make the difference between Tesla hitting the lower end or the higher end of those 350,000- to 370,000-unit delivery estimates.
In turn, 10,000 to 20,000 fewer vehicles in inventory would make a giant difference in its earnings for the quarter. Hence the importance of the end-of-quarter delivery push.

2022/09/26,"Tesla claims its used car business is “as big as some publicly traded used car retailers,” and it is expanding fast.
Many factors separate Tesla’s business from other automakers, and its direct-sale model is one of the biggest – and probably the one that other automakers are most jealous of.
Tesla operates all of its stores, service, and delivery centers. It doesn’t use the third-party franchise dealership model.
This has a tremendous and obvious impact on its distribution and service organization, but it also has a lesser-known impact on how it manages used cars. 
Operating its own dealership gives the automaker strong control over its used vehicles as owners upgrade or vehicles come off leases.
Tesla’s used car business is now so big that Jimmy Douglas, director of sales and delivery operations at Tesla, claims it is “as big as some publicly traded used car retailers”:
Most people don’t realize that Tesla runs its own vertically-integrated, nationwide online used car retailer. It’s as big as some publicly traded used car retailers you’ve definitely heard of, despite no Super Bowl commercials or wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men.
The executive is likely comparing it to companies like Carvana and AutoNation, which are worth between $4 and $6 billion.
It is impossible to confirm if Tesla’s secondary car business is worth that from public filings since the automaker files the business under “service and other” in its revenue report.
However, that line item is going up fast. It’s up more than 50% over the last year to $1.4 billion in revenue last quarter.
Tesla’s used car business would have an annual run rate of over $1 billion if it’s about 20% of that line item.
Douglas made a comment promoting a new job listing posted by Alex Liebl, manager of Tesla’s Used Car Quality, as the team is expanding.
The executive added about Tesla’s used car team:
They are distributed across North America, ensuring every used Tesla meets our quality standards, so we can delight every customer at the point of delivery. Since Tesla doesn’t advertise, delighted used car customers are our version of Super Bowl commercials.
While Tesla doesn’t advertise its used cars, it has the advantage of having great control over the inventory.
We previously reported that Tesla changed its policy to now prevent anyone from buying their car after their lease is over. This is increasing the automaker’s supply of used vehicles to resell.
At first, Tesla said that the move would be to build a fleet of self-driving cars. While that never happened, the move proved super successful because Tesla now has a lot of vehicles coming off leases, and used car prices are hitting all-time highs.

2022/09/26,"Several Tesla Semi electric trucks have been spotted being shipped around the country ahead of the long-awaited start of deliveries.
Tesla Semi, an all-electric class 8 truck, was unveiled back in 2017. At the time, it was supposed to come as soon as 2019.
The vehicle program was delayed for years, and until recently, it wasn’t expected to go into production until 2023.
However, Elon Musk surprisingly announced last month that the Tesla Semi would actually start shipping later this year.
He didn’t clarify the timing beyond that, but it now looks like it is imminent as several Tesla Semi electric trucks have been spotted around the US being shipped on the back of other trucks.
The electric trucks are being produced in Nevada near Tesla’s Gigafactory, and yet, one Tesla Semi was spotted all the way in Kentucky this weekend:
Saw a Tesla Semi on the way to the National Drive Electric Week – Louisville this morning! There was plastic sheets blocking view from the outside so no pics of the inside pic.twitter.com/2wZ0YuVR34
Around the same time, another Tesla Semi was spotted in Arizona, and the truck driver reportedly said that it was heading to Tesla Gigafactory Texas:
Tesla has said that it would be its own first customer when it comes to the Tesla Semi. It plans to use it in its own operations and reduce fuel costs.
The automaker has already been using early prototypes in its operations, especially between Gigafactory Nevada and Fremont Factory, but now the company is expected to start using production units in higher numbers.
But based on Musk’s announcement, Tesla is also expected to finally deliver Tesla Semi to customers who have placed orders up to five years ago.
Tesla has been taking reservations with deposits for up to $20,000 per truck.
The company is believed to have thousands of reservations for the electric truck with several large companies having big orders, including Walmart and PepsiCo.
While the automaker has production capacity deployed in Nevada, it is fairly low volume. Tesla is expected to bring the vehicle to volume production at Gigafactory Texas next year.
The company has never announced a planned production capacity, but it is expected to be in the tens of thousands of trucks per year.

2022/09/23,"Tesla is planning to have “thousands of Humanoid Robots within its factories,” according to a new job listing for the Tesla Bot program.
With science fiction promising us flying cars and robot butlers for decades, people aren’t taking tech companies announcing humanoid robots seriously.
When Elon Musk brought a dancer in a robot costume to the stage in order to announce the Tesla Bot program at Tesla AI Day last year, it didn’t help people to take it seriously; many saw it as a joke and didn’t believe that Tesla was serious in developing a humanoid robot.
However, Musk made it clear that the humanoid robot program has become a priority at Tesla.
During a product roadmap update early in 2022, Musk said that Tesla is prioritizing product development of the Optimus humanoid robot in 2022 over new product launches, which were all delayed until 2023.
On several occasions since then, Musk has said that people don’t appreciate the value that Tesla Bot could bring to the world. He even said that it could completely change world economics.
But Tesla doesn’t even need customers for the Optimus robot to prove its worth; the automaker plans to be its own best customers by putting the robots to work in its factories.
In a job listing for “Motion Planning & Navigation, Tesla Bot,” Tesla writes that it plans to use “thousands of Humanoid Robots within its factories”:
Tesla is on a path to build humanoid bi-pedal robots at scale to automate repetitive and boring tasks. Core to the Tesla Bot, the motion planning stack presents a unique opportunity to work on state-of-the-art algorithms for motion planning and navigation culminating in their deployment to real world production applications. Our motion planning software engineers develop and own this stack from inception to deployment. Most importantly, you will see your work repeatedly shipped to and utilized by thousands of Humanoid Robots within our factories.
The company said that the first version of Tesla Bot will be focused on completing simple repetitive tasks, which will make the robot useful in a factory setting.
Tesla is set to unveil the first working prototype of its humanoid robot at AI Day on September 30.
If Tesla can successfully create a humanoid robot that is useful, the benefits are obvious, especially amid the current labor shortage.
But that’s the question: how advanced is the robot going to be?
We know that Tesla has been putting a lot of resources into AI, and it has made great advancements in computer vision, which are going to be useful for the robot, too.
However, there is also going to be a need for advancements in robotics to truly make the robot useful. Has Tesla achieved that? We don’t know yet, but we will know soon.
When do you think we will see Tesla Bots working inside Tesla factories? Let us know in the comment section below.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/09/22,"The media has reported today on Tesla having to recall a massive number of electric vehicles in the US, but the fix for the “safety recall” is again just another software update that Tesla has already started to push.
Earlier this year, NHTSA issued a series of recalls on Tesla vehicles that were highly reported in the media.
What was less reported, though, is that almost all of those recalls were fairly simple software issues that Tesla has been able to fix through over-the-air software updates.
Whenever there’s a safety-related issue, NHTSA has to issue a “safety recall,” even if the automaker doesn’t have to physically recall any vehicle, which leads to some confusion.
Now we have another example today as the media reports on Tesla having to “recall” over 1 million vehicles:
The problem is that Tesla vehicles don’t react based on the standard for reversing when an object is detected in a power window.
NHTSA wrote in the recall report:
Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles. The window automatic reversal system may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 118, ‘Power-Operated Window Systems.’
The “remedy” is a simple over-the-air software update that Tesla is already starting to push:
Tesla will perform an over-the-air (OTA) software update of the automatic window reversal system, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed November 15, 2022. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752. Tesla’s number for this recall is SB-22-00-013.
Here’s the list of vehicles affected in the US:
In a similar situation earlier this year, the automaker issued a recall that was reported as a “massive” recall on over 800,000 vehicles due to “a seat belt issue,” which sounds pretty bad, but in fact, it had to do with a reminder alert to buckle the seat belt that sometimes wouldn’t appear under very specific conditions.
It is creating a situation where the media sensationalizes major “recalls” when, in fact, a simple over-the-air software update is needed, and no owner actually needs to bring the car to a dealership or service center, as is the case with traditional recalls.
It actually highlights one of Tesla’s biggest advantages over the rest of the industry: the high level of connectivity in its vehicles, and its lack of reliance on third-party dealers to service them – even for most recalls.

2022/09/22,"Tesla (TSLA) has had a sudden drop in wait times for deliveries on new orders on some of its electric vehicle models, and some are reading into it as demand falling off, but there’s more to it.
In recent weeks, industry watchers have noted that Tesla’s delivery wait times have dropped significantly. Some models that Tesla was quoting up to six months for delivery just recently are now listed as available in weeks.
Many, especially the usual Tesla naysayers, are using this as “proof” that demand is “falling off.”
However, there’s a lot more to it than that.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is not experiencing any demand issue, but there are discrepancies between its order book and production allocations for certain versions of its vehicles that are resulting in some openings, especially at the end of the quarter, for faster deliveries.
Due to Tesla’s direct-sale business model, the company is responsible for its vehicles until they are in the hands of the customers. The inventory doesn’t go through a car dealership, and therefore, it’s up to Tesla to keep inventory low and match production to orders.
Depending on the demand for certain models and production capacity per model, there can be discrepancy that creates volatility in wait times.
In fact, Tesla recently even stopped taking new orders on some models in order to address its long backlog.
Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, a Wall Street analyst covering Tesla, sent a note to clients this week to warn them not to read the wait times dropping as demand dropping:
Do not read a sudden drop in wait time too fast. Our analysis suggest the recent sudden 40-60% drop in wait times Tesla indicates for new orders only reflects a normalization of the backlog, after an acceleration in the first half.
He added in the note:
Understanding wait time volatility. Even with orders steadily growing, irregular increases in production capacity mean wait times will remain volatile. Our analysis clearly suggests orders are reaccelerating this quarter, despite the drop in indicative wait times.
In fact, Ferragu expects an increase in orders and deliveries while both the end-of-quarter backlog and wait times continue to drop during the rest of the year:
Production ramps at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas are also resulting in better product localization and contributing to reduced wait times.
New Street Research maintains a $530 target price on Tesla’s (TSLA) stock, and it expects the automaker to surprise investors with a “monster” quarter in Q3 with record free cash flow.

2022/09/21,"Tesla has officially launched its CCS adapter for $250, enabling Tesla drivers to access public charging stations. This is a product that Tesla owners have been wanting for a long time.
For the past year, Tesla has indicated that it is about to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles. This has been a concern for Tesla owners since it will increase traffic at Supercharger stations. On top of that, it doesn’t work both ways, since Tesla owners don’t have access to most non-Tesla charging stations due to them being equipped with CCS connectors.
In 2020, Tesla announced that a CCS1 adapter is coming, but it was only available in Korea, for some reason.
It took two years, but now Tesla has finally launched the CCS adapter in North America with an update to its online shop:
Tesla writes about the Tesla CCS Combo 1 Adapter in the product description:
Expand your fast charging options with the Tesla CCS Combo 1 Adapter. The adapter offers charging speeds up to 250kW and can be used at third-party charging networks.
The new adapter is identical to the one that Tesla has been selling in Korea for the past two years.
While the launch of the adapter is going to be welcomed by Tesla owners, it is not accessible to everyone.
Tesla writes in the description:
The CCS Combo 1 Adapter is compatible with most newer Tesla vehicles, while some vehicles may require a retrofit to ensure functionality with third-party CCS stations. We recommend checking that your vehicle is on the latest available software prior to signing in to your Tesla Account to verify vehicle compatibility.
While the automaker doesn’t elaborate in the description, the problem is with the charging ECU in Tesla vehicles built prior to October 2020.
Tesla is going to offer a retrofit, but it won’t happen until early 2023. In order to order the adapter, Tesla owners need to log into their Tesla account so that Tesla knows if their vehicle is compatible. If not, Tesla owners can’t even order, as Tesla likely wants to prioritize orders for Tesla owners who don’t need the retrofit.
To be clear, this adapter is only for Tesla owners to be able to charge at non-Tesla fast-charging stations, like EVgo or Electrify America stations. Most EV charging happens at home, and for long-distance charging, Tesla owners primarily use the Supercharger network, which doesn’t require an adapter.

2022/09/21,"The world’s first Tesla solar neighborhood is becoming a reality in Austin, where Tesla is deploying solar roofs and Powerwall in a brand-new development.
Last year, Tesla signed a breakthrough deal to deploy solar roofs and Powerwalls on a “large scale” in a new community in Austin, Texas. The project is in partnership with Brookfield Asset Management and Dacra, where they are offering Tesla Solar Roofs and Powerwalls as packages on brand new houses in a new 12,000-home development project called Easton Park.
It has been identified as an important project for Tesla, one where they can penetrate the new housing market with solar and energy storage.
The project has been going on for a year, but we haven’t heard much about it.
Now Electrek has learned that Tesla is ramping things up at Easton Park by focusing solar roof installation crews on the new house projects.
Last quarter, we reported that Tesla stopped scheduling new solar roof projects as the product is still lagging way behind schedule.
Now sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Electrek that Tesla is starting to plan new solar roof installations again for the fourth quarter, and the focus is on new houses, like the ones in Easton Park.
There are already quite a few houses in Easton Park with Tesla Solar Roofs and Powerwalls, like the one above.
Brookfield Asset Management has many listings with the “Tesla Solar Package” in the Tesla solar neighborhood:
An Easton Park resident going by Mario D. explained why he decided to go with the Tesla package:
I did a cost-benefit analysis: I went to the Tesla site and put in the same characteristics of the house we’re buying and what it would cost to add a Tesla Roof. There’s a big cost savings for at getting it at install.
Mario’s system produces more electricity than he needs, and he can sell the rest back to the grid:
I can generate passive income long-term by using the same energy-saving habits I already have.
Electrek recently reported that Tesla is setting up a company to sell retail electricity in Texas, and it is deploying a virtual power plant. These new installations in Easton Park could eventually be included in Tesla’s upcoming Texas virtual power plant.

2022/09/21,"Chinese automaker Changan Automobile has launched a new electric vehicle that strongly resembles the Tesla Model 3, but it starts at just $26,000.
Tesla has had some issues with Chinese companies getting “inspired” by its designs in the past. Those vehicles are often referred to as “Tesla clones.”
We previously reported on China’s Xpeng copying Tesla’s vehicle user interface and even its website at one point. Tesla is even suing a former employee who the company believes stole information about its Autopilot for Xpeng.
Now Tesla is facing a new major competitor in China that some believe took some inspiration from Tesla. 
Changan Automobile, a state-owned automaker, recently launched the Shenlan SL03, a small electric sedan. The front end of the vehicle where the bonnet meets the fascia looks very similar to the Tesla Model 3:
The vehicle’s dimensions are also extremely similar to the Model 3. It is only about 4 inches longer, but it has virtually the same wheelbase, width, and height.
Also, the interior is very minimalist and features a large horizontal center display like in the Model 3.
The display also appears to feature a user interface that mirrors Tesla’s:
Software features, especially the user interface, is the most often copied feature used by Tesla clones.
In terms of specs, the base version comes with a range of 515 km (320 miles) based on the Chinese standard. A bigger battery pack is also available with a longer 705 km (438 miles) range.
Those options are comparable to what Tesla used to offer before it stopped taking orders for the longer-range Model 3 in China – presumably because of an extended backlog of orders.
Where the Shenlan SL03 shines is with its pricing. The electric car starts at just ¥183,900, which is the equivalent of about $26,000 USD.
In comparison, the Tesla Model 3 starts at ¥279,900 in China, or about $40,000 USD.
Electronics giant Huawei and CATL, a battery cell manufacturer and a major supplier to Tesla, have participated in the development of the Shenlan SL03 with state-owned Changan Automobile.
The company took over 15,000 reservations for the new electric car only hours after launching it. It plans to deliver the first units to customers by the end of the year and ramp up production to eventually 15,000 units per month.

2022/09/20,"A Tesla Megapack has caught on fire at a giant battery project operated by PG&E in Monterey County in California.
In April, PG&E launched the Elkhorn Battery Storage facility in Monterey County, the largest Tesla Megapack project to date. The project consists of 256 Tesla Megapack battery units on 33 concrete slabs for a total capacity of 730 MWh.
Early this morning, a fire was reported at the facility, and PG&E confirmed the fire originated in one of the Tesla Megapack.
Fortunately, the safety systems worked, and the fire didn’t propagate to other battery packs.
PG&E released the following information about the situation:
With large volumes, some battery fires are inevitable, but Tesla has put a lot of effort into making sure they don’t result in too much damage.
In 2016, Electrek obtained the test results that Tesla got from setting fire to a Powerpack, which was the predecessor of the Megapack. The goal was to make sure that the fire didn’t propagate to other battery packs around the device since they are often in large groups in utility-scale energy storage projects.
It’s not the first time that a Tesla Megapack has caught on fire. Last year, a Tesla Megapack caught on fire at another giant battery project in Australia, as pictured above.

2022/09/20,"Tesla is creating a simulation of San Francisco in Unreal Engine, which is primarily a video game engine, to test its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems.
Over the years, Tesla has taken flack for testing its Autopilot and Self-Driving features with its customers on public roads.
But to be fair, there will be several steps taken before any Tesla software gets to a customer.
It is always first tested internally by Tesla employees in closed courses and public roads, but even before that, it is tested in a simulation.
Electrek obtained images of the Tesla simulation in which Tesla is recreating parts of San Francisco to test Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD):
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is focusing the simulation on the San Francisco area.
Tesla is creating the simulation in Unreal Engine, an engine powering many of your favorite video games like Fornite, Valorant, and Robo Recall. 
The automaker even hired many environmental artists that worked on some of those video games and other popular titles, like some of the latest games in the Call of Duty franchise, to develop the simulation.
Tesla currently has several job listings for its “Autopilot simulation,” and it describes the role of “Autopilot Rendering Engineer”:
As an Autopilot Rendering Engineer, you will contribute to the development of Autopilot simulation by enabling and supporting the creation of photo realistic 3D scenes that can accurately model the driving experience in a wide range of locales and conditions. You will be working across teams to provide graphics technology that can create high-fidelity scenes and enables the faithful reproduction of autopilot behavior in simulation.
In the same job listing, Tesla references the Unreal Engine:
Experience working with modern game engines, preferably Unreal Engine.
Unreal Engine was created by Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games. He is a famed software engineer, highly respected in the video game world. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has interacted with him on Twitter in the past.
Here are some clips of an earlier version of the Tesla simulation from last year’s AI Day:
Tesla is now using the latest version of the 3D computer graphics engine, Unreal Engine 5, to create its simulation.
Unlike other companies developing self-driving systems, Tesla doesn’t create HD maps to help its self-driving systems navigate, but it uses its simulation to create “corner case” scenarios to put its self-driving software through.
The simulation is becoming increasingly more realistic, and Musk has pondered whether to make it public at some point by creating video games based on its simulation.
In recent years, Tesla has had an increased interest in video games, which it has been increasingly integrating inside its vehicles. Lately, the automaker has even talked about integrating the Steam video game library in its vehicles.

2022/09/20,"Elon Musk said that Tesla is borrowing the Autopilot team for its Optimus humanoid robot project, which has a deadline at the end of the month.
The CEO has said that the Tesla Bot project has become a priority.
Tesla’s approach to selling Autopilot, and now its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package features before they are ready, is creating some pressure to deliver, but Tesla has missed several timelines already.
CEO Elon Musk has talked about Tesla turning its fleet into 1 million “robotaxi” vehicles by the end of the year, but the goal has now changed to expanding its FSD Beta program, which is still far from being able to perform a robotaxi service.
Many customers are getting impatient to the point that some have filed a class action lawsuit against Tesla over its claims about Autopilot and the FSD package.
Some were also worried that Tesla was spreading itself thin when adding its Optimus humanoid robot project to its plate, and Musk even said that the robot has become a “top priority” at Tesla.
Tesla planned to leverage its work on computer vision for self-driving to use in the robot, which raised concerns considering the automaker has yet to deliver on its self-driving promises despite selling the feature to customers.
Now when an owner asked Musk about a fix in Autopilot on Twitter last night, the CEO seems to suggest that it would have to wait because the Autopilot team is working on Optimus:
Note, Autopilot/AI team is also working on Optimus and (actually smart) summon/autopark, which have end of month deadlines.
The deadline at the end of the month for Optimus is the Tesla AI Day 2, during which the company is expected to unveil its first working prototype of the robot.
Tesla apparently also plans to unveil an updated version of its “Smart Summon” and Autopark features at the event.
Is Tesla spreading itself too thin with this robot project? Should Tesla focus on delivering on its self-driving promises?  Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

2022/09/19,"If you see more electric vehicles across the southern United States, it’s not just you. According to the annual Transportation Electrification in the Southeast report, EV market share in the region doubled from last year with Tesla and Hyundai leading the way. And, perhaps more important, the industry’s growth is bringing new jobs to the region.
The Southeast (Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) has grown to become a significant auto manufacturing hub. Several prominent automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and BMW, call the Southeast home for some of their operations. 
Automakers are transitioning from the motor city to the sun belt because of the regions benefits. It’s closer to the coast, making it easier to export; it offers vast space; and it tends to be less costly. 
EV startups and legacy automakers are both investing heavily in the region. In fact, the Southeast has garnered almost $33 billion in planned investments and expects eventually to house one third of the nation’s EV manufacturing jobs.
To illustrate, here are the top five EV manufacturing investments coming to the region ranked by number of jobs created:
These investments are bringing significant money into the area as electric vehicle sales continue picking up across the Southeast. 
In the second quarter, the Southeast’s EV market share doubled from 2.5% in July 2021 to 5% in July 2022, according to the report. Florida led the region with a 6% EV market share, while Georgia and North Carolina trailed at 5%. Coming in last was Alabama at 2.1% (even though it believes it will be an EV hub).
Tesla held on to its commanding lead with 57% of total EV sales in the Southeast. In second place is Hyundai, after seeing sales surge from the Ioniq 5 and Kia’s EV6. Volkswagen, BMW, General Motors, and Ford also saw growth in the area.
Fueling the growth in EV sales is higher availability (Georgia leads this trend with 57 EV models available), new incentives, and improved access to charging.
Although the Southeast trails the rest of the nation (7% EV market share), reaching the 5% threshold is a critical milestone. According to a Bloomberg study that evaluates nations’ electric vehicle sales, reaching a 5% EV market share can signal the start of mass adoption.
Will mass EV adoption happen in the Southeast? So far, policy-wise, many Southeast states are lagging with some of the highest registration fees for electric vehicles and lowest levels of funding per capita for electric transportation.
With so much investment and opportunity coming into the region, though, electric vehicles offer considerable potential for the Southeast. I expect EV adoption to continue accelerating from here as more models become available and new incentives continue to roll out.

2022/09/19,"Tesla has decided to expand its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program for the first time in a long time. After adding 60,000 additional owners, Tesla’s FSD Beta will have over 160,000 people in the program.
The FSD Beta program enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, FSD Beta is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. Tesla is basically using its customer fleet to test the feature’s capabilities and gather data to move toward its goals of making the system truly self-driving and shifting responsibility for driving safety to Tesla. 
The FSD Beta is a controversial program due to the potential danger of testing the software with customers on public roads, but Tesla has been fairly careful in the rollout, making gradual expansions to more owners.
Tesla launched the FSD Beta program in October 2020, and at first, it only had a few thousand owners in the program. It gradually grew to include about 100,000 owners. Then, with the latest 10.69 software update, Elon Musk began hinting that Tesla might expand to more owners because of increased confidence in the system.
Today, Musk confirmed that Tesla is expanding the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program to 160,000 owners in the United States and Canada:
FSD Beta 10.69.2.1 looks good, extending to 160k owners in US & Canada
The CEO has previously said that Tesla would be expanding to owners who have a driver safety score of over 80.
Tesla built a safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on factors like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagement.
Tesla seems to be confident in this new update. I wasn’t impressed with my first test of Tesla FSD Beta 10.69, but I need to do more testing.
For the new people getting the update, please be careful. You need to pay attention at all times and be ready to take control – especially when using the system in situations with pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users.
Stay safe out there.

2022/09/19,"Tesla is reportedly aiming for a massive sale ramp-up in Germany to 80,000 vehicles in 2022, powered by Gigafactory Berlin.
Germany is an important auto market in Europe and one that is difficult to penetrate for foreign automakers because of the strong local industry with companies like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.
Tesla has made some good early efforts in the country, but it is now expected to do much better with a local factory producing German-made Tesla vehicles.
Last year, Tesla delivered just short of 40,000 vehicles in Germany. Now, Automobilwoche cited a Tesla manager saying that Tesla is aiming to increase sales in 2022 to 80,000 units:
Our goal is to double sales every year, so we would be at about 80,000 units in 2022.
This would be quite an achievement. It would require a massive delivery ramp-up by the end of the year, since Tesla was just short of 25,000 deliveries as of August. That said, Gigafactory Berlin is expected to help as it ramps up production and increases Model Y availability in the country.
The automaker previously disclosed having achieved a production rate of over 1,000 Model Y vehicles per week at Gigafactory Berlin, but that was in June, and the automaker is expected to have significantly ramped up production since then.
The German publication also reported that Tesla is looking to increase its presence in the country to ramp up sales, including more stores, charging stations, and service centers.
That sounds almost impossible, to be honest. Selling 55,000 vehicles in Germany within four months would be an incredible performance by Tesla. That’s more vehicles than Tesla delivered during all of last year.
I think it would require a significant ramp up by Gigafactory Berlin, but that might already be happening. The situation is fairly opaque right now.
We heard from people in Germany that interest from buyers has increased since the automaker established Gigafactory Berlin; they feel like they are buying a German car, to a degree. That will help, but I’m still on the fence about whether 80,000 deliveries are achievable.

2022/09/19,"Chinese EFV automaker XPeng Motors announced it has launched a pilot program for its City Navigation Pilot (NGP) Advanced Driver Assistance System. With its debut, XPeng claims to be the first Chinese company to deliver such an “high-level” ADAS for complex urban driving, continuing to challenge Tesla’s Full-Self-Driving (FSD) technology overseas.
XPeng Motors continues to compete as one of the most prominent EV automakers in China, amongst supply chain constraints, a property crisis, and stern COVID-19 restrictions. It delivered 68,983 EVs in the first half of this year, a YOY increase of 124%, which, according to the automaker, was enough to secure its crown as number one in deliveries “among emerging auto brands in China” for four consecutive quarters.
Although the automaker’s future guidance predicts deliveries to dwindle through 2022, there’s a lot to be optimistic about. XPeng is expected to officially launch its brand new G9 SUV in China later this week, which can charge 200 km (124 mi) of range in five minutes. 
As XPeng’s most advanced EV to date, the G9 will also come equipped with XPeng’s ultra-advanced X-PILOT 4.0 ADAS, capable of full-scenario-assisted driving through its Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP), similar to Tesla’s FSD technology, but with the full embrace of LiDAR. 
The “Highway” version of XPeng’s NGP was launched in China in Q1 of 2021 on the premium trim of its P7 sedan, which is supported by XPILOT 3.0 software. This ADAS feature functions without LiDAR, but its potential is limited – it allows for assisted driving on highways and expressways, but not for city-level driving.
XPeng first teased its City NGP in a video last September, showing a beta version of the software navigate busy urban streets in China without human interference. In July, XPeng shared even more comprehensive footage of City NGP, which appears to be more promising than Tesla’s technology right now.
According to a press release today, XPeng has begun a City NGP pilot program on the urban streets of China, bringing the ADAS technology one step closer to full market integration – a feat Tesla has also yet to achieve. 
XPeng Motors officially launched the pilot program of its City NGP ADAS in the area of Guangzhou, China. The ADAS platform is made possible by XPeng’s combination of sensors to deliver a 360-degree fusion perception through cameras, LiDAR, millimeter-wave radars, and high-precision positioning units. 
XPeng’s approach is contrary to Tesla, who previously abandoned LiDAR in favor of one single vision perception. While Tesla FSD continues to expand and improve through beta phase, the American automaker continues to defer its wide release as its customers wait for it to make good on its promise for fully-autonomous driving. 
In addition to the sensor fusion framework, XPeng has introduced an enhanced Surrounding Reality (SR) display that can visualize the EV’s surrounding objects and project them in 3D on both the digital dashboard and central panel in real-time (see above). When the ADAS system is activated in an XPeng EV with a set destination, City NGP can perform the following:
City NGP marks XPeng Motor’s latest evolution in ADAS and self-driving technology, finally adapting to the most difficult environment for EVs to traverse autonomously – congested urban streets. Company founder and chairman He Xiaopeng spoke to the automaker’s progress:
With the rollout of City NGP, XPeng is spearheading a strategic roadmap to complete our ADAS coverage from highways and parking lots to much more complex city driving scenarios, offering our customers enhanced safety and an optimized driving experience. We believe the continuous evolvement of City NGP and the expansion of its coverage will accelerate the transformation of the driving experiences of our customers.
Currently, the City NGP pilot program is available to XPeng P5 sedan drivers via OTA update, but the automaker says the program will expand to other cities beyond Guangzhou in the future. 
Most recently, XPeng Motors has officially launched the G9 SUV ahead of deliveries in October, check it out.
Check out XPeng’s City NGP in action from the aforementioned video posted in July:

2022/09/19,"Tesla is increasing its Supercharger prices significantly across Europe amid the energy crisis on the continent. 
This follows more price increases throughout the year and around the world for Tesla’s charging network.
One of the biggest advantages of electric vehicles remains that their cost of operations is much lower than vehicles with internal combustion engines, thanks to electricity generally being much cheaper than gas.
However, the cost of both gas and electricity has been skyrocketing over the last year, especially in Europe due to the war in Ukraine and restrictions on Russian oil and gas.
It used to be difficult to pay more than $5 or $10 for a full charge at a Tesla Supercharger.
After several price increases throughout the last year, now many Supercharger stations are charging $0.50 per kWh, which can result in a cost of $30 to charge 60 kWh.
Today, Tesla sent an email to owners in Europe to warn them of another bigger price increase on the Supercharger network:
In the email, Tesla blamed the price increase on an increase in “energy prices” in Europe:
Due to an increase in energy prices, we are adjusting Supercharging pricing across Europe.
Prices vary per station, but a quick check by Electrek showed that prices went up by an average of €0.12 per kWh, which is quite significant.
There are now not many stations in Europe where Supercharging prices are going to be cheaper than €0.60 per kWh after this latest price increase.
For the most part, these prices are still cheaper than gas, which has also gone up in price significantly over the last year.
But it is also important to point out that those prices are only for Supercharging, which represents only a small percentage of most EV drivers’ overall charging since most of it generally happens overnight at home.
Overall, electricity rates have been going up too, but they are more manageable than Supercharger rates, which are also affected by demand charges.
We expect that Tesla is going to increasingly invest in solar and energy storage at Supercharger stations in order to help get control over the energy costs and, ultimately, Supercharger prices.
Tesla might be waiting for Supercharger V4 for wider deployment of solar and energy storage at charging stations.

2022/09/17,"Tesla announced that Gigafactory Texas has produced its 10,000th Model Y electric SUV as it ramps up production.
One of the biggest stories at Tesla right now as the production ramps up is that the automaker is trying to simultaneously achieve Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas. Those two factories are expected to roughly double Tesla’s production capacity within the next year.
However, those production ramps are hard to predict, and Tesla is not exactly forthcoming with the production numbers. But it does share milestones – today, the automaker announced that Gigafactory Texas produced its 10,000th Model Y vehicle:
10,000 Model Ys built at Giga Texas to date pic.twitter.com/4cOlnpCRa0
It doesn’t exactly give us the current production rate, but it is likely over one thousand vehicles per week.
In June, we reported that Tesla significantly managed to ramp up production at the factory, but it also coincided with the automaker starting to produce Model Y vehicles with the old battery architecture, using 2170 cells.
So there are two main questions about Tesla’s production at Gigafactory Texas: How many vehicles are produced per week? And, how many of those are produced with 4680 battery cells and structural battery packs?
Last month, we also reported that Tesla was spotted stacking structural battery packs at Gigafactory Texas, hinting at a possible ramp-up in Model Ys with structural packs.
The production of 4680 cells is believed to be the bottleneck. Tesla has relied on its pilot plant in California to supply Gigafactory Texas, but it has been guiding a start for volume production of the 4680 cell production in Texas by the end of the year.
I think 10,000 Model Ys produced at Gigafactory Texas is a good sign. I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla eventually produces about 2,000 Model Ys per week, but production might not be exactly stable. In my opinion, Tesla could likely achieve its goal of producing 5,000 units per week by the end of the year.
This is exciting because Tesla achieving its volume production ramp in Texas means it can move to Cybertruck.

2022/09/16,"A little-known investor has poured more money into Tesla (TSLA) than Elon Musk himself, and now he is reaping the rewards with a position worth billions of dollars.
We first reported on KoGuan Leo last year when he became the third largest individual shareholder in Tesla behind Elon Musk and Larry Ellison.
As we reported at the time, little was known about the investor and his wealth. He is a graduate of Columbia University and New York Law School, and he founded SHI International Corp, a large IT company.
Since it is a private company, it is difficult to value it, but it must be extremely valuable since it enables KoGuan Leo to invest billions of dollars into Tesla.
When we reported on him last year, he had 6.2 million Tesla shares, which is the equivalent of 18.6 million shares after the stock split last month. At the time, he said that he continued to buy Tesla shares and planned to invest billions more.
But something else interesting about KoGuan Leo is that even though he owns fewer shares than Musk, he has certainly invested a lot more money in Tesla than Musk at this point.
He believes that he invested more money than Musk and Ellison combined at this point:
I can’t believe that I have invested $ in Tesla more than Elon Musk+Larry Ellison combined so far and own 22,629,200 shares? I plan to invest more $ billion into Tesla if I am lucky.
He disclosed 22.6 million shares and, therefore, he stayed true to his promise to invest more in the company. Those 4 million more shares in Tesla likely cost him around $1 billion.
On top of that, KoGuan Leo disclosed having bought about 104,200 shares in Tesla over the last week:
Nibbling more 2500 shares at $292.27/shrSo, 22,731,000 + 2500 = 22,733,500 shares of TeslaTo sum up, here is Robert Frost’s promise to keep:The woods are lovely, dark and deep.⁰But I have promises to keep,⁰And miles to go before I sleep,⁰And miles to go before I sleep. https://t.co/IK4JOI0LKj
If you think he is lying, Tesla’s head of investor relations actually confirmed his Tesla position in the past.
Now, as for his claim that he has invested more money in Tesla than Musk, it is extremely likely to be accurate. While it is hard to determine how much KoGuan Leo invested in Tesla, it looks to be at least $2 billion. We contacted him to see if he would be willing to confirm; at the time of publication, we haven’t heard back.
As for Musk, it is also hard to confirm how much he invested in Tesla since he was the first outside investor before the company became public. We know that he invested $6.5 million in the first series A financing round.
He then participated in every other round and is believed to have invested about $70 million of his own money into Tesla prior to the company going public. While Tesla has been public, the company has raised many secondary offerings, and Musk participated in some of them with about $100 million.
Therefore, Musk likely put less than $200 million of his own money into Tesla, which makes it one of the best investments ever since his stake in the company is now worth close to $200 billion.
As for Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire founder disclosed an investment worth about $1 billion when he became a Tesla board member. It is safe to say that he invested less than $1 billion to get that position in TSLA.
Now it is hard to say how many shares of Tesla Ellison owns since he is not on Tesla’s board anymore, and therefore, he is not required to report his holdings. Unless he went on an undisclosed Tesla buying spree lately, it is fair to say that he hasn’t invested nearly as much money as KoGuan Leo in Tesla.
Obviously, I understand the difference between investing a few million dollars in an early unproven start-up and investing billions in a large proven company, but I still thought it was interesting and worth sharing.
If you follow KoGuan Leo’s Twitter, he can sound a bit eccentric at times, but I love his passion for Tesla.

2022/09/16,"I went on my first test drive of Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta 10.69.2, the latest big FSD software update, and unfortunately, it was a fail.
This week, Tesla has started to push its FSD Beta 10.69.2, a refined version of its big Full Self-Driving Beta update 10.69 that the automaker feels good enough about to push to all 100,000 FSD Beta testers in North America.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. Tesla is basically using its customer fleet to test the capabilities and to gather data, moving toward its goal of eventually making the system truly self-driving and taking responsibility for it.
I have FSD Beta on my Model 3, and my last test in August wasn’t super successful, so I was looking forward to trying the update when I got in my car earlier this week.
Tesla FSD Beta 10.69.2 is the company’s biggest FSD Beta software update in months and includes significant changes to all the neural nets powering the system. There’s a clear focus on unprotected left turns that seems to be dominating this update.
Yesterday, I tested out the update in Shawinigan, Quebec, and put a quick video together showing my first drive with Tesla FSD Beta 10.69:
As you can see in the video, I tested the update on country roads and residential streets. I was going to test it in the city too, but unfortunately, the test failed before that.
It started out well with a perfect right turn at a stop, which can be a bit difficult as you have to creep forward a bit to see if cars are coming from the left.
The second turn was also a right turn, but this time at a four-way stop. It was fairly good, but the vehicle decided to embark slightly on the bike line as it was doing the turn for some reason.
After that, it started to go downhill. To be fair, I hit a construction zone and a blocked street, but it was fairly simple to navigate, and I feel like detecting a blocked street should be a priority.
At first, there was a barrier on the other side of the road that extended into our lane, and as we approached it, it didn’t look like FSD Beta was seeing it. It did ask me to take control when I was less than a second away from it, but it actually got around it without disengaging.
Then we had a left turn at a four-way stop where I had to press the accelerator to tell the FSD Beta to go ahead, because it wasn’t taking its spot and was waiting for a pickup truck that arrived after us.
That was a first-driver intervention, but not a disengagement of the system.
However, it didn’t take long for that to happen. We encountered a blocked road a second later, and while FSD Beta appeared to detect the barrier, it decided to drive around it before I pressed the brakes:
I know some would think that it is an edge case and it shouldn’t be a high priority to navigate that, but I think not driving around blocked road signs is quite important. 
Considering Tesla FSD Beta uses the navigation system, I think it would be fairly easy for it to detect that the road is blocked and to find a detour, instead of trying to drive through it.
I am going to do some additional testing this weekend, and hopefully, I will get a good drive without disengagement, but it’s a fail for my first test drive of Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta 10.69.

2022/09/15,"Tesla (TSLA) has officially lost its infamous “most shorted stock” title as the short position on Apple’s stock (AAPL) rises above Tesla’s.
CEO Elon Musk has often warned people not to bet against Tesla on the stock market. He went as far as predicting a “next level short burn of the century,” and it sort of happened back in 2020.
Tesla’s stock went on a massive run, and people shorting the stock have cumulatively lost tens of billions of dollars.
Over the years, Tesla has been the target of some high-profile short-sellers like Jim Chanos, who made his name on shorting Enron, and David Einhorn, who made his name shorting Lehman Brothers before its 2008 collapse.
After the “short burn,” Musk ended up sending Einhorn a bunch of Tesla “short shorts” to tease him – even Bill Gates ended up shorting Tesla at some point.
For more than two years now, Tesla has remained the most shorted stock in the world based on the total value of the stock position.
Now S3 Partners Research, a firm specializing in short interest, reported that the short position on Apple has surpassed Tesla’s for the first time:
Tesla Inc (TSLA) has held the top spot in the short interest league tables for 864 days, almost two and a half years since April 2020 but Apple Inc (AAPL) has recently recaptured the crown. AAPL short interest is $18.44 billion, 112.86 million shares shorted and 0.70% Short Interest % of Float versus TSLA short interest of $17.44 billion, 57.30 million shares shorted and 2.19% Short Interest % Float.
However, Tesla’s stock is still more shorted than Apple’s based on the percentage of the float.
It’s on the total value of the position that Apple’s short interest has caught up to Tesla.
S3 Partners explained the difference in a note to clients:
The change in the top spot in the short interest rankings was primarily based on short sellers cutting their TSLA exposure and not a huge jump in AAPL short selling. TSLA short interest declined in 2022 as short sellers have continued to cover and reduce their positions in response to a long-term short squeeze even though TSLA’s stock price is down for the year.
The firm described Tesla as experiencing a long and slow short squeeze over the last two years as the automaker turned a profit and significantly increased its positive cash flow.
For years, Musk and fans have been complaining about the massive amount of money being invested against the company’s stock, but for the first time in a long time, it looks like shorts are losing interest in the automaker.

2022/09/15,"Tesla is reportedly considering bringing its “Tesla Center” strategy to China and closing some retail stores in high-rent locations.
Last year, Electrek exclusively reported on Tesla implementing a new retail strategy in North America that involves moving away from showrooms in fancy malls and, instead, focusing on cheaper locations, remote management of the test drive fleet, and delivery and service centers.
Those new bigger locations with both retail and service are often referred to as “Tesla Centers.”
Tesla is also using more “virtual advisors” who manage customers’ ordering experience without being based in a physical store.
Now, Reuters reported that Tesla is thinking about implementing a similar strategy in China:
The shift would put more emphasis on stores in less-costly suburban locations that can also provide repairs as the company works to meet Elon Musk’s goal of improving service for existing customers, many of whom have complained of long delays, they said.
Strong COVID restrictions in China have negatively affected foot traffic in some high-rent retail locations that Tesla operates in big cities, and the automaker is now reportedly considering closing some of those in favor of the new “Tesla Center” model in cheaper areas.
Tesla is also ramping up hiring for service:
As part of that push, Tesla is looking to ramp up hiring of technicians and other staff for service jobs in China, one of the people said. Tesla’s China recruitment website showed more than 300 openings for service jobs as of Thursday.
Recently, Tesla has also been putting more focus on service in other markets. 
The automaker has been delivering record numbers of vehicles every quarter, which is putting a lot of pressure on its infrastructure, and it’s hard to quickly grow service amidst a labor crisis.
This new “Tesla Center” approach could be part of the solution.
Sources have told Electrek that the new approach has shown to be promising in North America. The new model has been working from a retail perspective, and Tesla has been increasing its investment in service, which should start paying off by the end of the year.
It makes sense that it would work in China as well, where the COVID restrictions have continued to be a problem with high foot-traffic retail locations.
With Gigafactory Shanghai still ramping up production and Tesla soon needing fewer exports from the factory as Gigafactory Berlin ramps up as well, it would make sense for Tesla to invest in better distribution and service to support more sales.

With Tesla’s approach of selling features that it has yet to fully develop and missing several timelines relating to them, it was inevitable that the company would eventually face some legal repercussions. 
Those repercussions are now starting.
Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP, announced that it filed a class action lawsuit in the Northern District of California in which it claims that Tesla has been misleading buyers with its claims about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Package and basically delivering a faulty product.
They wrote in a press release:
The lawsuit filed today alleges that Tesla has yet to produce a fully self-driving car. Tesla owners receiving the latest “updates” to Tesla’s Autopilot software and FSD beta software have reported myriad problems, such as cars having difficulty making routine turns, running red lights, and steering into oncoming traffic. There have also been numerous collisions involving Tesla’s purportedly cutting-edge software, including vehicles crashing at high speeds into large stationary objects such as emergency vehicles and an overturned box truck.
The lead plaintiff is Briggs Matsko, a financial planner based out of Sacramento. Now the firm is looking to add plaintiffs to the lawsuit.
Joe Cotchett, a partner of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, said about the lawsuit:
As alleged in the complaint, people have relied upon the representations of Tesla that the self-driving capabilities are completely safe, when Tesla knew they had many problems.
The lawsuit is also using government investigations into Tesla Autopilot and FSD. However, those investigations have yet to find Tesla to have a defect with its systems.
Tesla is also facing a class action lawsuit over Autopilot’s phantom braking problem.
This was inevitable, and it’s going to be a hard one for Tesla to defend. At the very least, I think Tesla should promptly offer refunds to anyone who ordered Full Self-Driving if they want it.
I think that’s fair after so many missed deadlines and virtually no usefulness from FSD Beta.
On Tesla’s side, that would be some goodwill that could help prevent more people from joining the lawsuit, but I think those legal actions are inevitable at this point. Tesla dug itself into a hole that it has to climb out of by delivering on its promises, and this is proving way harder than it thought.

2022/09/15,"Tesla is rumored to be hosting a visit from Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry and innovation minister, amid talks of the automaker building a factory in Canada.
Over the past few months, we have been reporting on mounting evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential location in Canada for its next Gigafactory. Tesla plans to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade, and it is expected to need about eight more Gigafactories to do it.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at factory sites in North America. The CEO also hinted at Canada being the location for Tesla’s next Gigafactory, which he says should be announced by the end of the year.
Musk teased a possible Canada factory again at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting, and the company’s efforts were confirmed through a lobbying disclosure by the automaker with the Ontario government in Canada.
Last month, a local report stated that Tesla had visited Vale’s nickel operations in Canada and was scouting sites for a factory in Ontario and Quebec. We also reported that Tesla visited a graphite mining and processing company based in Quebec’s battery valley.
Finally, Quebec started to look like a likely location for a Tesla Gigafactory in Canada after we saw the automaker had posted a job listing for a high-volume recruiter, which generally means the company is looking to hire thousands of workers.
Last week, Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry and innovation minister, confirmed that the government is talking to Tesla about the automaker establishing a factory in the country.
When Champagne confirmed talks with Tesla, he also said that he is talking to many other automakers. Yesterday, he was at the Detroit Auto Show, and in a post on Twitter he confirmed that he talked to GM, Stellantis, and Ford at the event:
Wrapping up the day here at the @NAIASDetroit, following meetings with GM, Stellantis, and Ford. On Friday we’re on our way to California to talk with another auto manufacturer to bring more investment, create jobs, and build an economy that works for everyone. pic.twitter.com/A4w1joIX2t
But he also teased that he was going to California on Friday to “talk with another auto manufacturer to bring more investment, create jobs, and build an economy that works for everyone.”
Based on the recent talks and the fact that Tesla has a lot of operations in California, Tesla is rumored to be that automaker.
With lobbying efforts and meetings, it looks like the negotiations are ramping up. I wouldn’t be surprised if an announcement is imminent.
As Tesla itself admitted, it needs eight more factories to achieve its goal to produce 20 million vehicles by 2030. It is going to need to start announcing some of them soon if it wants to make it happen.
Canada certainly appears to be the number-one contender at the moment.

2022/09/14,"Tesla Gigafactory Berlin is seeing its expansion caught up in German bureaucracy once more as a vote to approve the project has been put on hold, but it still looks like the vote should happen by the end of the year.
The automaker’s experience building Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas simultaneously has set the tone for Tesla’s future factory projects.
The main takeaway is that the automaker wants an easier permitting process – something closer to what it experienced in Texas rather than in Germany, where Tesla saw several delays because of regulatory approval.
For a potential factory coming to Canada, Tesla has lobbied the government to help negotiate with provinces for a faster permitting process.
Tesla is currently ramping up production at Gigafactory Berlin from 1,000 vehicles per week to a goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year.
To support further expansion of the capacity, Tesla is planning to add constructions on 100 more hectares to build a freight depot, train station, training center, and a kindergarten, as well as more logistics areas to support production.
The expansion project was going to be presented to Grünheide, the city near Berlin where the Gigafactory is located, but Arne Christiani, mayor of Grünheide, confirmed that it was delayed.
Germany’s RBB confirmed (translated from German):
At the beginning of June, the Grünheide main committee approved the plans of the US electric car manufacturer to expand its factory premises and recommended that the local council initiate a procedure for a new development plan. However, Christiani took the item off the agenda shortly before the municipal council meeting. “There is still a need for clarification,” he said at the time. “This is the reason why the development plan is not on the agenda for the next meeting either,” Christiani explained on Wednesday. He could not estimate whether the topic will be dealt with this year.
Like with the original project, regulators often asked Tesla for more information, which created several delays in the approval.
It looks like a vote on the approval of the Tesla Gigafactory Berlin expansion is still expected to happen this year. It’s unclear at this point if it is going to impact Tesla’s timeline to ramp up production.
While Tesla is aiming for 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year, the automaker has much greater ambitions for the plant. It has previously said that it could produce up to 1 million vehicles per year at the factory.

2022/09/14,"Tesla has updated the Megapack and managed to squeeze a lot more energy in a single battery system for large-scale energy storage projects.
Back in 2019, Tesla launched the Megapack; it was Tesla’s third stationary energy storage product after the Powerwall and Powerpack.
A single Megapack unit is a container-sized “3 MWh battery system” with integrated modules, inverters, and thermal systems. With the bigger size and integrated power electronics, Tesla claims that the Megapack is 60% more energy-dense than its Powerpack. It also comes on-site, ready to install and can ship in containers.
When going into the configurator, Tesla was actually saying that the energy capacity is 2.6 MWh in a single Megapack.
Tesla has recently updated its Megapack configurator (hat tip to u/space_s3x) to now list 3.9 MWh capacity. That’s about 50% more energy capacity in a single Megapack, but the battery system is now 6-ft longer and 60% heavier at 83,996 lbs.
It would indicate that while the energy capacity has increased, the energy density of the Megapack went down.
2-hour duration
4-hour duration
Specifications
Earlier this year, Tesla updated Megapack pricing., which changes depending on how many Megapacks you order, but for a single-pack project, Tesla was charging $1,537,910.
Now with the updated bigger Megapack, Tesla has increased the price to $2,414,070 for a project with a single Megapack.
On a per kWh basis, Tesla went from $591 to $622 with the bigger Megapack that has more energy capacity.
The price goes down considerably for a bigger project. For example, a 10-Megapack project costs $19,235,700. With 38.5 MWh of capacity, the price per kWh goes down to $500.
The price goes down to $475 per kWh for even larger 100+ Megapack projects, which are actually becoming quite common.
If you allow me to speculate for a second, I think what we have here is Tesla using LFP cells in the Megapack – the fact that the energy density went down is a good indicator.
Also a good indicator is the fact that Tesla recently managed to significantly increase Megapack production to 42 per week at Gigafactory Nevada on top of ramping up Megafactory, where it plans to produce 40 GWh of Megapacks per week.
Tesla recently confirmed that it has all the battery cells it needs for both its energy business and its electric vehicles for the first time.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla has managed to secure LFP cells for its energy storage devices, including Megapacks.

2022/09/14,"Tesla is now behind schedule on its integration of Steam, the massive video game marketplace and library, but it still plans on having the full video game library available in its electric vehicles as CEO Elon Musk is testing it himself.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been investing heavily into integrating video games into its in-car entertainment system, but it still surprised many when Tesla said earlier this year that it planned to go as far as integrating Valve’s Steam, an online video game store and distribution platform, in its vehicles. 
Steam offers a massive library of video games, and integrating it into Tesla’s EVs would result in a massive increase in games playable inside Tesla vehicles.
In July, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla should release a demo of the Steam integration by August. However, Tesla appears behind schedule since the demo never came.
But the Steam integration is still in the plans for Tesla as Musk confirmed that he was testing it yesterday:
I’m testing it today in Palo Alto
The CEO didn’t offer a new timeline for releasing the integration into a Tesla software update.
As we previously reported, Tesla has a team of software engineers working on video games in Seattle, and they recently started building a similar team in Austin. The automaker has been building a video game platform called Tesla Arcade inside its vehicles, and it has been working with video game studios to port games to it.
Right now, it is mainly to create some added value to its ownership experience, but Tesla might have bigger plans for gaming inside its vehicles. Musk has been indicating recently that he believes “entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves,” which he thinks Tesla can achieve later this year.
In preparation for that, the automaker has been releasing more video games in its Tesla Arcade, and it has indicated that it might turn it into a business. We have seen indications that Tesla plans to offer paid packages of different video games inside its vehicles, which would get the company into the same business as Valve’s Steam, the PlayStation Store, and the Xbox Live store.
But it looks like Tesla is instead betting on Steam integration.
With the unveiling of the new Model S and Model X, Tesla has announced a new gaming computer inside the vehicles:
Up to 10 teraflops of processing power enables in-car gaming on-par with today’s newest consoles via Tesla Arcade. Wireless controller compatibility allows gaming from any seat.
A known chip leaker, Patrick Schur, posted a diagram of Tesla’s new gaming computer powered by the AMD Navi 23 GPU:
The system is integrated and connects directly to two touchscreens inside the Model S and Model X to play games, watch entertainment, and perform some other functions.
Musk also revealed that the new computer has more storage space to be able to handle more games on the platform at the same time.
The website videocardz compared the specs with existing consoles from the latest generation – showing that it does indeed match up well based on the specs available:
Tesla is expected to leverage this new hardware to expand its in-car video gaming experience.

2022/09/13,"Tesla has hired a senior government official in Ontario to lead the company’s efforts on its critical mineral supply chain and government policy in Canada ahead of a potential factory in the country.
Over the last few months, automakers have turned to Canada to secure critical battery minerals to support their ambitions to ramp up electric vehicle production. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz even made a deal with the Canadian government to help them secure the minerals.
The government is expected to try to convince some of the automakers to process the minerals locally and even build batteries and possibly electric vehicles in the country.
Tesla is also looking to Canada for resources, and it has now secured an important new hire in the market.
As first reported by Electric Autonomy Canada, Tesla hired Aleem Ladak to lead “Government Policy, Critical Minerals & Supply Chain” in the country.
Ladak is a geological engineer who started out his career as a mining engineer and then moved on to the analysis and business side of the industry. Before joining Tesla last month, he was a “senior mineral economist & battery minerals advisor for the Ontario Ministry of Mines.”
Ladak will be expected to help Tesla establish a stronger supply chain in the country, potentially leading to a new factory in Canada.
Over the past few months, we have been reporting on evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential location in Canada for its next Gigafactory. Tesla plans to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade, and it is expected to need about eight more Gigafactories to do it.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/09/13,"A new relay attack has demonstrated that Tesla vehicles can be stolen with a quick hack, but thieves need to work in pairs and get as close as two inches from your phone or key card.
Security researchers at IOActive reverse-engineered Tesla’s NFC protocol and have demonstrated a new relay attack:
To successfully carry out the attack, IOActive reverse-engineered the NFC protocol Tesla uses between the NFC card and the vehicle, and we then created custom firmware modifications that allowed a Proxmark RDV4.0 device to relay NFC communications over Bluetooth/Wi-Fi using the Proxmark’s BlueShark module.
After having the protocol, the security researchers can build a device to quickly replicate the signal and send it to another NFC-enabled device.
IOActive describes the attack in a white paper:
This relay attack requires two attackers; in this case, one of the attackers will be using the Proxmark device at the vehicle’s NFC reader, and the other can use any NFC-capable device (such as a tablet, computer, or for the purposes of this example, a smartphone) close to either the victim’s Tesla NFC card or smartphone with the Tesla virtual key. The Proxmark and the second attacker’s smartphone can communicate via Bluetooth using the BlueShark module for the Proxmark RDV4.0, or even via Wi-Fi, connecting the Proxmark to a tiny computer like a Raspberry Pi or similar with Bluetooth while the Raspberry Pi connects to the second attacker’s smartphone via Wi-Fi.
They released a video demonstration of the hack on a Tesla Model Y:
While the attack does show a vulnerability, the thieves need to get the device within two inches of the owner’s key card or phone.
The security researchers noted that they believe that the hack can be achieved with longer distances between the device and the key using Bluetooth, but they haven’t demonstrated that.
A Tesla vehicle was recently used to demonstrate a Bluetooth hack that can unlock cars.
Thefts of Tesla vehicles are quite rare in North America, but in Europe, they have some more sophisticated thieves that managed a string of Tesla vehicle thefts through relay attacks, like this new one.
In response to those attacks, Tesla started rolling out extra layers of security with an “improved cryptography” key fob and optional “PIN to Drive” feature. Once applied, these measures can greatly decrease the chances of your Tesla vehicle being stolen.
In this case, on top of the PIN to Drive feature, drivers can carry their Tesla key card in an RFID card holder to protect against the attack, but it wouldn’t apply if you use your phone as a key, which is what most Tesla owners do.

2022/09/13,"It was discovered that Tesla has special codes in its vehicle software related to crash testing with auto safety agencies. It is raising red flags with those agencies.
Tesla has an incredible record when it comes to crash safety. Its electric vehicles have consistently achieved top safety ratings with auto safety agencies around the world.
Most recently, the Model Y has been getting a lot of accolades.
We previously reported on the Model Y acing its safety test with NHTSA and achieving the highest possible IIHS safety rating.
Last week, Euro NCAP and Australia’s ANCAP released their own testing results for the Tesla Model Y, and the electric vehicle achieved the highest Euro NCAP overall score under its new protocol.
But now, those results are put into question due to a strange finding in Tesla’s software.
Green, a well-known Tesla hacker who often finds interesting tidbits of information in Tesla’s software, reported that Tesla has been adding code that involves crash-testing agencies, including ANCAP and EuroNCAP, which just tested the Model Y:
Tesla just added ANCAP support in their code. This is in addition to already existing ""I VISTA"" (Chinese testing grounds), EuroNCAP and Korea NCAPOne wonders why do it (they also give testing houses one-off builds with the testing house in the name (with tweaked settings?) )
Green was able to confirm that Tesla has been giving “one-off builds” to crash-testing agencies and that the tweaks that the software code brings are “non-visible settings on the autopilot side.”
Crash-testing agencies do test for advanced driver assist features like Autopilot, and Green speculated that it possibly could be “to better conform to the test criteria.”
It is raising some red flags with safety agencies. An ANCAP spokesperson told Drive that it is looking into the situation:
We’re aware of the claims made on Twitter and are looking into it.
To be clear, there are no specific allegations of cheating here, but the special code related to crash testing does raise some questions, which Tesla is not answering, since it doesn’t have a media relations department.
The concern is that Tesla might be changing settings in its vehicles to optimize for the tests, which could be cheating. It’s not unlike what happened during the Dieselgate scandal when automakers were caught having software that detected when the vehicles were emission tested and optimized for better results than would happen outside of the lab.
While the special code doesn’t mean that Tesla is cheating, the automaker has some explaining to do.

2022/09/13,"A Tesla executive has hinted at the automaker offering cheaper electric cars ahead of launching its robotaxi service.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that he was “embarrassed” by how expensive the automaker’s electric cars are at the moment.
 With inflation, the rising cost of battery materials, and strong demand, Tesla’s prices went up significantly across its entire EV lineup over the last two years.
Now the cheapest Tesla you can buy starts at $46,000 in the US, and the Model Y, Tesla’s most popular vehicle, starts at a whopping $66,000.
Musk has talked about reducing prices once inflation calms down. He has also previously talked about a cheaper $25,000 Tesla electric car, but he has put the project on the back-burner in favor of other programs at Tesla.
At times, the CEO also said that he is not sure a cheaper Tesla model is needed with the advent of self-driving resulting in the cheapest form of transportation being a large ride-hailing fleet powered by self-driving electric vehicles.
Recently, Tesla announced plans to build its own dedicated robotaxi vehicle for the service.
Now at the invite-only Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco yesterday, Martin Viecha, Tesla’s head of investor relations, gave a presentation about the company in which he described what to expect from Tesla over the next five years.
According to a third-party account of the presentation released by Business Insider, Viecha reiterated plans for a cheaper vehicle and an overall cheaper offering ahead of the robotaxi service:
When asked about the possibility of Tesla making a cheaper EV, Viecha said that the company eventually wants a more affordable vehicle on the road. If a company wants to be a high-volume automaker, it needs a broad portfolio, and Tesla needs a cheaper offering before its company-operated robotaxi service comes out, he explained.
The executive didn’t elaborate on the timing beyond saying it would come before the robotaxi service, which itself has been delayed several times.
Update: Viecha has now clarified his comment saying that he didn’t say anything about before the robotaxi, which he says is coming in 2024
Viecha also said that he believes Model Y will become the best-selling vehicle of all time next year:
Model Y will basically next year become the best selling vehicle of any kind of all time in the world.
The exec noted that Tesla has yet to pull some demand triggers for the vehicle, including an emphasis on leasing.
While price is one metric, Viecha told investors that the cost of building electric cars is the most important metric to follow. Despite rising prices, Viexha noted that Tesla’s cost per car went from $84,000 in 2017 to $36,000 per vehicle in recent quarters.
He believes there’s still room for improvements and hinted that the Tesla robotaxi could bring some of those improvements in the form of a new generation platform, which would be Tesla’s third after the Model S/X being the first and Model 3/Y being Tesla’s second-generation platform.

2022/09/12,"Tesla has access to all the battery cells it needs for the first time, according to Martin Viecha, the vice president of investor relations at Tesla.
If you have been following Tesla for a long time, there’s a term you should be extremely familiar with by now: production constrained.
For years now, Tesla has been trying to dispel rumors that it has any problem with demand and always replies that its main issue in ramping up electric vehicle deliveries has been its production capacity.
There have been many different bottlenecks in the production and supply chain over the years, but the most common one has been battery cells.
Tesla was the first company to utilize li-ion battery cells in production vehicles and since then, every automaker has rushed to secure the supply of the battery cells for their own EV ambitions. This has resulted in very limited availability of battery cells in the industry.
Only over the last year, we heard Tesla say for the first time that battery cells weren’t actually a concern.
Now Martin Viecha, the vice president of investor relations at Tesla, said Monday during a presentation at the Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco that Tesla currently has all the supply it needs (via Business Insider):
“For the first time I can remember, we can access all the supply we need for both businesses.”
Viecha is referencing “both businesses” because for the longest time Tesla had to limit its production of energy products, like Powerwalls and Megapack, to use its battery supply for its electric vehicles.
Recently, we see the result of the higher availability of battery cells with new record output for both Powerwalls and Megapacks.
The executive is crediting Tesla expanding beyond just Panasonic and adding new battery suppliers like CATL and LG Energy Solutions for the higher battery cell supply.
Tesla itself plans to add to the supply with the volume production of its own 4680 battery cell by the end of the year at Gigafactory Texas.
However, Viecha also warned that the supply chain will need to keep growing at a record pace to support the industry:
“This is the most important part of how this industry can growth in the future. If the industry can 10X from here, the supply chain will need to 10X as well,”
Tesla plans to contribute through deeper investments throughout the supply chain with its recent off-take agreements with both junior mining companies and established mining giants.
I am truly happy for Tesla, but unfortunately, it’s not the case for everyone. Other companies are still having issues getting battery cell supply and especially smaller startups developing new vehicles.
I have been really encouraged by the massive investments in battery production and all the way down the supply chain lately, but I think there’s still a lot more to go.
Tesla and other large automakers need to keep helping finance new mining project for lithium, nickel, manganese and other critical resources for battery production before prices get completely out of control.

2022/09/12,"Tesla has changed requirements for new solar roof projects – they now all require at least one Powerwall per project.
For years now, Elon Musk has been saying that he believes Tesla’s energy business could grow as large as its automotive business.
This is hard to believe right now, considering Tesla’s auto business brought in $14.6 billion in revenue last quarter while its energy division brought in $866 million – that said, over the last year, we have seen Tesla focusing greatly on the energy side of the business.
At $866 million, this last quarter was the division’s best quarter in years, and Tesla’s energy storage and solar power deployment are at record highs.
On top of ramping up deployment, Tesla has been working on new energy products and testing a new version of Solar Roof (v3.5), but the company is also looking to leverage its energy assets to provide grid services, like through its virtual power plants leveraging Powerwall installations.
Last week, we reported that Tesla is finally getting more Powerwall availability with an impressive production ramp to 6,500 Powerwalls per week.
Now Electrek has learned from sources familiar with the matter that starting last week, Tesla is  requiring every new solar roof project to include a Powerwall. The move will accelerate Powerwall deployment and add more prospective members to Tesla’s growing virtual power plants.
Earlier this year, Electrek obtained data on Tesla’s solar roof installations for the first time and confirmed that the company deployed 2.5 MW of solar roofs during the second quarter of 2022, or about 23 roofs per week, which is extremely low and behind Tesla’s goal of 1,000 roofs per week.
Furthermore, we also reported that Tesla had paused the scheduling of its solar roof installations in the third quarter in virtually all markets in the US, which is the only country where Tesla is installing solar roofs. Third-party roofing and solar companies are able to continue installations.
Tesla is now restarting scheduling for the fourth quarter, and it now looks like it will be with Powerwalls.
Powerwalls are not cheap so it will increase the cost of the solar roof projects, but I would bet that already most projects include Powerwalls since they do add a lot of value.
I have two of them at my house, making power outages a thing of the past which is truly awesome.
Then in markets where Tesla is making deals for virtual power plants with electric utilities, you can help pay for it by allowing some power output when the grid needs it.

2022/09/12,"After sending untrained sales workers to work on vehicles amid a service crisis, we now learn that Tesla is bringing the workers back to sales for another end-of-quarter push.
Earlier this year, we reported on Tesla CEO Elon Musk renewing efforts to improve the automaker’s service, especially in North America where many Tesla owners are experiencing long wait times to get their cars into service in some markets.
Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was launching a new effort to “revolutionize” service with bigger centers and more specialization.
In June, we learned that Musk’s renewed attention on Tesla’s service came due to the department experiencing bigger issues than previously believed. The CEO made service a new top priority for Tesla and even canceled sales and delivery targets to focus on it.
We even learned that Tesla pulled untrained sales workers from their positions to work on cars in service centers.
A few months later, Electrek learned that Tesla is now starting to gradually bring the employees back into their roles in sales as the automaker is trying to deliver as many vehicles as possible at the end of the quarter, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Over the last year, Musk has said that Tesla would try to move away from its model that results in large pushes for deliveries at the end of quarters, but it had a difficult time achieving that.
Last quarter ended up being another “nutty” one, according to the CEO.
While the end of Q3 should have a more manageable delivery push, sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla’s Model 3 and Model S production is going to be a bit higher than its sale backlog – hence why the automaker is pulling the sales workers back from Tesla Service.
Sources told Electrek that Tesla is seeing a decent number of customers trying to delay their orders to 2023 in an attempt to have access to the new federal tax credit for electric vehicles. However, Tesla has decided to stick to the original order contracts with customers and cancel orders if delivery is delayed too long.
This results in factory build slots opening for some Model 3 and Model S variants for the end of the quarter.
I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a bad sign for Tesla’s demand. After all, Tesla literally stopped taking orders on some more popular versions of its vehicles due to the backlog getting too long.
It just looks like some production allotment is not matching orders, and Tesla is short on staff in sales to rectify the situation since it sent a decent number of employees to work on service.
While Tesla is not pushing as much for end-of-quarter delivery waves, the automaker still doesn’t want to be sitting on too many vehicles in inventory at the end of the quarter because it looks bad on its financials. 
It has been a while since Tesla had to pull a demand trigger, but it doesn’t look like it is going for a major one.

2022/09/09,"Ford is not backing down from a showdown with Tesla as the EV race heats up. According to a new report, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley will meet with dealers next week in a bid to lower the price of its electric vehicles to compete with Tesla.
One of Tesla’s most significant advantages is its ability to effectively sell directly to consumers (DTC) through its online website, therefore skipping the dealership altogether. As a result, Tesla can cut dealership-related costs and streamline delivery. 
Ironically, when Tesla first began selling EVs, many saw its DTC approach as a vulnerability with less exposure to buyers, yet the opposite turned out to be true. It’s now one of its greatest advantages.
After years of going back and forth with US dealerships and government officials (see here) over selling cars directly to buyers, Tesla is proving the DTC model not only works, but it’s also more efficient. 
Dealerships earn their profit from vehicle sales, which trickles down as costs to the consumer. Furthermore, it’s costly to store inventory on the lot, which can add expenses to both the dealer and automaker, which affects the buyer. 
Tesla’s business model is not the focus of legacy automakers and EV startups as they look to mirror the EV leader’s success.
Elon Musk often talks about how Tesla can cut costs and pass that on to buyers. On Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon explained:
We need to make stuff and make it efficiently.
The key term here is “make it efficiently,” as many startups and legacy automakers are realizing it’s not easy to make a profitable electric vehicle. Although Musk is referring to manufacturing here, Tesla applies the same to its selling process with minimum marketing and distribution costs.
Ford seems to be catching on as the automaker took second in EV sales in the US this past month. That said, after trading shots back and forth between Elon Musk and Jim Farley, Ford’s CEO (Farley said, “Take that, Elon Musk” after taking an early lead in the EV pickup truck market with the F-150 Lightning), the automaker may actually be taking a page out of the Tesla playbook. 
Don’t worry – Ford is not taking its models off dealership lots to target online buyers. That said, Jim Farley recently told dealers new agreements would be on the table in their upcoming meeting next week to promote sales of its electric vehicles.
In particular, Farley is focused on the cost. In July, Ford’s CEO said the automaker would need to cut selling costs by about $2,000 to remain competitive with Tesla and other EV makers. 
Ford is already implementing some measures, such as selling low-inventory models directly to consumers. Although this will help cut costs by about $600 or $700 per unit, according to Farley, it still won’t be enough to compete with Tesla, which can update pricing instantly.
Dealerships expect Ford to implement new policies to promote the growth of its EV line, such as requiring the installation of chargers. 
Josh Sloan, GM of two Ford and one Lincoln dealerships in Michigan, claims:
We’re moving into this really fast. If you’re not all in, you’re going to lose.
During its annual meeting with its US network of dealers, Ford introduced some potentially-game changing requirements in order for its franchisees to continue to sell EVs. Check out all the details of these revised standard here.
Is Ford going all in? So far, that does seem to be the case. Ford is making the right moves right now, and they are paying off. 
Working with dealers is a smart move on Ford’s part. For one thing, dealerships should be incentivized by the massive growth in EV demand. If they want to remain competitive with Tesla and other EV startups, they will need to be more flexible, in my opinion. 
As Elon said, it’s all about efficiency. And if dealerships want to compete in this new EV era, they will need to cut costs somewhere.

2022/09/09,"Tesla is forced to change Autopilot features in Germany by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
Many don’t know that Tesla’s Autopilot features are not the same everywhere. 
That’s partly due to Tesla’s own approach that relies on data from its fleet to improve Autopilot features and a lot of that data is coming from North America, and especially California. 
This results in the system performing better in some places than it does other places.
But regulations are also preventing Tesla from deploying some of its Autopilot features in certain markets, including in Europe.
Now Tesla’s Autopilot is again being affected by regulations. According to Wirtschaftswoche, the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has found “abnormalities”.
The automaker reportedly “partly” fixed the issues with a software update, but there are still issues (translated from German):
In a Tesla investigation by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), which has been running since the beginning of the year, the electric car manufacturer can book a partial success. According to a KBA spokesman, the KBA carried out tests on Tesla vehicles as part of market surveillance and found “abnormalities”. They have now been “already partially remedied by the manufacturer”. For the remaining problems, “further remedial measures are still being tested and validated”. The focus of the investigation is on the driver assistance system (“Tesla Autopilot”).
KBA President Richard Damm commented on the situation. He said that the agency is waiting for information from Tesla and might intervene if it doesn’t receive it:
“If we do not receive any information, we cannot rule out that systems do not comply with the rules,” 
Earlier this year, KBA had expressed concerns that Tesla Autopilot’s auto lane change feature may be considered illegal in Europe.
This is only the latest example of Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving package being under pressure from regulators.
The system is currently under a significant investigation by NHTSA.

2022/09/09,"BMW Group has come out and publicly stated that its future success in a competitive EV market relies heavily on “powerful, innovative, and sustainably produced” battery cells. When BMW’s Neue Klasse (new class) EV architecture launches in 2025, the German automaker says the EV platforms will utilize newly developed 46-mm-diameter battery cells, the same larger design Tesla is using.
This past August, we covered a report that BMW was planning to adopt Tesla’s 4680 (46 mm by 80 mm) cylindrical battery cells – the largest EV cells to date. Tesla has already been manufacturing the 4680 cells itself at Gigafactory Texas, but the automaker has also been recruiting other battery manufacturers to help produce the cell to maximize its availability.
One of the interested parties was EVE Energy in China, which was reportedly going to be producing the 4680 EV cells for BMW as well. At the time, the German automaker would not comment, but said battery news would be coming in early September.
Here we are, just over a week into the month and BMW has confirmed it will adopt 46-mm-diameter cells for its next EV platform, but with a twist. Furthermore, we’ve learned that the automaker is throwing down double-digit billions to battery manufacturers to erect gigafactories in Europe, China, and the USMCA free trade zone (US, Mexico, Canada).
BMW Group confirmed its new battery ambitions in a press release today, sharing a wealth of new information about its sixth generation of battery cells and some of the performance they will provide to BMW’s 800V Neue Klasse platform.
First, BMW states the cylindrical cells have been specifically designed for its new EV architecture and can increase the range of its highest-range model by up to 30% (WLTP). Frank Weber, a member of the Board of Management of BMW AG in charge of development, elaborated on the specs:
The newly-developed sixth generation of our lithium-ion cells will bring a huge leap in technology that will increase energy density by more than 20 percent, improve charging speed by up to 30 percent and enhance range by up to 30 percent. We are also reducing CO2 emissions from cell production by up to 60 percent. These are big steps for sustainability and customer benefits.
Did you catch it? Weber mentions lithium-ion cells. Previously, we’ve questioned whether BMW intended to implement lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry into the 46 mm cells, which could enable less expensive BMW EVs. Additionally, critical raw materials like cobalt and nickel can be avoided entirely in the cathode material, offering more sustainability.   
Although BMW has clearly committed to lithium-ion cylindrical EV cells, the automaker has stated the sixth-generation battery technology will also have an option for LFP cathodes for the first time. Furthermore, BMW Group says it is developing all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) and aims to reach series introduction by the end of the decade. BMW has vowed to present a demonstrator EV with this technology “well before 2025.”
Another important aspect to note is that BMW states that while the cells will be 46 mm in diameter, they will be available in two different heights. It has not shared those heights, but expect one to be 80 mm like the Tesla cells, joined by a second height option.
To support this impending demand for its new 46 mm cells, BMW already has contracts in place with two battery manufacturers while it searches for a third. The two awarded contracts are with CATL and EVE Energy in the “two-digit billion-euro range” to support each battery manufacturer in erecting multiple gigafactories – two in Europe and two in China. 
Each of the battery cell factories are planned to have a total annual capacity up to 20 GWh. BMW states it is already planning two additional battery cell factories in North America, but those partners have not yet been decided. If and when that does happen, those locally produced cells are a stepping stone for future BMW EVs to qualify for federal tax credits in the US under revised terms of the Inflation Reduction Act. As long as the luxury automaker can deliver a vehicle with an MSRP below the price thresholds.
On the wings of its six planned gigafactories, BMW believes costs of its sixth generation of battery cells can be reduced by up to 50%, based on current market assumptions.

2022/09/09,"Tesla has revealed the output Powerwall, Megapacks, vehicle motors, and batteries of Gigafactory Nevada as new leadership is taking over the factory.
Gigafactory Nevada is a factory that Tesla shares with Panasonic where the latter produces battery cells that the former puts into battery packs for its electric vehicles produced at Fremont Factory.
Tesla also produces electric motors at the plant, as well as stationary energy storage products like Powerwall and Megapack.
Chris Lister, vice president of Gigafactory operations, was in charge of operations at Gigafactory Nevada, but he left Tesla this summer.
Now Hrushikesh “Hrushi” Sagar, senior director of vehicle operations and manufacturing engineering, is taking over his responsibilities, along with leading Fremont Factory, and held a meeting with Gigafactory Nevada employees this week to discuss the direction of the plant.
CNBC obtained a recording of the meeting during which the leadership shared some rare data about Tesla’s output at the factory.
Sagar confirmed that Gigafactory Nevada produced 283,473 drivetrains during the second quarter of 2022. Most of those powertrains fed vehicle production at Tesla’s Fremont and Austin factories.
The new leadership also stated that the factory needs to maintain “a steady output of 8,800 high voltage battery packs per week” just to feed Fremont Factory with packs for vehicle production.
Tesla has also managed to significantly ramp up Megapack production at the factory. The automaker is reporting a capacity to produce 42 giant Megapack per week compared to 34 during the last quarter.
The company also confirmed that it produced 37,600 Powerwalls in the second quarter, but it is now capable of producing over 6,500 Powerwalls per week, which should put Tesla’s quarterly output over 70,000 Powerwalls.
During the meeting, Tesla’s management also talked a lot about Fremont factory, which needs to be seen as a “client” by Gigafactory Nevada, according to Sagar. The company confirmed that Tesla now has a production rate of 12,000 cars per week at the factory and it is in the process of ramping that up to 14,000 per week.
These are all very impressive numbers. Gigafactory Nevada is obviously critical to Tesla’s success with an output of nearly 300,000 drivetrains per quarter.
Forty-two Megapacks per week is also really good, and that’s not accounting for Tesla’s new Megafactory in California, which should greatly increase Tesla’s capacity to produce Megapacks. 6,500 Powerwalls per week is also a massive increase in output. We might finally see Tesla expand the availability of the Powerwall as Musk hinted at earlier this week.
These two combined together should set Tesla up for a massive deployment of energy storage products in 2023.

2022/09/09,"Tesla is planning to build a lithium refining factory in Texas – something CEO Elon Musk has previously referred to as a “license to print money.”
In an application filed with the Texas Comptroller’s Office and obtained by Reuters where Tesla is seeking to obtain relief on local property taxes, the automaker describes a battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility to be built on the Gulf Coast of Texas:
“The potential battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility, which Tesla touted as the first of its kind in North America, will process “raw ore material into a usable state for battery production”, the company said in an application filed with the Texas Comptroller’s Office.”
If the project is approved, Tesla says that it could start construction as soon as in the fourth quarter of 2022, which would enable it to reach commercial production by the end of 2024.
Tesla has been looking into entering the lithium mining and refining industry for a long time now.
All the way back in 2014, Tesla tried and failed to buy a lithium startup for $325 million.
At Tesla’s Battery Day event in 2020, the automaker announced that it is getting into the mining business – starting with buying lithium claims on 10,000 acres in Nevada.
The automaker planned to implement a new process to mine and refine the lithium into a battery-grade material.
However, two years later, Tesla has yet to do anything with this claim or a new lithium mining technology announced at the same event.
In the meantime, the price of lithium has gone up by more than 400% during that time.
More recently, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla might actually get into the lithium business as a reaction to the price increase.
During Tesla’s last earning call, the CEO encouraged entrepreneurs to get into the lithium processing business – referring to it as “a license to print money”:
So it is basically like minting money right now. There’s like software margins in lithium processing right now. So I would really like to encourage, once again, entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business. You can’t lose. It’s a license to print money.
There are many companies getting into this space or expanding it, including Lithium Americas, Standard Lithium, Livent, and more. But as Musk pointed out, there’s plenty of space for more.
Tesla has recently issued a lot of contracts to secure a supply of lithium, but processing itself would be a big step for the company in furthering vertical integration.

2022/09/08,"Tesla announced that it is going to let people vote on Supercharger locations as it is expanding its network at an increased pace.
The Supercharger network is the gold standard when it comes to fast-charging networks, and it helped Tesla reach incredible market shares in the EV market both in the US and Canada. While the automaker already operates the largest fast-charging network in the world, it is rapidly expanding.  
It is expected to ramp up greatly in the coming months as Tesla is planning to open its network to non-Tesla EVs, which should increase demand for the charging network.
Electrek recently reported that Tesla is doubling its Supercharger design team in Canada to accelerate the deployment of new stations. The same is happening in the US, and Tesla is looking for locations for new stations.
Now Tesla has announced that it will start letting people vote on Supercharger locations:
Shawinigan, Quebec – the new EV hub.
People can respond to the tweet with locations that will be included in a poll where people will be able to vote on new locations.
Tesla’s Supercharger network already covers most of the population in North America, but there are still some dead zones where a Supercharger station would be really helpful.
If you know of any, reply to that Tesla tweet with the location.
Bennington VT. For all the NYC area people going Skiing in VT. Notice the VOID!!! Chatham NY also could be helpful pic.twitter.com/bZwjtvE8Em
I expect Tesla to massively ramp up Supercharger deployment when it opens the network up to other EVs. Also, I wouldn’t be surprised if it coincides with the first deployments of the Supercharger V4.
On top of it, Tesla is likely going to receive federal funding for new station deployment, but I don’t think that will be massively impactful, considering money hasn’t been an issue for Tesla. The Supercharger bottlenecks are more likely related to labor and production. 
I think we also going to see new stations with stalls for Cybertrucks and vehicles towing trailers. It might result in more Supercharger stations near to each other to support different types of vehicles, including Megachargers for Tesla Semi – though the deployment should be slower for that.
As for the location, I guess it’s nice that we can suggest but I bet Tesla’s data is a lot better at finding locations than user suggestions. It’s still nice to be included.

2022/09/08,"Tesla is ramping up hiring for its Megafactory in California, where it aims to produce 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.
Last year, Tesla broke ground on a new “Megafactory” to produce Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California. The goal is to have a new factory focused only on building the large battery pack for utility-scale energy storage projects.
CEO Elon Musk revealed that Tesla aims for Megafactory to produce an impressive 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.
Tesla has been working on the new plant for a year now, and it is starting a significant hiring effort to staff the factory.
Michael Snyder, senior director of engineering and construction, Energy Projects at Tesla, announced the hiring effort on LinkedIn:
If you or someone in your network is looking for a new role in manufacturing a transformational product, and want to be a tangible part of the energy transition, take a look at positions at our Megafactory in Lathrop. The factory is incredible inspiring and you can see the future of energy storage taking form as we scale to 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.
Snyder reiterated the goal to produce “40 GWh of Megapacks per year.”
It’s hard to overstate how this is a massive ramp-up in Megapack production. For comparison, Tesla only delivered about 4 GWh of energy storage products over the last year. 
Snyder expanded on the job openings at the factory:
Positions span across test, controls, quality, equipment, and process engineering, as well as technicians, production associates, and technical project managers. A truly unique opportunity, and one that is particularly relevant as we see grids around the world being stressed to all-time levels (hang in there CAISO).
Tesla is listing 37 job openings at the Megafactory; most of them have to do with engineering and quality control, but there are also openings for production associates, which generally means that start of production is close. 
Last year, Tesla increased the price of the Megapack as its backlog for the energy storage product is extending into the next year. 
As we previously reported, Musk believes that Tesla Energy will become a distributed global utility, an endeavor that could even outgrow the company’s automotive business. The ramp-up in producing energy storage products, like the Megapack, is crucial to achieving this goal.

2022/09/07,"The Canadian government has confirmed that it is talking with Tesla (TSLA), along with other automakers, about building an electric vehicle factory in the country.
Over the past few months, we have been reporting on evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential location in Canada for its next Gigafactory.
Tesla plans to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade, and it is expected to need about eight more Gigafactories to do it.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America, and the CEO hinted at Canada for Tesla’s next Gigafactory, which he says should be announced by the end of the year.
Musk did it again at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting last month, and the effort was confirmed through a lobbying disclosure by the automaker with the Ontario government in Canada.
Last week, a local report stated that Tesla had visited Vale’s nickel operations in Canada and was scouting sites for a factory in Ontario and Quebec.
We also reported that Tesla visited a graphite mining and processing company based in Quebec’s battery valley.
Finally, Quebec started to look like a likely location for a Tesla Gigafactory in Canada after we saw the automaker posting a job listing for a high-volume recruiter, which generally means the company is looking to hire thousands of workers.
Tesla has also hired a senior government official to lead critical mineral supply chain efforts in Canada.
Now Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry and innovation minister, confirmed that the government is talking to Tesla about the automaker establishing a factory in the country.
He said when asked about Tesla building a factory (via Reuters):
“Yes, I’m talking to them,” Champagne said, in response to a question about reports of Tesla looking to build a factory in Canada. “I’m talking also to all the automakers around the world.”
Champagne also made it clear that he is talking to other automakers also, but Tesla is being singled out due to all the recent evidence that the automaker is getting serious about building a factory in the country.
Tesla has made it clear that speed is essential. The automaker wants the government to guarantee a clear path to build the factory and establish production quickly.
The company has been lobbying for a more efficient permitting process in order to make it happen.

2022/09/07,"Tesla continues to receive accolades for its safety ratings, with the Model Y receiving the top safety rating from Euro NCAP and Australia’s ANCAP.
Australasian New Car Assessment Program or ANCAP becomes the latest car safety agency to give Tesla’s electric SUV a top safety score.
We previously reported on the Model Y acing its safety test with NHTSA and achieving the highest possible IIHS safety rating.
While the Model Y has been on the market in the US for a few years now, it just arrived in Australia a few months ago.
Now ANCAP has released its safety rating for the electric SUV, and it received five stars. However, it is important to look at the individual scores in every category since it tells a much better story than the five stars, which are somewhat easy to get.
Tesla scored high in all categories, but especially in adult occupant protection and safety assist:
For comparison, the recently tested 2022 Kia Niro also received five stars, but it scored much lower than the Tesla Model Y in every category:
The Model Y scored a near-perfect result in the crash tests for adult occupants:
For child occupant protections, Tesla Model Y lost some safety score points because it is not equipped to support every kind of child seat:
Installation of typical child restraints available in Australia and New Zealand showed most child restraints could be accommodated in the rear seating positions, however the Type A capsule and one of the selected booster seats could not be correctly installed in the centre rear seating position.
Another place where Model Y lost a few points is with the protection of road users as ANCAP found that if it struck a pedestrian, it would have a hard time with the base of the windscreen:
The bonnet of the Tesla Model Y provided GOOD or ADEQUATE protection to the head of a struck pedestrian over most of its surface, with WEAK and POOR results recorded at the base of the windscreen and on the stiff windscreen pillars.
On the other side, the agency was impressed by Tesla’s autonomous emergency braking system for protecting road users.
ANCAP wrote in the results:
The autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system is capable of detecting and reacting to pedestrians and cyclists. The AEB system showed GOOD performance in pedestrian test scenarios in both daylight and low light, with collisions avoided or mitigated in most scenarios including in turning scenarios and some reverse (AEB Backover). In cyclist test scenarios, the AEB system offered GOOD performance with maximum points scored.
The agency was also impressed with Tesla’s autonomous driver assist system for preventing or mitigating crashes with other vehicles (car-to-car).
It wrote in the assessment:
Tests of the AEB (Car-to-Car) system showed GOOD performance with collisions avoided or mitigated in all scenarios, including AEB Junction Assist where the test vehicle can autonomously brake to avoid crashes when turning across the path of an oncoming vehicle.
ANCAP says that those safety results apply for the Tesla Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive and Performance variants.

2022/09/06,"Tesla is pushing a new software update that includes an improved Theater Mode. It’s a small change, but it will provide a much smoother experience when using streaming platforms inside Tesla vehicles.
Tesla vehicles are equipped with an in-car app called Tesla Theater, which includes several streaming services, like YouTube and Netflix, that Tesla owners can enjoy when their vehicles are parked.
The feature is especially useful when a Tesla owner is stopped at a Supercharger station to charge.
Tesla Theater now includes YouTube, Disney+, HBO, Twitch, and more.
With this new software update (2022.28), Tesla is improving the Theater Mode with a new minimizing function.
From the release notes via Notateslaapp:
Full screen Theater Mode can now be minimized, allowing access to vehicle controls without video playback interruption. Tap the minimize button on the top left corner of the window to toggle full screen mode.
The update has just started pushing out, and it can take some time to propagate throughout the fleet.
This sounds like a very small change, and it is, but it is a much-needed improvement to Tesla Theater.
Almost every time that I use Tesla Theater, I end up wanting to look up something else in the center screen, generally to plan my route in the navigation system, but it always takes me out of the streaming service I am using in Tesla Theater.
You have to go through the whole process of going back to your stream after you are done. It’s annoying. This is a small change that will get me to use Tesla Theater a lot more.

2022/09/06,"Elon Musk is signaling that Tesla is ramping up Powerwall production and will finally increase the availability of the home battery pack.
Tesla has been production constrained with the Powerwall for a long time.
The demand has been strong in several markets, like the US and Australia, but production hasn’t been able to catch up despite significant ramp-ups.
As we previously reported, it took Tesla about five years to deploy the first 100,000 Powerwalls, and then it deployed 100,000 more home battery packs in 2020 alone. Despite the ramp-up, Tesla couldn’t catch up to the demand, and it even had to tie Powerwalls to solar power systems and stopped taking orders for the home battery pack.
Last night, Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared the Powerwall page and suggested that people should order for “blackout protection”:
Order a Tesla Powerwall battery for blackout protection! https://t.co/tEE4LDBD78
The comment was likely in response to the electricity issues that California is currently having and the brownouts that some are experiencing.
However, you still can’t order the Powerwall for backup power. When following Musk’s link, you end up having to order both the Powerwall and Tesla solar panels. But in a follow-up tweet, Musk said that Tesla might open up orders for Powerwall by itself by the end of the year:
For now, supply is too low, but ordering a Powerwall by itself should be possible end of year.
This would signal that Tesla might be expecting to increase production capacity and be able to improve the availability of the Powerwall.
We recently reported that Tesla is planning new energy products coming this year, including an updated Powerwall. The company has also been ramping up solar installations recently since those are now mostly combined with Powerwalls, and it looks like the automaker has already been ramping up production.
But catching up to demand has been hard. Around this time last year, Musk said that Tesla had a backlog of around 80,000 Powerwalls.

2022/09/06,"Tesla is still having some issues in ramping up production of its new 4680 battery cell and especially its dry-coating technology, according to an interesting albeit strange new report.
Reuters is out today with a new report on Tesla’s effort to ramp up production of its 4680 battery cell.
It’s a bit difficult to determine the level of credibility of the report because Reuters is being a bit vague about its sources, only saying that it talked to “12 battery experts” with some of them having “close ties to Tesla”: 
Among the 12 battery experts Reuters spoke with, nine have close ties to Tesla and three of the nine have examined Tesla’s new and old battery technology inside and out through teardowns.
According to those experts, Tesla is still having issues ramping up its 4680 battery cell production, and the dry-coating technology is still an important bottleneck.
Tesla acquired the dry-coating technology through its acquisition of Maxwell back in 2019.
The dry-coating manufacturing process eliminates large parts of the manufacturing process and could significantly cut the costs of Tesla’s batteries. The battery experts quoted in the report believe Tesla could save up to $5,500 per Model Y battery pack.
But according to the experts, Tesla is having issues ramping up the technology for volume production. One of the sources with ties to Tesla said:
They can produce in small volume, but when they started big volume production, Tesla ended up with many rejects, too many.
Another expert quoted in the report said he believes Tesla will solve the issue, but maybe not on the announced timeline, which is to achieve volume production by the end of the year.
In the meantime, Tesla is enjoying other improvements coming from 4680 cells. For example, Reuters explains that Tesla went from 17,600 weld points to 1,660:
With the older technology, Tesla needs about 4,400 cells to power the Model Y and there are 17,600 points that need to be welded – four per cell – to create a pack that can be integrated into the car, the sources said. The 4680 battery pack only needs 830 cells and Tesla has changed the design so that there are only two weld points per cell, slashing the welding to 1,660 points and leading to significant cost savings.
Most of the advantages of the cell right now comes from the bigger cell format itself. Also, using the cells in a cell-to-pack, or structural battery pack architecture, is also saving about 55 lb. per pack, according to the experts.
However, the dry-coating technology is the biggest difference maker, according to the experts. One of them said:
Bulking up the battery cell helped a lot in boosting efficiency, but pushing for 50% cost savings for the cell as a whole is another matter. That will depend on whether Tesla can deploy the dry-coating process successfully in a factory.
CEO Elon Musk has repeated lately that Tesla doesn’t need the 4680 cells this year to achieve its production goals, but the automaker is going to need them next year to ramp up production with new models, like the Cybertruck.

2022/09/05,"Tesla has officially raised the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package to $15,000, as CEO Elon Musk promised.
Is it worth $15,000?
For years now, Musk has stated that Tesla would keep gradually increasing the price of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package as functionality improves leading to the actual final form of the product, which is, as its name suggests, the capacity to fully drive autonomously. 
However, the feature hasn’t lived up to its name so far. It has been in beta for two years now, and it is still far from self-driving.
Technically, the system is able to both activate and attempt to drive in most areas, including across intersections, but the responsibility remains with the driver, who needs to be paying attention at all times and be ready to take control.
Many see the willingness to take responsibility for the system as the most important step companies developing self-driving systems can take toward achieving this goal.
Tesla has made it clear that it is not there yet and participating in the FSD Beta comes with a bunch of warnings that make it clear the responsibility is still with the driver.
But Tesla sees every new FSD update as a step closer to the goal, and it believes that some of those updates even warrant price increases for the package.
Last month, Musk warned that with the wider rollout of FSD Beta 10.69, Tesla would increase the price of the package from $12,000 to $15,000.
Today, Tesla updated its online configurator to reflect the change:
For the extra $3,000, the FSD package doesn’t have more features, but the “coming soon” “Autosteer on city streets,” which is currently in invite-only beta, is a little better with the latest update.
Of course, the quick answer is no. It’s absolutely wild that right now if you already have Enhanced Autopilot, the extra $9,000 for FSD gives you virtually nothing but the chance to maybe get access to FSD Beta, which itself is not a prize either.
But that’s not really what you are buying. Since Musk has made it clear that he believes true self-driving is worth a lot more than $15,000, he says that the price will keep going up leading to self-driving.
Therefore, buying FSD right now at $15,000 is more of a bet that Tesla will deliver true self-driving and that you are getting it at a discount over the final price right now.
However, that’s a bet because the path from what FSD Beta is right now to a self-driving system safe enough that Tesla would take responsibility for it is not clear.
It’s a bet that I made pre-FSD Beta day with a lot less information and fewer missed deadlines then. I also made the bet with $6,000, which is what FSD cost back then. I don’t know if I would make that bet now for $15,000.
Would you? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/09/05,"Tesla is preparing to launch its electric vehicles in Thailand for the first time with a significant hiring spree.
It has been a little while since Tesla has expanded into a brand-new market. The company was trying hard to enter the Indian market for years, but the effort was put on hold earlier this year after negotiations with the government stalled.
A few weeks later, we learned that Tesla’s new market team turned its attention to Southeast Asia, and more specifically Thailand.
The automaker filed to register its product for sale in the country. That was the first indication that Tesla planned to enter the market.
Now Tesla’s effort is ramping up as the automaker has posted 16 job openings based in Bangkok, Thailand.
The jobs range from service advisor to store manager in order to staff a new Tesla Center in Bangkok, but there are also several managerial positions to establish a wider presence in the country:
Most importantly, one of the best indications that Tesla is entering a new market is if the automaker is planning to open a Supercharger in said market.
Based on its Supercharger map, Tesla still doesn’t have any planned station in Thailand, but the hiring spree shows some positions related to building out charging infrastructure:
Everything points toward Tesla preparing to soon launch its electric vehicles in Thailand.
While Tesla hasn’t officially entered the country yet, there are already quite a few Tesla vehicles in Thailand. They have been imported privately by the owners – and that’s a factor that Tesla takes into account when considering entering a new market. If many people are willing to go through the trouble of importing the vehicle, there’s a good chance that there’s a market for its vehicles in the country. 
We even reported on the Thai police buying a fleet of Tesla Model 3 vehicles for police patrol back in 2020, pictured above.
The Thai auto market is more significant than most people would think. More than 750,000 cars were sold in the market last year, and it is expected to ramp up to 800K–900K this year. However, most of those vehicles are not in the same price range as Tesla vehicles.
Thailand would be the first Southeast Asian country where Tesla would officially sell its vehicles.

2022/09/02,"Tesla’s virtual power plant in California is growing at a fast pace with more Powerwall owners joining. It can now output up to 50 MW.
We have seen Tesla putting a lot of effort into virtual power plants lately.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems – like Tesla Powerwalls – used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants.
Last year, Tesla launched a VPP pilot program in California, where Powerwall owners would join voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it. It helped Tesla prove the usefulness of such a system.
Following the pilot program, Tesla and PG&E (the electric utility covering Northern California) launched the first official virtual power plant through the Tesla app in June.
This new version of the Virtual Power Plant actually compensates Powerwall owners $2 per kWh that they contribute to the grid during emergency load reduction events. Homeowners are expected to get between $10 and $60 per event.
Last month, we reported that Tesla’s California VPP expanded to Southern California Edison (SCE) to now cover most of the state. Shortly after, the VPP had its first event, and it was extremely successful. 
During the last two weeks since the first event, Tesla’s virtual power plant in California has grown significantly.
Last Bulb is tracking the growth of the network and noted that it just reached 3,500 homes and a capacity of 50 MW:
Between PG&E and SCE, it looks like over 400 Powerwalls are being added to the network per week.
The VPP also had its second event this week, and it was outputting a record 20 MW on the PG&E network:
Many Tesla Powerwall owners participating in the event are reporting being credited between $30 and $40 for the short event.
The electric utility needed the capacity amid a heat wave and increased demand for electricity and the VPP replaced the use of a peaker plant, which is more costly and more polluting.

2022/09/02,"Tesla is looking to hire “high volume” recruiters to operate in Quebec, Canada, as rumors that the automaker is looking to establish a factory in the region are ramping up.
Over the past few months, we have been reporting on evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential location in Canada for its next Gigafactory.
Tesla plans to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade, and it is expected to need about eight more Gigafactories to do it.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America, and the CEO hinted at Canada for Tesla’s next Gigafactory, which he says should be announced by the end of the year.
Musk did it again at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting last month, and the effort was confirmed through a lobbying disclosure by the automaker with the Ontario government in Canada.
Yesterday, a local report stated that Tesla had visited Vale’s nickel operations in Canada and was scouting sites for a factory in Ontario and Quebec.
We also reported that Tesla visited a graphite mining and processing company based in Quebec’s battery valley.
Now we learn that Tesla is looking to hire recruiters in Quebec for a “high volume” recruiting effort (via the job posting – hat tip to Alex Oha):
A great recruiter stands apart by excelling at talent identification, attraction, and assessment, and by developing deep partnerships with the business and within HR. Tesla is looking for a high volume, an extraordinary recruiter that stands out by doing all of the above combined with strong business acumen, a passion for their craft, and a genuine commitment to providing an unforgettable candidate experience.
Tesla has used similar language about “high volume” recruiting for early positions at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas. Tesla generally employs between 5,000 and 10,000 at Gigafactories, and it requires significant recruiting efforts when staffing them.
It could be a sign that Tesla is planning to build a large operation, even its next Gigafactory, in the region.
The job is based in Montreal, but it is listed as “Recruiter, Quebec,” which generally means that the position covers the whole of Quebec.
I know I have been making the argument that the next Tesla factory could end up in Quebec for a while now, and I’m obviously biased, but this is a very strong indicator here.
Similar positions have popped up in Austin and Berlin as Tesla was planning Gigafactories there.
I am starting to like Quebec’s chances.
Where in Quebec though? Battery Valley (around Becancour-Trois-Rivieres) would make sense, but it depends if Tesla is planning a full-scale Gigafactory with vehicle production or just battery production.
If it’s the former, I think something closer to Montreal would make more sense when it comes to recruiting a workforce of up to 10,000 people. Maybe a location within about one hour of Montreal, not unlike Gigafactory Berlin is to the city of Berlin. 
I could see something around Granby or Drummondville, but those are just guesses.

2022/09/01,"Tesla’s electric vehicle sales and exports in China have come back up to pre-shutdown output levels with 77,000 units delivered in August, according to the latest statistics.
The automaker has had a tough year in China due to COVID restrictions leading to factory shutdowns, a lower supply, and climate issues leading to power constrained, but it is looking to catch up during the second half of the year with a recent factory upgrade that is going to enable a ramp-up to a capacity of 1 million electric vehicles per year.
Tesla’s numbers for August are now coming out, and it confirms Tesla’s output is now going back to pre-shutdown capacity and ramping up.
The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said that Tesla sold about 77,000 made-in-China vehicles last month, which is up 173% month-to-month since Tesla delivered only about 28,000 vehicles in July due to its factory shutdown for the production upgrade, and up 74% year-over-year versus July 2021.
Those numbers include both vehicles that Tesla delivers in China and export from China to other markets – in short, the output at Gigafactory Shanghai.
In 2021, Tesla decided to take advantage of the production rate and turned Gigafactory Shanghai into its “export hub.” Just a year later, Tesla now accounts for half of China’s electric vehicle exportations.
I see a lot of people claiming that Tesla’s demand in China is falling because its base Model Y – a very popular model for Tesla in China – went from a delivery timeline of 4-8 weeks to 1-4 weeks.
However, I don’t think that’s an indicator; it’s just that Tesla switches to local deliveries during the last month of every quarter and therefore, it is going to have units to deliver in September in China before it switches production back to international deliveries.
I wouldn’t put too much weight on that timeline, but Tesla certainly has more competition in China than anywhere else.

2022/09/01,"Tesla has recently visited Nouveau Monde’s graphite mine and processing factory in Quebec, as the automaker is increasingly looking to establish a factory in Canada.
Nouveau Monde Graphite is a Quebec-based company developing a graphite mine and processing facilities to supply automakers and battery manufacturers with the critical material for creating the anode part of a battery cell.
Their Matawinie project is located in Saint-Michel-des-Saints in Quebec, Canada – about two hours north of Montreal – and the company believes that it is sitting on the biggest graphite deposit in North America.
On top of mining their own graphite, Nouveau Monde is also working on a large anode material facility called the Bécancour Battery Material Plant.
It is located in Bécancour, Québec, which has been called “Québec’s Battery Valley,” as many companies working on battery materials have made significant investments there lately, including GM and Livent.
Interestingly, we reported in 2020 when Nouveau Monde created a funny video addressed to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It aimed at making Musk reach out to them about their graphite project; it took a few years, but it looks like Nouveau Monde finally got the attention of Tesla.
Electrek learned from sources familiar with the matter that Tesla recently paid a visit to Nouveau Monde’s mine and phase 1 of its processing plant.
We reached out to Nouveau Monde for comment on the Tesla visit, but the company said it couldn’t comment.
It comes as we just learned of a visit from Tesla in Canada to meet Vale’s nickel operations in the country, and a local media report stated that Tesla took the opportunity to scout factory sites in Quebec and Ontario at the same time.
Tesla, like many other automakers lately, has turned to Canada’s mineral resources to secure supply to build batteries and support their plan to rapidly increase electric vehicle production. When it comes to graphite, Tesla needs a significant amount to produce every vehicle.
As we previously reported, Tesla asked the US government to waive tariffs on graphite from China last year, claiming that it can’t get the mineral elsewhere; the request covered both artificial and natural graphite.
Furthermore, Tesla has indicated that it is working on new chemistry that it obtained through a startup acquisition that utilizes a new silicon in the anode to replace the graphite.
However, the automaker also said that it plans to use a variety of chemistries and cell supply in order to satisfy its rapidly growing need for battery cells as it ramps up battery-electric vehicle production.
Nouveau Monde Graphite claims that it can produce a 99.95% pure spheric graphite product that will be cheaper and cleaner than synthetic graphite from Asia, which often requires fossil fuels in the transformation process. The company is issuing clean hydroelectricity to produce its anode material in Quebec, and it plans to use electric vehicles to operate its mining operations.
Obviously, again, I’m biased because I live in the area, but it would make a ton of sense for Tesla to establish a presence in Quebec – more specifically, in Mauricie or Centre-du-Quebec, where Bécancour is located.
Soon enough, there will be everything you need to build battery cells all at the same location and all from resources that are located within North America.
Especially with the new requirements about sourcing battery materials to get the new tax credit in the US, it makes trying to secure supply from Canada and “Quebec’s Battery Valley” the perfect location.
If Tesla doesn’t do it, somebody else will.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/09/01,"Tesla has now disclosed that it is lobbying the Canadian government for an accelerated permitting process to build a factory in the country. At the same time, it reportedly scouted factory sites in Quebec and Ontario.
We have been reporting on evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential factory in Canada.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America, and the CEO hinted at Canada. Musk did it again at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting earlier this month, and the effort was confirmed through a lobbying disclosure by the automaker with the Ontario government in Canada.
Now Electric Autonomy Canada reports that Tesla went on a site-scouting expedition in Ontario and Quebec during a trip to visit Vale Canada last month:
Multiple sources with knowledge of the matter, but not authorized to speak, told Electric Autonomy that, earlier this month, high-level Tesla employees visited Vale Canada operations in Sudbury, Ont., just ahead of the Mercedes-Volkswagen announcements. That trip, sources say, was part of a larger location scouting mission by Tesla in Ontario and Quebec to seek out potential manufacturing locations.
Earlier this year, Tesla confirmed that it is buying nickel from Vale.
Electric Autonomy Canada also reports that Tesla filed a new lobbying disclosure that states it is asking the federal government’s support to engage with provinces for a faster permitting process:
Tesla’s updated federal lobbying objectives now read as follows: “Seek government support to facilitate the engagement with provinces regarding permitting timelines, to increase the competitiveness of Canada and its ability to attract capital through approvals timeframes that are competitive with other manufacturing locations while working with government to identify incentives to further increase the attractiveness of Canada.”
We reported that Tesla met with François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s federal minister in charge of innovation, science, and industry, last month.
While Musk has been teasing the announcement of the location of a new Gigafactory, which generally entails vehicle production, Tesla might also be interested in building battery or battery materials in Canada and securing local resources.
Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz both recently announced a deal with the Canadian government to work to secure resources to build batteries.
There’s currently a rush in the country to finance new mining projects, and companies are encouraged to keep the refining of battery materials in the country.
Like I said when we first started hearing about a potential Tesla factory in Canada, it is going to come down to speed of permitting and construction.
Tesla will likely go with the province that will offer an experience closer to what Tesla had in Austin with Gigafactory Texas than in Germany with Gigafactory Berlin.
When Tesla gives the greenlight, it wants to be able to quickly build the factory and deploy production capacity – long and complicated permitting processes and environmental assessments generally prevent that.
It will be interesting which province – and it sounds like it is between Ontario and Quebec – will be able to make that offer.

2022/08/31,"Tesla is currently facing an “unprecedented demand,” according to a Wall Street analyst after a visit with management at Gigafactory Berlin.
Despite the price for its electric vehicles going up significantly this year, there have been many indications that Tesla is experiencing strong demand. We reported on Tesla’s order rate surging to record highs in the US when gas prices went up earlier this year. Tesla even stopped taking orders on some versions of its vehicles because the backlogs were becoming too long. 
Last week, Tesla held an event for analysts at Gigafactory Berlin, and Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research participated.
In a note to clients, Ferragu noted that he sees Tesla facing “unprecedented demand”:
Tesla is facing unprecedented demand. Everybody I know at Tesla and with whom I could discuss that topic agrees that demand is way above what hopes were a few years ago. Electric cars are so popular that for Tesla and their competitors, market shares will mostly be dictated by their ability to ramp volumes.
The analyst came out of the visit, impressed by the efficiency of Gigafactory Berlin.
He wrote:
Compared to Fremont, Berlin is visibly much more efficient. Logistics inside the factory are much simpler, eased by docks surrounding the fab from all sides and ensuring parts come in at the right place in the manufacturing chain. The single manufacturing line is designed for a cycle time of 45 seconds and will deliver 10,000 cars per week at full capacity. (On a side note, it takes just above 5 full days non-stop to do 10,000 cars at 45 seconds per car, so this target accounts for a healthy 25% downtime.) Most importantly, cars are manufactured today with a rear casting, and will shift to rear and front casting as soon as the 4680 structural battery packs will be available.
Ferragu has a price target of $530 on Tesla’s stock, which represents a significant upside on the current value of $275 a share.
Long term, Ferragu even sees a case for Tesla being worth $10 trillion by 2030, but that’s based on the automaker achieving its goal to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by then. For comparison, that’s about four times Apple’s current valuation.

2022/08/31,"A group of Tesla owners in Norway claims they are going on a hunger strike to get Elon Musk’s attention about a long series of problems they claim to have with their vehicles.
However, it looks like there might be another motive.
Elon Musk was just in Norway earlier this week to attend an energy conference, and he said it was also to “show his appreciation for the Norwegian people’s adoption of electric vehicles.”
Norway is indeed adopting electric vehicles at a higher rate than any other country, and it is also Tesla’s biggest market per capita.
While successful, Tesla’s foray into Norway hasn’t been without issues.
The automaker’s rapid growth in deliveries in the country couldn’t match its service expansion, which led to major service wait times that Musk personally acknowledged.
Furthermore, some Norwegian owners also sued Tesla through a consumer protection agency, and Tesla was found guilty of throttling charging speed and asked to pay $16,000 to thousands of owners.
Now there’s another group of “dissatisfied Norwegian Tesla owners,” and they claim to be going on a hunger strike to get Musk’s attention:
They wrote on their website:
We are a group of dissatisfied Norwegian Tesla owners. We believe that if Elon Musk is made aware of our troubles, he will solve the situation. Please help us get his attention.
They have a very long list of complaints – most of which are known issues that have gotten some attention in the past and have mostly been fixed, but there are definitely some that might still occur:
Now the group of owners claims that they are going on a hunger strike to get Musk’s attention in order to fix those issues. However, Electrek found a link on their website to Bilklager, which appears to be a legal service that “helps car owners claim legitimate compensation when they are affected by errors, fraud and problems.”
The service claims that it can collect the money for the previous battery capacity and charging throttling issue in which Norway’s consumer protection agency found Tesla to be at fault.
It looks like the “hunger strike” might be a marketing effort to get Tesla owners to use their services for this issue and potentially sign up for other group claims against Tesla.
Let’s see how long the hunger strike lasts…

2022/08/30,"An insurance company has faked a Tesla battery fire and crash as part of a bizarre showcase to show that electric cars cause more accidents.
Tesla vehicles have been tested by many auto safety agencies around the world, including the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), which most recently gave the Tesla Model Y its highest possible safety rating.
When I received an email telling me that an insurance company crash tested the Tesla Model S last week, I expected to see yet again segment-leading results, but instead they talked about how they managed to “flip the vehicle and it caught on fire.”
I quickly dismissed the report after seeing how ridiculous their crash test looked like and the fact that they decided to use a Model S that is at least six years old:
It made no sense to me so I decided not to report on it, but now it turns out that the crash test was even more bizarre than I thought.
24auto.de confirmed that AXA Insurance completely faked the crash by pulling the vehicle to launch and then activating pyrotechnics to fake a fire:
The alleged crash test by Axa insurance is increasingly turning out to be a show event without any real gain in knowledge: As the company admitted at the request of 24auto.de, there were no batteries in the tested vehicles . According to the press office, “demonstrating a battery fire would have been too dangerous due to the guests present, which is why the battery cells of the electric cars were removed before the tests”. With the same reasoning, the insurance company had also ignited the fire of a tested Tesla Model S with pyrotechnics itself.
The entire “crash test” showcase was part of AXA’s promotion of a report where they claimed that electric vehicles cause more collisions with damage:
“A look at the AXA statistics shows that drivers of electric cars cause 50 percent more collisions with damage to their own vehicles than those of conventional combustion engines. Drivers of high-performance electric cars cause more than twice as much damage to themselves through collisions as those of standard combustion vehicles.”
Of course, you can make data say many things, but in this case, AXA has decided not to compare vehicles per segment. Indeed, electric vehicles on average accelerate quicker due to the instant torque and some people can’t handle the power, which can lead to crashes.
It looks like the Tesla crash theatrics were just produced to illustrate that. Is it worth it?

2022/08/30,"As we roll along in the third quarter of 2022, GM’s long-promised EV lineup is beginning to materialize and gain some serious momentum. The American automaker now has several EVs on the market and has even more in its production pipeline. In recent media appearances, CEO Mary Barra has relayed confidence in GM’s autonomous technology and has reiterated the company’s goal to usurp Tesla as the leader in EV production. Can GM pull it off?
General Motors is an American brand that needs no introduction. As a legacy automaker, GM was a tad slow to join the EV revolution or, at the very least, took a bit longer than some to get “everybody in.”
It’s hard not to argue that a huge factor in the decision to take a $35 billion gulp of the lithium ion Kool-Aid was to gain some market share back from Tesla, which has been donning the crown as America’s EV darling for over a decade now. 
Following a tumultuous end to 2021 following a massive recall on the Bolt, GM’s EV delivery numbers were downright abysmal, despite brave contributions by GMC to get one single Hummer EV pickup out into the world.
As the ball dropped at midnight on December 31, GM must have poured its champagne directly onto its maniacally scribbled slate from 2021 and wiped the entire thing clean. The automaker kicked off 2022 with so much exciting news, I was seeing Chevy Equinox EVs hurdling fences when I closed my eyes at night. 
Revamped production facilities, new US battery cell factories, and a slew of new BEV models were just some of the headlines that followed as GM continues to work toward its promise of delivering 20 new EVs by 2023 and accelerate its EV production capacity to over 1 million units by 2025.
That’s not all either. GM’s CEO Mary Barra has stated several times that the American automaker strives to be the name to beat in autos again and has had its sights set on Tesla for quite some time now. 
GM’s EV transition finally appears to be holding a steady charge, despite global supply chain issues, but can the automaker overtake Tesla in EV production? What about self-driving EVs?
According to GM CEO Mary Barra’s comments in recent interviews with Fox Business, the Tesla logo remains the target on the office dartboard. During an interview on The Claman Countdown, Barra spoke to the tremendous demand for GM EVs across all its brands, as well as the company’s growth despite supply chain constraints:
Frankly, since the beginning of COVID, the supply has been stretched pretty thin, so I’m very proud of what we’re able to do. We’re seeing an improvement with semiconductors and that’s allowing us to make more and more vehicles.
According to Barra, one of the two previously announced US battery factories will open in “a matter of weeks” in Ohio, allowing GM to ramp up production of even more EVs. US battery production could also prove fruitful to the automaker and consumers alike, as GM can sell its customers on federal tax credits for certain US-built EVs based on new terms signed under the recent Inflation Reduction Act.
GM will need all the production capacity it can get to catch up with Tesla, who delivered nearly 255,000 EVs in Q2 of 2022 alone. For comparison, GM delivered about 7,200 EVs in Q2. Still, Barra doesn’t seem to be flinching. During the interview, the GM CEO reiterated confidence that the company can pass Tesla in EV production, without providing a specific timeline yet. In the past, Barra has said by 2025, but that might have changed.
It may not happen by 2025, but it’s certainly still possible. By introducing all-electric versions of the Chevy Silverado, Blazer SUV, and Equinox compact SUV, GM is throwing three ponies into the race that already have street cred thanks to their gasoline-powered predecessors. 
If a fraction of combustion-GM drivers transition to the electric versions, the demand will be deafening. Furthermore, if GM can in fact pivot its production infrastructure to meet that demand, well, we may witness one helluva battle against Tesla. 
Let’s not forget about Ford either! The next five years of American EV production are going to be a sight to see.
GM is pouring billions of dollars into its current facilities to embrace electrification and surpass Tesla, but what about a competition where the American automaker has had less of a head start in terms of infrastructure?
Unlike her comments on EV production, Mary Barra has not come right out and said GM wants to beat Tesla in self-driving tech, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true. The team at GM subsidiary Cruise has been operating fully-driverless rides in San Francisco since fall of 2021, logging tens of thousands of miles across several hundred trips. Barra spoke to the company’s progress:
I’m really impressed and pleased with the progress Cruise has made under Kyle Vogt’s (CEO) leadership from the technology being ready. You know, I think a couple years ago, everybody thought they’ll be autonomous vehicles everywhere, know they think it’s years away. It’s not. It’s here right now.
Barra would go on to to discuss how she believes autonomous vehicles like the GM vehicles used by Cruise are the future of how people get around due to their advanced safety and lack of human error – a factor Barra states accounts for 90% of all automobile accidents.
On the flip side, autonomous vehicles are consistently dragged through the muck by the media for their occasional accidents. Tesla itself has been consistently clouded in controversy surrounding its full-self driving technology. One, because CEO Elon Musk could be hired by an NFL team based on the number of times he’s punted the arrival date of Level 4, fully-autonomous driving.
But the automaker has also faced class action lawsuits on top of unfair smear campaigns that not only lack credibility but do a lot more harm to proper EV education than many realize. Telling your beta testers not to complain about your software doesn’t help either, though. 
We’re not here to say GM will overtake Tesla in EV production and/or self-driving technology. However, we do want to point out that the former is gaining momentum and has the money to back up its bold words. Tesla’s no spring chicken in the EV world either and will certainly not go down without a fight.
No matter who eventually takes the production throne, we as consumers should end up the true winners, as we will get to experience much of the innovation this healthy competition will birth.

2022/08/30,"Tesla shared some rare and stunning images of its internal vehicle testing; this time, for extreme heat and durability testing in Dubai.
Since it has dissolved its PR department, Tesla has only rarely shared images of its internal testing.
The automaker has a proving-ground facility in Alaska for cold weather testing.
Now we learn that for extreme heat and durability testing, Tesla is bringing its vehicles to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
Tesla announced on Instagram:
Our field quality engineers head to Dubai at the hottest time of the year for extreme heat and durability testing. Temperatures reach over 122°F/50°C.
The automaker appears to have brought its full lineup of electric vehicles for testing:
A post shared by Tesla (@teslamotors)
Tesla killed two birds with one stone with this trip as it both tested for extreme heat and also got some great shots to use in its marketing:
Tesla appears to have primarily brought Model Y vehicles, but the automaker also appears to have brought a few Model X and Model 3s to Dubai based on the pictures.
The automaker has recently made several updates to its vehicles that likely warrant new testing for durability, including the refreshed Model X, Model 3 with new LFP cells, and several new versions of the Model Y.
Durability testing generally entails pushing vehicles past their limits to see if they can handle extreme conditions and to find potential improvements.
For Tesla, the testing can also help improve things like range predictions using external factors such as temperature readings and elevation. Recently, we reported on Tesla putting a lot of effort on range calculation by including new factors like “crosswind, headwind, humidity, and ambient temperature” and more recently, it even added things like tire pressure and phone charging.
The climate and terrain in Dubai would offer some prime grounds for some of those tests.

2022/08/30,"Tesla is facing a new proposed class-action lawsuit over the phantom braking problem that has been plaguing Autopilot for years now.
Back in November of 2021, Electrek released a report called “Tesla has a serious phantom braking problem in Autopilot.” It highlighted a significant increase in Tesla owners reporting dangerous phantom braking events on Autopilot.
Phantom braking is a term used to describe when an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) – or a self-driving system – applies the brakes for no good reason. The system can be falsely detecting an object on the road or anticipating a collision that won’t actually happen and apply the brake to try to avoid it.
Obviously, phantom braking is something you want to avoid since it can create accidents if someone is following too closely behind you.
This issue is not new in Tesla’s Autopilot, but our report focused on Tesla drivers noticing an obvious increase in instances based on anecdotal evidence, but it was also backed by a clear increase in complaints to the NHTSA. Our report made the rounds in a few other outlets, but the issue didn’t really go mainstream until The Washington Post released a similar report in February 2022. A few months later, NHTSA opened an investigation into the matter.
Now Tesla is facing pressure regarding the phantom braking issue from another front as a Tesla owner in California has filed for a class-action lawsuit.
Reuters reports:
A California owner of a Tesla Model 3 sued the electric vehicle maker in a proposed class action over cars suddenly stopping for non-existent obstacles, calling it a “frightening and dangerous nightmare,” according to the lawsuit.
Jose Alvarez Toledo, a Model 3 owner in San Francisco, filed the lawsuit, which is seeking to represent all Tesla owners with Autopilot, in federal court in the northern district of California.
The lawsuit reads:
When the sudden unintended braking defect occurs, they turn what is supposed to be a safety feature into a frightening and dangerous nightmare.
The lawsuit is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for expenses to repair vehicles, diminished value of Tesla cars, and a refund of the added cost attributed to the Autopilot features.
It’s not the first time that Tesla owners have turned to a class action to make the company pay for mishandling features inside their vehicles. Last year, Tesla agreed to pay owners $625 each over battery throttling after a class-action lawsuit.

2022/08/30,"Tesla has so many projects going on at the same time that i is often easy for one to be forgotten – like the fact that it is currently building a big battery cathode material factory in Texas.
A new drone flyover shows that the building is coming together.
Things move quickly in Texas.
It was only back in February 2022 that we learned that Tesla applied for building permits on a new project called ‘Project Cathode’ next to Gigafactory Texas in Austin.
Now a drone flyover of the Gigafactory Texas campus shows that the building that is going to house Tesla’s battery cathode factory is already coming together.
Joe Tegtmeyer, who regularly flies drones over Gigafactory Texas, flew over the new ‘Project Cathode’ building that is rising fast:
Obviously, it is not as big as the main Gigafactory Texas building, which is one of the biggest in the world, but it is quite a large building on 3 stories for its sole purpose of producing cathode battery material:
 Tesla originally announced plans to build its own “cathode facility” during its “Battery Day” presentation in 2020.
Drew Baglino, Senior Vice President of Engineering, said at the time:
We’re gonna go and start building our own cathode facility in North America and leveraging all of the North American resources that exist for nickel and lithium, and just doing that, just localizing our cathode supply chain and production, we can reduce miles traveled by all the materials that end up in the cathode by 80%.
At Battery Day, Tesla unveiled a new cathode chemistry that allows for a much more simple and cheaper production.
It was later revealed that Tesla acquired the technology from a Canadian startup.
In an update on its progress in producing its new 4680 battery cell last month, Te
Tesla has since made moves to also secure lithium and nickel supply from North American sources, including deals with Piedmont Lithium and Talon Metals.
With the reform of the tax credit including new eligibility criteria that include both sourcing battery minerals and components in North America or in countries with free trade agreements with the US, Tesla would be in a great position by sourcing the minerals from those companies and producing its cathode at this new factory in Texas.
The new facility makes more sense from a logistic standpoint since the cathode material will then go into battery cells produced next door, but it will also likely secure significant incentives for Tesla buyers.
While this is Tesla’s first cathode factory, the automaker is expected to invest in several more once it has managed to hone its new production process.
",tesla
2022/08/30,"Tesla has been spotted stacking an impressive number of structural battery packs in inventory at Gigafactory Texas. We look into what could be happening.
When Tesla started production of Model Y at Gigafactory Texas earlier this year, it launched a new architecture for the electric SUV based on Tesla’s new structural battery pack design.
The design is enabled by Tesla’s new 4680 battery cell that can become a structural part of the battery pack, which in turn becomes part of the chassis of the vehicle.
CEO Elon Musk compared the design to planes using wings as fuel tanks.
The structural battery pack architecture is expected to bring efficiency and performance improvements to the Model Y.
However, Tesla has had difficulties ramping up the product at Gigafactory Texas.
In June, we reported that Tesla significantly managed to ramp up production at the factory, but it also coincided with the automaker starting to produce Model Y vehicles with the old battery architecture using 2170 cells.
This led many to believe that 4680 cells were a bottleneck for Tesla to ramp up production at Gigafactory Texas, which the automaker all but confirmed.
Now a new drone flyover of Gigafactory Texas by Joe Tegtmeyer showed that Tesla has been building up an inventory of structural battery packs:
Here are some images of what appear to be a few hundred structural battery packs being stacked up at the factory:
We can clearly see that they are structural packs because they used the same design that incorporates the seat base directly on the packs.
Now the question is why is Tesla accumulating structural battery packs?
The video also shows that there’s still a steady stream of Model Y vehicles coming out of the factory, but as previously mentioned, those might be equipped with 2270 cells.
Tesla is believed to still be getting a limited supply of 4680 battery cells from its pilot plant in Fremont as it is establishing production of the new cell at Gigafactory Texas.
The automaker could have received a shipment from Fremont, and it is waiting to shift back to vehicle production with the structural battery packs in Texas.
Tesla could also have found a problem with those packs, and it needs to be fixed before they can make their way into vehicle production.
Either way, at least it shows that Tesla is still working on ramping up structural pack production, which is believed to be needed to ramp Gigafactory Texas to full production as the Model Y with 2170 cells is just a temporary solution.

2022/08/29,"Tesla has unveiled a new virtual power plant using Powerwalls home battery pack, and this time, it’s on an island, Miyako-jima, in Japan.
We have seen Tesla putting a lot of effort into virtual power plants lately.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems, like Tesla Powerwalls, used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants.
Tesla launched one in California earlier this year, and it had its first emergency event earlier this month with great results.
Now the company is trying to deploy a virtual power plant in Texas, and of course, it also had one in operation for years in Australia that is still expanding.
But now we have learned that Tesla also quietly built a new virtual power plant in Japan, and it has now decided to unveil it.
The project is called “Miyakojima VPP” because it is located on the island of Miyako-jima, the most populous island in the Okinawa Prefecture.
Tesla announced that it started to install Powerwalls in partnership with the local electric utility in 2021, and it now has over 300 Powerwalls on the island as part of the VPP (translated from Japanese):
In Miyakojima, Okinawa Prefecture, the virtual power plant (VPP) project (hereinafter referred to as this project) using Tesla home storage battery Powerwall started in 2021, and the number of units installed on the island has exceeded 300. This is the first commercial use of Powerwall for a VPP project in Japan, and it will be the largest commercial VPP using household storage batteries in Japan.
Local homeowners get incentives from the local utility, Miyakojima Mirai Energy Co., to install the Powerwall and solar power in their homes, which the utility can use as part of the Tesla VPP.
Tesla explains that VPP is helping the island take better advantage of its renewable energy, but it is also proving more grid resilience, especially in the case of a natural disaster:
As a result, for example, when power supply and demand are tight on Miyako Island, electricity generated by photovoltaic power generation is stored in Powerwall before the tight time period and discharged from Powerwall to the home during the tight time period. It contributes not only to the households where the is installed, but also to the stabilization of Miyako Island’s grid power supply, and stabilizes the power supply on the island. In addition, in the event of a power outage due to a typhoon, etc., power will be supplied from the Powerwall to the installed home, making it possible to prevent power outages in the home.
The Miyakojima VPP is still growing, and Tesla expects that it will include 400 Powerwalls by the end of this year and 600 Powerwalls by the end of 2023.
In 2024, Tesla expects to start installing Powerwalls for similar projects throughout the Okinawa Prefecture.

2022/08/26,"Tesla is going into a hiring spree for motor and actuator designers and engineers for its humanoid Optimus robot program. The automaker is actually hiring more for the robot program than for its electric vehicles.
CEO Elon Musk has made it clear that Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot program, has become a priority for the automaker’s development teams. This level of priority is starting to be reflected in Tesla’s hiring effort.
Tesla planned on leveraging some of its existing expertise to build the robot. Musk claims that Tesla’s vehicles are already “robots on wheels,” and that a lot of the technology will transfer well.
After all, Tesla’s humanoid robot will be powered by batteries, electric motors, actuators, and power electronics – just like Tesla vehicles.
But even with technologies that Tesla is already familiar with, there are going to be new products to be developed. For example, Tesla has a ton of electric motor (rotation) and actuator (linear) experience, but it will have to develop new ones that match the specs of the Tesla Optimus robot.
Konstantinos Laskaris, Tesla’s long-time lead electric motor designer, announced a new hiring spree for his motor team for the humanoid robot program. He wrote:
The ability to simultaneously optimize designs for performance, efficiency, cost, and manufacturability is what makes Tesla the leader in Electric Motor Technology. Developing a HUMANOID ROBOT requires pushing the technology boundaries even further, bringing us new challenges. Finding talented and passionate people to join our growing team is fundamental.
Tesla added nine new jobs for the program – mostly in Palo Alto, but also one in Athens, Greece, where Laskaris is from and where Tesla operates an electric motor research division:
That’s one more job opening related to motors and actuators than Tesla has for the same department related to its vehicles. Tesla is expected to unveil the first working prototype of Tesla Optimus on September 30th at its AI Day 2.
As Laskaris pointed out, these new hires would be working on optimizing the early designs to be unveiled next month to achieve more efficient and cost-effective products to manufacture.
Musk has previously said that Tesla was aiming to bring the robot to production as soon as 2023.

2022/08/26,"Tesla has launched the Model Y Rear-Wheel-Drive Standard Range in Europe, and it is surprisingly cheap.
It looks like Tesla has decided to bring the elusive Model Y Standard Range with rear-wheel drive to Europe.
Today, in an update to its online configurator, Tesla has made a new base version of the Model Y available for sale in many European markets.
The new version of the Model Y is listed as “Rear-Wheel-Drive” and features a WLTP range of 455 km (283 miles) compared to the already available Long Range’s 533 km (331 miles) range.
The top speed is the same at 217 km/h, but the 0-100 km/h is much slower at 6.9 seconds.
Where the vehicle really shines is with its price. For example, in the Netherlands, it starts at just €50,000 – €16,000 less than the Long Range version:
That includes VAT of approximately €8,850, and therefore, it starts at about €42,000, and the euro is currently about the same value as the US dollar.
If that vehicle were sold in the US, it would be about $20,000 cheaper than the current cheapest configuration of the Model Y in the US.
In some European markets, this new version of the Model Y is now cheaper than a base Model 3.
Tesla lists the new version of the Model Y in Europe as available from December 2022–February 2023.
The automaker doesn’t specify if the new Model Y Standard Range is built at Tesla Gigafactory Berlin, where Tesla launched Model Y production earlier this year, or if it is being imported from Gigafactory Shanghai, like most Tesla vehicles being sold in Europe right now.
The latter is more likely, but there have also been interesting rumors lately about Tesla getting new LFP battery cells from BYD at Gigafactory Berlin to produce a cheaper Model Y.
When it comes to the Model Y, Tesla has been stingier with trims and options.
The automaker has primarily only made two versions available: Model Y Long Range and Model Y Performance, which basically have the same powertrain with more performance unlocked in the “Performance” version as well as a few different options.
In North America, Tesla briefly introduced in 2021 a Model Y Standard Range, which had a rear-wheel-drive powertrain and shorter range than the two other versions.
The launch was surprising considering CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla won’t produce the version of the Model Y because he said that the range would be “unacceptably low” at less than 250 miles (402 km).
The Model Y Standard Range had an EPA-rated range of 244 miles (393 km) and a starting price of $42,000.
Then a few weeks after launching it, Tesla stopped taking orders for the model and came back to just two versions of the Model Y in North America.
A few months later, Tesla launched a Model Y Standard Range in China. This one is still available for sale, and it is one of Tesla’s most popular vehicles in the market. It is produced at Tesla’s Gigafactory Shanghai.

2022/08/26,"Panasonic just announced that it is building a $4 billion battery cell factory in Kansas to supply Tesla, but we now learn that the Japanese company is considering greenlighting another large-scale US battery cell factory to build simultaneously.
Before choosing Kansas for its new battery cell factory in the US last month, Panasonic was choosing between Oklahoma and Kansas.
The company ended up going with Kansas for a large-scale battery cell factory, its second in the US after its part in Tesla’s Gigafactory Nevada where it exclusively produces battery cells for Tesla vehicles.
Panasonic plans to manufacture new 4680 cells for Tesla at the new Kansas plant.
Now the Wall Street Journal reports that Panasonic’s plan for a battery cell factory in Oklahoma is not dead because it is moving forward with Kansas. The report states that the Japanese manufacturer is actually considering also building a plant in Oklahoma simultaneously:
The new Panasonic plant would come in addition to a roughly $4 billion EV battery factory that the Japanese company said in July it plans to build in Kansas. People with knowledge of Panasonic’s plans described the two plants as twins with similar capacity.
While this would be a big investment for Panasonic, it wouldn’t actually be out of the norm.
LG Energy and SK Innovation, both competitors of Panasonic, have both announced plans for multiple battery cell factories in the US in partnership with GM and Ford respectively.
Panasonic supplies cells to multiple electric automakers, but it is obviously closer to Tesla who has made it clear that it will buy every viable battery cell it can get its hands on for the foreseeable future.
If you believe Tesla, it wouldn’t be a bad business model to ramp up production as fast as you can with as many factories as you can. Also, both Kansas and Oklahoma are strategically located relatively close to Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas where most of the company’s growth in production capacity is going to come from in North America for the next few years.
The Oklahoma state government has already approved an incentive package worth over $600 million for battery cell factory, but it’s not clear when Panasonic will make a final decision.

2022/08/25,"At a joint event between SpaceX and T-Mobile, the two companies announced that they will be launching a direct-to-phone connection with Starlink Gen 2 satellites. Elon Musk took to Twitter soon after to confirm that this same connection will allow direct connections with Tesla vehicles.
SpaceX’s announcement with T-Mobile saw the companies announce that SpaceX will use a portion of T-Mobile’s existing 5G spectrum, the “mid-band PCS,” to allow updated Starlink satellites to connect directly to cellphones.
This connection will be limited – at only 2-4 megabits per cell area – but it will be enough to allow T-Mobile customers on their standard plans to send text messages or make phone calls even in some of the most remote areas of the globe. Musk said this speed is enough to support one or two thousand phone calls per cell area. This won’t support massive amounts of data, but it is more than enough to reach out via phone call or send text messages if you are truly in need of communication. 
Because the satellites will use an existing spectrum, this means that existing cellphones will be able to connect through the service.
As new hardware will not be necessary on the consumer’s end, this led several people to ask whether Tesla vehicles will utilize their cellular connections to make emergency calls and texts.
Musk responded simply, “Yes.”
Yes
Another user asked if Tesla vehicles would gain the service in addition to Premium Connectivity, to which Musk also replied, “Yes,” so it’s not clear whether or not, when this service becomes available, it will require the customer to pay for Premium Connectivity.
T-Mobile plans to include this “Coverage Above and Beyond” with many of their existing plans for no extra cost, so seeing an important – and potentially life-saving – feature made available standard with Tesla vehicles would be a great move.
It will be some time until phones and Tesla vehicles will gain this capability though, as SpaceX’s much larger Gen 2 Starlink satellites will be the ones with the additional antennas to support cellular connections. Those will be launching on SpaceX’s Starship rocket in 2023 – with service expected to begin in late 2023. We know how Elon can be optimistic with his timelines, so this could be delayed as SpaceX works to deploy the satellites.

2022/08/25,"Tesla has sent a cease and desist to billionaire Dan O’Dowd’s Dawn Project, which is currently running a smear campaign against Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta.
Earlier this year, we reported on Dan O’Dowd, a self-described billionaire and founder of Green Hills Software, a privately-owned company that makes operating systems and programming tools.
O’Dowd had launched a Senate campaign in his home state of California, but the tech executive made it quite clear that he is making it a single-issue campaign, and that issue is Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program.
Under the protection of political ads, he invested several million dollars in an ad campaign to attack Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta program with the goal of having it banned from public roads in the US.
Even though O’Dowd has lost his senate effort, the campaign continues under the name “The Dawn Project” and continues to attack Tesla.
Earlier this month, the campaign launched a new ad called “The Dangers of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Software,” in which they showed footage of an in-house test showing a Tesla Model 3 on FSD Beta hitting a child dummy.
The next day, Electrek posted a report that poked major holes in the ad, and the report that the Dawn Project released at the same time supposedly includes the methodology of the tests behind the ad.
We highlighted the fact that the actual ad never showed them activating FSD Beta and instead, it shows the driver attempting to activate it and failing.
There’s also a warning alert that appears on the screen of the Tesla throughout the ad and on additional footage released by The Dawn Project. The resolution of the video is conveniently too low to read, and The Dawn Project refused to explain the alert after a request for comment.
We also pointed out inconsistencies between the test results and the additional footage that The Dawn Project release of its tests where we can see that FSD Beta was activated, but that footage somehow didn’t make the ad.
The Dawn Project and O’Dowd personally refused to answer our questions about those significant inconsistencies. Instead, O’Dowd took to Twitter to claim that I “fabricated” my story that pointed inconsistencies in their own tests:
Dan, you need to stop claiming that I fabricated the story and answer the questions instead. I gave you and your PR team many opportunities to answer really simple questions both prior and after the article was released. Why aren't you answering them: pic.twitter.com/R43ewpFAOI
He even called me or anyone questioning his test a “moron”:
Dan, you’re willingness to call anyone pointing inconsistencies with your FSD Beta test a moron is only equal to your unwillingness to answer questions about those inconsistencies. Despite you cowardly insulting me online, I’m still willing to TALK to you about your test.
Now we learn that Tesla sent a cease and desist letter to The Dawn Project and O’Dowd personally.
In the letter, Dinna Eskin, Esq., Sr. Director and Deputy General Counsel at Tesla, eviscerates O’Dowd for “disseminating defamatory information to the public regarding the capabilities of Tesla’s Full Self Driving (FSD) (Beta) technology.”
She asks him to take down the video and pull the ads based on it, which are running nationally, along with a few other things:
The letter includes vague threats of legal actions if he chooses not to comply. O’Dowd already confirmed he doesn’t plan to comply.
In the letter, Tesla references our report on the ad:
In contrast, your testing and methodology have already received swift and public rebukes from multiple sources. For example, the commercial you released claims that the tests shown were performed with Tesla’s FSD Beta engaged. But Electrek reported that your our own videos clearly show that FSD Beta was not engaged at times. Similarly, Electrek reports that The Dawn Project manipulated its video after being confronted with the defamatory nature of its advertisement. Despite your clear knowledge of the misleading nature of the advertisements, you continue to promote and disseminate these advertisements on multiple mediums.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk also retweeted our article even though he still technically blocks both myself and the Electrek account on Twitter:
I appreciate the RT @elonmusk, but I and @ElectrekCo are still blocked for some reason. How about unblocking? pic.twitter.com/m0rRK7tJkK
O’Dowd called Musk a “coward” for sending his lawyers after him.
Musk has recently announced that Tesla is building a “hardcore litigation department” with the goal of fighting back against people attacking the company.

2022/08/25,"Tesla’s former head of energy products has launched a new startup to compete against Powerwall with a new home battery pack, and it managed to secure significant funding from key partners.
Kunal Girotra, a chemical engineer, spent five years at Tesla. During his tenure, he led energy products, including Powerwall, solar panels, and solar roofs before being promoted to head of Tesla Energy in 2018 – a role he held until he left the company in 2020.
After leaving Tesla, Girotra funded Lunar Energy, a new startup with the mission to “electrify the home and provide energy independence to homeowners worldwide.”
Lunar Energy came out of stealth mode yesterday with a press release announcing its first product and $300 million in funding from Sunrun and South Korea’s SK Group.
Girotra also confirmed that Lunar’s first product is going to be a home battery system without revealing more about it:
More than ever, we need rapid adoption of renewable energy solutions across all sectors to mitigate climate change. Lunar Energy was founded to build affordable hardware and software products for the residential sector to help homeowners generate, store and consume 100% clean energy and remove the usage of fossil fuels from every home. The first offering of our product ecosystem is a next-generation home battery system. It’s the first step towards our mission to electrify all homes and connect communities to form clean, resilient virtual power plants—freeing us from power outages, rising energy costs and harmful emissions.
It sounds like it will be competing against Tesla’s Powerwall, a product that Girotra was leading and that has been dominating the residential home battery space.
Lunar is also going to have strong partners in Sunrun and SK to deliver the product.
Sunrun is the largest residential solar installer in the US, and it has been installing home battery packs with its system. Interestingly, it parntnered with Tesla to install Powerwalls back in 2020, but we heard that Sunrun was having issues getting supply from Tesla, which has been focusing on supplying Powerwalls directly to its own customers.
Lynn Jurich, chair of Lunar Energy and cofounder and co-executive chair of Sunrun, commented on the new partnership:
As an entrepreneur, I’m always looking for those rare opportunities where you can invest in exceptional people with a big vision. Kunal, and the engineering team at Lunar Energy, are building at scale home electrification products that will dramatically accelerate the switch from fossil fuels to renewables. I’m excited to see Sunrun, and the industry at large, begin offering Lunar Energy solutions to millions of homes across the nation.
As for SK, the company is a large supplier of battery cells, which could obviously find their ways into Lunar products.
Along with these three announcements to come out of stealth mode, Lunar also announced that it acquired Moixa, a software company for distributed energy resources (DER) management:
In acquiring UK-based software leader Moixa, Lunar will combine revolutionary new hardware with the proven GridShare™ software that manages the thousands of batteries across Europe and Japan. Currently, GridShare software—now Lunar Gridshare™—is deployed at scale across 35,000 homes (330MWh of batteries) via ITOCHU in Japan, supports advanced smart charging services for Honda electric vehicles, and facilitated UPS’s transition to electric vehicle fleets in the UK.
With all of these pieces together, Lunar Energy putting a smart energy puzzle together.
But for now, it looks like Lunar is mostly coming out of stealth mode as part of a recruiting effort since it is not ready to announce the details of its first consumer product just yet.

2022/08/24,"Tesla’s (TSLA) stock has now officially split 3-for-1 after closing at $891 per share yesterday, which means it should start trading at around $297 per share this morning.
But now it already got its first price target update post-split at $360 a share.
Tesla’s stock is an important indicator of the move to electrification since Tesla is the largest automaker only selling electric vehicles by a wide margin.
The rise in its stock price has also encouraged other automakers to accelerate their electric vehicle plans since it made it clear that investors were looking for aggressive electrification.
Now Tesla’s stock price rising has led to the automaker going for another stock split – it’s second in two years.
Tesla shareholders approved the 3-for-1 stock split earlier this month and it comes into effect today.
The shareholders will receive two additional stock dividends for every share they own, and the stock price will start trading this morning for one-third of the price it closed yesterday, which was $891 a share.
That should result in Tesla’s stock (TSLA) trading for about $297 when the markets open this morning.
It wasn’t long for Wall Street to adjust to the stock split with the first new price target.
Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush and one of the top Wall Street analysts covering Tesla (ranked #557 out of 8,009 analysts on TipRanks), announced that he is increasing his price target on Tesla from $333 a share post-stock split to $360 a share.
He noted “improved production” out of Gigafactory Shanghai as one of the main reasons for the increase:
We are adjusting our pre-split $1,000 price target ($333 post split) to $360 reflecting the 3:1 split as well as improved production from Tesla out of its key China Giga factory during the September quarter with clear momentum heading into year-end.  Maintain Outperform rating.
In a note to clients, Ives wrote that he believes Tesla can deliver 2 million electric vehicles in 2023, which should put the automaker in a favorable position against increased competition in the EV space:
For 2023 we believe 2 million deliveries potential and massive production capacity will be a significant advantage for Tesla in this EV arms race with competition coming from every angle and geography.
That estimate is actually on the lower side since Tesla has been guiding that it will enter 2023 with a production capacity of 2 million vehicles per year. With increase production capacity at Gigafactory Berlin and Texas, Tesla could deliver significantly more than 2 million vehicles in 2023.

2022/08/24,"Elon Musk has told an early Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta tester not to complain about the new FSD Beta update. Isn’t that kind of their job? A job that not only they are not paid for, but that they are paying Tesla for the privilege of doing?
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it. The company now has around 100,000 owners in the program, and with more people in it, it is expected to have more data to train its neural nets.
But those beta testers are also providing feedback for Tesla to directly improve on its system. In the latest update, the automaker even took direct feedback to attempt a specific left turn that an early tester has been attempting with FSD Beta.
With the latest update (10.69), Tesla is only slowly rolling out the update to some of the early beta testers. CEO Elon Musk said it was out of extra caution due to several important code changes.
One of those early beta testers took to Twitter to complain about FSD Beta still needing “lots of work on basic control” after the latest update, and Musk responded by asking him not to complain:
10.69 is in limited release for a reason. Please do not ask to be included in early beta releases and then complain.
The comment from the CEO comes even though Tesla is not only getting free feedback from those beta testers, but it is actually charging them up to $12,000 for the “privilege” of testing FSD Beta – soon $15,000. 
The beta tester even ended up apologizing to Musk for his comment.
I think this behavior is an example of Musk’s feedback loop being broken on Twitter because of the superfans feeding him pure adulation. Locke’s comment was completely reasonable, and Musk should encourage – not discourage – such feedback.
All he was saying is that he didn’t understand the focus on a complex left turn, when there are some basic controls that FSD beta seems to still be missing. I completely understand that as I experienced some basic control issues in my most recent Tesla FSD Beta test.
That’s valuable feedback from someone who has been using FSD Beta for over a year. Take it or leave it, but don’t discourage others from doing the same. Many influential Tesla FSD Beta testers are giant fans of Musk and interact with him through Twitter. They will be discouraged from posting negative feedback like that if Musk sees it as them “complaining.”

2022/08/24,"Chinese EV battery maker CATL continues its reign as the world’s largest battery manufacturer after posting robust growth in its Q2 earnings. 
As the transition to electric vehicles in the auto industry gains momentum, the need to lock up critical EV battery materials is becoming evident. 
Automakers are scrambling to lock up deals with EV battery makers to ensure they have the raw materials to ramp production and hit their electric vehicles targets. For example, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz yesterday announced deals to source minerals from Canada. 
Meanwhile, CATL is a critical supplier for leading EV makers like Tesla, BMW, and Volkswagen, to name a few. The battery supplier has now ranked number 1 in EV battery usage for the fifth straight year. 
Despite concerns over economic growth in China, CATL’s earnings continue surging. Lockdowns in China due to Covid caused significant supply chain issues as factories and plants were shut down. 
EV makers in China are feeling the pressure this year as a result. For example, XPeng, a leading EV producer in China, reported 7,000 less deliveries in the second quarter than its peak of 41,751 in Q4 2021. 
CATL is overcoming these issues with major EV partnerships and a dominant share of the growing EV battery market. The battery manufacturer helped Tesla scale production at Gigafactory Shanghai to become the most prominent global EV factory.
The success is fueling CATL’s growth outside of China. The company first announced a $1.96 billion battery factory in Germany (to support german automakers ramping EV production), with an 8 GWh battery capacity annually. Then, earlier this month, the battery giant said it would invest $7.4 billion into a 100 GWh battery plant in Hungary, Europe’s largest.
The new investments may seem extreme, but as you will see from CATL’s Q2 earnings, the company is growing rapidly. Furthermore, more battery capacity will be needed to support the soaring demand for EVs. 
Even though global economic conditions are crumbling due to soaring inflation and geopolitical tension, EV sales continue picking up.
In China, EV sales rose 120% in the first half of 2022, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In fact, most automakers are seeing an uptick in EV sales this year. 
That being said, CATL continues controlling the EV battery market with 34.8% of the share in the first half of 2022, up from 28.6% last year. South Korean LG Energy Solution, which also supplies major EV makers like Tesla, GM, and Ford, earned second. 
However, CATL seems to be weathering the storm better than its counterpart. For one thing, CATL’s revenue rose a massive 158% in Q2 from last year, reaching 64.29 billion yuan (about $9.36 billion).
CATL did feel some pressure on margins as battery metal prices remain elevated. Lithium prices are up 343% in the past year and look to be approaching record highs. Despite this, CATL’s net profit grew 164%, reaching over $974 million in its Q2 earnings, according to Reuters.
To help combat rising battery costs across the industry, CATL says it has entered into long-term contracts with suppliers, which will help ease costs. CATL also mentions in its Q2 earnings that it signed agreements with Ford and other automakers in the US as the new Inflation Reduction Act is likely to drive demand for EVs with new tax incentives.
There’s no denying the need for EV batteries is critical; automakers are looking to ramp EV production, batteries, and the materials to make them as they are becoming increasingly scarce. 
Battery manufacturers like CATL and LG are working to increase supply to ensure the EV rollout is successful. The largest EV battery maker in the world continues getting bigger, as its Q2 earnings show.
It’s no surprise to see CATL’s sales soar as EV makers look to lock up deals for batteries – but what is surprising is how well the company is handling the macroeconomic changes. 
Despite growth concerns in its primary market, the battery manufacturer is expanding into nearly every region, which will help cushion the impacts.

2022/08/24,"Tesla has released two new deep-dive presentations into its Dojo AI supercomputer ahead of its upcoming AI Day 2.
You can check the slides from both presentations below.
Dojo is Tesla’s own custom supercomputer platform built from the ground up for AI machine learning and more specifically for video training using the video data coming from its fleet of vehicles.
The automaker already has a large NVIDIA GPU-based supercomputer that is one of the most powerful in the world, but the new Dojo custom-built computer is using chips designed by Tesla.
The custom-built supercomputer is expected to elevate Tesla’s capacity to train neural nets using video data, which is critical to its computer vision technology powering its self-driving effort. 
Last year, at Tesla’s AI Day, the company unveiled its Dojo supercomputer, but the company was still ramping up its effort at the time. It only had its first chip and training tiles, and it was still working on building a full Dojo cluster or “Exapod.”
Tesla’s AI Day 2 is coming up on September 30, and the automaker is expected to give an update on its Dojo program, but it has now given an update ahead of the event. 
Tesla’s Dojo team gave two presentations at the Hot Chip event this week that are likely to preview some of what the company will discuss next month at AI Day. 
Serve The Home shared the slides from the two presentations, which you can see below. The info is quite “inside baseball” on the system architecture side and requires some technical knowledge to appreciate, but I thought it would be worth sharing here for those who can appreciate it.
I would assume that the main goal of those presentations is to recruit engineers for the Dojo program, and we might get a version more palatable to a wider audience next month at Tesla AI Day 2.

2022/08/23,"Tesla has started pushing a new software update to its fleet with several new features, including the promised cloud-based driver profiles and a bunch of goodies to make your Tesla experience a bit better.
This week, Tesla has started the wider release of its latest software update (2022.24) through 2022.24.5.
The update comes with new features and previously released features that are now making it to more vehicles in Tesla’s fleet of now over 3 million cars.
One of the biggest new features is the introduction of “Tesla Profiles” – the integration of cloud profiles promised by Elon Musk last year.
The feature aims at making it easier to keep your preferred driver settings across multiple vehicles, including when renting a Tesla vehicle, which is becoming increasingly popular through the recent deal with Hertz.
Tesla describes the new “Tesla Profiles” in the release notes of 2022.24.5 (via Not A Tesla App):
Keep your settings and preferences synchronized across all supported vehicles using your Tesla account, including:
– Mirror, seating and steering wheel adjustments
– Autopilot, driving and climate control preferences
– Navigation, media and data sharing preferences
You can set up your Tesla Profile from Driver Profile settings and change your profile picture from the Tesla Mobile app.
The software update also brings the ability to reposition the blind spot camera feed to different positions on the display to more vehicles.
Here’s what Tesla writes about the feature in the release notes:
Adjust the placement of your blind spot camera on your display by dragging the camera feed. The camera feed will appear in the same position when your blinker is active. To enable, tap Controls > Autopilot > Automatic Blind Spot Camera.
For owners with premium connectivity, Tesla is also slightly updating how it shows slower traffic conditions along your navigation route by now making the different colors part of the route line on the map instead of along it.
In the update, Tesla is also adding the ability to disable sounds on Sentry Mode:
To prevent disturbing neighbors, you can now disable the sounds made by Sentry Mode. Mobile app notifications will still be delivered. To enable this setting on the touchscreen, tap Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode > Disable Sentry Sounds.
The new update also brings to more vehicles the new driving behavior that includes automatically applying regular brakes when regenerative is limited. This is something that Tesla started rolling out earlier this year, but it is still making it to more vehicles through new updates.
The new 2022.24.5 also includes a few small changes that are not documented in the release notes, like the ability to uninstall video games on the Tesla computer to free up space for others and timestamps on tire pressure readings.

2022/08/23,"A former Tesla engineer who the company accused of stealing Dojo supercomputer secrets is now in a bizarre situation where he can’t defend himself as Tesla moves the case to arbitration.
Tesla has a clause in its employment contract that requires employees to settle workplace disputes by arbitration, an out-of-court method that relies on third-party decision-makers instead of courts.
The automaker has been known to aggressively sue employees, especially over handling of confidential information, like trade secrets, and then move to private arbitration – hiding the matter.
Shareholders have proposed to remove the arbitration clause for three years in a row at Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting, including earlier this month, but it was voted down by shareholders. 
Now we get a clear example of the practice.
In May, we reported on Tesla filling a lawsuit against Alexander Yatskov, a recently hired engineer who Tesla claims stole trade secrets related to its Dojo supercomputer project.
Yatskov was hired as a thermal engineer, though Tesla claimed that he lied about his qualifications, and he was assigned to the Dojo project to work on a cooling system.
Project Dojo is a new supercomputer that Tesla is developing to help train its neural nets, which are primarily used in its self-driving effort.
Tesla claims that quickly after starting the job, Yatskov started downloading “confidential and tightly guarded” information related to the Dojo supercomputer project to his personal computer.
In the lawsuit, the company claims that Yatskov admitted to stealing the information when confronted about it. He was placed on administrative leave starting April 6, 2022, and asked to bring Tesla his personal laptop to recover the allegedly stolen information.
Tesla claims that the engineer brought the company a “dummy laptop” that was set up to make it look like he only accessed “inoffensive Tesla information, like an offer letter” and not trade secrets related to Dojo.
Yatskov ended up resigning from Tesla on May 2.
The engineer has maintained his innocence and now complains that Tesla is pushing to move the dispute to arbitration, which will result in him not being able to defend himself in court (via Bloomberg):
A former Tesla Inc. engineer said it was “humiliating” to be sued in open court for allegedly stealing trade secrets, only to be steered by the company into closed-door arbitration where he can’t defend himself publicly.
Yatskov’s lawyers wrote in a filing:
Now that Tesla has dragged Dr. Yatskov’s name through the mud, Tesla wants to hide this dispute in private arbitration.
Originally, Tesla was seeking “compensatory and exemplary damages and an order that would stop Yatskov from disseminating its trade secrets and direct him to return all proprietary data.”
But now according to the new report, Tesla is only seeking to recover the cost of its investigation.
The judge asked if Yatskov wanted his job back:
At the end of the day, maybe it’s just money. I mean, he doesn’t want his job back, does he?
His lawyer confirmed that he doesn’t.
It’s not the first time that Tesla is suing former employees over alleged stolen information.
Tesla is currently suing Rivian and former employees hired by the EV startup over allegedly stealing information related to its “next-gen battery.”
Previously, the company also sued a former employee who went to work at Xpeng after Tesla claimed that the engineer stole the Autopilot source code.
Finally, Tesla also won a lawsuit against self-driving startup Zoox for the theft of some proprietary information related to its logistics systems.

2022/08/22,"Green Mountain Power (GMP), a Vermont electric utility, has quietly built a fleet of 4,000 Tesla Powerwalls, and it is saving them a lot of money.
GMP has been one of Tesla’s best partners when it comes to deploying Powerwalls, Tesla’s home battery pack, in a decentralized way with electric utilities. The relatively small electric utility operating in Vermont was one of the earliest adopters of Tesla Powerwall.
It has been leading the deployment of Tesla Powerwalls with 2,000 units as of 2018, and in 2020, it signed a deal to get up to 1,000 more Powerwalls from Tesla per year. As of last year, GMP said that it had more than 3,000 Powerwalls installed in homes on its network.
The electric utility offers strong incentives to either deploy Powewalls at customer’s homes or onboard existing Powerwalls in its grid program where GMP is allowed to use some power capacity of a customer’s batteries in exchange for credits on their electricity bill.
In 2020 alone, GMP disclosed that it saved over $3 million from its use of Tesla Powerwalls.
Now the company confirmed that it has deployed over 4,000 Tesla Powerwalls at customers’ homes across the state. GMP CECO Mari McClure said to local news WCAX:
The program has been running for a few years and McClure says they’re finding success. There are more than 4,000 Powerwalls in Vermont homes.
McClure also said that the fleet of home batteries saved more than $3 million again in 2021 and it is likely to be much more than that this year since it saved them nearly $1.5 million in one week this summer during a heat wave.
This is significant for a relatively small electric utility that serves approximately 270,000 residential and business customers in Vermont.
Tesla has recently been building its own virtual power plant (VPP) with Powerwall owners in California in partnership with much larger electric utilities, like PG&E and SCE, which both have millions of customers. Yet, during the VPP’s first discharge event last week, they had less than 3,000 Powerwall owners participating.
Therefore, Green Mountain Power’s Tesla Powerwall fleet is extremely impressive for its size.
But McClure said that they need to go faster, and more people have to get onboard. They are working with other electric utilities to deploy similar technology; GMP is also deploying new microgrids.
You can inquire about how to enroll in GMP’s Tesla Powerwall program here.
Last year, GMP also disclosed that it will be using Tesla’s Autobidder software to better take advantage of its increasing energy storage capacity. Autobidder is a real-time trading and control platform for energy assets, like Tesla’s Powerpacks, Powerwalls, and Megapacks, optimized through machine learning to better use and more directly monetize the assets.

2022/08/22,"Tesla claims Autopilot is currently preventing about 40 crashes per day just by correcting drivers pressing the wrong pedal, something that has led Tesla to be accused of sudden acceleration in the past.
Over the years, Tesla vehicles have often been accused of accelerating on their own, resulting in crashes. 
These events are called “sudden unintended acceleration,” which can be due to a defect or a driver’s mistake, more often than not from pressing the wrong pedal.
We reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that it is looking into claims that Tesla vehicles have a defect leading to “sudden unintended acceleration” after receiving a petition citing 127 claimed incidents.
As we stated at the time, several claims of sudden unintended acceleration involving Tesla vehicles have been made public over the years. The most publicized one involved a South Korean celebrity claiming his Model X accelerated on its own into his garage.
We have also seen plenty of Tesla vehicles slamming into buildings – most often in a parking situation – like pictured above.
However, in every case, Tesla claimed that the car’s log showed that it was a user mistake due to pedal misapplication, meaning that the driver pressed on the accelerator instead of the brakes.
In one case, Electrek was able to have Tesla’s log verified by a third party, and it supported the automaker’s claims that it showed the driver pressed on the accelerator.
Last year, NHTSA released findings from its investigation and determined that the incidents of sudden acceleration involving Tesla vehicles where drivers said that the vehicles were “accelerating by themselves” were due to user errors.
Following the NHTSA investigation, Tesla issued a statement claiming that there are no defects in its vehicles resulting in unintended acceleration, and that the petition with NHTSA was started by a TSLA short seller.
At the time, Tesla noted that it was using Autopilot to try to prevent those wrong pedal mistakes resulting in accidents:
Unique to Tesla, we also use the Autopilot sensor suite to help distinguish potential pedal misapplications and cut torque to mitigate or prevent accidents when we’re confident the driver’s input was unintentional.
The automaker is using its advanced driver assist (ADAS) technology to try to detect that even though the driver is pressing on the accelerator, they are likely doing it unintentionally and applying the brakes instead.
It is a difficult technology to implement since you generally don’t want to override driver input with ADAS technology.
But Tesla claims to have impressive success with it as Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla’s head of Autopilot software, recently revealing that “Autopilot prevents ~40 crashes per day where human drivers mistakenly press the accelerator at 100% instead of the brakes.”
He even shared an example:
These predictions are already used to prevent a lot of collisions. For e.g., Autopilot prevents ~40 crashes / day where human drivers mistakenly press the accelerator at 100% instead of the brakes. In the video Autopilot automatically brakes, saving this person's legs (7/12) pic.twitter.com/XtMssPT9cM
This is a good example of Tesla always getting blamed when there’s an accident where Autopilot is involved, but the automaker doesn’t get credit for all the crashes that it has avoided.
The comment and the example come from a talk that Elluswamy gave for the CVPR 2022 Workshop on Autonomous Driving in June, but it was just released on Youtube last week.
The talk goes into detail about Tesla Autopilot’s use of occupancy networks. It’s certainly more of an inside baseball talk, but it can be interesting to some:

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/08/22,"Tesla is dominating the charging experience satisfaction among EV owners, and it’s going to be a problem for charging network operators now that Supercharger is going public.
This is a problem that needs to be put in perspective since most electric car charging happens at home.
Therefore, public charging issues mainly affect only a small part of the EV-owning experience, but it is still a problem that needs to be addressed.
When going on a road trip or traveling longer distances, public fast-charging stations are essential, and unfortunately, there is a wide range of levels of satisfaction based on the charging station.
We recently reported on a study that found that more than a quarter of surveyed charging stations were nonfunctional. This is a real problem.
Now J.D. Power has released its new charging experience survey to compare the satisfaction level based on different brands of charging stations, and it had some interesting findings.
First off, satisfaction went down overall despite the availability of public charging stations increasing significantly over the last year, which is one of the biggest problems with charging networks to start with: availability.
It wrote in the report:
Despite that more public charging stations are in operation than ever before, customer satisfaction with public Level 2 charging declined from last year, dropping to 633 (on a 1,000-point scale) from 643 in 2021, while satisfaction with the speedier DC (direct current) fast charger segment remains flat at 674. This lack of progress points to the need for improvement as EVs gain wider consumer acceptance because the shortage of public charging availability is the number one reason vehicle shoppers reject EVs.
The report highlights that one of the biggest issues for satisfaction is that the charging points actually function:
Public charger operability and maintenance a key issue: Growth of the public charging infrastructure is making it easier for EV owners to find public charging stations. The index for ease of finding a location is 724 among users of DC fast chargers and 683 among users of Level 2 chargers. But the industry needs to do a better job of maintaining existing charging stations. The study finds that one out of every five respondents ended up not charging their vehicle during their visit. Of those who didn’t charge, 72% indicated that it was due to the station malfunctioning or being out of service.
When breaking down the scores by brand, Tesla and its Supercharger network dominate the survey, and the last point about maintenance and keeping the charging station going has to do with it since Tesla is known for having a very good operation time compared to its peers in the charging world:
Tesla Destination ranks highest among Level 2 charge point operators with a score of 680 and Tesla Supercharger ranks highest among DC fast chargers with a score of 739.
From the survey, it’s clear that Tesla is actually bringing the average up with being the only charging operator over the average score:
Right, this is not too much of a problem with those charging operators since they are not really competing with Tesla Supercharger as the network is only for Tesla owners in North America.
However, that’s about to change with Tesla opening the Supercharger network to non-Tesla EV owners by the end of the year.
Now it will be in direct competition with Electrify America, Chargepoint, EVgo, and others.
Hopefully, the competition will encourage their networks to increase customer satisfaction – especially by improving their uptime on their stations.

2022/08/21,"Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” software, which currently costs $12k, will get a $3k price hike to $15k on September 5 in North America, coinciding with the wide release of the 10.69.2 Beta update. The early release version has just started rolling out to beta testers, and results are coming in to give us a sense of whether this update is worth the price increase.
The new update started rolling out to  about 1,000 testers this weekend, and patch notes have been posted online. The notes look similar to the leaked 10.13 release notes we saw last month, with improvements to left turns, animal and pedestrian detection, and better “creep” behavior.
It has been called a “major code change” and a “big step forward” by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who announced the price increase earlier today.
Given this apparent increase in abilities, Tesla has decided it’s time to increase prices again on the software. Prices will go up to $15K on September 5, though the “old” price of $12K will be honored for orders made before but delivered after September 5. This price hike will only happen in North America – other regions are “safe” with the old price for now, because those regions tend to get Autopilot updates later than North America.
We don’t know yet if there will be any change to Tesla’s FSD subscription service. That service currently costs $199/month, and didn’t go up in price the last time Tesla hiked FSD prices. But if you want to subscribe with a car bought between late 2016 and mid 2019, Tesla will charge you $1,000 for hardware you already bought.
Tesla has steadily increased the price of its FSD software since it first debuted. The public rationale is that as the software becomes more capable, it also becomes more valuable, and therefore the price should go up.
But it also works as an incentive to have Tesla owners purchase the software early in order to “lock in” lower prices. An FSD buyer who purchased the software years ago might have paid as low as $5,000 (though the earliest buyers were treated unfairly in that respect) for software that currently costs $12K, but can now derive the same amount of benefit as a current buyer.
Each time Tesla raises the price, some current owners decide to buy the software, not wanting to be “left out” of the eventual upgrades. This sense of urgency is contributed to by Musk’s public statements about Autopilot – who has suggested that Tesla would have self-driving robotaxis on the road by “next year”… for several years running.
Tesla’s Full Self-Driving is unfortunately still anything but self-driving. As is, the system is still “Level 2” in the SAE’s autonomous driving classification, much like other driver assist technologies like GM’s Super Cruise and Mercedes Intelligent Drive (MB has a Level 3 system, Drive Pilot, coming soon™ to the US). A Level 2 system requires that a driver remain present and attentive to the road at all times, though the driver can take their hands off the wheel.
Level 2 really can’t be considered self-driving, as a driver is still always responsible for the car. Not until we reach level 4 can a car really be considered self-driving, able to make all decisions without the necessity of a driver being in the seat.
This disconnect between Tesla’s branding and the system’s actual capabilities has led to consternation from governmental and non-governmental sources alike, including a recent TV smear campaign from a competing self-driving software company.
While its features have improved over time, it still results in some scary situations, as Electrek‘s own Fred Lambert recently found out when it almost threw him off a cliff. For most of the drive it behaved well, but “most of the drive” is not enough when you’re perched along a cliff, or passing by pedestrians and motorcycles, or driving at high speeds, etc.
However, that was pre-update. And post-update test drives have started showing up on YouTube as the software rolls out to beta testers. This one showed improvements and no driver interventions over a 10-minute drive on several unmarked roads:
Here’s a drive that starts on dirt roads, which the software used to be capable of, but would often warn the driver to take over immediately. The drive shows a seemingly unnecessary slowdown on the dirt road while going up a small hill, and had several disengagements and quirks but did not encounter any phantom braking on town roads:
Here’s an examination of unprotected left turns by Chuck Cook, who has become famous for “Chuck’s turn,” a difficult unprotected left that has proven challenging for many autonomous/driver assist systems:
This turn was in fact mentioned specifically in the patch notes for 10.69: “Improved unprotected left turns with more appropriate speed profile when approaching and exiting median crossover regions, in the presence of high speed cross traffic (‘Chuck Cook style’ unprotected left turns).”
Cook seems quite excited about 10.69’s behavior on his turn, and it seems to be a significant improvement from previous versions. He still felt the need to take over on some trials, but the car seems to understand the concept of waiting in the median for a space in traffic to slot into – most of the time.
However, Cook found some previously distressing behaviors have been carried over into 10.69, and still need to be worked on:
WHO HASN'T SEEN THIS.  This is not an #FSDBeta v10.69 issue, as it existed before and I don't understand it.. but it needs to be fixed.  I happened to me twice today. Sorry.. Good with the bad 😬@elonmusk @aelluswamy pic.twitter.com/honwnJ2Aau
And some other testers felt like there was too much focus on “Chuck’s Turn,” with several (unnamed) “basic control issues” persisting in the update which should have been worked out by now:
Unfortunately I have to say I'm still having to intervene to correct #FSDBeta 10.69 in my area. Still lots of work to go.I know this is probably not a popular opinion but the focusing on the ""Chuck"" complex left is getting ahead of the needs of some more basic control issues.
(Inexplicably, Musk dismissed this criticism, suggesting that beta testers – the group invited by Tesla to test this software for bugs – shouldn’t be critical of the software their job it is to be critical of)
So while the software does solve some problems, there’s still work to be done. While many expect/hope for Tesla to reach Level 4 soon, 10.69 is not there yet.
Currently, Tesla Full Self-driving doesn’t signify a big change in how a driver uses their vehicle. You still must be in the seat, and still need to pay attention to the road. You can’t have your car drop you off and go find parking for itself, or come give you a ride home after a night out, or drive itself while you read the paper, work on spreadsheets, or watch a movie.
Autopilot does give certain benefits, like reducing cognitive load over a long drive. Many drivers say they feel more refreshed when they reach their destination when driving with Autopilot engaged. But those benefits are largely included with the basic Autopilot package that all Teslas come with, which includes lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control on highways.
Also, there are the safety benefits – but those are, again, included with all Teslas.
Tesla even splits some of the functions out from FSD into “Enhanced Autopilot,” a package that has been available from time to time and currently costs $6,000. This includes Navigate on Autopilot and Auto Lane Change, which will automatically guide you to freeway exits and interchanges, Autopark to help with parking, and Smart Summon, which can bring your car to you from the other side of a parking lot.
Currently, FSD’s only function is to stop at stop signs and traffic lights, and with FSD Beta, Autosteer on city streets.
While these are neat things to have, it’s hard to suggest that they are worth $15,000. That amount of money gets you a lot of rides from taxis or ride-hailing apps, where you really can offload the driving to someone else. Or if you want more hardware, after the new EV tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act comes into effect, it might even pay for an entire 2023 Chevy Bolt if you’ve also got access to state or local credits.
So, from what we’ve seen, and after this upcoming price increase, is FSD worth it?
This is unfortunately not a question we can answer for everyone, because everyone’s economic situation and needs are different.
While early testers do seem largely satisfied with improvements in the update, $15,000 is still a steep price. And it’s certainly not “more affordable” than the previous price, as Musk once stated was Tesla’s goal:
We’re trying to make EVs & autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company.
For early Tesla owners, who bought FSD as early as 2016, it’s hard to say that the thousands of dollars they spent has produced fruitful results, given that cars are currently still not able to drive themselves. Some of those cars might reach the end of their service life before full self-driving is solved, resulting in that money being spent on software that was never actually delivered.
For those owners, Tesla may eventually offer some sort of “loyalty program” – as it currently does in China, offering FSD for half-price if an owner buys another Tesla and had FSD on their original one. Though it should probably just allow transferability of the license – especially for owners who have owned FSD for years and gotten little to no benefit from it (given that FSD Beta is still locked behind a “safety score,” making owners qualify for software they already purchased).
And if Level 4+ self-driving actually is solved, to the point where vehicles can function as driverless taxis (outside of geofenced areas like GM’s Cruise and Google’s Waymo currently do), the software could be worth more than the car. But that’s a big “if,” particularly considering the software would have to satisfy safety regulators before allowing cars to drive around with nobody in them.
So the question of whether it’s worth it runs down a similar line as it always has: Do you think the value of Full Self-Driving will go up in the future, fast enough that a $12,000 payment now (or $15K after Sept 5) will be “worth” the “investment”?
If you take Elon’s word for it, then you’ll only have to wait until “next year” to find out. Whichever year that may be.

2022/08/19,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla is slowing down the rollout of its next “Full Self-Driving Beta” software update (10.69) due to “many major code changes.”
It is reportedly still coming tomorrow, but only to ~1,000 Tesla FSD Beta drivers.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
The last update (10.12) came in May, so it has been a while since Tesla has pushed something new to the FSD Beta fleet.
In July, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that FSD Beta 10.13 would be coming in a week, and he did something rare for him when it comes to Tesla Full Self-Driving – he managed expectations about the update.
However, even though release notes leaked a week later, the update wasn’t pushed to the larger fleet as Musk decided to make it a bigger update and upgraded it to 10.69.
The CEO had been promising the new Tesla FSD beta 10.69 to come on August 20, but now a day before the release, Musk announced on Twitter that the rollout will be slower due to “many major code changes”:
There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout. Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta.
Based on previous comments and the release notes for 10.13, the update will address left turns, animal detection, speed limits, and more.
Musk had originally said that Tesla’s bigger FSD update, v11, would be coming around this time at the end of August, but it looks like it is delayed in favor of this new 10.69 update.
Tesla FSD Beta v11 is expected to include the merger of Tesla’s city driving stack and highway driving stack, which will be a big step toward the development of the autonomous driving system.

In addition, some specs have been clarified. Tesla still says the truck will be capable of 0-60 in 20 seconds and have 300- or 500-mile battery options with a consumption of under 2kWh per mile – all while fully loaded to its 82,000 lb. capacity.
We also previously just had one static interior photo, while now we have a short video render of the interior:
But a couple expectations have been trimmed down, though only slightly. Tesla originally claimed the truck would have four independent motors and be capable of recharging 400 miles in 30 minutes.
The site now says that the Tesla Semi will have three independent motors (instead of four) and be capable of regaining 70% charge in 30 minutes (which would be 350 miles on a 500-mile battery) when attached to a “Tesla Semi Charger.” And we’ve got a new video of a Tesla Semi pulling up and plugging into one of these chargers installed at Tesla’s Gigafactory Nevada:
Previously, Tesla referred to these Semi chargers as “Megachargers,” so we’re not sure if this is a change in branding or if Tesla plans to use both terms.
Tesla is a member of the CharIN alliance, the industry association behind the CCS standard, which is also working on a larger Megawatt Charging System for commercial vehicles. CharIN is targeting a maximum rate of 3.75MW (3000A, 1250V) for their connector, which will see pilot use in 2023 but debuts fully in 2024. Initial stations will have Tesla-compatible 1MW chargers.
We originally assumed the Semi would need more than 1MW of power to charge at the rates Tesla claims it will charge at.
If the truck can get 500 miles at 2kWh/mi, that means it would have a 1MWh battery, and to charge to 70% of range (700kWh) in 30 minutes, you’d need a 1.4MW average charge rate from 0-80%. Which means peak charging rate would need to be higher than 1.4MW, because charging speeds usually taper off at higher states of charge.
However, Tesla says consumption is less than 2kWh/mi, and these numbers would work out to a 1MW average charge rate if consumption is significantly less than that number – around 1.5kWh/mi, suggesting a 750kWh battery.
For comparison, Rivian and Lightning trucks consume somewhere around 1kWh/mile when towing a large trailer, and they are much lighter and have less rolling resistance than the Tesla Semi. They might have a worse aerodynamic drag coefficient with trailer attached, but the Semi probably still pushes more air due to its larger frontal area. And Volvo’s estimates for the VNR electric involve a bit higher than 2kWh/mile consumption, though they don’t specify that this is under a full load. All told, 1.5kWh/mi consumption would be quite a feat.
Alternately, the change in language could just be a recognition of the 300-mile battery. Does this mean the 300-mile battery can charge to 70% in 30 minutes, and the 500-mile will take longer? Or will they have different charge rates leading to similar charge time on a percent-per-minute basis (larger batteries can typically accept more power, as long as the charger can provide enough)? Or, perhaps, Tesla is just being characteristically generous in their estimates.
So we still don’t quite know battery size, charge rate, or consumption, but we’re getting in the ballpark.
Finally, Tesla’s website originally stated the Tesla Semi would have a .36 Cd drag coefficient, but that stat is now missing. It could have to do with some changes in the design of the truck. The photo on the previous Semi site and first unveiled prototypes show fewer aerodynamic disturbances (more side skirting, less space between tractor and container, no side mirrors) than the most recent, more production-ready prototypes show, as we can see from a video in the background of Tesla’s new site:
After a long wait, it looks like the Tesla Semi is finally starting to materialize. What do you think about these new details? Notice anything we didn’t? Let us know in the comments.

2022/08/18,"Tesla has confirmed its plan to launch a new electricity retail business in Texas through a new job posting for a role overseeing the new business unit.
Last year, Tesla created a new business unit called Tesla Energy Ventures and applied with the Public Utility Commission of Texas to sell electricity on the retail market.
The plans haven’t been clear, but Tesla has since launched a virtual power plant demonstration with Powerwall owners in Texas, and the goal is to demonstrate the value to ERCOT, Texas’s electric utility regulating body, in order to operate a virtual power plant in the state – as it does in California.
Tesla could be looking to get deeper into the Texas energy market and become a dull electricity retailer, which is what the company now confirms through a new job posting found by Electrek. The automaker is looking for a “Product Operations Manager, Retail Electricity” based in Austin.
In the description, Tesla said that the role will oversee “the launch and growth of a new electricity retailer in the Texas market.”
This Product Operations Manager will be central to the success of Tesla’s emerging Electricity Retail business. This person will support the launch and growth of a new electricity retailer in the Texas market. This person will be responsible for managing retail electricity products, administering the customer portfolio, coordinating customer support, and tracking financial performance.
The company added that it would prefer someone with experience “in residential electricity retail, preferably with a retail electricity provider in ERCOT.”
Tesla has been expanding its solar and storage business rapidly in Texas. The automaker is currently building what will likely become the largest rooftop solar installation in the world at Gigafactory Texas, and it is also planning a large battery system with a planned output of 250 MW.
The move into electricity retail in Texas appears to be part of Musk’s vision for Tesla Energy to become a distributed global utility. The CEO also said that he believes Tesla’s energy business could outgrow its automotive business.

2022/08/18,"Tesla has managed to cut Model 3 and Model Y delivery times in China, an important market for the automaker, after upgrading Gigafactory Shanghai to add more production capacity.
Demand has rarely been a problem for Tesla and over the last few years, it has resulted in long delivery times for many variants of most models.
The automaker has been increasing production capacity to catch up to demand, but the latter has still been outpacing the former, leading to Tesla stopping new orders of some models in order to reduce the backlog.
In China, Tesla has also been experiencing strong demand, but production has also been ramping up rapidly. Over the last month,  Tesla upgraded the plant to achieve a production rate of 1 million vehicles per year.
Today, Tesla announced a significant improvement in delivery time for the Model Y Rear-Wheel-Drive, which is Tesla’s cheapest and most popular model in China.
The automaker cut the delivery time from 8-24 weeks to 4-8 weeks:
Now both sides – Tesla fans and Tesla haters – are interpreting the news in different ways.
On the one hand, Tesla fans believe that the automaker has managed to significantly ramp up production through its recent factory upgrade, which is cutting down the delivery time. On the other hand, Tesla naysayers believe that demand has fallen, resulting in this shorter delivery time.
We should know in a few weeks when China releases its vehicle registration data for August, though September numbers should be more telling.
That said, Tesla’s issues in China are not over as a drought has been putting a lot of pressure on the grid, and Tesla has been asking the government to help maintain power at Gigafactory Shanghai.
China is the largest market for electric vehicles and therefore is Tesla’s most important market. Any production output issue at Gigafactory Shanghai would significantly affect deliveries in China and markets where Tesla exports from China, such as Europe.

2022/08/18,"Tesla’s virtual power plant in California had its first emergency response event helping the grid by pooling power from Powerwall owners around the state.  The event appears to have been a success as the distributed power plant looks like the future.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems, like Tesla Powerwalls, used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants.
Last year, Tesla launched a VPP pilot program in California, where Powerwall owners would join in voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it.
It helped Tesla prove the usefulness of such a system.
Following the pilot program, Tesla and PG&E, the electric utility covering Northern California, launched the first official virtual power plant through the Tesla app in June.
This new version of the Tesla Virtual Power Plant actually compensates Powerwall owners $2 per kWh that they contribute to the grid during emergency load reduction events. Homeowners are expected to get between $10 and $60 per event.
Earlier this week, we reported that Tesla’s California VPP expanded to Southern California Edison (SCE) to now cover most of the state.
Just days later, the Tesla VPP had its first emergency response event. Tesla reached out to Powerwall owners who opted in the program through its app yesterday to warn them of the event and give them the option to opt-out if they needed all the power from their Powerwalls today:
It looks like 2,342 Powerwall owners participated in the event on the PG&E network and 268 homes on the SCE grid.
For PG&E, Tesla’s VPP was outputting as much as 16 MW of power at one point during the event – acting as a small distributed power plant.
Here are examples of what the Tesla app looked like during the event:
PG&E 2342 homes 16 MW at the moment over here pic.twitter.com/2CRLfolOrl
For SCE, the Tesla VPP was outputting as much as 1.5 MW of power at one point during the event.
P&GE released a Flex Alert Requests for voluntary conservation on energy yesterday:
With hot temperatures and high energy demand across California, the state’s power grid operator is asking residents statewide to voluntarily conserve electricity this afternoon and evening when the grid is most stressed due to higher demand and energy supplies are tighter.
Now Tesla’s VPP is another tool that they can use to address the situation and avoid brownouts.
I think we are starting to witness the beginnings of a true smart grid backed by distributed energy assets, which is something that has been talked about as the future of the electric grid for a long time, but it’s finally happening.
Now that Tesla is showing that this is working smoothly on a significant scale, I think we are going to see massive growth of those systems, and the economics of them are just going to get better.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla ends the years with tens of thousands of Powerwalls on VPPs.

2022/08/17,"Tesla has released a rare public comment denying a media report that claims an executive has left the company.
Over the last few years, almost every article about Tesla you read includes some version of the phrase “we contacted Tesla for a comment, but the automaker has not responded.” That’s because the automaker has stopped commenting on media reports over the last two years after disbanding its press relations department.
But surprisingly, Tesla has taken to Twitter today to comment on a media report from Bloomberg that claimed David Searle, Tesla’s head of legal, had left the company:
This Bloomberg article is false. David Searle has not left Tesla.
Tesla denied the report on Twitter despite Bloomberg claiming that three sources confirmed the news to them:
David Searle left his position as Tesla’s head of legal less than a month ago, according to three people familiar with the matter. Dinna Eskin, a deputy general counsel at the company, has taken over the role, the people said.
The publication had reached out to Tesla prior to reporting, but the automaker didn’t respond. Bloomberg has since modified the article to specify that Searle is not the head of legal at the company, which Tesla doesn’t seem to deny, but the headline still claims that Searle has “exited” Tesla.
The report also noted that Searle oversaw the investigation into the suspicious order of “special glass” that reportedly resulted in several Tesla employees being fired. And, supposedly, Elon Musk’s top lieutenant Omead Afshar is going to be next.
That report was also from Bloomberg (but from a different reporter), and Tesla hasn’t commented.
Man, I miss Tesla’s PR department. This is one of those cases where it would have been useful. It looks like Bloomberg might be onto something about this, but they didn’t get the full story.
Tesla could have clarified the situation. Instead, Bloomberg posted an incomplete report and Tesla decided to correct it after the fact. 
But, the fact that the company commented on it at all is interesting because that hasn’t happened in a long time. Are we seeing a glimpse of potential media relations coming back? Maybe. We will have to wait and see.

2022/08/17,"Tesla has met with François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s federal minister in charge of innovation, science, and industry, as the automaker is considering a Gigafactory in Canada.
We have been reporting on evidence that Tesla has been looking at a potential factory in Canada. 
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America, and the CEO hinted at Canada. Musk did it again at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting earlier this month, and the effort was confirmed through a lobbying disclosure by the automaker with the Ontario government in Canada.
Now we learn that François-Philippe Champagne has met with Tesla Canada at their Markham facility.
There’s a part of 🇨🇦 in every @Tesla that you see on the roads and today I had a chance to visit their facility in Markham for a tour and test drive.I look forward to seeing Canada continue to be the green supplier of choice for the automotive industry. pic.twitter.com/bIEWceRa8h
In Markham, Tesla operates its Tesla Toronto Automation group, which it built out of its acquisition of the manufacturing equipment maker Hibar Systems. The group makes machinery that goes on production lines at Tesla’s factories around the world.
Champagne also happens to be my federal deputy in Shawinigan, where I live in Quebec.
To be honest, I believe that the meeting with Tesla has more to do with his role as minister of industry than his own district, but it’s still not impossible that a Tesla factory would end up in the region.
Obviously, I am biased, but the region is also objectively becoming an EV/battery hub. There are about half a dozen manufacturing facilities related to battery and EV production within 50 miles of the region.
GM is partnering with POSCO on a $400 million factory to produce cathode material for EV batteries at a new facility in Bécancour. In the same region, Livent is going to process lithium and Nouveau Monde Graphite is going to process graphite – both for EV battery production. In Shawinigan, Taiga is planning a large factory to produce electric snowmobiles, watercraft, and UTVs. Flo is producing EV charging stations a rock’s throw away from the upcoming Taiga factory.
There are also a bunch of smaller EV projects in the region, which is also known for its cheap hydroelectricity, and the Quebec government is investing over $1 billion in promoting projects related to battery production.
I think if Tesla ends up building a Gigafactory in Canada, it would likely be between the greater Toronto region and somewhere in Maurice/Centre du Quebec.

2022/08/17,"Tesla is working on a new Supercharger membership to offer non-Tesla EV owners as it prepares to open its Supercharger network in the US.
After opening the network in Europe where Superchargers use the standard CCS plug, Tesla is now preparing to open the network in North America by introducing a new CCS adapter for non-Tesla EV owners.
The move is expected to happen by the end of the year and comes as opening the network is a requirement to get access to new federal funds to accelerate the deployment of EV charging stations.
The idea of opening the Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs is somewhat controversial in the Tesla community since the network, which is much larger than any other fast-charging network in the US, is one of the biggest advantages of driving a Tesla, but it already gets crowded at times and adding more EVs to it will not help that issue.
Tesla is still working on the rollout of its plan to open the network to other EVs, and we got a glimpse at it last night as Tesla briefly allowed people in the US to sign up to a Supercharger membership in the country:
BREAKING: @Tesla has launched Supercharger membership packages for Non-Tesla EV owners.There are two plans:• Pay Per Use: Pay as you go, access to Supercharger network• Membership: $0.99/month (in the US), access to Supercharger network, lower price per kWh pic.twitter.com/muVBv3pZbd
Tesla quickly removed the option from the app, which it presumably prematurely released as it still doesn’t have any station in the US open to non-Tesla EVs.
The membership of $0.99 is also most likely not going to be the final price and was just a placeholder in the unfinished version of the Supercharger membership in the app.
However, the concept of a “Pay per Use” model and a membership where the cost per kWh is lower is likely something that Tesla is indeed working on, and that’s why it popped up in the app.
My assumption is that Tesla is going to charge a higher price per kWh for non-Tesla EV owners on the Pay per Use model, and the Supercharger Membership is going to give them the same price as Tesla owners, who won’t have to pay the membership.
I would estimate the membership will be between $5 and $10 per month.
Depending on if Tesla releases a CCS adapter that non-Tesla EV owners can purchase or if it deploys them at stations as it individually opens them to the public, I would probably hold off on a membership because it could take a while before you can get significant value out of the network.
But we are going to have to wait for more details about the plan, which Tesla has yet to make clear.

2022/08/16,"Tesla’s Supercharger stations that are open to non-Tesla electric vehicles are deemed “illegal” in Germany due to the lack of kWh counter on the units.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers. In November 2021, we saw Tesla take its first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands, where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
In January, the automaker announced that the program is expanding to more stations in Norway and France, and a month later, the program was expanded to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands. Now Tesla has expanded the pilot program to some Supercharger stations in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria.
In May, the automaker also added Spain and the UK to the program, and finally in June, Tesla expanded the program again to include Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.
Now that the Supercharger network is partly public and open to all EVs, it faces different rules in some markets and it is becoming a problem in Germany.
Handelsblatt reports that Tesla’s Superchargers are considered “illegal” because they don’t have a visible kWh counter at the stations (translated from German):
Every charging station at which charging current is billed according to kilowatt hours must comply with calibration law in Germany , i.e., have a meter that precisely measures the charged current. This applies to public space, but also to company and private premises.
Tesla has always relied on its mobile app to monitor charging sessions, and the stations are not equipped with screens.
Thomas Weberpals, head of the Bavarian State Office for Weights and Measures, said that it is Tesla’s job to retrofit the stations, and it is working toward that. The government doesn’t plan to act on it right now:
The illegal operation is not hindered and not sanctioned. It was and is being worked toward a lawful state.
There are a few other charging companies that are also in violation of the regulation, but Tesla has the highest number of stations in violation.
When Tesla opened its Supercharger network to the public in Europe, it automatically became the “largest public 150 kW+ fast-charging network.”

2022/08/16,"Tesla has expanded its Virtual Power Plant In California to the southern parts of the state through a new partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE).
Now Tesla Powerwall owners in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas can get paid to help the grid.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems, like Tesla Powerwalls, used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants. 
Last year, Tesla launched a VPP pilot program in California, where Powerwall owners would join in voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it.

Now Tesla is expanding the VPP through a partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE):
Participate in the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP) pilot offered by Southern California Edison (SCE) and support the grid while also earning compensation and maintaining your energy security.
The program operates very similarly to the VPP with PG&E and also pays $2 per kWh, but it has a different set of rules that you can find here.
Now, most of California is covered by Tesla’s virtual power plant and most Powerwall owners are able to enroll.
Tesla is also running a virtual power plant demonstration in Texas as it expands this product in partnership with electric utilities to offer a cheap alternative to peaker plants.
Tesla’s vision of becoming a global decentralized electric utility is becoming a reality.
With this program now with the two largest electric utilities in California, any time it installs a new Powerwall in the state and the homeowner enrolls, it is adding more value to the VPP.
When launching the one with PG&E, Tesla said it had about 50,000 Powerwalls that could be eligible for this VPP, which add up to a significant 500 MWh of energy capacity than can be distributed in any event.
The company didn’t update that number with the new SCE partnership, but let’s say that it has half that capacity in Southern California. That’s 750 MWh that can be deployed or $1.5 million worth of electricity per event.

2022/08/15,"Tesla is still dominating the US electric car market, now with a 68% market share. This share is going down as more EVs hit the market. But, the decline is slow and the automaker is increasing its US delivery volumes.
For years now, Tesla has dominated the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market, but for now, the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla’s production and deliveries.
For the entire year of 2020, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States.
In 2021, that number went down to 69.95%, but that’s still impressive with EV delivery volumes significantly increasing throughout the year along with Tesla’s prices.
Now we have the numbers for the first half of 2022, and Tesla is maintaining its dominance with a 68% market share in the US EV market. That number is based on registration data from Experian.
Where things get impressive is when you consider that Tesla managed to maintain its lead, or more accurately only lose 1% market share, while other automakers producing electric vehicles increased their US deliveries by 58% during the first half of the year.
Tesla Model Y and Model 3 are still first and second with the Mustang Mach-E coming in a distant third despite Ford doubling its EV deliveries so far this year.
Here are the top 10 best-selling electric vehicles in the United States so far this year:
Ford is expected to add to the top 10 soon with the F-150 Lightning. While there were only 1,288 deliveries of the electric pickup truck during the first half of 2022, Ford delivered another 2,173 units in July alone, according to registration data.
However, Tesla could very well manage to maintain its lead from the first half of the year depending on Model Y production ramp-up at Gigafactory Texas.
Volkswagen’s US EV deliveries are down 17% so far this year, but they are expected to pick up during the second half of the year thanks to the start of VW ID.4 production in Tennessee.

2022/08/15,"Tesla has released a new picture of its upgraded supercomputer, which is now believed to be the seventh most powerful computer in the world by GPU.
For years now, Tesla has been teasing the development of a new supercomputer in-house optimized for neural net video training. Tesla is handling an incredible amount of video data from its fleet of over 1 million vehicles, which it uses to train its neural nets.
The automaker found itself unsatisfied with current hardware options to train its computer vision neural nets and believed it could do better internally.
Over the last few years, CEO Elon Musk has been teasing the development of Tesla’s own supercomputer called “Dojo.” In 2020, he even teased that Tesla’s Dojo would have a capacity of over an exaflop, which is one quintillion (1018) floating-point operations per second, or 1,000 petaflops.
It could potentially makes Dojo the new most powerful supercomputer in the world.
Last year, at Tesla’s AI Day, the company unveiled its Dojo supercomputer, but the company was still ramping up its effort at the time.
Now Tim Zaman, engineering manager leading the AI Infrastructure and AI Platform at Tesla, confirmed that Tesla recently upgraded the GPUs in its supercomputer and released a picture.
Tesla is sponsoring the @MLSysConf, come visit our booth for opportunities on the AI team and see our hardware.We have recently upgraded our GPU supercomputer (photo) to 7360 A-100(80GB) GPUs, making it Top-7 by gpu-count. Reach out to build #1: https://t.co/mPiOOb8CJg pic.twitter.com/VN5orhbtLy
The announcement is part of a recruitment effort as Tesla is spooning the MLSys Conference.
The engineer commented that Tesla’s goal is for the supercomputer to become number one. Tesla aims to have the most powerful supercomputer in the world to support its increasingly broadening artificial intelligence effort. It is starting with its self-driving program, but the automaker has made it clear that it wants to play a role in “general artificial intelligence” through its humanoid robot program.
The company is expected to reveal more details about its supercomputer and all other AI-related programs next month during its Tesla AI Day 2.

2022/08/15,"We tested Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta in the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina, and it was a scary experience.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. Tesla is basically using its customer fleet to test the capabilities and gather data to improve toward its goal of eventually making the system truly self-driving and taking responsibility for it.
I had FSD Beta in my Model 3 for a few months now, and I sporadically test it out when I feel like there’s a potentially interesting scenario. I generally don’t use it in my day-to-day driving because in my case, it feels like work and add a stress level that I don’t need.
Yesterday, my girlfriend and I went hiking in the the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. On our way back, I thought it could be interesting to test Tesla’s FSD Beta (version 10.12) on the Blue Ridge Parkway since it is a scenario where FSD Beta should excel in because there are very few intersections, and the road lines are as clear as it gets.
Here you can watch the full unedited drive:
The scenario puts FSD Beta in similar circumstances as Tesla’s Autopilot, but on lower speed roads, which is why I thought it would do very well.
For the most part, it performed well – the computer vision system is excellent at detecting its environment, and the car stays beautifully centered in the lane. 
At one point (9:50), we encountered hikers that were walking very close to the road, which didn’t have shoulders, and Tesla FSD Beta quickly detected them, slowed down, and even planned to move more to the left to give them space before they actually moved further away from the road themselves:
That was very good driving behavior that I was about to do myself, had FSD Beta not shown us what it was planning.
The most annoying part of FSD Beta, like Autopilot, is still the frequency of “phantom braking” events where the vehicle decelerates without a good reason to decelerate. As you can see, it happens several times on this drive, though I feel like the deceleration is not as significant as on Autopilot – that might be simply explained by the different driving speeds on highways versus this slower road.
I also noted some inconsistencies in the speed Tesla FSD Beta takes turns. You can see it decelerate to take some turns that it doesn’t look like you’d need to decelerate, and then take others just as sharply at the max set speed.
Over the 13-minute and 8-mile test, we only had a single driver intervention (12:56), but it obviously was a significant one. Tesla FSD Beta was clearly taking the sharp turn too fast, and it was about to throw us down the cliff on the side of the road. I applied the brakes as I felt the car going over the double lanes straight for the other side of the road. It was certainly scary for a second.
What is strange is that FSD Beta knew this road had sharp turns that required slowing down, since it was driving a good 10 mph under the set speed, but it somehow didn’t anticipate that turn correctly.
From the predicted path (blue line), you can see that FSD Beta is having difficulties predicting how sharp the turn actually is and appears to align with the double lines:
As FSD started taking the turn, I could feel it was going too fast and there was no way the car wasn’t missing the turn without slamming the brakes before forcing the wheel to the right.
It’s a good reminder that the system is still in beta, and it is extremely important to remain vigilant and be ready to take control at all times. Stay safe out there.
Note: this post is based on my own opinion of Tesla FSD Beta based on this test, which you can see unedited video footage from above.

2022/08/15,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed more details about Tesla Optimus, the company’s upcoming humanoid robot, and how he sees the product rolling out over the next decade.
Over the last few years, Musk has been getting quite cozy with the Chinese government. 
In a country known for its protectionism, the CEO managed to score for Tesla the first car factory in China wholly owned by a foreign automaker.
He also often praises the country’s engineering and scientific prowess while also limiting his criticism of China’s authoritarian regime.
Now in another example of Musk getting cozier with China, the CEO was invited to publish a column in the Cyberspace Administration of China’s official publication. The government agency has wide-ranging power in China to control the internet and data security.
In the column titled “Believing in technology for a better future,” Musk reiterated his goals for SpaceX to enable humanity to become multi-planetary and Tesla to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. 
Interestingly, Musk also wrote an entire section about Tesla Optimus, the company’s humanoid robot project. The CEO recently said that the robot project had become a top priority at Tesla, and it shows by how much time he spent on it in the new column.
Here’s the relevant part from a version translated to English by China’s state media Beijing Channel:
Today’s cars are increasingly like smart, web-connected robots on wheels. In fact, in addition to cars, humanoid robots are also becoming a reality, with Tesla launching a general-purpose humanoid robot (Tesla Bot) in 2021. The Tesla Bot is close to the height and weight of an adult, can carry or pick up heavy objects, walk fast in small steps, and the screen on its face is an interactive interface for communication with people. You may wonder why we designed this robot with legs. Because human society is based on the interaction of a bipedal humanoid with two arms and ten fingers. So if we want a robot to adapt to its environment and be able to do what humans do, it has to be roughly the same size, shape, and capabilities as a human.
Tesla Bots are initially positioned to replace people in repetitive, boring, and dangerous tasks. But the vision is for them to serve millions of households, such as cooking, mowing lawns, and caring for the elderly.
Achieving this goal requires that robots evolve to be smart enough and for us to have the ability to mass produce robots. Our “four-wheeled robots” – cars – have changed the way people travel and even live. One day when we solve the problem of self-driving cars (i.e., real-world artificial intelligence), we will be able to extend artificial intelligence technology to humanoid robots, which will have a much broader application than cars.
We plan to launch the first prototype of a humanoid robot this year and focus on improving the intelligence of that robot and solving the problem of large-scale production. Thereafter, humanoid robots’ usefulness will increase yearly as production scales up and costs fall. In the future, a home robot may be cheaper than a car. Perhaps in less than a decade, people will be able to buy a robot for their parents as a birthday gift.
It is foreseeable that with the power of robots, we will create an era of extreme abundance of goods and services, where everyone can live a life of abundance. Perhaps the only scarcity that will exist in the future is for us to create ourselves as humans.
In the piece, Musk makes it clear that Tesla plans for the robot to go beyond industrial labor and be used in homes to perform household tasks and even care for the elderly.
Tesla is expected to unveil the first working prototype of its humanoid robot on September 30 at its Tesla AI Day 2.

2022/08/14,"Tesla announced today that Gigafactory Shanghai has just produced its 1 millionth electric car – an important milestone for Tesla’s new global export hub.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk disclosed that Gigafactory Shanghai has now surpassed Fremont Factory in production capacity, and Tesla has made the Chinese factory its new main export hub.
Gigafactory Shanghai is a significant success story for Tesla.
The factory went from beginning construction in December 2018 to starting production in December 2019.
Within just two years of starting production, it became the biggest/most productive electric vehicle factory in the world by a wide margin.
It finished 2021 with an annualized production rate of over 800,000 vehicles it is still growing.
Today, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai has now produced its 1 millionth electric car:
Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M. pic.twitter.com/2Aee6slCuv
As Musk highlighted, Tesla disclosed just earlier this month that it produced its 3 millionth electric car.
Fremont factory, Tesla’s first factory, announced that it produced its 2 millionth electric car just a few week prior.
Gigafactory Shanghai’s 1 millionth vehicle came fast, but its second millionth vehicle is going to come a lot faster as Tesla recently upgraded the plant to achieve a production rate of 1 million vehicles per year.
The production rate is expected to be achieved later this year.
Gigafactory Shanghai currently only produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, but the factory is expected to expand to more vehicles next year.
The automaker is aiming to increase its production capacity to 20 million cars per year by the end of the decade.
With the success of Gigafactory Shanghai, it’s likely that Tesla will invest more in China to achieve that goal. But in the short term, Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas are expected to be the ones adding more production capacity for the automaker.

2022/08/12,"Tesla has decided to stop taking new orders for its Model 3 Long Range, one of its most popular models, in the United States and Canada. The automaker has adopted this new business model to avoid creating delivery timelines that are super long for customers.
There’s currently a rush to order electric vehicles as the technology becomes more mainstream and, in the short term, grows in popularity due to gas price increases and the new federal EV incentive expected to become law any minute.
For Tesla, we previously reported that this uptick in demand has resulted in a significant increase in its order rate in several regions of the United States. In March, this resulted in many Tesla models being sold out until 2023 in the United States. That’s despite several price increases throughout Tesla’s entire lineup over the last two years.
In May, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that Tesla might stop taking orders on some vehicles because of long delivery times as backlogs become bigger. The automaker has now followed through on the warning with an update to its online configurator today:
As you can see above, the Model 3 Long Range is now greyed out and cannot be selected to order. Tesla added a note that it will be “available in 2023.”
The screenshot above is from Tesla’s US configurator, but the vehicle is also not available in Canada.
The Model 3 Long Range is one of Tesla’s most popular vehicles. Based on Musk’s warning, it’s likely that the automaker now has a large enough backlog for the model that it doesn’t make sense to take more orders until it can work through it.
Tesla has also removed the pricing of the vehicle for now. Before today’s update, the price was $57,990. It’s likely that the price will be updated when Tesla reopens orders.
The Model 3 Long Range might be one of the few electric vehicles that could be eligible for the new EV tax credit with the battery and critical mineral criteria, but it is going to have to be less than $55,000 in order to qualify.

2022/08/12,"Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving programs are facing mounting pressure from many fronts as regulators and politicians are getting involved.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has famously launched 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles where it believes advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), under which both Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Beta program fall, could have been involved.
So far, these special investigations haven’t come up with much against Tesla. In fact, NHTSA is most often finding that the drivers involved were simply not paying attention – something that is required with all of Tesla’s ADAS.
But now there’s an investigation that has been progressing toward a recall.
Last year, NHTSA announced that it is launching an investigation into Tesla Autopilot after identifying 11 crashes involving first-responder vehicles.
In June 2022, NHTSA announced today that its investigation into Tesla Autopilot had been upgraded to an engineering analysis (EA) – a step closer to a possible recall.
Now after a few months without news about the investigation, US Senator Gary Peters and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats who chair subcommittees overseeing auto safety, have decided to send a letter to NHTSA to pressure them on the investigation:
Reuters reported on the letter:
The lawmakers asked “given the mounting number of fatalities involving Tesla vehicles crashing into tractor trailers … has NHTSA considered opening a defect investigation into this issue?”
The letter added “does NHTSA strike a balance between investigative thoroughness and addressing urgent, emerging risks to motor vehicle safety?” and if the agency has enough resources and legal authority to properly investigate advanced driver assistance systems.
Simultaneously, former presidential candidate Ralph Nader released a public letter calling for NHTSA to remove FSD Beta from Tesla vehicles:
I am calling on federal regulators to act immediately to prevent the growing deaths and injuries from Tesla manslaughtering crashes with this technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has the authority to act swiftly to prevent such disasters. NHTSA has been investigating Tesla and its Full Self-Driving technology for several years. NHTSA must use its safety recall authority to order that the FSD technology be removed in every Tesla.
Coincidently, or not, those new efforts to pressure regulators to shut down Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Beta comes after Dan O’Dowd released a new ad attacking Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta. 
The ad has been running on national TV all week:
However, as we reported earlier this week, there are some serious problems with the tests that led to this ad.
Nonetheless, it appears to have successfully influenced politicians to mount the pressure on NHTSA to act on Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD Beta.

2022/08/11,"After months of rumors that Tesla is going to use BYD’s blade batteries at Gigafactory Shanghai, there’s a surprising turn of events that suggest Tesla is actually going to use the new battery cells at Gigafactory Berlin, and it reportedly already took delivery of the first cells.
In 2020, BYD, a China-based electric vehicle and battery company, introduced its new bladed battery cell. The new cells use LFP chemistry, but the new form factor, which looks like a blade, is the real innovation enabling a safer cell and higher energy density at the pack level, according to the company.
BYD wrote in a press release:
While undergoing nail penetration tests, the Blade Battery emitted neither smoke nor fire after being penetrated, and its surface temperature only reached 30 to 60°C. Under the same conditions, a ternary lithium battery exceeded 500°C and violently burned, and while a conventional lithium iron phosphate block battery did not openly emit flames or smoke, its surface temperature reached dangerous temperatures of 200 to 400°C. This implies that EVs equipped with the Blade Battery would be far less susceptible to catching fire – even when they are severely damaged.
While this feature obviously offers great safety advantages, it also delivers thermal management improvements, and BYD claims the form factor enables energy density improvements by eliminating the need for modules.
It goes directly from cell to pack, not unlike Tesla’s structural battery pack technology.
In 2021, we first heard rumors that Tesla was testing BYD’s new “blade batteries” for a potential supply partnership last year.
When the report came out last year about Tesla testing the new cell from BYD, it stated that Tesla already had the cells in test vehicles and that it could start deliveries for production in the second quarter of 2022.
Earlier this year, BYD confirmed that it is about to start supplying Tesla (TSLA) with battery cells. It was presumed that those cells would go to Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai.
Now a new report coming from Sina says that the cells are actually going to Gigafactory Berlin and that the first vehicles with the cells could roll off of the factory within a month (translated from Chinese):
On the afternoon of August 10, a number of people familiar with the matter revealed that the blade battery supplied by BYD has been delivered to Tesla’s Gigafactory in Berlin, Germany, which is also Tesla’s first super factory to use BYD batteries. Tesla vehicles can roll off the assembly line in as little as one month (that is, the end of August to the beginning of September). It was also learned from another source that the Shanghai Gigafactory, which has attracted much attention, has no plans to use BYD batteries for the time being.
This is a surprising turn of events if it turns out to be true, but neither Tesla nor BYD are confirming right now, though BYD has previously confirmed plans to supply Tesla with battery cells.

2022/08/11,"Tesla has started converting its Tesla Energy fleet to Model Y electric SUVs and Model 3 sedans, getting rid of their gas-powered vehicles.
When Tesla Energy shows up at a customer’s home, it does with vans and cars powered by gasoline, which isn’t the best look for the world’s leader in electrification – but Tesla is looking to address that.
The automaker has already integrated some of its own vehicles in its energy fleet for site surveys and things like what is pictured above (picture via u/demuhnator on Reddit), but now it is expanding the use with vehicles for installations and more.
In a Tesla Energy-wide company meeting obtained by Electrek yesterday, a Tesla manager confirmed that the company has been integrating Tesla Model Ys and Model 3s into its fleet:
We have been doing a great job working with our vehicle teams to get us into some Model Ys. We already got the first batch deployed across the country in different offices, and our plan is to continue electrification by getting Model Ys and Model 3s to replace every vehicle that they can one for one.
 The manager continued:
Looking over the course of this next quarter, we are really going to start getting rid of the Chevys we have in our fleet and some of the Sprinter vans and the other vehicles where applicable to replace them with Model 3s and Model Ys, so that when we install at a customer’s house, we are showing up with a fleet of Teslas.
Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys are not necessarily the best-equipped vehicles for that purpose, which is why Tesla has been using vans, but the automaker has been adapting its own vehicles when possible.
In 2018, Tesla started moving its own mobile service fleet from vans to Model S vehicles that had a modified interior to fit tools:
Tesla could do something similar with its Model Y to be able to easily fit solar panels and Powerwalls for installations.
Soon, you could see Tesla showing up for your solar installation with Model Ys and Model 3s.

2022/08/11,"Ford CEO Jim Farley has called out Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker’s lead in electric pickup trucks. 
Musk responded. Do we have a little friendly competition in the electric pickup market?
In the auto industry, or any competitive industry really, it is rare that CEOs will directly call each other out or even mention the other company in order to avoid highlighting the competition.
Of course, it still happens every now and again.
It actually happens somewhat frequently with Tesla since the automaker has built such an incredible lead when it comes to electric vehicles that it is hard not to acknowledge it. 
Ford CEO Jim Farley has had great things to say about Tesla in the past. Last year, Ford’s CEO praised Tesla in an internal meeting where he said “no one does electric better.”
But now he actually has an area where Ford does electric better, and that’s electric pickup trucks.
Farley commented during a press event to announce Ford and DTE Energy’s deal for the largest renewable energy purchase in US history:
We’re really on a mission at Ford to lead an electric and digital revolution for many, not few, And I have to say the shining light for us at Ford is this beautiful Lightning made right down the road in Dearborn, right here in the state of Michigan, already the leader of all EV pickup trucks in our industry in the United States. Take that, Elon Musk.
The comment even prompted a response from Musk on Twitter who said, “Thanks, but I already have one” – seemingly referring to the Tesla Cybertruck.
Farley is not wrong. Ford has quickly built a lead in electric pickup trucks with the F-150 Lightning.
Rivian was actually first to market with the R1T electric pickup, but even though Ford started producing about six months later, the automaker was quickly able to catch up to the startup by using its mighty manufacturing capability.
As for Tesla, Musk might have his own Cybertruck, but it’s a prototype and one of only a few.
Tesla first unveiled the Cybertruck in 2019 and claimed that it would go into production in 2020, which would have made Tesla the first to market with an electric pickup truck.
However, the vehicle program was delayed several times, and now Tesla plans to bring the Cybertruck to market in 2023.
Farley is not wrong. While Tesla still dominates the EV market, especially in the US, Ford certainly has the lead when it comes to electric pickup trucks.
However, he might come to regret his words. You can never count Tesla out in my opinion.
Ford has accelerated its planned production for the Lightning to a rate of 150,000 units to be achieved around mid-2023 when Tesla also plans to be in volume production with the Cybertruck, according to Musk’s most recent comments.
If there’s something Tesla has been incredible at over the last few years is ramping electric vehicles to mass production.
I am not saying it will, but I wouldn’t be completely shocked if Cybertruck ends up catching up to the Lightning in terms of total production by 2025. We will have to wait and see.

2022/08/10,"In an internal meeting, Tesla teased new and updated energy products coming later this year along with a better customer front-end for solar installations.
Tesla’s energy division definitely lives in the shadows of its automotive business. When most people think “Tesla,” they think of electric cars, but the company has had a renewed focus on energy products lately through its Tesla Energy division.
We noted that Tesla’s solar division had its best quarter in four years last quarter. Some of the improvements have been achieved through an improved product offering.
In an internal Tesla Energy-wide meeting obtained by Electrek today, Tesla explained that it improved its energy product offering by going from a mix of third-party equipment to Tesla equipment with its own software integration over the last two years.
During the meeting, Seth Winger, senior manager of solar products engineering at Tesla, said that new and updated Tesla Energy products are coming this year:
The engineer said that he can’t reveal specifics yet, but he commented:
In 2022, we are heavily investing in Tesla products. I can’t say exactly what is coming we want to maintain confidentiality but across the board on PVs, on Solar Roof, on Powerwall look forward to greatly improved installation efficiency, aesthetic, and product performance.
Winger also said that some people on the call know it already – and if they do, they should “keep it a secret” – but there are pilot programs coming soon.
Electrek recently reported that Tesla is testing a new version of Solar Roof (v3.5) on employees’ homes, but Winger now makes it sound like Tesla is also working on a new and updated Powerwall and solar panels.
During the call, Tesla also announced that it is about to deploy a new “Intereactive layout experience” for customers.
A Tesla manager said that customers are going to be able to interact directly with the layout and help Tesla with the project:
Customers are going to be able to engage with zero-touch layouts. They are going to be able to see a max kW design in their Tesla account.
They are going to be able to tell Tesla things like where to drop its equipment for the project.
The company is still working on the new interface, but based on early testing, Tesla expects that the new portal is going to reduce post-permit redesign requests by 20%, utility rejections by 30%, and “average handle time (chat)” by 10%.
Internally, Tesla is also updating its grid UI to more easily and quickly understand the status of a job flow.
The company is hoping that these new products and tools will help Tesla Energy achieves new highs during the second half of the year.

2022/08/10,"A Tesla Full Self-Driving smear campaign started by a California billionaire running for Senate has a new attack ad based on a FSD Beta “test,” where they failed to realize they never engaged FSD Beta during the test.
Earlier this year, we reported on Dan O’Dowd, a self-described billionaire and founder of Green Hills Software, a privately owned company that makes operating systems and programming tools.
O’Dowd had launched a Senate campaign in his home state of California, but the tech executive made it quite clear that he is making it a single-issue campaign, and that issue is Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program.
Under the protection of political ads, he invested several million dollars in an ad campaign to attack Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta program with the goal of having it banned from public roads in the US.
Yesterday, the campaign, called The Dawn Project, released this ad titled “The Dangers of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Software”:
As the video and its description explain, O’Dowd’s team claims that this is a test of Tesla’s “latest version of Full Self-Driving Beta software (10.12.2),” where the system crashes into a child-size mannequin:
Our safety test of the capability of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology to avoid a stationary mannequin of a small child has conclusively demonstrated that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software does not avoid the child or even slow down when a child-sized mannequin is in plain view.
However, there’s a real problem with the test: They never activated Tesla’s FSD Beta in the test.
On its website, The Dawn Project describes the test and claims that “Full Self-Driving mode” was “engaged” (step 3 and 4 in their descriptions are the important ones):
According to their test results, FSD Beta was activated at 40 mph within 100 yards of the dummy, and in three tests, it always struck the dummy between 24 and 27 mph:
These results would point to the driver failing to activate the FSD Beta, and the car slowing down to those speeds over 100 yards before hitting the target.
Sure enough, The Dawn Project’s own video of the test shows the driver “activating” FSD Beta by pressing on the Autopilot stalk, but we can clearly see that it didn’t activate because the course prediction line stays grey and the Autopilot wheel doesn’t appear on the top left:
In addition, the vehicle keeps pushing an alert that can’t be read due to the resolution of the video. It’s possible that the alert is related to FSD Beta.
The vehicle does appear to be equipped with FSD Beta, or at least FSD Beta visualization, but it clearly wasn’t activated during this video.
The explanation is likely quite simple. Tesla FSD Beta still relies on map data, and this test was performed on a closed course at Willow Springs International Raceway in Rosamond, California.
Electrek reached out to The Dawn Project to point out to them that unlike what they claim, Tesla FSD Beta was never “engaged” during the test based on their own footage in the ad.
They contacted me back, but they could only provide an affidavit from the driver who conducted the test, Art Haynie, claiming in the sworn statement that he believed FSD Beta was activated:
The affidavit mentions that there’s an “Exhibit B” that showed a screen with a warning “regarding the full self-driving (Beta)” that the vehicle showed when it was “in full self-driving mode.”
However, when I looked at Exhibit B, it was only a screenshot of the warning that appears when you accept the FSD Beta agreement in the car’s settings menu, and not when you activate or engage it:
This warning doesn’t appear when you activate the feature while driving and doesn’t prove in any way that FSD Beta was active during the test.
The Dawn Project’s PR team didn’t respond when I showed them a screenshot of their own video showing that FSD Beta was not engaged, and they didn’t respond when I asked if they still planned on running the ad, which already has over 240,000 hits on Youtube since being posted yesterday (and for which comments have been turned off), and many more on broadcast television.
Update: The Dawn Project has since released additional footage that doesn’t appear in its ad where we can see that they were able to activate FSD, however, the footage is inconsistent with the results published about the test and in the ad.
For example, in the first run, we can see that FSD sends an alert to grab the wheel well before the point of impact and the impact happens under 20 mph, which is inconsistent with the results claiming that impact happened at 24, 27, and 25 mph:
I downloaded their raw footage. You might want to verify again. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/21TvCbZicv
Therefore, it’s clear that The Dawn Project is manipulating the result and footage of those tests, and the ad clearly shows that FSD Beta is not active.
Look, everyone who has been following this blog knows that I’m no FSD Beta apologist. I find the system impressive, but I know it has serious issues.
I recently compared its performance to “the equivalent of a 14-year-old who has been learning to drive for the last week and sometimes appears to consume hard drugs“. To be fair to the Tesla team, you could give me $1 billion and a thousand years, and I couldn’t get a car to drive like a 14-year-old on drugs.
I do believe that the system’s computer vision is extremely good, but some of the decision-making is really questionable.
That said, you can’t produce a test of FSD Beta where you don’t even activate FSD Beta properly. The Dawn Project and O’Dowd screwed up big time posting this. They should take this down right now considering they can’t claim that they don’t know the test was a failure at this point.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/08/10,"Tesla lost its fastest lap record for a production series electric car at the Nürburgring race track to Porsche Taycan, which originally held the record and motivated Tesla to beat it.
After Porsche brought its brand-new Taycan electric car to the Nürburgring racetrack to break a record in 2019, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to use the famous proving grounds for the electric automaker’s own latest performance vehicle.
Tesla started testing early Model S Plaid prototypes at the track and achieved some impressive lap times. However, the vehicle was delayed, and it didn’t launch until two years later.
Last year, Tesla brought its then brand-new Model S Plaid to the Nürburgring track and beat Porsche’s record with an impressive 7:35.579 lap.
It looks like Tesla beating it in its own backyard didn’t sit right with Porsche because the German automaker has brought the latest version of the Taycan electric back to Nürburgring and announced that it managed to improve its time – beating Tesla by two seconds:
Never before has a series-production electric car posted a faster lap on the Nürburgring Nordschleife: Porsche development driver Lars Kern took just seven minutes and 33 seconds for a lap in the Taycan Turbo S.
However, Porsche is pushing the limits of what a “production series electric car” is for the record as the Taycan was equipped with a new “performance kit” that is “only available in Germany and only for the 2023 model year Taycan Turbo S sports sedan.”
Porsche explains the new kit in a press release:
The performance kit includes 21-inch RS-Spyder-design wheels with road-approved, Pirelli P Zero Corsa sports tyres that are now available for the Taycan. Their tyre compound is similar to that of racing tyres. Another element of the performance kit is a software update to the Porsche 4D Chassis Control so that it works in harmony with the sports tyres. The system analyses and synchronises all the chassis systems of the Taycan in real time. “In the past, only thoroughbred super sports cars got into the 7:33 range,” says Kern. “With the new performance kit I was able to push even harder, and the car was even more precise and agile to boot.”

2022/08/10,"Elon Musk announced that the Tesla Semi electric truck with 500 miles of range is going to start shipping this year.
After unveiling the Tesla Semi in 2017, the company first guided a start of production in 2019.
This was delayed many times, but in the summer of 2020, CEO Elon Musk said that “it’s time to bring Tesla Semi to volume production.”
Last summer, Electrek revealed that Tesla made progress toward Tesla Semi production at a low-volume facility near Gigafactory Nevada.
Shortly after, Tesla unveiled a new small fleet of “Tesla Semi” electric trucks, but Tesla said that it shifted the “launch” of the Tesla Semi program to 2022 due to battery supply constraints.
While Tesla appeared to be building new electric trucks in low volume, it wasn’t clear if the company would stick to its new timeline of delivering its first units to customers in 2022 as Musk later said not to expect new products to be delivered in 2022 as Tesla focused on ramping up production of Model 3 and Model Y.
Now in a surprise announcement on Twitter today, Musk said that Tesla would start delivering the Tesla Semi with a 500-mile range this year:
Tesla 500 mile range Semi Truck starts shipping this year, Cybertruck next year
The CEO made the comment in reference to his “Master Plan, Part Deux” where he first mentioned the idea of Tesla building an electric semitruck.
By “shipping,” one would assume that Musk is talking about Tesla delivering the electric truck to customers. The company has been taking orders for the truck since 2017 and built a significant backlog.
It’s not clear who is going to get the Tesla Semi first, but PepsiCo is a likely contender.
After the launch of Tesla Semi in 2017, PepsiCo placed one of the biggest orders for Tesla Semi: 100 electric trucks to add to its fleet.
The company planned to use 15 of those trucks for a project to turn its Frito-Lay Modesto, California, site into a zero-emission facility.
Last year, PepsiCo said that it expected to take deliveries of those 15 Tesla Semi trucks by the end of the year before it was delayed again.
While the company didn’t get its Tesla Semi trucks last year, Tesla did install a Megacharger station for the trucks at its Modesto facility, which indicates that deliveries are getting closer.

2022/08/09,"Tesla has disclosed that CEO Elon Musk sold around $6.9 billion worth of Tesla (TSLA) shares last week.
It’s a significant chunk of his Tesla stake, but the reason behind the sale is unknown as of now. A Twitter settlement maybe?
Update: Musk has commented on the sale, and we have added those comments to the end of this article.
Today, Tesla released a series of SEC filings on Tuesday evening revealing that Elon Musk has sold significant numbers of Tesla stocks starting last Friday and up to today:
It adds up to around $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares over the last week.
Tesla nor Musk have revealed the reason for the sale at this point.
As of the last filing and sale of shares today, Musk still holds 155,039,144 Tesla shares, which is worth $131.7 billion at today’s closing price of $850 per share.
After Tesla went public in 2010, Elon Musk often said that he would be the “last one to sell Tesla stocks.”
The CEO periodically had to do it to cover his taxes after receiving large stock compensations, which is something he did warn would happen amid his promise not to sell Tesla.
However, paying taxes turned out not to be the only reason he would sell Tesla stocks.
In late 2021, Musk said he would sell 10% of his stake in Tesla if a Twitter poll agreed, which it unsurprisingly did.
The CEO framed the idea as pressure from the media and politicians about the rich not paying taxes on unrealized gains.
However, Musk wasn’t as vocal about the fact that he was facing a giant tax bill regardless of his sale of shares, due to a large number of stock options he needs to exercise over the next year. More importantly, the CEO did end up selling more Tesla shares than he needed to cover his tax burden from the stock options being exercised.
In December 2021, Musk announced that he was done selling Tesla.
A few months later, we learned that he used some of that extra money from selling those shares to invest roughly $3 billion in Twitter.
Soon after, Musk announced a deal to buy Twitter and take it private. The CEO again broke his promise to be the last one to sell Tesla shares and sold about $8 billion worth to cover some of the equity needed in the deal.
Now a judge will be the one to decide whether or not Musk is going to buy Twitter since the CEO has backed out of the deal claiming that Twitter is lying about the percentage of daily users who are bots and the company is suing him to complete the deal.
Update: Musk claimed on Twitter that he is “done selling” and suggested that the purpose of this sale was to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock in the event that the Twitter deal closes. He also stated that he would “buy Tesla stock again” if the Twitter deal doesn’t close. But he claimed the same thing in April (and, as mentioned above, December), then went on to sell $6.5 billion in stock last week as reported in this article.
The reason behind the sale is not clear, but at this point, Musk has made it clear that his “last one to sell Tesla” promise comes with several exceptions.
It’s not impossible that Musk has come to a settlement with Twitter, and he is selling to cover more of the equity portion of the deal, but that’s pure speculation at this point.
Why do you think Musk sold $6.5 billion worth of Tesla shares? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/08/09,"Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have become the second-best and best-selling vehicles in California, helping electric vehicle sales reach a new record in the state.
California has long been a leader in the US when it comes to EV adoption.
There are many reasons for that: state incentive, a general interest in new technology in the state, but also the fact that until recently, it was home to Tesla, the largest EV company in the world. Tesla holds massive market shares in the US electric vehicle market, which California is a big part of.
This week, the California New Car Dealer Association (CNCDA) released their Q2 2022 numbers that are giving us some insights into Tesla’s sales in the state.
CNCDA confirmed that Tesla Model Y and Model 3 are the two best-selling vehicles in the state for the first half of 2022:
The Tesla Model Y reigns as the top-selling car in the California market with 42,320 registrations so far this year. In second place: the Tesla Model 3 with 38,993 units sold, further indicating the statewide demand for EVs. New registrations of the Honda Civic, Toyota Camry and Corolla, the state’s top-selling mainstays, were impacted by inventory shortages but still remained at the top of their segment categories.
The two electric vehicles beat everything – even the most popular pickup trucks.
When you compare them to their segments, it truly highlights their dominance:
Tesla’s Model S and Model X are also not doing badly despite still being ramped up following the design refresh last year:
Tesla’s strong performance in California is propelling electric vehicle market share to new highs.
According to the latest report from CNCDA, EV sales are now at 15% of the entire California auto market:
That compares to about 7% for the broader United States.
That’s amid an auto market that is still suffering from supply chain issues. According to the report, Tesla and Genesis are the only two brands that are growing so far in 2022 in California:
This is where things start to move fast. It took a decade to go from 1% to 15% market share, but I think it’s going to take two years to go from 15% to 50% market share. Mark my words.
Also, you are still going to see a lot of those brands in the red – that steep increase in market shares I’m talking about will not just be because of more electric vehicles, but also because fewer people are going to want to buy new ICE cars.
The brands that are too slow in bringing EVs to market and stick to a mostly ICE offering are going to see their sales decline while EV grows, which is going to accelerate EV market share at a wild pace.

2022/08/09,"Tesla’s (TSLA) sales in China are down more than 60% month-to-month in July, but Gigafactory Shanghai’s planned upgrade is to blame.
After a tough Q2 in China due to the restrictions in the city of Shanghai forcing Tesla to shut down its factory, the automaker started to ramp production back up again with 78,906 vehicles and exported 968 in June 2022.
Today, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released its July numbers and confirmed that Tesla sold 28,217 Chinese-made vehicles and exported 19,756 vehicles in July 2022.
Those numbers are down significantly month-to-month, but it is understandable considering Tesla had another shutdown at Gigafactory Shanghai in July – though this time it was planned.
At the end of July and through the first week of August, Tesla shut down its most productive factory in order to perform upgrades that it believes will increase capacity to about 21,000 vehicles per week or 1 million vehicles per year.
This factory upgrade is likely also going to affect Tesla’s results in August, but the automaker should be able to catch up going forward with the new capacity.
In recent years, Gigafactory Shanghai has become Tesla’s most productive factory, and the automaker turned it into its “export hub” – exporting many Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to European and Asia-Pacific markets.
But it also supplies the Chinese market with Tesla vehicles, and it remains the most important market for Tesla and other EV automakers.
China’s overall passenger car sales in July jumped 20.1% year-over-year to 1.84 million units, and electric vehicles accounted for an impressive 26.4% of the total sales. That number also includes plug-in hybrids.
BYD is leading the dance with a record 163,042 electric vehicles delivered in July, but more than half are plug-in hybrids.
When it comes to all-electric vehicles other than Tesla’s, Nio and Xpeng respectively delivered 10,052 and 11,524 units in the market in July.
Based on the timing of the factory upgrade, I think August and September might not be the best months to look at since Tesla could still be ramping up the new capacity during that time.
But Q4 could be really interesting. I can see Tesla delivering 250,000 vehicles out of Gigafactory Shanghai alone in Q4.
Likely 150,000 from Fremont factory. That would already be a record of 400,000 units and then Gigafactory Berlin and Texas are hard to predict, but they would hopefully start to contribute significant outputs by then.

2022/08/08,"During its inaugural partner’s conference in Shanghai, autonomous-centric robotic car brand JIDU shared details of its lofty production expansion goals overseas. Furthermore, the CEO of parent company Baidu, said JIDU’s autonomous driving technology will “lead the Tesla generation.” 
In January of 2021, Baidu announced it was expanding from software development into physical EV production, joining forces with Geely to produce a new breed of EVs. By March, the JIDU marque was officially unveiled on the heels of $300 million in startup capital. That amount was followed by another $400 million in Series A funding in January of 2022, led by Baidu.
JIDU’s market strategy is a focus on popularizing autonomous driving and human-machine interaction technologies, beginning with its flagship EV which will be based on a concept called the ROBO-01.
Since first teasing the ROBO-01, JIDU quickly began touting it as the nameplate for fully-autonomous EVs that combine interactive robot emotion with artificial intelligence within the driving experience. We got our first full glimpse of ROBO-01 during JIDU’s ROBOCAR Day in June, showcasing a retractable yoke steering wheel powered by JIDU’s steer-by-wire technology that can fold up during autonomous driving mode. 
According to JIDU, the ROBO-01’s autonomous driving system utilizes two Nvidia Orin X chips and is equipped with thirty-one external sensors including two LiDARs, five millimeter-wave radars, twelve ultrasonic radars, and twelve cameras.
During its latest public event in China earlier today, JIDU’s CEO shared some bold production goals for the decade and was joined by CEOs of both JIDU parents – Baidu and Geely – one of which called out Tesla’s autonomous driving capabilities directly.
The main focus of JIDU’s partner conference held in China today was to share news of its “2880” strategy, which entails JIDU’s ambitions to deliver 800,000 robot EVs annually by 2028. 
The CEO shared that JIDU intends to officially launch a limited, production model version of the ROBO-01 this fall that will bear a 90% resemblance to the concept. Mass production of JIDU’s first EV will then ramp up in 2023. Xia also followed up by sharing plans for a second mass produced JIDU model scheduled for 2024. 
Baidu CEO Robin Li also spoke during the event, explaining how JIDU is expect to inherit Baidu’s AI technology and autonomous driving technology in Apollo, and take it to a whole new level. Li elaborated:
For smart cars, our judgment is that electrification is halftime and intelligence is the endgame. 
Li went to say that in terms of autonomous driving technology, JIDU is expected to lead Tesla by an entire generation. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) continues to make progress through beta, but is still years late for its originally promised delivery date. Its full rollout has been continuously punted to give the American automaker more time to figure it out .
Unlike JIDU and most other EV automakers developing autonomous driving technologies, Tesla has long foregone using LiDAR. 
The production intent version of the ROBO-01 concept is expected to be revealed soon, followed by the public’s first glimpse of the exterior design of JIDU’s second “robocar” model at the Guangzhou Auto Show in late 2022.

2022/08/08,"Tesla has launched a new “Ownership Loyalty Program” with some significant discounts – something that CEO Elon Musk has said Tesla wouldn’t do. But the program is only in China for now.
Aside from the $1,000 discount with the now defunct referral program and other discounts on display models, loaners, and test drive vehicles, Tesla made a policy of always offering the same prices everywhere, aside from the difference in exchange rates and import duties.
CEO Elon Musk referred to it as a “no negotiation and no discount policy,” which differentiate Tesla from the dealership model. However, we have seen the automaker deviate from the policy at times, especially during end-of-quarter delivery pushes.
But now Tesla is taking an even bigger step away from the policy by launching a new “Ownership Loyalty Program” that includes some significant discounts (Ray4Tesla via on Twitter).
Tesla is telling owners of all current models that if they decide to upgrade to a new vehicle, they will receive these three incentives:
These add up to quite a significant discount that might make Tesla drivers outside of China jealous if the automaker doesn’t decide to expand the program outside the country.
The FSD discount is also interesting because there’s an asterisk to it: To get the discount, the trade-in needs to have either Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving package.
Tesla owners have been asking for years to have their FSD package be transferable to a new purchase. While Tesla is not going as far as doing that here, it is the closest it has ever been.
Free Supercharging of 15,000 km (9,300 miles) is also significant and a lot more than the 1,000 miles that Tesla used to offer as part of the referral program.
This is a surprising move from Tesla. Is the automaker finally having some demand issues in China? If there’s anywhere in the world where Tesla has strong competition, it’s definitely in China.
This is more than $6,000 in value that Tesla is giving owners to upgrade right now, but it’s likely a good deal for the automaker too, considering how strong the used car market is right now. 
Also, I am not sure if that’s the case in China, but Tesla is not always the one giving out the best prices for its own cars in trade-ins. That’s something to take into account with the new $6,000 Ownership Loyalty Program.

2022/08/08,"Tesla has disclosed that it is lobbying the Ontario government for a potential new factory in Canada. The new lobbying effort comes after several hints from Tesla CEO Elon Musk in regards to building a Gigafactory in the country.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Musk, during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America and the CEO hinted to Canada.
Musk did it again at Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting last week.
Now Electric Autonomy Canada reports a new lobbying disclosure from Tesla in Ontario revealing that the company is engaging with the government to reform permitting and for possible incentives regarding an “advanced manufacturing facility.”
In Canada, companies have to disclose all their lobbying efforts with the government.
Tesla wrote in the filing filed last month:
Engage with the government and its agencies to identify opportunities for industrial and/or advanced manufacturing facility permitting reforms with the intent to increase the competitiveness of Ontario and its ability to attract capital investment through establishing approvals timeframes that are competitive with high-growth manufacturing locations in North America, while also working with government to identify or align incentives programs that could further increase the attractiveness of Ontario for industrial and/or advanced manufacturing investment.
Tesla has made it clear that a quick permitting experience to get approval to build is now the biggest incentive a region can give it to convince the company to choose them for a new factory. The automaker doesn’t want to repeat the experience of building Gigafactory Berlin in Germany, which was stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare for the better part of a year.
Tesla is looking for something closer to the experience it had in Austin for Gigafactory Texas, which was built in a record time.
If Tesla has set its eyes on Canada for its next factory, and it looks like it did, I think the company is likely looking to make Quebec and Ontario compete for the factory; both provinces have fairly large populations, and they both have a history of automotive production.
They have both been investing heavily into electric vehicles. Quebec has had a lead in EV adoption, but Ontario has attracted more investments for production.
Like Tesla is hinting in the lobbying disclosure, I think it’s going to come down to how smooth they can make the permitting experience, and I think that’s going to be a challenge for both provinces.

2022/08/08,"Tesla has reportedly agreed to a deal with the Indonesian government that will secure the automaker about $5 billion worth of nickel, according to a government official.
In 2020, we reported on Tesla allegedly being in talks with the Indonesian government to build a new nickel venture in the country, which has a strong nickel reserve – nickel is one of the main materials used in the production of cathodes for battery cells used in electric vehicles. The move came after CEO Elon Musk pleaded with mining companies to increase their nickel production.
As we detailed in our previous report on Tesla’s interest in Indonesia, the country is one of the world’s biggest nickel producers, but it has also recently put a ban on exporting nickel ore in order to encourage the industry to process it locally.
Indonesia hopes that the measure will encourage companies to invest in manufacturing finished products in the country using their nickel, like batteries.
There has certainly been strong interest from Tesla to establish a relationship with Indonesia.
Earlier this year, Tesla sent a group to Indonesia to talk with the government, and Elon Musk met with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.
However, the automaker’s actual intentions in the country have not been clear, and rumors have been all over the place. 
In May 2022, Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said that Tesla had “agreed” to “build a battery and electric vehicle plant.” At the time, we noted that the comment should be taken with a grain of salt at this point since the government seems to still be negotiating with Tesla.
Sure enough, three months later, there has been no further announcement on Tesla building an actual factory in the country, but now another government official talks about an actual signed agreement.
Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan announced Monday that Tesla has “signed a five-year contract with nickel processing companies operating out of Morowali in Sulawesi island” (via Reuters).
Pandjaitan added:
We are still in constant negotiation with Tesla… but they have started buying two excellent products from Indonesia.
The government official made it sound like it is purely a supply contract – though the country’s regulations would indicate that the nickel would need to be processed in the country before being exported by Tesla to be used in battery manufacturing.
It was recently revealed that Tesla has a strong partnership with Vale to secure nickel, and the Brazilian mining giant is known to have strong operations in Indonesia.

2022/08/06,"Tesla is in hot water with California DMV over its Autopilot and self-driving claims, which the agency believes are deceptive. The company has two weeks to respond to the inquiry, or it risks temporarily losing its licenses to operate as a vehicle manufacturer and auto dealer in California.
Over the years, Tesla has been criticized for how it advertises its Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). One of the main concerns has been the actual names of the systems: Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability. Some people believe that the names suggest that the systems are autonomous, even though they are only driver-assist systems.
California DMV, which has some authority over Tesla since it has a lot of operations in the state, has shared those concerns in the past.
Now it is putting pressure on Tesla with not one but two filings with California’s Office of Administrative Hearings, claiming that Tesla is falsely promoting those systems as “autonomous” (via CNBC):
Instead of simply identifying product or brand names, these “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving Capability” labels and descriptions represent that vehicles equipped with the ADAS features will operate as an autonomous vehicle, but vehicles equipped with those ADAS features could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles.
The DMV is taking a two-pronged approach where it is pushing for Tesla to change its marketing around Autopilot and Full Self-Driving and also separately probing the capabilities of Tesla’s system as part of a safety review.
Last year, Tesla’s communications with the DMV over Full Self-Driving were released, and they brought some confusion. Some of the comments made by Tesla to the DMV could be interpreted as contradicting what Tesla and Elon Musk are saying publicly.
Tesla has been trying to convince the DMV that its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta is not a level 4 or 5 self-driving system so it doesn’t have to report data back to the DMV.
On the advertising front, California DMV’s deputy director for the Office of Public Affairs, Anita Gore, said:
It “will ask that Tesla will be required to advertise to consumers and better educate Tesla drivers about the capabilities of its ‘Autopilot’ and ‘Full Self-Driving’ features, including cautionary warnings regarding the limitations of the features, and for other actions as appropriate given the violations.”
Tesla has now 15 days to respond to the inquiries from the DMV, or it is at risk to lose its licenses to operate as a vehicle manufacturer and auto dealer in California

2022/08/05,"Tesla Cybertruck reservation holders got a minor update on the upcoming electric truck at Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting. CEO Elon Musk confirmed that it is going to have a higher price than previously announced, and that production equipment is about to be installed.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023, and in June, Musk said that Tesla is aiming for production to start in mid-2023.
If the automaker sticks to the new timeline, it is less than a year away, but there are still a lot of unknowns. When Tesla first unveiled the vehicle, the automaker revealed three versions of the electric pickup truck starting at $40,000:
However, Tesla removed Cybertruck specs and prices from its website late last year. An update on pricing and specs has been expected ever since.
When asked if Tesla is going to increase Cybertruck prices and if it will honor the prices originally announced in 2019 at Tesla’s shareholder’s meeting yesterday, Musk responded:
Cybertruck pricing, it was unveiled in 2019, and the reservation was $99 – and a lot of changed since then. The specs and the pricing will be different. I know it’s a little bit of bad news, but there was no way to anticipate the inflation that happened and various issues, but what I can say is that Cybertruck is going to be one hell of a product. It’s going to be a damn fine machine.
It sounds like we can expect a price increase and different specs for the Cybertruck.
During the meeting, the CEO again said that Tesla is tracking to start Cybertruck production in the middle of 2023, though this time he specified “volume production.”
He added:
We are going to be installing production equipment in the coming months.
Tesla plans to build Cybertruck at Gigafactory Texas in Austin, and we recently reported that Idra is about to deliver a new giant Giga press designed to produce the Cybertruck’s body.

2022/08/05,"Tesla revealed that Model Y is on track to be the world’s highest-selling car by revenue this year, and it will likely be the best-selling vehicle by total volume next year.
It’s already the world’s best-selling electric car.
People often like to poke fun at Tesla CEO Elon Musk for his predictions that didn’t turn out to be true, and rightfully so, especially for things like his self-driving timeline; but we also have to give credit where credit is due.
Before Tesla ever brought the Model Y to market in 2020, Musk made some bold predictions about how popular the vehicle will become. Musk said that he anticipated Model Y demand would be about twice as high as demand for Model 3, which was already the best-selling electric car at the time. Back in 2016, the CEO put demand for the Model Y between 500,000 to 1 million units per year. That was four years before releasing the vehicle.
Now after two years on the market, Musk’s predictions are becoming true.
At Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting yesterday, Musk made the announcement that the Tesla Model Y is on track to become the world’s best-selling vehicle. More specifically, the electric SUV is going to be the best-selling vehicle in the world by revenue this year, and the company expects that it will be the best-selling vehicle by volume next year once Tesla has ramped up production at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
Currently, the best-selling vehicle in the world is Toyota Corolla with around 1,150,000 sales.
Tesla doesn’t breakdown sales between the Model 3 and Model Y, but the latter is expected to have surpassed the former, and Tesla is reporting a capacity of around 300,000 of those vehicles per quarter.
At Gigafactory Texas and Berlin, Tesla is exclusively producing the Model Y. By the end of the year, Tesla is expected to have the capacity to produce over 1 million Model Y vehicles per year.

The CEO added:
10 years ago, we had made less than 3,000 cars, now here we stand, 10 years later, having made 3 million cars.
Just last month, Tesla announced that Fremont factory had produced its 2 millionth electric car. The other million vehicles came from Gigafactory Shanghai, Berlin and Texas, which are all still ramping up production.
Musk noted that Tesla’s fleet size growth is so smooth that when you chart it, it looks like one of those business plan charts made to impress potential investors:
Looking forward, Musk wondered about where Tesla will be in another 10 years:
What about the next 10 years? I’ll be surprised if it’s not over 100 million in 10 years.
Tesla has famously set a goal to be able to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030. At the meeting, Musk said that he believes Tesla will need about 12 Gigafactories in order to achieve that goal. The automaker is already operating four Gigafactories, though it is still ramping up production at all those locations.
Considering it takes a few years for Tesla to build a new factory and ramp up to volume production, the automaker is going to need to start adding new factories fast in the coming years.
At the meeting today, Musk said that Tesla is likely to announce the next Gigafactory location later this year. 
Tesla aims to exit 2022 with an annualized production rate of two million vehicles per year. Many more factories are expected to be announced soon in order to grow that number by an order of magnitude within eight years.

2022/08/04,"Tesla has teased its Optimus humanoid robot prototype with a new image, ahead of a full unveiling planned for September 30.
Earlier this year, CEO Elon Musk announced “Tesla AI Day #2” with “many cool updates” on August 19.
The original “Tesla AI Day” held last year was an event focused on the company’s self-driving program. The automaker also unveiled its Dojo supercomputer and announced plans for the “Tesla Bot” humanoid robot – now known as Tesla Optimus.
The AI Day #2 was supposed to be held a year to the day after the first one, but Musk took to Twitter in June to delay the event to September 30. As for the reason for the delay, the CEO said that Tesla may have a working prototype of Optimus by then.
Now at Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting, Musk released a new image of the Tesla Optimus to promote the upcoming AI Day #2 event:
The image appears to feature the robotic hands of the actual Tesla Optimus prototype.
At the original AI Day, Musk announced the project by bringing a human in a robot custom on stage – which was obviously a joke – but it also brought criticism as a pie-in-the-sky project. However, the CEO has been doubling down on the project.
The CEO even said that the company aims to start production of the robot in 2023, which surprised many. This is an extremely ambitious timeline for such an ambitious project, but Musk said on several occasions that it has become a priority.
In January, the CEO said that Tesla is prioritizing product development of the Optimus humanoid robot in 2022 over other products.
At the event today, Musk again reiterated that he believes that the humanoid robot business should become bigger than Tesla’s automotive business:
I suspect Optimus is going to be more valuable than the car long-term. It will turn the whole notion of the economy on its head.
The CEO previously stated that the Optimus could be a solution to the labor shortage and create a shift in the economy to greatly reduce costs.
Tesla plans to leverage its existing expertise in power electronics and batteries for electric vehicles to build the robot and use its AI expertise to give it a brain.
At first, Musk said that the robot would be programmed to perform simple and repetitive tasks, including in manufacturing operations like Tesla’s own.
Tesla plans for the robot to improve over time and be able to perform a wider range of tasks that would make it useful for both commercial and consumer applications.

2022/08/04,"Elon Musk has teased the announcement of a new Tesla factory location by the end of this year. The CEO hinted strongly that it could be in Canada.
Over the last year, Musk has been talking about Tesla announcing a location for a new gigafactory.
At Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting today, Musk again brought up the upcoming announcement, saying that Tesla might be ready to announce a new location “later this year.”
After teasing the announcement, Musk asked the crowd of Tesla investors:
Where should we build it?
After people yelled a bunch of different locations, Musk said:
We got a lot of Canada. I am half Canadian, maybe I should?
Musk was born in South Africa to a Canadian-born mother.
This is actually the second time that Musk hinted that Tesla’s next factory could be in Canada.
In June, Electrek obtained a recording of a companywide meeting held by Musk during which he confirmed that Tesla is looking at sites in North America.
The meeting included a Q&A with workers. During the Q&A, an employee asked Musk where Tesla’s next factory in the US is going to be located.
Musk said that Tesla hasn’t decided yet, but he did specify that it might not be in the US:
We are looking at sites, but we are considering some sites options more broadly in North America, so including Canada and Mexico, and the US as well.
The CEO made it sound like Tesla is actively looking at sites, but he did make it clear that the priority in North America right now is to ramp Gigafactory Texas to volume production.
The comment made it sound like Tesla is looking more at Canada and Mexico for its next factory.
Electrek also previously reported that Tesla has recently been in talks with the Quebec government amid a multibillion-dollar investment into battery production from the Canadian province.

2022/08/04,"Tesla (TSLA) is holding its annual shareholder’s meeting, which is now called Cyber Roundup, and you can watch it below while following all the most important news coming out of the event.
It starts today at 4:30 PM Central Time at Tesla Gigafactory Texas.
Like every company, Tesla has to hold an annual shareholder’s meeting where shareholders vote on some items like director appointments, stockholder proposals, and some special items.
This year, the main special item is a proposed 3-for-1 stock split.
Shareholders are also going to vote on re-electing Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen WilsonThompson as directors, on reducing director terms to two years, and eliminating applicable supermajority voting requirements. Tesla shareholders have been able to vote by proxy prior to the meeting, and it is very likely that they will announce that all those proposals have been adopted following the reading of them during the formal part of the meeting.
After that, shareholders who submitted proposals will be given a few minutes to present them and the company will announce early voting results for those; they are all related to company governance, and the board has asked shareholders to vote against them. Historically, those get shut down when the board asks to vote against them.
That will be the end of the formal part of the Tesla annual meeting, and then CEO Elon Musk is expected to go on stage to give a presentation that is going to be called “Cyber Roundup.”
You can watch the presentation live right here via Youtube starting at 4:30 PM CT:
Generally, the annual presentation includes a recap of Tesla’s history and more specifically of the year.
Following the presentation, Musk – and sometimes other Tesla executives – are going to take questions from shareholders; both people live at the event.
Here are some of the most upvoted questions:
Tesla isn’t likely to make major announcements, especially when it relates to new products, as the company prefers to keep those for separate events. The company has its “Tesla AI Day” coming on September 30th.
But we still expect some newsworthy comments coming out of the event, and we will post them here:
Tune in at 4:30 PM CT to follow the Tesla Cyber Roundup.

2022/08/04,"Tesla (TSLA) is expected to be about to finally get rid of its “junk bond” rating and become a “blue chip” – something somewhat overdue for the sixth most valuable company in the world.
Despite delivering profits for more than two years straight and building a cash position of over $18 billion while sitting on very little debt, Tesla is still rated as a “junk bond” by rating companies like S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.
Now rating experts and analysts are expecting Tesla to finally be upgraded by the end of the year.
Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Joel Levington commented:
Tesla is still generating a huge amount of cash. At some point ratings companies will have to act and I wouldn’t be surprised to see an upgrade to investment-grade happen before year-end.
While this may not be important for the average investor and Tesla shareholders, but it is a big deal for some large funds that often have a policy not to invest in companies that have anything less than an investment grade rating – often referred to as “blue chips.” This has been preventing some large funds from investing in Tesla.
This resulted in Tesla having a smaller percentage of its shares being held by large institutional investors compared to its peers with extremely large valuations, like Apple and Amazon. 
Tesla was upgraded to BB+, one step below investment grade, by S&P last October and by Moody’s in January.
Nishit Madlani, the head of North American auto-sector ratings at S&P, even stated in June that Tesla is “likely” going to be upgraded by the end of this year.
This is one of the last things that Tesla needs to solidify it as a “blue chip” company.
Obviously, I think that some funds are still going to have issues holding Tesla’s stock for other reasons, like how controversial Elon Musk can be for some people, but for the most part, this is the last of the manageable hurdles.
Now what does it change?
Not much really other than it can bring more stockholders, which reduces the number of shares available to buy and can therefore boost the stock price.
In turn, Tesla can use that to raise more money to put toward its mission – though the automaker doesn’t really need more money right now.

2022/08/03,"Tesla has applied to patent a new multi-band GPS antenna that it believes will be more precise for self-driving and navigation applications.
The automaker describes the new device in the abstract of the new patent application:
A multi-band antenna system is provided. The antenna system can be placed under and embedded within a glass exterior surface of a vehicle. Such an antenna system can include a capacitively coupled metallic element on or adjacent to the glass exterior surface, which can serve as both a parasitic element to enhance gain and as a heating element to melt snow and/or ice accumulation over the glass area that covers the antenna. In certain applications, the antenna’s structure itself can be used as a heater to improve performance in adverse weather conditions while the heating elements are positioned away from the thermally sensitive electronics. The antenna system with integrated heating can include a spiral antenna.
Here are a few images of the new antenna, which is located inside the rear mirror enclosure:
In its claims, Tesla argues that the design can produce a more precise antenna, while reduce power demand, noise, and cost.
The automaker also makes it clear that its GPS system wouldn’t be only used for navigation but also for self-driving applications:
GNSS antenna systems can be useful for providing Global Positioning System (GPS) signals and/or other signals to vehicle systems for different functions involving accurate location information. For example, signals received from a GNSS antenna can be combined with data from other sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors and/or cameras) to plan a route to take a vehicle to a target location, such as summoning the vehicle to the owner or another person. GNSS antenna systems can also be useful for other features that involve precise or general location information such as navigation, autopilot and other self-driving features, searching for nearby gas stations, restaurants, or businesses. GNSS antenna systems can also be useful for relaying precise or general location information for relaying pertinent information regarding the region and local advertisements.
Tesla lists 10 inventors on the patent: Anand Konanur, Shreya Singh, Richard Breden, Yasutaka Horiki,  Aycan Erentok, George Zucker, Nagarjun Bhat, Rui Moreira, Aydin Nabovati, and Rishabh Bhandari.

2022/08/03,"Despite dwindling inventories of BEVs due to supply chain constraints and legacy automakers still playing catchup in BEV production, the demand for electric vehicles continues to rise… and Tesla isn’t the only pony in the race anymore. That being said, Tesla remains the “Nap” in EV sales, but the rest of the market is starting to catch up.
Morgan Stanley released its July Auto Sales report for the US today, highlighting sales data as evidence that inflation continues to affect consumer demand, especially in low-income households. 
The lack of available BEVs has also led to continually high prices for automakers selling BEVs directly to consumers, as well as dealership models charging exorbitant mark ups to cash in on these demands, dismissing threats from their OEM superiors.
Despite pricing and demand issues, BEV sales are up 59.8% compared to last year in an overall automotive market that is down 8.2% YOY. According to the report, BEVs now account for 6.1% of the total market, another huge YOY jump compared to its 3.5% market share in July of 2021.
Part of the reason for this market growth is the increasing number of EV models going on sale, especially from legacy automakers not named Tesla. For example, Ford Motor Company delivered 7,669 BEVs in July selling just three models: the Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, and F-150 Lightning. On the coat tails of these three EVs alone, Ford lead all legacy OEMs in deliveries this month.
Basic math tells us that as one group’s figurative piece of the EV market pie grows, another’s must shrink, which is the most recent case for Tesla. That said, the EV leader still has plenty of dessert on its plate.
Tesla’s share accounted for 60.9% of the BEV market in the US, down 7.5%  compared to last year (68.4%). Although its saturation has lessened a tad, its July sales provide more evidence that Tesla is still the EV darling in the US. Its 42,813 estimated sales are about 1.6x greater than the rest of the BEV industry combined (27,543 sales in the US).
Tesla is still the clear leader, at least for now. One last little cupcake of data that’s important to note in Morgan Stanley’s July report is sales growth. While Tesla’s nominal sales are estimated to have grown by nearly 37% YOY, non-Tesla BEV sales have nearly doubled, up 90.6% compared to a year ago.
Obviously this is one brand going up against a ensemble of other American automakers, but if anything, these particular numbers show that Tesla isn’t the only viable EV option in the market anymore. That should be celebrated due to what it represents for snowballing EV adoption, and the number of cool EVs that are and will soon be available to US consumers. 
Right now with Demand not just for Tesla but all EVs far outstripping supply, sales are really about how many can and automaker make and allocate to the US. Tesla with its Gigafactories and vertical integration is able to almost match the rest of the established auto industry which is super impressive.
However we expect that Tesla’s decreasing percentage of the overall EV market will continue as the big companies like VW, Toyota and GM continue to ramp up their battery procurement and EV production. At the current rate, Tesla should fall below 50% at some point next year.

2022/08/03,"Tesla has come up with a new version of its Solar Roof, version 3.5, and it is now testing it on employee’s homes ahead of a wider launch.
When launching the solar roof, CEO Elon Musk presented it as a critical product to accelerate solar power deployment, as it opens up the market to people needing a new roof in the near future, all while delivering a compelling new product.
He said that he aimed for Tesla to produce 1,000 new solar roofs per week by the end of 2019. It was always clear that Tesla was far behind on that goal, but we didn’t know by how much until earlier this month.
The company never released data on its solar roof installations and always included them with its solar panel retrofits, which represent the vast majority of its solar power deployment.
Last month, Electrek obtained solar roof installations for the first time and confirmed that Tesla deployed 2.5 MW of solar roofs during the second quarter of 2022, or about 23 roofs per week. Furthermore, we also reported that Tesla had paused scheduling of solar roof installations in virtually all markets in the US, which is the only country where Tesla is installing solar roofs. Third-party roofing and solar companies are able to continue installations.
Now we learn that Tesla is aiming for its own solar roof installation to continue in the fourth quarter, and it is working on a new version in the meantime.
During its many delays, the solar roof went through many different iterations with Tesla Solar Roof v3 launching back in 2019. The company also added a new solar tile with more power and higher efficiency last year.
Now sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is working on Solar Roof v3.5, and it is currently deploying the updated solar product at employee homes for testing.
At this point, it’s unclear what is new with the updated version, but Tesla has been putting a focus on durability and ease of installation when it comes to the solar roof lately.
If testing goes well, Tesla is expected to introduce the new version of the Solar Roof when it restarts installation toward the end of the year.
It’s not clear when Tesla plans to officially launch the new solar roof v3.5, but it’s possible that we will learn more about the product tomorrow during Tesla’s Cyber Roundup
Solar Roof is certainly one of those products that have never delivered on the level of hype that Tesla and especially Elon Musk put behind it.
The good news is that Tesla is now going back to doing pretty well with its solar panel business and as it works on the solar roof product, it can shift its installation crews to installing solar panels.
Hopefully, v3.5 is the boost that the solar roof needs to become the important solar product that Tesla told people it would be.

2022/08/03,"Tesla has finally started taking Model S and Model X orders in Europe again after closing them last year due to a slower than anticipated production ramp following the design refresh.
The automaker shut down Model S and Model X production in January 2021 to update its two flagship vehicles.
Europe has been starved of those models since then – coming up on two years now.
Tesla kept taking new orders, but production was delayed with the new refreshed Model S starting to be delivered in June 2021 and the updated Model X in October 2021.
With the production ramp being slow, Tesla took the rare decision to stop taking orders outside of North America starting in December 2021.
At the time, the company said that the new Model S and Model X would likely arrive in Europe during the second half of 2022 – almost two years after unveiling the refresh and stopping production of the vehicles.
Now Tesla has reopened Model S and Model X orders in Europe starting with the Plaid version:
Deliveries for new orders are shown to start between December 2022 and February 2023.
This would indicate that for the Plaid, Tesla plans to work through its backlog accumulated up to December 2021 by the end of the year and then start delivering new orders.
For the Model S Long Range, Tesla has not yet reopened new orders in Europe and lists the version as “available in 2023.”
It’s the same thing with the Model X – only the Plaid is available under the same timeline:
This points to European deliveries of the new Model S and Model X being imminent. I would argue that it also points to Tesla getting a handle on Model S/X production since introducing European deliveries again is going to put more stress on the timelines in North America, which were already long. 
Model S/X production has been slowly increasing since restarting production last year with Tesla producing 8,941 units in Q3 2021, 13,109 units in Q4 2021, 14,218 units in Q1 2022, and 16,411 last quarter.
Tesla is aiming to ramp back up to around 25,000 Model S/X vehicles per quarter once it delivers to all its markets.

2022/08/02,"Tesla and Lincoln Tech, a company with technical schools across the US, announced a new partnership to train next-generation of electric vehicle technicians.
Until 2018, Tesla had mainly been recruiting technicians who have been working for other automakers or coming out of training programs where they mainly worked on internal combustion engines.
Of course, electric cars have several components in common with gas-powered cars, but the powertrains are completely different and require a significant amount of training to service them, even for an experienced auto technician.
Tesla has been conducting that training internally to adapt them to their EV products.
In 2018, the automaker launched Tesla START, a 12-week training program in partnership with community colleges to train people to become Tesla service technicians.
Announced today, Tesla is expanding the program through a partnership with Lincoln Educational Services Corporation:
Lincoln Educational Services Corporation (NASDAQ: LINC), a national leader in specialized technical training for more than 75 years, has signed a new agreement with Tesla, the world leader in electric vehicle (EV) production. A Tesla training facility will be established at Lincoln Tech’s Denver, CO campus as part of a 3-year plan whereby the school will provide Tesla START training at no cost to students to help develop the next generation of Tesla’s service technician workforce. Automotive Technology graduates from any of Lincoln Tech’s campuses will be eligible to apply for this advanced EV training program.
While the program is starting with Lincoln Tech’s Denver, Colorado, campus, the company has a dozen other schools across the US where it could expand.
Tesla will take over 6,000 square feet of space in the center and provide equipment and vehicles.
Students accepted into the 16-week program will receive an hourly stipend while they train. The Tesla training facility will occupy approximately 6,000 square feet of space in Lincoln Tech’s Denver campus. Tesla will also provide vehicles, tools, equipment, charging stations and its own instructors to deliver the program. Upon completion of the program, graduates may be recruited for positions at Tesla service centers across North America.
In June, we reported on Elon Musk’s announcement that Tesla is working on service in North America and how Telsa is aiming to make the majority of appointments same-day repairs. As we noted, it is much needed since Tesla’s customer fleet is growing at a much faster pace than its service infrastructure. However, Musk didn’t elaborate on how Tesla plans to achieve that.
Tesla’s service problem was much bigger than we anticipated as we learned that the automaker was going as far as sending untrained employees from other departments to work on cars. The company’s service division is being affected by the labor shortage.
During a companywide meeting a week after the same-day repair announcement, Musk elaborated after being asked by an employee:
I think we still have a relatively conventional approach to servicing – although we kind of use the vehicle app. So we definitely have better servicing than the rest of the industry, but I really want Tesla to look at how we can revolutionize service and I don’t know, make it 10 times better than the rest of the industry.
The CEO said that the goal to get to two-thirds of appointments as same-day repairs is part of that mission. He said that Tesla looked at the data of all the different repairs, and he believes that most of them can be done on the same day, as long as parts are available at the service centers.
Musk said that he aims for Tesla to achieve that goal with bigger centers and more specialization – meaning that each service center is going to have service bays to perform very specific services. 
Recently, the CEO added that Tesla is aiming for same-hour service with “Formula 1 pit crew techniques.”

2022/08/02,"Tesla is enabling paid charging at Destination Chargers, which have generally been free up to this point, but there’s a catch: You have to have at least six Wall Connectors to be able to set pricing at your Destination Charger location.
The automaker operates two different charging networks. While Tesla’s Supercharger network is made of DC fast-charging stations for long-distance driving, the Destination Charging network consists of level 2 chargers, more specifically the Tesla Wall Connector, mostly installed at restaurants and hotels to charge once Tesla owners arrive at their destination, hence the name.
In 2020, Electrek reported that  Tesla upgraded Destination Chargers with Gen 3 Wall Connectors, and the automaker told property owners that it would enable paid charging with this new generation charger.
For the most part, Tesla’s Destination Charging locations have been free with the only requirement at some places being that you be a customer of the business where it’s located – for example, if you use at a hotel’s Destination Charger, some locations require that you are staying at the hotel.
The cost of electricity from the chargers would be covered by the business.
But with this new Wi-Fi-connected Wall Connector, Tesla said it would enable businesses to charge for the use with the seamless experience Tesla’s charging networks are known for. 
Tesla has now updated its Commercial Registration for Wall Connectors form to include the provision for paid charging, but the automaker confirmed that it will only let property managers with six or more Wall Connectors to activate the feature:
Tesla Commercial Services can be enabled on Gen3 Tesla Wall Connectors that are connected to either Wi-Fi or Cellular and have a signed Services Agreement with Tesla. A minimum of six units are required to be installed to be considered for this service.
This will eliminate a lot of locations, especially hotels, which account for a large part of the Destination Charging network, since most locations only have between two and four Tesla Wall Connectors.
But it might also encourage some locations to add more chargers since now they are going to be able to charge customers for the service and get back their electricity costs, which most EV owners won’t mind paying.
This new program might encourage some property managers to utilize some parking spaces better and turn them into small charging stations.
While fast-charging locations, like Superchargers, are more convenient for a quick charge, there are plenty of use cases for Wall Connectors, which can add about 44 miles of range per hour of charging.
If you have a parking lot in a downtown area that is easily walkable, you could add six or more Wall Connectors to your lot, and Tesla owners traveling to the city planning to spend a few hours there could park and charge there while exploring.
For some, it might be a better solution than a Supercharger, which you would have to come back to within an hour in order to move your car since it will be fully charged and you don’t want to occupy the space if you are not charging.
Now that those property managers can charge for the service and it’s fully automated in the Tesla app, it’s a more appealing solution since they can recoup the cost of deploying the chargers and the electricity while attracting Tesla owners to their businesses.

2022/08/01,"Tesla has decided to deploy a swimming pool at a Supercharger station in Germany as the automaker is starting to invest more into amenities around its charging stations. But that’s a whole new level of charging amenities, even for Tesla.
Last week, we reported that Tesla deployed new cube lounges at a Supercharger station with automated coffee, food, and more.
The automaker is still exploring options to provide amenities and fun activities for its customers while they wait at charging stations.
With the first cube lounges being deployed at a Supercharger station in Germany, it looks like the country is a test bed for Tesla’s new Supercharger amenities because this new one is also in Germany: Tesla is deploying an actual mobile swimming pool at its Supercharger station in Hilden, Germany.
David from the Tesla Welt Podcast and friend of Electrek sent this video of the swimming pool being installed ahead of the launch coming on Thursday:
The launch of the first Tesla swimming pool at a Supercharger station comes on the same day as the Tesla Cyber Roundup event. Maybe Tesla will announce it as a new product? Who knows?
As you can see, the pool appears to be made out of a container, making it movable.
There are instructions posted by Tesla that seem to indicate that up to 4 people can use the pool at the same time for up to 10 minutes.
It will be open from Thursday through Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
That gives you just enough time to put your bathing suit on, jump in for a swim, get out, and get dry – by that time, your car should be fully charged.
There are also Tesla-branded balls to play with in the pool:
Tesla’s Supercharger station in Hilden is one of the biggest in Germany with 40 chargers (8 Superchargers up to 150kW and 32 Superchargers up to 250kW).
The charger is also equipped with CCS and is one of the first to be open to non-Tesla vehicles in Germany.
It’s also equipped with solar panels and already other amenities, like restaurants such as the Seed & Greet and Bäcker Schüren.
What do you think of Tesla deploying swimming pools at its Supercharger stations? Let us know in the comment section below.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/08/01,"Tesla vehicles are increasing Hertz’s customer satisfaction as the company gets better use of electric vehicles. The rental car company is also adding more EVs to its fleet.
Last year, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles. More recently, the company added Model Y vehicles to the order.
The rental car company said that it expects to have all 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 – though Tesla didn’t seem to be completely on board with that timeline.
In April, Hertz announced that it is also adding up to 65,000 electric vehicles from Polestar to its fleet over the next five years.
During its Q2 2022 earnings, Hertz released some updates about its growing Tesla fleet. 
Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr confirmed that it is still taking delivery of Tesla vehicles and it continues to do so:
First of all, we continue to take delivery of Teslas and we will continue to do that, number one.
Scherr said that it is getting repeat customers from its Tesla fleet:
The first lot we took from Tesla relative to the most recent lot we took have moved materially faster. We’ve learned how to move those cars, where we want those cars to be. And equally, I think we have schooled our customers on how to use them, so much so that I think there’s an embedded tether there, which is people have learned how to use the card. They’re coming back to use the car and rent car more frequently. And I think all of those are expressions of the first mover edge that we have around EVs.
The CEO confirmed that it has rented Tesla vehicles for 160,000 days already, and customers renting Tesla vehicles from Hertz are rating them much higher than if they rent other vehicles from them.
Scherr added:
With respect to electric vehicles in our airport and off-airport fleet, we’ve recorded over 160,000 transaction days using Tesla cars, booked at premium rates that are typically $30 to $35 in excess of comparable average rates. Customers are enjoying the Tesla EV experience, which is being expressed in NPS scores that are 10 points higher than our global average. We are continuing to expand the electric vehicle offering through the regular delivery of Tesla cars and now Polestars.
NPS stands for “Net promoter score,” and it is used to rate the likelihood that customers would recommend a company – often a good metric for customer satisfaction.
Hertz is really liking its move to electric vehicles, and Scherr said that we should expect them to announce more large purchases of electric vehicles in the near future.

2022/08/01,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is surging higher ahead of its shareholders voting on a stock split and event Cyber Roundup event later this week.
Tesla’s last stock split dates back just a few years ago in 2020. At the time, Tesla’s stock was trading at around $1,300 a share, but the stock-split announcement sent its stock price surging to a record high of $2,000 a share.
The split resulted in the price per share being reset at around $460 and a valuation of about $430 billion. The stock grew quite fast following the 5-for-1 split with Tesla, roughly doubling its valuation over the next year.
The company announced its intentions to do another stock split back in March 2022 and last month, Tesla revealed that it will be a 3-for-1 stock split if approved by shareholders. The vote is coming up at Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting on Thursday, August 4.
Tesla’s stock has been trending higher ahead of the meeting with a jump of over 5% on Friday and this morning, TSLA is trading up over 1% in pre-market trading despite the NASDAQ being down. Something similar happened ahead of the last stock split as Tesla shorts – people betting against the company – covering their position and creating a short squeeze.
However, Tesla’s stock was much more heavily shorted at the time with as much as 7% of its outstanding shares being shorted.
Today, Tesla’s stock is still the most shorted (betted against) in the world, but only 2.9% of its shares are being shorted – or about half of what it was ahead of the previous stock split. But as we noted last week, it looks like people betting against Tesla are starting to hurt, and some are retreating.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to poke a little fun at them Friday evening:
Heatwave in Shortville 🥵
But shorts don’t only have the stock split to worry about, since Tesla shareholders are going to vote on it on Thursday at Tesla’s annual shareholder’s meeting, which is being rebranded as the Cyber Roundup, as we recently reported. It wouldn’t be surprising if Tesla were to make a few announcements at the event, which could potentially help keep the stock’s momentum going.
We will have to wait and see.

2022/08/01,"Tesla has secured battery material supply deals with two large Chinese companies, according to new fillings. The move aims to ensure battery supply to support its electric vehicle production through the mid-decade. 
Automakers who are serious about electric vehicles are currently scrambling to secure as much long-term battery supply as possible since it will determine how many electric vehicles they are going to be able to produce. 
With internal combustion engine sales declining, their capacity to produce EVs will soon represent their entire production capacity and their only capacity for growth.
Ford and GM both recently announced plans to secure critical minerals and battery supply to support the production of 600,000 and 1 million electric vehicles by 2025.
As for Tesla, it only sells electric vehicles, and as such, the company has been securing long-term battery supply for decades now, but it is able to do it more efficiently as of late due to its scale.
The automaker is looking to exit 2022 with a production rate of about 2 million electric vehicles a year – twice what its American competitors are hoping to hit in three years.
From there, Tesla aims to grow at a rate of about 50% per year, and that will require massive amount of battery materials.
Today, we learn that Tesla has secured battery precursor materials through new contracts with Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. and CNGR Advanced Material Co in China (Bloomberg first reported):
Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. and CNGR Advanced Material Co. signed pricing agreements with the electric-vehicle giant for supplies until the middle of this decade, according to separate stock-exchange statements from the companies. The deals are for ternary precursor materials — chemical cocktails that are key to storing energy in lithium-ion batteries.
Huayou Cobalt will supply processed cobalt for batteries to Tesla from July 1, 2022, to the end of 2025, according to the filing. The miner specified that the prices of the products will be “subject to market prices for nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as refining fees.” 
CNGR will supply Tesla between 2023 and 2025 based on the new contract – though both companies had previously been supplying the American EV automaker.
These new contracts for Tesla follow several more throughout the entire battery supply chain.
In January, Tesla signed a deal to secure nickel from a new mine in the US. Tesla ended up adding another deal with an upcoming lithium mine in Australia developed by Liontown in February.
A month later, Tesla added another lithium contract with a new mine in Australia.

2022/07/30,"Tesla is preparing to launch pictures of its customers into space on SpaceX’s lunar orbiter mission with the Korea Aerospace Research Institute of South Korea.
Back in 2018, Tesla had a referral program to help sell vehicles – owners could share a referral code with new buyers who would receive Supercharging credits. In exchange, referrers would get prizes based on how many people they referred.
One of the prizes was launching a picture into deep space.
Launch Your Photo into Deep Space Orbit We’ll laser-etch any image onto glass and send it into deep space orbit for millions of years. Refer more friends while you wait for an alien race to discover your payload.
Last month, we reported that Tesla had yet to deliver on the prize – four years after the program ended. A week later, Tesla finally launched a system for referral program prize winners to send their pictures in space, but we didn’t know when Tesla was actually going to launch the pictures or how.
Now Tesla has confirmed that they will launch on the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter mission to be launched by SpaceX next week.
Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy — thank you for your support in making it a reality. Your photo will be launched into space on the KPLO mission on August 4, 2022.
With the confirmation, Tesla also released this mosaic of the pictures it will be sending being assembled to recreate an image of the Tesla Roadster in space.
In February 2018, SpaceX launched its first Falcon Heavy rocket, and it needed a “dummy load” to send into space in order to demonstrate the capability.
Musk, who is the CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla, decided to launch his own Tesla Roadster.
Due to the higher risk of failure with a brand-new rocket, SpaceX didn’t want to put something too valuable out there, like a satellite, but at the same time, Musk didn’t want to just launch a weight into space.
He figured that launching a Tesla Roadster would be more interesting and inspiring – and that it was. The video of the launch became extremely popular, and it created stunning images of the Tesla Roadster in space.
I had Canvaspop make printouts of one of those pictures (using high-res images that SpaceX released on Flickr), and I display it in my house.
Now the vehicle is believed to be over 180 million miles from Earth traveling at 8,100 mph.

2022/07/29,"Autonomy, an electric vehicle subscription service using Tesla vehicles, announced that it is adding Tesla Model Y to its fleet and is now taking delivery of about 200 Tesla vehicles per week.
It is also about to expand to other EVs with an order of 23,000 EVs that will include EVs from Rivian, Lucid, Ford, and more.
We first reported on Autonomy, which was founded by Scott Painter, the founder of TrueCar, back in January when they first launched their EV subscription service using Tesla Model 3 vehicles.
At the time, they disclosed having 100 Model 3 vehicles and planned to have 10,000 by the end of the year.
The subscription service works entirely through an app to apply, take delivery, and manage your subscription. Service starts at $490 a month, with $4,900 down and with a three-month minimum. With a sliding scale, you can go up to $1,000 a month with only $1,000 down.
Today, Electrek sat down with Painter to get an update on the business as they are adding Tesla Model Y to the fleet and placing a large order for 23,000 electric vehicles with many automakers.
Painter said that Autonomy now has about 1,000 Tesla vehicles in its fleet (most of them Model 3s and a few Model Ys now) and about half of their clients chose the lower monthly payment options and the other half go for $1,000 a month and only $1,000 down.
The CEO said that, at any given time, the company has a backlog of about 1,000 people waiting for cars, and it generally takes five to six days for them to receive the vehicle as it takes delivery of about 200-300 Tesla vehicles per week.
Painter explained that, unlike Hertz, which also placed a large order of Tesla vehicles for its rental fleet, Autonomy doesn’t just order base Model 3 vehicles in white, but it takes pretty much everything it can get – including inventory vehicles like customer cars that ended up being canceled.
Autonomy sees strong demand and plans to ramp up to about 3,000 Tesla vehicles by September, but it has revised its goal of having 10,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of the year to having about 6,000 – though it sounds like that’s more about Tesla’s limitation than Autonomy’s.
While its Tesla fleet is not going as fast as it first anticipated, the company is expanding rapidly to other vehicles with a new partnership with Auto Nation that is going to result in an order of 23,000 electric vehicles.
Auto Nation dealers are going to become Autonomy’s partner dealers for delivery and service, and they will also help them build a relationship with the legacy automakers who still use the dealership models.
The full order, one of the biggest of its kind for electric vehicles, is going to be published in full next month, but Painter gave Electrek a preview and said that it will include vehicles from newcomers like Rivian, Lucid, Polestar, and Canoo.
As previously mentioned, Autonomy is also buying EVs from established OEMs – like GM, the Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Silverado EV, Equinox EV, and Blazer EV were all mentioned, the latter in the thousands of units – said Painter.
Ford is also going to be on the list with the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.

2022/07/29,"Elon Musk noted that he believes inflation might finally be trending down based on Tesla commodity prices. The CEO has previously said that he would be waiting for that to start reducing the prices of Tesla vehicles.
Over the last few years, the inflation rate has been hitting record highs that we haven’t seen in decades.
It has resulted in price increases across virtually every industry, especially the auto industry.
On top of it, electric vehicle makers are seeing higher battery material costs due to geopolitical situations, like the war in Ukraine, which sent the price of nickel up massively.
In Tesla’s case, all of these factors have resulted in higher costs, and the automaker has raised its prices by more than 20% over the last two years. For example, the Tesla Model Y started at $53,000 in early 2020, and today, the same vehicle starts at $66,000.
That’s a 25% increase in price in less than two years, and the same is happening across Tesla’s entire vehicle lineup.
It disappointed many as CEO Elon Musk always said that Tesla’s goal was to make electric vehicles more affordable to improve adoption.
Earlier this month, Musk said that Tesla is waiting for inflation to “calm down” before finally reducing EV prices.
Today, the CEO took to Twitter to say that he might be seeing signs that inflation is finally trending down based on commodity prices that Tesla is tracking:
More Tesla commodity prices are trending down than up fwiw
However, when asked if Tesla is going to reduce prices, Musk said that it was too early to say at this point.
Interestingly, Musk’s comment comes a day after Democrats in the Senate announced having reached a deal on the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,” which includes a reform of the federal EV tax credit.
The reform would enable Tesla vehicles to gain access to the credit again, but there’s a new price limit on electric vehicles to be eligible. Tesla reducing its prices would result in a wider access to the credit.
For example, there’s a $55,000 price limit on sedans to get access to the $7,500 credit, and the Tesla Model 3 Long Range starts at $57,990. If the automaker were to reduce the price by $3,000, buyers would get access to the $7,500 credit.
However, the bill hasn’t been put to vote or made into law yet, but it is expected that many automakers, including Tesla, are going to try to adjust their prices to fit the requirements.

2022/07/28,"Now that the US Senate has an agreement on the reform of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles, it looks like it might finally happen after roughly two years of work. Though it’s still pending a vote.
But it does bring up an interesting question: Will it make EV sales crash until the end of the year since it’s not retroactive?
The response is yes and no. It depends on the models and the automaker. It’s actually quite a complicated situation.
First off, the incentive is not retroactive. The new credit applies to electric vehicles delivered after December 31, 2022 – meaning delivered in 2023.
The main thing that should prevent EV sales from crashing until the end of the year is that the proposal includes a provision to still offer the current federal tax credit to people who place an order for a new EV this year prior to the signing of the bill, even if it gets delivered in 2023:
Transition provision for EVs with written sales orders dated in 2022 prior to the date of President signing the bill but delivered in 2023 allows purchaser to claim the “old” credit in 2023.
This is going to be good for all EVs that are still eligible for the current credit – meaning that the automaker has delivered fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US and their phase-out period is not over yet.
However, what does it mean for companies like Tesla and GM whose EV buyers don’t have access to the current credit? Will buyers want to wait until the new incentives come into effect before buying their EVs?
It depends. Tesla already has strong demand for its vehicles, and a lot of that demand is coming from fairly wealthy individuals who make more than $150,000 as an individual and $300,000 as joint-fillers. This means that it is likely to result in Tesla keeping a significant part of its market this year.
As for the other requirements, some of them are more tricky.
Technically, the base Model 3 and both versions of the Model Y should qualify with the new MSRP price limit as long as the Model Y is officially considered an SUV.
Where things get more complicated is with the new requirement that 40% of battery minerals and 50% of the battery components come from the United States or countries with a free trade agreement with the US. This is harder to confirm today, but I doubt that the base Model 3 will fit this requirement since it is believed that it is equipped with LFP battery cells from China.
If the Model Y does qualify as an SUV, it has a much higher chance of being approved since it is equipped with 2170 cells built at Gigafactory Nevada with a lot of minerals from North America and Australia.
Therefore, Model Y could be more affected by the end of the year, but with a strong backlog and higher-income individuals not qualifying already, I doubt it will have much of an effect.
As for GM, the Bolt EV, Bolt EUV, and Cadillac Lyriq could fit the price requirements, but it’s almost impossible to know if they fit the battery requirements. I think that the Bolt EV and EUV would be the most hurt until the end of the year, but with the recent price drop, I think most units available will be sold anyway.
Therefore, to answer the question, no for the most part: EV sales won’t be affected by the new credit not being retroactive, other than maybe for a few models.
Now another interesting question: Who would be the greatest winners of this new EV incentive? To be answered soon.

2022/07/28,"Tesla has deployed large cube lounges at a Supercharger station in Germany that is equipped with automated vending machines for coffee, food, and more.
The new partnership with bk World to deploy these lounges could reshape Tesla’s Supercharger networks in regions where it is more challenging to deploy charging stations near amenities.
Tesla has been trying to deploy its Supercharger stations at properties located around amenities that offer food, coffee, and restrooms, but that is not always easy.
At a few locations, Tesla has deployed its own lounges to offer those amenities.
Now the automaker is trying a new approach through a partnership with bk World that developed a new deployable cube lounge that includes a bunch of amenities – many of them automated: 
“bk World of course offers bathroom facilities, while a comfortable lounge area invites drivers to linger. But the concept is far more extensive. For instance, it makes extremely efficient use of the small footprint. Various products are dispensed in a fully automated way. The food that drivers can purchase on site is healthy, fresh, and low in sugar. When selecting the product portfolio, the planners deliberately avoided working with large corporations and chose instead to focus on keeping things regional and sustainable. Together with entrepreneur and investor Marcell Jansen, work is even going on to develop an innovative and healthy food portfolio especially for bk World.”
Drivers have to sign into an app in order to access the lounge:
Inside, you access different food, drinks, and even some electronics through a very high-tech automated vending machine:
Outside, there’s even a machine that can make fresh pizza for you in about four minutes:
Most importantly, the deployable air-conditioned cubes are equipped with full restrooms:
In the lounge area, there’s a Nintendo Switch for kids – big or small:
There are also seating areas with electrical outlets for people to work or charge their devices:
bk World says that the lounges are easily deployable and can be moved quickly:
bk World is made up of what are known as Qubes – modular, transportable room elements that can be combined in a number of ways to meet a wide variety of space requirements on site. When a charging facility grows, its bk World can grow with it. Qubes can be assembled, disassembled, and relocated in a very short time. This is particularly good news for property owners, but also for charging facility operators. If a lease expires, bk World offers the greatest possible flexibility. The smallest version, with a lounge area and bathroom Qube, takes up around 50 square metres – but there is no upper size limit to bk World. This reduces material waste and makes demolitions a thing of the past. And bk World’s inherent adaptability makes it easier to find suitable locations.
While this is the first station using this new technology, the company says that it has 300 locations planned across Europe:
The bk World in Endsee is now open and ready to welcome all visitors to the Tesla charging park. But this first location is just the beginning: in the next five years, bk World Holding GmbH plans to open 300 locations across Europe. bk World is coming soon to charging parks run by the largest charge spot operators and energy providers – to the benefit of customers, retailers, and the environment.
It’s unclear how many of those are in partnership with Tesla.
Here, Out of Specs visited the station and took a look inside the lounge. You can check the video here:

2022/07/27,"Tesla has a new product called “Virtual Machine Mode,” and it is being deployed at its energy storage project in South Australia, nicknamed “Tesla Big Battery,” in partnership with France’s Neoen.
Over the last few years, Tesla has put a lot of effort into developing software products to take better advantage of its rapidly growing fleet of energy storage capacity.
In 2020, Electrek spotted a previously unknown new product from Tesla: Autobidder. It’s a real-time trading and control platform for energy assets, like Tesla’s Powerpacks, Powerwalls, and Megapacks, optimized through machine learning to better use and more directly monetize the assets. A few months later, Electrek revealed Tesla Powerhub, a monitoring system for energy assets.
Last year, we also reported on Tesla’s Opticaster, which is “an intelligent software designed to maximize economic benefits and sustainability objectives for distributed energy resources.”
Now Tesla has yet another energy software product called “Tesla Virtual Machine Mode.”
The product was revealed through Neoen, the French energy company that owns the Hornsdale Power Reserve (HPR) in South Australia (also known as “Tesla Big Battery”), announcing that it obtained approval to offer the “world’s first grid-scale inertia services” through Tesla’s technology.
HPR is the first big battery in the world to deliver grid-scale inertia services, thanks to Tesla’s pioneering Virtual Machine Mode technology.
Neoen said that it is deploying the technology at the energy storage system in South Australia after receiving approval from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
Electrek found Tesla’s description of the Virtual Machine Mode:
As more wind and solar power replace fossil fuel generation, less mechanical inertia is available on the grid, removing a natural stability buffer in the case of a grid disturbance. Tesla’s Virtual Machine Mode is designed to address these stability challenges by virtually emulating mechanical inertia. Megapack’s built-in inverters with Virtual Machine Mode create grid-forming dynamics that provide grid strength, respond to added and rejected loads and maintain quality voltage at the point of interconnection. In South Australia, the Hornsdale Power Reserve alone can provide up to 3,000 megawatt-seconds of inertia by using Virtual Machine Mode — roughly half of the state’s entire inertia needs.
Neoen commented on the deployment of the technology at the Hornsdale Power Reserve: 
This landmark achievement is the result of two years of extensive trials and intensive collaboration between Neoen and battery technology provider Tesla, working closely with AEMO and ElectraNet, South Australia’s network operator. Together they completed the necessary studies, testing and analysis to deploy this pioneering technology at scale for the first time.
In 2020, the Big Battery was expanded adding 50 MW/64.5 MWh of capacity at the site – bringing the total to 150 MW/193.5 MWh. It showed a record 270 MW range after the expansion.
The project has already proven to be profitable, and it has served as an example for other large-scale energy storage projects around the world.

2022/07/27,"Tesla has finally put an end to its unlimited “Standard Connectivity” internet connection included in all Tesla vehicles with now a new generous eight-year time limit.
Connectivity has been a flagship feature of Tesla’s offering in the auto industry. It enables several fun and useful features for customers and has also been used by Tesla to collect data from the fleet and improve features — mainly Autopilot.
Tesla always offered internet connectivity for free, but as its fleet grew, so did the internet connectivity requirement and cost.
In 2018, Tesla started requiring a new paid “premium connectivity” package for a monthly fee to access some of the more data-heavy connectivity features. Since then, Tesla owners have had to decide if they want to pay $10 per month for the premium connectivity service or not.
More recently, the automaker launched a software update to allow owners to use their phones’ Wi-Fi hotspots while driving as an alternative to LTE connectivity.
After launching the “Premium Connectivity” package, Tesla only made navigation standard with the standard connectivity that comes with every vehicle:
Arguably this was the most important feature, and Tesla was also seemingly offering it for life with its cars since there was no time limit until now.
Now Tesla has updated its website to specify that Standard Connectivity is included for “eight years”:
Standard Connectivity is included in your vehicle, at no additional cost, for eight years beginning on the first day your vehicle was delivered as new by Tesla, or the first day it is put into service (for example used as a demonstrator or service vehicle), whichever comes first. If you are purchasing a used vehicle, you will be notified of how long your vehicle will include access to Standard Connectivity.
Interestingly, it doesn’t sound like Tesla planned to offer an option to buy Standard Connectivity after the eight-year period is over as Tesla only mentions buying Premium Connectivity after that:
Premium Connectivity is available as an annual or a monthly subscription.
It sounds like at that point, Tesla drivers would have to pay $10 a month for the premium connectivity, but that’s eight years away. Things have time to change.
Some people are not happy about this, but to be honest, Tesla’s connectivity packages have been quite generous so far compared to the rest of the industry.
This simply brings them closer to being on par with the industry – though I’d argue that eight years of included connectivity with navigation is better than most.

2022/07/27,"Tesla is doubling down on delivering better range estimates with tire pressure, battery cooling and heating, and more now being taken into account in the calculations.
Range calculations are difficult regardless of the type of powertrain – electric or internal combustion engine.
There are just so many factors that can affect the efficiency of a vehicle on a road that it is hard to determine how far it can go on a full battery pack or tank of gas.
But it is important. I’d argue that accurate range prediction is better at curbing range anxiety than longer range.
Tesla has been a leader in efficiency and long-range electric vehicles for a long time, but despite that, it still has issues predicting the energy consumption of a trip.
When entering a destination in the navigation system, Tesla gives the driver the expected range remaining at the destination, but Tesla drivers know that most of the time it’s actually going to be much lower than the estimate.
In 2018, Tesla added more environmental factors (elevation changes, weather, etc.) in the calculation. It helped, but it is still far from accurate. You put a destination in the system and Tesla’s trip advisor tells you how much energy you will have left by the time you get there, but it’s not rare to see the amount of energy go down fast as you drive.
Earlier this year, Tesla put a renewed focus on range prediction using “crosswind, headwind, humidity and ambient temperature” in a software update.
Now it looks like Tesla is pushing it even further by adding several other factors in its range calculations, including tire pressure and even phone charging.
The information comes from notorious Tesla hack “green” who often finds features in Tesla’s software updates before they are officially announced in the release notes:
wow 2022.20.7 seems to go into insane details to improve range predictions.Even tire pressure is taken into account (amongst many-many other extra variables just added). Also takes into account energy loss to phone charging and 12V accessories, air density, battery heat/cool,…
These changes are being released as part of Tesla’s 2022.20.7 software update being currently gradually rolled out to the fleet.
This seems to be Tesla’s biggest effort to make its range estimates accurate.
All of those things on their own might not account for much of a difference, but put together, they might literally account for a few percentage points of difference, which can make a huge difference when planning a trip.
Tire pressure alone could make a big difference since more inflated tires are known to be more efficient.
Also, it’s surprising to learn that Tesla didn’t take battery heating and cooling into account before since one would assume that this would require a significant amount of energy in extreme temperatures, which is often when the range calculations are the worst.
So this alone might fix a big part of Tesla’s terrible range estimates in the winter.
This is all great news because as Tesla drivers start trusting the range estimates more, they will be able to get more out of their vehicles in road trips and long distance driving.

2022/07/26,"Tesla confirmed today that it expanded its own insurance based on real-time driver data to two more states, Utah and Maryland – now in 10 states or 11 if you count California, which has Tesla Insurance but not the real-time data version.
Tesla updated its website to note that its real-time data insurance product is now available to customers in the states of Utah and Maryland.
The addition makes for a total of 10 states with Tesla Insurance based on real-time driving data:
Tesla still hasn’t been able to get the full product adopted in California, but the automaker recently started to let people who get Tesla Insurance in California use the Driver Safety Score for “educational purposes.”
Recently, Tesla filings for its insurance products have surfaced in Florida and New Jersey – indicating that the automaker is looking to expand in those states soon.
In October of last year, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla Insurance is aiming to be “in most states” by the end of 2022. The regulatory landscape for insurance is complex and varies state by state. Therefore, Tesla has a lot of work to do to launch in any new state, but the effort appears to be paying off with many new markets being added in the last few months.
Tesla originally introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data or Tesla’s safety score, which had been the original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, Tesla wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October 2021, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes comparing the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month to month depending on your score:
Since releasing the product, Tesla has integrated everything into its mobile app, from ordering insurance to using the safety score to paying and managing claims.
The company expanded the insurance product to Illinois in December and then to  Arizona and Ohio in January.
In April, Tesla launched insurance based on real-time driver data in Colorado, Oregon, and Virginia.
In June, the automaker expanded the product to Nevada, and now in July, we see Utah and Maryland being added to the list.
It’s going to be interesting to see if Tesla can indeed add most states with its insurance product by the end of the year, as Musk stated.

2022/07/26,"Tesla tried to force a customer to pay $4,500 ransom over 80 miles of range that the company software-locked in his battery pack. The automaker only started to walk back on the strategy to squeeze $4,500 out of its customers after an uproar on social media.
Tesla used to sell Model S vehicles with software-locked battery packs. For example, Electrek‘s Seth Weintraub’s first Tesla was a Model S 40, which was actually a Model S with a 60 kWh battery pack software-locked at 40 kWh of capacity.
This was a way to offer different range options without having to make production more complicated with different battery pack sizes.
Later, Tesla started to offer owners of those software-locked vehicles the option to unlock the capacity for an additional cost. Tesla phased out the practice over the years, but the company still used software-locked battery packs when doing warranty replacements of battery packs of certain capacities that it doesn’t produce anymore.
This has created a situation for a customer that Tesla has completely mishandled.
Jason Hughes, an infamous Tesla hacker, revealed the situation after trying to help the customer who bought a used Model S 90 that used to be a Model S 60:
Car is sold twice since, and now has a new owner (my customer). It says 90, badged 90, has 90-type range.He has the car for a few months, goes in and does a paid MCU2 upgrade at Tesla after the 3G shutdown.All goes well. The upgrade is done, car is working fine.(2/*)
The customer went to a Tesla service center to get a computer upgrade so that his vehicle can stay connected to the internet – older Tesla vehicles only had 3G connectivity, which is going away. After the Tesla visit, he received a call from the automaker telling him that they found an error in his vehicle configuration and that they would push a “fix” to his car.
The “fix” reverted his configuration to a Model S 60 and locked about 80 miles of range from his battery pack. The customer tried to explain the situation to Tesla and have them reenable the capability, which he paid for since he bought the car as a Model S 90, but Tesla told him that he had to pay $4,500 to unlock the capability:
Imagine walking out to your car to find it's now 1/3rd as good as it was 15 minutes ago, and Tesla making it out like this is a good thing! They fixed the problem!What do you do?He tried for a while with them with no progress.(5/*)
That’s when the customer came to Hughes, who has been known to be able to enable software-locked features inside Tesla vehicles. However, he couldn’t get a solution that wouldn’t cause other issues.
Instead, he took the problem to social media, and his thread on the situation went viral.
Only after the thread went viral did Tesla reportedly reach out to the customer to say that they would “take care of it right away”:
While I don't think it's ideal to need a huge social media push to get things accomplished, thanks to the momentum this thread has generated it seems like we've got a path forward with Tesla towards getting this taken care of the right way.Thanks to those who've reached out!❤️
It sounds like Tesla will revert the capacity back to a 90 kWh battery pack for the customer.
This is wild. Now, I understand that mistakes happen. And, I can actually see that if this car came on Tesla’s radar, and a tech saw that it should have been configured as a Model S 60, they might try to reverse it.
However, what is inexcusable is that when the customer reached back out to Tesla to explain the situation to them – that he is the third owner of the vehicle and bought it as a Model S 90 with clear proof – they demanded an additional $4,500 to give him what he had already paid for.
Tesla made $2 billion last quarter. There’s no reason to try to squeeze $4,500 from a customer who did nothing wrong. It took the story going viral for Tesla to address the situation.
I think Tesla is a great company doing great things, but sometimes it gets it so wrong that it’s hard to understand.

2022/07/26,"The Tesla Cybertruck with its interesting design offered a surprise in the first independent aerodynamic performance simulation test. It comes in at an unofficial 0.39 drag coefficient.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, the design was polarizing, to say the least. Some were totally in love with the design, while others hated it with a passion. One thing that both sides can agree on is that it is quite a novel design – it is so unusual that real images of the electric pickup truck almost look like they are CGI.
There are many reasons behind the novel design – the biggest one is likely the fact that Tesla wants to build the truck with a stainless steel exoskeleton, which creates some limitations in terms of design. Tesla was also inspired by cyberpunk science fiction like Blade Runner for the design of the pickup.
But Tesla also thought that it could make a pickup truck that is more aerodynamic with this novel design. Pickup truck designs are, for the most part, extremely similar and generally have a bad drag coefficient between 0.55 and 0.65 Cd. 
Now a new study of the Tesla Cybertruck’s aerodynamic performance shows that the electric pickup truck has a drag coefficient of about 0.39 Cd.
Aleix Lázaro Prat, a CFD Engineer for Numeric Systems, used the company’s aerodynamic simulation technology to produce the study that they released on LinkedIn.
The engineer shared the positive aspects of the design from his study:
Contrary to what many people would think, the sharp edge of the roof does not produce a big detachment! It is true that the flow it is not attached, but in fact the air follows down the slope quite seamlessly. The boundary layer does not substantially grow. This is quite remarkable and a big aerodynamic advantage compared to other pick-up trucks. Moreover, the diffuser makes a substantial effect in the center of the vehicle’s rear-end! It creates suction and reduces the wake.
However, he also saw plenty of room for improvement:
On the other side, our results show clear turbulent structures created by the front edge which connects the bumper and the bonnet, the vertical edge right behind the front lights, the wheel arches’ “protectors”/surrounding edgy geometry, the rim styling and the geometry of the a-pillar and c-pillar. The generation of the turbulent structures is caused by the sharpness of these edges. These geometrical features increase the drag of the vehicle, which ultimately reduce the range the CYBERTRUCK. Furthermore, due to the sharp rear end, the flow instantly detaches and creates a considerably big low energy area (wake), mostly noticeable behind the top and side rear-end edges.
It’s important to note that Numeric Systems don’t have the final geometry of the Cybertruck, and therefore, it shouldn’t be completely representative of the final product.
There are factors like the lack of side mirrors that we don’t know if or how will be implemented in the production version of the truck next year.
CEO Elon Musk has previously hinted that Tesla might deliver the truck with removable side mirrors.
Musk has also said that he believes that Tesla could manage to bring the Cybertruck’s Cd down to 0.30 with some improvements, which would be amazing for a pickup truck of this size.
Tesla is expected to soon unveil the production version of the Cybertruck, which is now finally set to go into production in mid-2023 after many delays.

2022/07/26,"Tesla (TSLA) is launching today a new shareholder platform to manage its large investor base and allow them to participate in events and ask questions.
Over the years, Tesla has had an unusual approach to investor relations.
CEO Elon Musk often voiced frustration with traditional Wall Street analysts on earning calls and pushed for more interactions with retail investors.
Tesla started to implement Say’s platform, which collects questions from investors and lets them vote on the most popular ones to be asked to Tesla’s management during the calls.
Now it looks like Tesla wants to build its own platform using Say and Plaid.
The automaker announced the “Tesla Shareholder Platform” on Twitter today:
We're launching the Tesla Shareholder Platform — join the program to participate in Tesla events and hear more updates soon → https://t.co/HUVikOo5a3
Tesla shareholders can sign up by proving ownership with their brokers through Say and Plaid:
If you don’t want to link your broker account or can’t because it is a Canada-based broker (like me), you can verify manually with a statement.
For now, Tesla only lists that the platform will offer participation in events as well as voting and submitting questions for earnings calls, but more is apparently coming:
These services were already offered directly through Tesla’s IR website and the Say platform.
You can also choose more options for your investor email subscription:
Shareholders can choose only to get the big events or all SEC filings.
This is something that more large companies with massive investor bases are starting to do.
I would assume that this is also going to give Tesla more data on its investor base, which can prove useful.
Some are already speculating that Tesla is doing that to potentially go private, like Musk previously talked about and tried to do with Twitter, but I think that’s a bit far-fetched.

2022/07/26,"Uber is expanding its electric vehicle rides through its new “Comfort Electric” option to more cities, and since most of its electric rides come from Tesla vehicles, the ride-hailing company has started sending notifications about how to open Tesla door handles, which can be confusing for first-time riders.
Last year, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles to be delivered over the next year.
Shortly after, Hertz announced that on top of adding Tesla vehicles to its rental fleet, the company also made a deal with Uber to offer its drivers access to the Tesla vehicles. 50,000 Tesla vehicles will be offered for rent to Uber drivers, and the company has an option for more if the program is successful.
The company recently launched the “Comfort Electric” option that pays drivers more when Uber users choose an electric ride. Tesla Model 3, Model Y, and Polestar 2 are part of this fleet – but it remains primarily Tesla vehicles.
Last month, Uber revealed that it has 15,000 Tesla vehicles in its fleet through its Hertz deal.
Today, Uber announced that it is expanding the program to seven new cities:
Today, we’re announcing the expansion of Comfort Electric, our first all-electric rides offering, to seven additional cities including Las Vegas, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, Philadelphia and Baltimore. In May, we launched Comfort Electric in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles.
The company has had feedback about some people having difficulties opening Tesla doors:
For those of you who have only admired Teslas from a distance, they’re coming your way! We’ve heard from drivers that some riders are having difficulty figuring out how to open the Tesla door handle. Don’t worry – we got you!
Their solution is to send push notification ahead of a Tesla ride to explain how to open the door handles:
The new push notifications are starting today with the expansion to new cities. Uber hasn’t updated the number of Tesla vehicles in its fleet.
The need for instructions on opening Model 3/Y are not new. New York City taxi drivers have had door instructions (seen below) for some time now.

2022/07/25,"The average electric car price in the United States hit $66,000 last month – a more than 13% increase year over year. That’s a bit disappointing since the promise has been that EV prices would come down, but this price increase isn’t the whole story.
One of the biggest complaints about electric vehicles remains their prices. They are unattainable for most consumers, even with subsidies.
To be fair, most new cars are not a smart purchase for most people, and EVs are going after the new car market. But there’s also the factor that many automakers entering the EV space started with more expensive segments, resulting in electric vehicles being on average more expensive.
Now on top of it all, there’s out-of-control inflation that is increasing the price of everything – including electric cars. Kelley Blue Book is out with a new report tracking average car prices across the United States. Their report confirms that the average EB price has increased 13.7% to $66,000:
The average price paid for a new electric vehicle (EV) increased in June by 3.8% compared to May and 13.7% versus a year ago. The average price for a new electric vehicle – over $66,000, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates, is well above the industry average and more aligned with luxury prices versus mainstream prices.
That’s a significant year-over-year increase, but it is in line with price increases for the broader car market, which was up 12.7% to $48,043 last month.
Obviously, the $18,000 difference in average price is not a great comparison since gas-powered vehicles are offered in a much larger variety of models and in more categories than EVs, which again, tend to be more premium and luxury models.
Nevertheless, the actual cost of ownership is extremely close on average after accounting for gas savings. 
KBB released average transaction prices for each brand, and Tesla is up almost 12% over the last year:
But interestingly, Tesla’s average sale price is extremely comparable to other premium automakers like BMW.
We can’t really blame the EV market for these price increases. Inflation is hitting virtually every industry pretty hard. Once things calm down on that front, I think we are going to see improvements in electric vehicle prices through economy of scale and reduction in battery cost.
Of course, if we are looking at the overall average sale price of electric vehicles, models in cheaper segments are going to be the biggest difference maker. I am talking about vehicles like the VW ID Life and the newly announced Hyundai $20,000 electric car.
At the same time, electric pickups are likely going to represent a significant portion of EV sales in the United States in the next few years, and that should push the average higher.

2022/07/25,"Tesla has applied to trademark the term “Cyber Roundup” ahead of what looks like is going to be a rebranded annual shareholder meeting coming up next week.
Like all other public companies, Tesla has to hold an annual shareholder meeting where shareholders can vote their shares on a bunch of different matters both brought forward by the board of directors or the shareholders themselves.
Along with this more official part of the meeting, Tesla generally holds a presentation about the company’s state and where it is going, along with a Q&A session.
Tesla has traditionally held its annual meeting in the Bay Area and more specifically at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.
But now with Tesla moving its headquarters to Texas, the automaker is bringing its meeting to Austin at Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla is also calling it “Cyber Roundup,” and it has filed to trademark the term with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
Tesla filed in both “Advertising and business” and “clothing” categories – presumably for the marketing around the meeting and to sell T-shirts with the above logo on it.
(Advertising and business) Advertising; business management; business administration; office functions.
The automaker will hold the meeting on Thursday, August 4, 2022, at 4:30 p.m. CT.
The Cyber Roundup comes after Tesla held a Cyber Rodeo event at Gigafactory Texas for the start Model Y production and the unveiling of the giant factory. 
Because of the name, many thought that Tesla would give an update on the Cybertruck, which is supposed to be produced at the plant, but Tesla didn’t release anything new about the vehicle even though it is due for an official unveiling of an updated prototype as well as updated pricing and trim information.
Now some are again expecting something about the Cybertruck at the Cyber Roundup, but it could just be a fancy name for a regular old shareholder meeting.
We will have to wait for next week to find out.

2022/07/25,"Tesla has released impressive new footage of one of its robots pulling a still smoking large casting part from one of its Giga Press machines.
This new casting approach from Tesla is going to be critical for the future of the company and especially new vehicle programs like the Cybertruck.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been heavily investing in casting and alloy technology to enable larger casted parts that have the capability to greatly simplify manufacturing.
The company acquired several units of the biggest casting machine in the world. These giant, multimillion-dollar machines are developed by Idra. Tesla’s first Giga Press, which was installed at the Fremont factory, was put into operation in 2020. The machine was the first of its kind at the time and has a clamping force of 55,000 to 61,000 kilonewtons (5,600 to 6,200 tf).
Tesla has already been producing the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle.
That was Tesla’s first major step into large cast parts, and the automaker has since been heavily investing in large casting technology.
The automaker took deliveries of several more giant casting machines at Gigafactory Texas, and Tesla has started producing the Model Y at the plant with both front and rear single-piece casting.
This approach has greatly simplified Tesla’s body shops – bringing the number of robots per unit of production capacity down significantly:
To get a better understanding of how this casting technology works, Tesla has released an impressive new video of one of those giant cast parts coming out of the Giga Press:
Our huge casting machines enable us to make full-size cars the same way toy cars are made ✌️ pic.twitter.com/pWvW5Ovufo
You can see the single part, which is basically one-fourth of an entire car body, still smoking after coming out of the press.
Now Tesla is going all-in on the giant casting technology.
Earlier this year, Idra was teasing a new 9,000-pound Giga press that will take the prize as largest in the world. Considering Tesla’s relationship with Idra, it was rumored that the new machine (pictured below) would be for the automaker again.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has since confirmed that the machine is going to be used for the Cybertruck body at Gigafactory Texas.
Since Tesla has been moving in that direction, several other automakers have reportedly reached out to Idra and other casting machine makers to do the same.
However, Tesla is believed to have a significant advantage since it has been both working on this technology for a long time and also developed new alloys to work better with larger cast parts.

2022/07/25,"Tesla has disclosed in a new filing today that it was recently subpoenaed by the SEC over Elon Musk’s tweets again. It’s the second time over the last year.
Musk and the SEC have had a few run-ins with each other, and it was rarely with a good outcome.
Most famously, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk over his infamous “funding secured” comment regarding his failed attempt to take Tesla private back in 2018.
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) judged that Musk exaggerated when saying that the funding was “secured”:
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Musk went on a campaign against the SEC, calling them names and claiming that they were working for people shorting the electric automaker.
Tesla and Musk ended up reaching a settlement with the SEC.
As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down from the role of chairman of the board, and both Tesla and Musk had to each pay $20 million in fines.
The CEO presumably didn’t want Tesla to have to pay for his issue with the SEC, and while he couldn’t directly pay for Tesla’s part of the fine, he decided to buy $20 million worth of shares from Tesla.
That way, he sort of indirectly ended up paying for Tesla’s fine – though he also ended up with ~71,000 additional Tesla shares in the process.
As we previously reported, Musk ended up actually making money from the settlement due to Tesla’s stock price surging last year.
Another part of the settlement was that Musk and Tesla had to agree for the former to have his tweets reviewed by the latter’s legal department if they are material to the company.
This didn’t appear to have any effect on how Musk tweeted until an issue in 2019 when the SEC asked a judge to hold Musk in contempt for violating one of the terms of the settlement of the SEC’s complaint against Musk over his “funding secured” comment about his attempt to take Tesla private.
The SEC and Musk came to a settlement that avoided him being held in contempt of court, but it added new oversight over his tweets.
The SEC settlement requires that Musk get pre-approval for tweets that “reasonably could contain material information” and which could move the stock.
Back in November 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena to Tesla apparently to try to see if it needed to enforce the tweet pre-approval requirement.
Over the last year and seemingly after that subpoena, Musk has been attempting to get out of this deal, which he claims he was forced to get into to avoid Tesla going bankrupt and that he never lied about the “funding secured” comment, which started this whole thing.
Back in April 2022, a judge ruled that Elon Musk can’t get out of his “Twitter police” deal with the SEC.
Recently, a bunch of text messages and emails from Musk and people related to the situation confirmed what pretty much everyone knew about Tesla’s take-private deal – Musk took a meeting with the head of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and had early discussions about taking Tesla private, which he took as enough to say that the “funding was secured.”
But that didn’t end the saga because Tesla disclosed today that it was again subpoenaed by the SEC over “governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement,” which points to the same issue.
Tesla wrote in the filing regarding its dealings with the SEC:
For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. On November 16, 2021, and June 13, 2022, the SEC issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended.
It sounds like the SEC was concerned over a tweet Musk made about Tesla last month and subpoenaed the company to see if the legal department approved it first.
It’s not clear what tweet it was. On June 13, the day of the subpoena, Musk tweeted about Tesla “accelerating RHD Model Y production”:
We’re working on accelerating RHD Model Y production. Didn’t expect demand to be so high!
The fact that he also said that the demand is “high” could be material, but the tweet was actually in response to an article that was highlighting high demand.

2022/07/25,"Tesla has reportedly started applying for more public grants to expand its Supercharger network with the requirement that it can be used by non-Tesla electric vehicle owners.
The company already announced plans to open its Supercharger network to all-electric vehicles globally, but the rollout of the initiative has been slow and is currently limited to Europe. The move makes sense considering Tesla has adopted the CCS standards in Europe like all other automakers, and its Supercharger stations are already equipped with CCS connectors.
Therefore, opening the Supercharger network there only requires opening up its software compatibility.
In North America, Tesla uses its own proprietary connector on both its vehicles and its Supercharger stations. This approach prevents non-Tesla EV owners from using the Supercharger network and limits Tesla owners to the Supercharger network for fast-charging unless they can get their hands on a CHAdeMO or CCS adapter.
It hasn’t been clear how Tesla plans to implement its plan to open the Supercharger network in the United States, but CEO Elon Musk previously talked about having an adapter at the stations for non-Tesla EV owners to use.
Earlier this year, Musk hinted that Tesla will be adding the CCS connectors directly at the stations.
As for the timing of this happening in North America, everything points to something happening by the end of the year. Even the White House recently announced it on its website.
Why would the White House get involved in that? The US federal government recently opened up billions in funding for EV charging infrastructure, but to get access to the funding, the charging stations need to be open to EVs from more than one manufacturer.
Therefore, another good indicator of Tesla starting to open up the network is when they start to apply for those funds on new stations.
Now the Wall Street Journal reports today that Tesla has already started applying for those funds based on “recent regulatory filings and other documents”:
Tesla already has a national network of fast chargers for its own drivers, but they aren’t available to other types of vehicles in the U.S. For a year, the company has said it plans to open its U.S. network to others, though details about timing and whether it would open existing stations or new ones have been sparse. Recent regulatory filings and other documents indicate that the company is applying for public funding that, if granted, would require access by other makers of EVs to the network.
However, the Journal is light on details as it only references two applications for funding from Tesla.
The first one is a previously reported application for funds in Texas, but that wasn’t from the new federal effort but from remaining funding from the VW Dieselgate settlement, and as we previously reported, Tesla didn’t win any funding from that program.
The only other effort mentioned in the article is for some new Superchargers in California as part of a state program:
While federal infrastructure dollars won’t start to become available until later this year, Tesla sites in Willows, Barstow, Coalinga and Baker are among 17 likely winners of a California grant to help build public chargers. The California Energy Commission would have to approve the funding, possibly at an October meeting of the five commissioners, according to the agency.
The $7.5 billion in funding from the federal infrastructure bill is not expected to be distributed until the end of the year.

2022/07/23,"Elon Musk announced that he is working toward Tesla achieving same-hour service on its vehicles as often as possible by using “Formula 1 pit crew techniques.”
As usual, Musk took to Twitter to make the announcement:
Excited to work with Tesla Service to enable same-hour service as often as possible! Applying Formula 1 pit crew techniques to Teslas.
This is actually not the first time that Tesla announced such an effort. Back in 2015, Tesla hired Kenny Handkammer, a 25-year F1 veteran and former Red Bull Racing chief mechanic, to lead new service programs as Global Director of Service Innovation.
Welcome @Chiefboltkennyh to @TeslaMotors. He will apply Formula 1 techniques to revolutionize servicing mainstream cars.
One of the first programs he put in place was F1-inspired ‘fast lanes’ at service centers to curb wait times. Handkammer left Tesla in 2017, and he is now in charge of global technical service and operations at Lucid Motors.
This new announcement today comes after Tesla already announced a renewed focus on service over the last few months.
Last month, we reported on Musk’s announcement that Tesla is working on service in North America and how Telsa is aiming to make the majority of appointments same-day repairs. As we noted, it is much needed since Tesla’s customer fleet is growing at a much faster pace than its service infrastructure. However, Musk didn’t elaborate on how Tesla plans to achieve that.
Tesla’s service problem was much bigger than we anticipated as we learned that the automaker was going as far as sending untrained employees from other departments to work on cars.
During a company-wide meeting a week after the same-day repair announcement, Musk elaborated after being asked by an employee:
I think we still have a relatively conventional approach to servicing – although we kind of use the vehicle app. So we definitely have better servicing than the rest of the industry, but I really want Tesla to look at how we can revolutionize service and I don’t know, make it 10 times better than the rest of the industry.
The CEO said that the goal to get to two-third thirds of appointments being same-day repairs is part of that mission. He said that Tesla looked at the data of all the different repairs, and he believes that most of them can be done on the same day as long as parts are available at the service centers.
Musk said that he aims for Tesla to achieve that goal with bigger centers and more specialization – meaning that each service center is going to have service bays to perform very specific services. It sounds like the newly announced “Formula 1 pit crew techniques” could play into that new model.

2022/07/22,"A Tesla Semi electric truck with some impressive artwork was spotted on the highway. Based on its location, it looks like Tesla is putting the electric truck to work in its own operations.
Tesla Semi might be the automaker’s most disappointing program to date.
When the original prototype was unveiled in 2017, it sent waves in the trucking industry for its potential to both decarbonize trucking and significantly reduce the cost of operations of trucks, on which the whole world relies for virtually everything.
But the vehicle program is so late at this point that a lot of the hype around it has died down. Tesla originally said that it was supposed to come in 2019, but it has been continuously delayed, and now it is expected to reach volume production and have customers deliveries until 2023. That’s a four-year delay.
But there are a few Tesla Semi electric trucks out there, and now one of them was spotted by a Redditor on the highway in California this week:
The electric tractor and trailer feature some beautiful artwork, which would indicate that it is the same unit that Tesla brought to its Cyber Rodeo earlier this year since it was being painted by an artist during the event.
The location of the electric truck westbound on the 80 near Colfax, California would suggest that Tesla is putting the truck to work moving cargo between its many locations in Northern California and Gigafactory Nevada outside of Reno.
Tesla always said that it would be its own first customer when it comes to the Tesla Semi. The automaker operates a fairly large fleet of trucks in its own operations on top of using trucking companies and integrating electric trucks in its fleet, and would obviously align with its mission while also reducing its cost of operations.
The 80 between California and Nevada is an extremely busy route for Tesla since the automaker sends hundreds of thousands of powertrains from Gigafactory Nevada to Fremont factory.
We don’t know exactly how many Tesla Semi electric trucks the company has in operation today.
We know that Tesla established low-volume production of the electric truck at a facility next to Gigafactory Nevada last year and released an image of a fleet of 4 Tesla Semi trucks shortly after.

2022/07/22,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is surging following its Q2 2022 financial results, and the shorts are hurting on what is surprisingly still the most betted against company in the world.
On Wednesday night, Tesla released its Q2 2022 financial results and beat market expectations by a considerable margin despite facing a lot of difficulties. The results have sent Tesla’s stock price surging by 9% yesterday, and it’s up another 3% this morning.
That’s the highest Tesla’s stock has been since May:
This is a welcomed change for Tesla shareholders who were having a tough few months. On the other hand, Tesla shorts – people who are betting against Tesla’s stock – are having a much tougher time.
While the automaker is not as shorted as it used to be, it is still the most shorted stock in the US and in the world, according to S3 Partners Research, a firm specializing in short interest:
According to S3, the people betting against Tesla’s stock were already down by over a $ 1 billion by mid-day yesterday following the earnings results:
TSLA shorts are down –$1.01 billion in mark-to-market losses on today’s +5.4% spike in stock price. Today’s move is increasing July’s losses to –$2.67 billion in mark-to-market losses, –14.2% monthly return on an average short interest of $18.81 billion. For the year, TSLA shorts are still profitable, up +$6.34 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market profits, up +29.6% in 2022.
Considering Tesla’s stock continues to go up, Tesla shorts are likely now down by closer to $2 billion in just two days.
S3 suggests that Tesla’s stock might be primed for another short squeeze if delivers on its promises in the second half of the year:
Tesla Inc (TSLA) reported strong second quarter results with 42% year-on- year revenue growth; strong vehicle demand (even as they raised car prices); and continued production forecast of 50% annual sales growth (even as gross margins slipped due to supply chain challenges). The end of “supply chain hell” may turn into a “short squeeze hell” for TSLA short sellers as Elon Musk says the firm has the “potential for a record breaking second half of the year.”
A short squeeze happens when people who are “shorting” a stock rush to cover the position, which limits the supply of the stock and help increase the price.
Several of Tesla’s big surges in stock price have been at least partly attributed to short squeezes.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/07/22,"Tesla has managed to strike a deal with the state of Nuevo Leon to have its own lane at the US-Mexico border, which should help the company and its suppliers get across faster.
Nuevo Leon is a weirdly shaped state that managed to have its border drawn in a way that gave it a little 9-mile border with the United States and more specifically the state of Texas.
While it is small in size, it has a large population of more than 5 million people – most of them concentrated around Monterrey, its capital, and the many industries in the region, including many automotive suppliers.
The 9-mile border means that the small state, which also borders the bigger states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas, manages its own border crossing with the US.
Now we learn that Tesla has struck a deal with the state of Nuevo Leon to have its own lane at the border crossing. It resulted in fairly comical signage for a border crossing:
Bloomberg talked to Ivan Rivas, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon, about the deal. The politician said that it was an “incentive” awarded to Tesla:
It was a simple incentive. What we want is a crossing that’s much more expedited and efficient. And maybe there will be a lane for other companies in the future like there is for Tesla.
The exclusive lane will enable Tesla and its suppliers to avoid some wait time at the border, even though the border crossing in Nuevo Leon is among the least popular and the longest wait times are generally no more than 20 minutes.
Tesla has several suppliers in Nuevo Leon according to Rivas, including EnFlex Corp. and Quanta Computer, French firm Faurecia SE, Germany’s ZF Friedrichshafen AG, and APG Mexico.
Furthermore, Tesla has reportedly been looking at potential sites for a factory in Mexico.
Earlier this year, we reported on CEO Elon Musk confirming that Tesla is considering sites for a new factory in Canada, Mexico, and the US when discussing its next plant in North America.

2022/07/21,"Elon Musk is reportedly at risk of losing his top lieutenant at Tesla over a suspicious order of ‘special glass’ that some suspect might have been for the CEO.
Omead Afshar’s official position at Tesla is director of the office of the CEO – Elon Musk’s office. But in practice, he has been seen as Musk’s chief of staff since Sam Teller, Musk’s longtime top lieutenant, left the company in 2019.
More recently, he was known to lead the construction of Gigafactory Texas, and he is often the go-between with Musk and his direct reports.
Now a new report from Bloomberg suggests that Afshar might be forced to leave Tesla.
The report stated that a purchase of “special glass” ordered by Afshar for a “secret project” got flagged by the automaker finance department as suspicious – triggering an internal investigation:
Omead Afshar, one of Elon Musk’s top lieutenants and the executive running Tesla Inc.’s Texas factory, is under scrutiny in an internal investigation for his role in a plan to purchase hard-to-get construction materials, according to people familiar with the matter.
The publication claimed that Tesla has already fired employees relating to the probe and that Afshar is likely going to be next:
Tesla has already fired some employees in relation to the probe, and the electric-vehicle maker plans to part ways with Afshar, likely through a leave of absence initially, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Terms of his exit are still being worked out.
It’s not clear what is “special” about the glass, but it is apparently difficult to get, and if it is for a personal project for Afshar or Musk himself, it is a problem that they would use Tesla’s purchasing department to place the order.
Investigators are reportedly still trying to determine if the materials were going to be for Musk’s personal use. If that’s the case, it’s unclear what kind of repercussions he could be subject to or if it will stop at Afshar.
For companies, especially publicly-traded ones, it’s important not to use company resources for personal reasons. It can open up a world of liabilities, which is likely what triggered this investigation and it is evidently a serious one if people have already been fired.

2022/07/21,"Tesla’s energy division, Tesla Energy, has achieved a record quarter on many levels, but the company didn’t have a word for its problematic solar roof product.
Yesterday, Tesla (TSLA) released its Q2 2022 financial results, and it beat Wall Street expectations. One of the highlights of Tesla’s earnings is the results of the company’s energy division.
Ahead of the earnings, Electrek already reported that Tesla’s US residential solar division had its best quarter since 2017 after the acquisition of SolarCity. The company deployed over 70 MW of residential solar in the US, and when adding other sectors, Tesla Energy deployed a total of 106 MW of solar energy in Q2 2022:
Tesla wrote about its solar deployment performance during the quarter in its shareholders’ letter:
Solar deployments increased by 25% YoY in Q2 to 106 MW, the strongest quarterly result in over four years. Although we continue to experience import delays beyond our control on certain solar components, we have expanded our supplier base to enable growth in this business. Our solar installation team continues to improve installation efficiency, enabling higher volumes and stronger economics.
Interestingly, the company didn’t mention its solar roof product at all. We previously reported that the solar roof deployment was extremely low during the quarter and Tesla recently stopped scheduling new installations in most US markets.
Tesla also had a great deployment of energy storage capacity during the quarter with 1.133 GWh deployed.
Energy storage deployment consists of Powerwalls, Powerpacks, and mostly its latest product, the Megapack, which is popular for large-scale utility projects.
While energy storage deployment was up quarter to quarter, it was down year over year due to supply issues.
Tesla wrote about it in its shareholders’ letter:
Energy storage deployments decreased by 11% YoY in Q2 to 1.1 GWh, mainly due to semiconductor challenges, which are having a greater impact on our Energy business than our Automotive business. Demand for our storage products remains in excess of our ability to supply. We are in the process of ramping production at our dedicated Megapack factory to address the growing demand.
The company is referring to its Megafactory in California, but Tesla is also still producing Megapacks at Gigafactory Nevada.
Earlier this month, we reported on an impressive number of Megapacks being spotted outside of Gigafactory Nevada – seemingly being ready to be shipped out

2022/07/21,"Tesla announced that it aims to start 4680 battery cell production at Gigafactory Texas this quarter and quickly ramp up to volume production by the end of the year.
Over the last few months, Tesla has been fairly quiet about the production of its new 4680 battery cell that enables its new structural battery pack design. This has been a concern for Tesla investors since the new battery technology is seen as critical to Tesla’s future vehicle programs.
The concerns grew larger as the automaker launched Model Y production at Gigafactory Berlin with the old architecture based on 2170 cells and after launching Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas with 4680 cells, it recently added the production of Model Y vehicles with the old architecture at the Austin factory also.
Everything pointed to Tesla having major issues ramping up production of the new and much bigger cell.
Much of Tesla’s conference call with analysts and shareholders for the release of its Q2 2022 financial results yesterday revolved around the 4680 cell. The automaker confirmed that it is having issues ironing out production processes for new technologies in the cell, including its dry electrode technology. Tesla wouldn’t confirm its current 4680 cell production rate, but it did confirm that it is still not enough to produce 1,000 vehicles per week, which would put the annual production capacity at less than 4 GWh, but it aims to achieve that “well before the end of the year.”
On the bright side, Drew Baglino, Tesla’s senior vice president, powertrain and energy engineering, confirmed that the automaker plans to officially start production of the 4680 cell at Gigafactory Texas this quarter:
Manufacturing lines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content. For these reasons, there are some new ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin. Specific to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and we produced our first commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line. Our target for Texas is to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly output before the end of this year.
“Kato” refers to Tesla’s current pilot production factory for the 4680 cell on Kato Road in Fremont, California.
The fact that Tesla plans for 4680 cell production at Gigafactory Texas to exceed production from the Kato facility by the end of the year is particularly impressive, considering the automaker also disclosed today that production in Kato increased 35% month-over-month each month since March.
Tesla always meant to learn from the production at the pilot facility and deployed more advanced and higher volume production lines at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.

2022/07/20,"Tesla (TSLA) announced today that it sold most of its Bitcoin, about 75%, during the last quarter. The automaker didn’t elaborate on the reason.
Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network showed a higher mix of renewable energy.
A year after the initial investment, Tesla’s Bitcoin holding increased to $2 billion just a few months ago. 
The cryptocurrency lost a lot of its value this year and the automaker’s position suffered greatly. Last month, we reported that Tesla was likely down by as much as $500 million on its Bitcoin investment.
However, it looks like Tesla might have avoided some of those loses.
With the release of its Q2 2022 financial results today, Tesla confirmed that it sold about 75% of its Bitcoin position:
“s of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency. Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.
With roughly $936 million from that 75% and having sold over $250 million as a sort of stress test early in its investment, Tesla is still likely up on its $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin’s value fell after Tesla disclosed the sale, but it has mostly recovered.

2022/07/20,"Tesla is reporting that its fleet of customers driving with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has now surpassed 35 million miles driven, and the pace is ramping up.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name, but it is the closest thing to a self-driving vehicle that is available to customers and not in a closed fleet operated by companies like Waymo and Cruise.
Because Tesla is putting those vehicles in the hands of customers in fairly large numbers, it is accumulating data at an impressive pace.
With the release of its Q2 2022 financial results, Tesla shared some rare numbers showing that FSD Beta has now driven over 35 million miles and the pace is increasing:
Tesla commented on the milestone and the data collected through this program:
As of the end of Q2-2022, over 100,000 Tesla drivers in North America had access to FSD Beta. Cumulative miles driven by our customers using City Streets supervised autonomy continue to grow at an unprecedented scale. Fleet data is an important part of improving and expanding the system.
The automaker appears to be adding almost 10 million miles of data per quarter at this point, and the number is expected to accelerate greatly in the coming months.
CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla will soon release FSD Beta v11, which is going to merge the highway and city driving software stacks to create a single FSD beta stack. This alone should greatly increase the number of miles driven on FSD Beta.
The update is currently expected for the end of August, but Tesla has often been late with FSD Beta software updates.
Furthermore, Tesla is also continuously expanding access to the FSD Beta to more Tesla drivers who have purchased the FSD package.
Musk recently said that he expects Tesla to have 1 million people on FSD Beta by the end of the year. However, it is believed that the number of Tesla owners who purchase the FSD package is nowhere near that number, and therefore, he must be expecting that the usefulness of the features will improve enough by the end of the year that more people are going to want to buy it.

2022/07/20,"Tesla (TSLA) is reporting a massive increase in production capacity across all its factories, closing in on a 2 million vehicle annual production capacity.
While Tesla had a tough Q2 2022 due to its forced factory shutdown at Gigafactory Shanghai, we knew that the automaker took the opportunity to increase capacity everywhere during that time.
With the release of its Q2 2022 financial results today, Tesla updated its installed production capacity across all its plants and confirmed a significant overall increase.
Here’s the reported capacity at the end of Q1 2022 (left) compared the new capacity reported today for the end of Q2 2022 (right):
Fremont Factory added 50,000 EVs in annual production capacity or roughly 10% upgrade for Model 3 and Model Y output.
Tesla recently reported that Fremont produced its 2 millionth vehicle:
Gigafactory Shanghai saw the biggest increase by going from 450,000 vehicles per year to over 750,000 vehicles, making it the largest electric vehicle factory in the world by a wide margin.
Tesla commented on the factory in its Q2 report:
While the Shanghai factory was shut down fully and then partially for the majority of Q2, we ended the quarter with a record monthly production level. Recent equipment upgrades will enable us to continue to increase our production rate further.
The automaker also shared new pictures of the factory in China:
As for Texas, Tesla is now reporting a deployed production capacity of over 250,000 vehicles per year, and it confirmed that it was achieved by introducing the production of vehicles equipped with legacy battery packs:
Our Fremont Factory made a record number of vehicles in Q2. We see opportunities for further production rate improvements. In Texas, we have added flexibility to produce vehicles with either a structural battery pack or legacy battery pack. The next generation of 4680 battery cell machinery has been installed in Texas and is in the process of commissioning. Factory output in Texas continues to grow.
Tesla shared these new pictures of Gigafactory Texas:
Tesla didn’t release as much information about Gigafactory Berlin, but it did also report a deployed production capacity of over 250,000 units:
Thanks to strong production rate improvement towards the end of Q2, our team in Germany produced more than 1,000 Model Y vehicles in a single week, using 2170 cells. We expect the production rate to continue improving through the rest of the year.
The company released images of the assembly line and paint shop at Gigafactory Berlin:
Tesla warned that there are still going to be production challenges due to labor shortage and supply chain issues, but it also showed confidence in a significant ramp up during the second half of the year.

2022/07/20,"Tesla (TSLA) has released its financial results and shareholders letter for the second quarter of 2022 after market close today.
We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders’ letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information.
Earlier this week, we posted our Tesla Q2 2022 earnings preview with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $16.521 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.81 per share.
The expectations represent a rare quarter-to-quarter decrease for Tesla due to the forced shutdown of Gigafactory Shanghai resulting in about 250,000 deliveries instead of well over 300,000 that was expected.
Just after market close, Tesla released its financial results and confirmed that it managed to beat expectations on both earnings and revenue despite a difficult quarter.
The automaker reported revenues of $16,934 billion (about $400 million more than Wall Street expected) and earnings per share of $2.27 (Non-GAAP versus $1.81 expected by Wall Street).
Tesla managed to increase its cash position by $0.8B to $18.3B during the quarter.
The automaker noted the challenges during the quarter, but it came out strong at the end with still an impressive operating gross margin:
“We continued to make significant progress across the business during the second quarter of 2022. Though we faced certain challenges, including limited production and shutdowns in Shanghai for the majority of the quarter, we achieved an operating margin among the highest in the industry of 14.6%, positive free cash flow of $621M and ended the quarter with the highest vehicle production month in our history.”
The biggest concern is probably the automotive gross margin falling for the first time in a long time, but at 27.9%, it is still amongst the best in the industry.
Tesla’s stock price was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket hour trading.
We will be posting our follow-up posts here about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts):

2022/07/20,"Tesla has paused scheduling new solar roof installations in most markets in the US. It’s not clear what’s happening, but the deployment of the solar product is at a crawl and way behind Elon Musk’s goal.
When launching the solar roof, CEO Elon Musk presented it as a critical product to accelerate solar power deployment, as it opens up the market to people needing a new roof in the near future, all while delivering a compelling new product.
He said that he aimed for Tesla to produce 1,000 new solar roofs per week by the end of 2019. It was always clear that Tesla was far behind on that goal, but we didn’t know by how much until earlier this month.
The company never released data on its solar roof installations and always included them with its solar panel retrofits, which represent the vast majority of its solar power deployment.
Earlier this month, Electrek obtained solar roof installations for the first time and confirmed that Tesla deployed 2.5 MW of solar roofs during the second quarter of 2022, or about 23 roofs per week.
Now Electrek has learned from sources familiar with the matter that Tesla has paused scheduling of solar roof installation in virtually all markets in the US, which is the only country where Tesla is installing solar roofs.
It’s unknown why Tesla has to pause installations, but it is likely due to a low supply of solar tiles. Tesla had paused solar roof installations due to supply issues back in March. Tesla has moved the installation crews to install solar panels, which are still going great. Tesla had its best month of solar panel installation ever last month.
Solar roof is now in its third iteration, and Tesla has made cost improvements and speed of installation improvements, but it remains an expensive product with problems that as resulted in serious issues for customers.
We previously reported on a customer who was left with a tarp for a roof for months.

2022/07/19,"Tesla Supercharger V4’s design has been revealed as part of the construction plans of a new station being deployed in Danvers, Massachusetts. It’s another clean design that is reminiscent of previous chargers.
Tesla’s Supercharger technology has evolved greatly over the years, going from 90 kW of capacity to 250 kW. But when it comes to the design, it hasn’t evolved a lot.
Tesla’s first Supercharger was a bit more square and blocky-looking, but the automaker didn’t deploy many of those stations. The company quickly moved to a new design (on the right) that is similar to the first generation but more refined. This design is what most people associate with the Tesla Supercharger network today:
When Tesla introduced the Supercharger V3, it didn’t really update the design of the Supercharger post.
Tesla also launched what it calls a “Urban Supercharger” with a different design, but it is meant for garages and parking lots in cities and is limited to 72 KW:
It is not a new generation of the Supercharger design, but something that Tesla has been deploying along with the previously mentioned design.
We know that Tesla has been working on a new generation of the Supercharger technology. In a recent earnings call, Tesla mentioned that it is pushing toward upgrading its fat-charging technology to a peak charge rate of 300 to 350 kW.
Furthermore, the automaker has been talking about integrating the CCS connector to the Supercharger network in North America, like it did in Europe, in order to open its network to non-Tesla electric vehicles.
There have been rumors that the new Supercharger would come with a design refresh, and now it looks like Tesla has revealed it in a new Supercharger construction plan application in Danvers, Massachusetts (via John Harris Twitter):
In the application, Tesla shows both a Supercharger V3 post and this new one called “Alternative Tesla Supercharger Post.” The automaker appears to be covering its bases and submitting both designs to have the new one accepted if it is ready in time for this particular station in Danvers.
Here’s a side-by-side of the two designs in the application:
It shows that the new design doesn’t feature the same protected cable inside the post opening, and the cable appears to be significantly longer. The new post is also significantly higher than the previous design.
Overall, it looks like a significantly bigger version of Tesla’s Urban Supercharger, which is the automaker’s latest Supercharger post design.

2022/07/19,"Tesla has been found only 1% liable by a jury in a case over a fatal crash of a teen, and dedicated a feature to his memory.
In May of 2018, two Fort Lauderdale teens were killed and a third was injured after the Tesla Model S driven by 18-year-old Barrett Riley crashed into a concrete wall at 116 mph.
The vehicle quickly caught on fire after the crash, which is not uncommon after violent crashes at high speeds regardless of its electric or gas-powered.
In 2019, Riley’s family decided to sue Tesla over what they claim was a defective battery pack that led to the fire and that Tesla “failed to warn purchasers of its vehicles of the battery’s dangerous condition.”
Furthermore, the lawsuit that Riley’s parents had a speed limiter installed at a Tesla service center two months before the accident, but Riley apparently had it removed at another service center without his parent’s knowledge, which they blamed on the automaker.
It took three years to go to trial, but the jury has now delivered its verdict and according to Law360, they awarded the family $10.5 million even though they could only put 1% of liability on Tesla with the rest going on the Riley and his father:
The jury found Tesla negligent for a crash in a 2014 Model S that killed two Florida teens and awarded the family $10.5M. However, that payout is the result of only 1% liability and the bulk of blame was assigned to the teenaged operator and his father.
Shortly after the accident, Tesla released a new speed-limiting feature in a software update dedicated to Riley. The feature allows any Tesla owner to input a speed limiter on its vehicles, instead of going through the company like Riley’s family did.
Tesla originally commented on the lawsuit:
Our thoughts continue to be with the families affected by this tragedy. Unfortunately, no car could have withstood a high-speed crash of this kind. Tesla’s Speed Limit Mode, which allows Tesla owners to limit their car’s speed and acceleration, was introduced as an over-the-air update last year in dedication to our customer’s son, Barrett Riley, who tragically passed away in the accident.
The automaker didn’t comment on the jury’s verdict, but Tesla no longer has a press relations department.

2022/07/19,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla Fremont factory has produced its 2 millionth electric car with the help of Gigafactory Nevada.
Fremont factory used to be operated by Toyota and GM before they sold it to Tesla in 2010.
Tesla couldn’t pass on the deal because of the terms, which consisted of Toyota investing $50 million in Tesla and the latter giving back $42 million to the former for the factory. Tesla basically ended up with a factory and $8 million to invest in it.
It wasn’t easy. After years of headaches, sweat, and literally unfortunately some blood, Tesla eventually managed to ramp up production of electric vehicles at the factory, where it produces its entire lineup: Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X.
Earlier this year, Tesla Fremont Factory even became the most productive car factory in the US.
Last month, we reported that Tesla now produces more cars at Fremont factory than when it was operated by GM and Toyota.
Today, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla has just produced its 2 millionth electric car:
Congrats to Tesla Fremont + Giga Nevada for making their 2 millionth car!
Musk also congratulated Gigafactory Nevada because while Fremont factory is where the vehicles are being assembled, the factory wouldn’t be able to produce as many electric vehicles if it wasn’t for the drive unit and battery pack supply from the Nevada factory.
Tesla put together a deal with Panasonic to build battery cells under the same roof where it builds battery packs on an extremely large scale, which became Gigafactory Nevada.
The automaker sends those battery packs to Fremont factory, enabling the plant to produce over half a million vehicles per year.
Tesla has been recently investing in ramping up production at the factory, and it is expected to update its production rate tomorrow with the earnings results.
Tesla currently reports the production of 100,000 Model S and Model X vehicles and 500,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles per year.

2022/07/19,"Tesla is on track to double its electric cars on Australian roads to over 50,000 units by the end of the year, according to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm.
When it comes to the auto industry, Australia often gets things late.
It’s both far for a lot of automakers and a right-hand drive market, which often comes after left-hand drive production for many American and European automakers.
Tesla is one of those automakers. It didn’t launch the Model 3 in Australia until mid-2019 – about 18 months after originally launching the electric vehicle. The same thing happened with Model Y, which only came to Australia earlier this year. Tesla has been surprised by the strong demand for the small electric SUV in the country.
However, Australia is a market that got Tesla’s Powerwalls early, and the home battery pack is extremely popular there.
But with strong demand for Model Y, Denholm, chair of Tesla’s board, believes that the company’s vehicles are going to catch up to Powerwalls in the country
She said:
Australia is in a very unique position from an energy perspective, in that we have more Powerwalls installed in Australia than we do have Teslas on the road.
Denholm added according to Reuters:
Tesla Inc’s electric vehicle (EV) sales are rapidly picking up off a low base in Australia and are set to catch up with sales of its Powerwall home batteries in the country.
Denholm disclosed that Tesla accumulated 26,500 deliveries in Australia over the last 3 years, but she believes that the automaker might double that during the second half of the year:
We now have more than 26,500 Teslas on Australian roads, and the momentum is there. I personally wouldn’t be surprised if we double that number by the end of the year.
That would be quite impressive – especially for a relatively small auto market like Australia, which has a population of 26 million who buys about 1 million cars per year. Tesla would be adding more vehicles on Australian roads in 6 months than it did over the last 3 years.
Based on its current production rate, Tesla is expected to deliver between 750,000 and 1 million vehicles during the second half of the year.

2022/07/19,"Tesla is still looking to make its own smart and efficient HVAC system for homes and it’s on the “product list,” says CEO Elon Musk.
Tesla has been putting a lot of effort into improving the air quality inside its electric cars, and it went as far as integrating a HEPA filter into its HVAC system inside some of its higher-end electric cars.
The filter can theoretically remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns (µm), and it’s adapted into an efficient HVAC system in order to not affect too negatively the range of its vehicles.
When announcing that Tesla is working on a software update to make the HVAC system quieter in the new Model S last year, CEO Elon Musk was asked on Twitter about Tesla making a home HVAC system:
Oh man, home hvac that is super energy efficient, quiet & purifies the air would be great. We developed it for the car, but it can be scaled up for home use.
It’s something that the CEO has been talking about for years and strongly hinted that Tesla was working on it at some point, but it sounded like he is still pondering the idea at the time.
Again on Twitter this year, Musk said that it is on Tesla’s “future product list”:
It’s on the future product list. Especially important in places like Austin, which has next-level amounts of pollen in the air.
HVAC systems are among the most energy-demanding products in homes and are becoming increasingly needed with extreme heat waves in many regions of the world – including Tesla’s new home of Texas.
When talking about Tesla making its own HVAC, Musk previously mentioned making it super efficient to save energy, adding a HEPA filter to clean the air, and even potentially using the capability to create clean water.
The CEO also talked about making it a smart system that would only turn on when needed and even integrate it with its vehicles to turn on ahead of arriving home.
Tesla and especially Musk have been talking about this for years, but it doesn’t sound like the product is in an advanced stage of development yet.

2022/07/18,"Tesla vehicles have reached the Mount Everest base camp for the very first time, operating at five kilometers of altitude.
Tesla is known for not advertising, but it does sometimes produce and/or share marketing videos from its owners on social media. 
This one from Tesla China is particularly interesting as it features a couple of Tesla owners who drove their Model Y and Model X all the way to the Mount Everest base camp. Tesla recently completed its Supercharger route along the China National Highway 318 (G318), which runs from Shanghai to Zhangmu across 5,476 kilometres (3,403 miles).
Trensen, a Chongqing-based bridge designer and travel vlogger, and his friend set out to test the route from Chengdu to the Mount Everest base camp – around 2,339 km (1,425 miles) and nine Supercharger stations. The distance itself is not that impressive. I just drove a similar distance from Quebec to Mississippi in a Model 3 last week, and it was actually quite easy.
But the difference here is the elevation that Trensen had to drive up and the rough terrain that he and his friend faced. He also had to have wheel chains at times, which destroy his efficiency.
Cars powered by internal combustion engines actually have issues operating at high altitude since oxygen is low and they need it to achieve combustion.
He also had to sleep in the car on a few occasions, which also drains the battery pack since he had to keep climate control on. But, they made it to their destination, becoming the first Tesla vehicles to do so.
At the end of the video, Tesla notes that it has already deployed over 8,700 Superchargers at over 1,200 stations in mainland China.
The automaker also operates an extensive Destination charger network in the country with more than 1,800 chargers at over 700 locations. Those chargers are primarily located at hotels and tourist destinations.

2022/07/18,"Less than a week after start of production for its first scaled electric hypercar, Rimac Group continues to expand its growing EV battery business, offering a one-two punch in a relatively nascent industry. Rimac is reportedly developing 46mm battery cells of various heights, similar to Tesla’s more energy dense 4680 cells that have recently begun rolling out in its EVs. 
Rimac Automobili was founded in Croatia in 2009 and has been developing technologically advanced electric hypercars since. Its first EV, the Concept_One, was introduced in 2016 and is considered one of the world’s fastest production vehicles, although that production run only consisted of eight units.
Rimac followed up with the Concept_Two – which debuted in 2018 – and eventually evolved into its production form renamed the Nevera. This larger scaled EV officially began start of production this month, after years of development and delays brought on during the pandemic. 
Rimac Group is currently erecting a new $224 million headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, which will be home to its Rimac Bugatti joint venture with Porsche, Rimac Automobili, and Rimac Technology – the group’s separate arm that develops batteries, converters, and other vehicle systems for itself and other OEMs. Per its website:
Rimac battery systems provide the highest power and energy density, engineered to be manufactured at high volume. Our experience is built up from over 10 years of developing high-performance batteries for over 30 different projects, commissioned by more than 10 global OEMs.
Rimac already has a dozen projects in place with other automakers, some of which include supplying battery cells. According to a recent report of of Europe, the Croatian automaker is emulating Tesla and developing its own 46mm battery cells. But unlike Tesla, Rimac is exploring varying cell heights for its new EV modules. 
News of Rimac Group’s transition to 46mm battery cells comes from Automotive News Europe, who says the company is simultaneously developing unique modules to house the cells. The technology itself emulate fellow EV automaker Tesla, who first introduced its potential in its 4680 cells.
The name is derived from the larger, more energy-dense dimensions of the battery cells, which are 46mm in diameter and 80mm tall. According to Wasim Sarwar Dilov, Rimac Technology’s head of research and advanced engineering, its cells won’t be limited to just 80mm and will be “varied heights.”
Dilov also said Rimac’s battery technology side hustle is currently chatting with three battery manufacturers to supply cells for its new EV modules which will be the foundation for its future programs. Which cell manufacturers are in discussions is unknown, but you can probably narrow it down to at least five big names. 
Although both Porsche and Hyundai Motor Group have minority stakes in the company, it is free to supply other automakers with its technology, and it has. Rimac says it has twelve separate projects with different automakers in the works and according to Dilov, most of them are not for current investors.
Rimac did divulge the names of two customer agreements for battery packs – Aston Martin for its Valkyrie hybrid and Koenigsegg in Sweden.
Looking ahead, Rimac’s 46mm battery cells will be an integral part of structural battery packs it is working on that will implemented within the car’s body rather than typical battery boxes within box platforms that are commonplace today.
To compliment the more energy dense cells, Rimac is working to slenderize the rest of the battery pack to deliver the best conversion efficiency rate as possible. The Rimac Nevera is currently at 67%, but the goal is to develop modules that deliver an efficiency of 75% cells per pack before their aimed start production in 2025.
In addition to 46mm battery cells, Rimac Technology also develops its own UX, infotainment, and performance software, a factor Dilov believes can separate the company from other automakers like Tesla:
 Our hardware is great, but so is lots of hardware. With our software however we can extract more performance from any given cell than our competitors.

2022/07/18,"Tesla’s new Full Self-Driving Beta update (10.13) is all about left turns, animal detection, speed limits, and much more. Here are the release notes.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
The last update came in May, so it has been a little while since Tesla has pushed something new to the FSD Beta fleet.
Last week, we reported on CEO Elon Musk talking about the new FSD Beta 10.13 update, which he said would be released internally last weekend and externally this week.
The release notes have now leaked and they show what Tesla has been working on for this update (via Reddit):
As Musk said last week, there is a clear focus on this update to better handle handle left turns, especially the difficult left turn that early FSD Beta tester Chuck Cook has been putting the software through for the last year and a half.
But we now learn that the update also makes some other improvements including animal detection, speed limit sign reading, and more.

2022/07/18,"Tesla (TSLA) is set to announce its second-quarter 2022 financial results on Wednesday, July 20, after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management is scheduled after the results.
Here we’ll take a look below at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.
As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q2 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drives the vast majority of the company’s revenue.
Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 254,000 electric vehicles during the second quarter of the year.
This is the first time in a long time that Tesla’s deliveries were down and it is due to lockdown restrictions in Shanghai forcing the automaker to shut down Gigafactory Shanghai for weeks during the quarter.
Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results
For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers, but it is harder this quarter to adjust down instead of up this time.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $16.521 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a significantly higher revenue of $17.186 billion.
It’s rare that the range is this significant, but it is to be expected with this quarter’s conditions. It is also interesting that revenue estimates are not that far off from the previous quarter, despite already knowing that Tesla delivered about 50,000 fewer vehicles this time around.
Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years: Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus are in gray, actual results are in green:
Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful doing so over the last two years now.
For Q2 2022, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $1.81 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $2.06 per share.
These earnings estimates are even more surprising than the revenue estimates since they point to Tesla barely slowing down on the earnings side of things despite the challenges during the quarter with Shanghai being shut down for weeks and Texas and Berlin losing a lot of money while trying to ramp up production.  
Here are the earnings per share over the last two years: Estimize predictions in blue, Wall Street consensus in gray, actual results in green:
In the shareholder’s letter and the following conference call, Tesla generally shares additional details about not only financial results, but also other important metrics on how the company is doing.
While the quarter was difficult for Tesla, it looks like it’s already behind them with Tesla already reporting that June was the automaker’s best month for production ever.
I think a lot of the questions are going to look forward to things like production ramps at Gigafactory Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai.
The level of information coming out of the earnings will likely depend a lot on whether or not Musk is going to be on the call, which he said he will not always be on going forward. He would make sense for him to be on this time considering that Tesla has let go of many employees this quarter and shareholders and analysts are likely going to have a lot of questions about that.
If Musk is there, I think he will have to field some questions about Tesla’s upcoming AI Day on September 30, which is likely going to be Tesla’s next big event.
When it comes to Tesla Energy, we do have some rare data ahead of the results. Electrek reported that Tesla had its best quarter in years for residential solar in the US with 71.5 MW. The final number will be higher with some deployment in the commercial market and other regions.
We also reported that solar roof deployment is still exceptionally slow and shareholders should ask questions about that considering Tesla has previously mentioned that this is going to be an important product.
The FSD Beta program is also critical and investors will want an update on that front.

2022/07/18,"Tesla has been working on a new “self-diagnostic” feature in its app that the automaker runs when certain types of service appointments are requested.
For better or worse, Tesla has been heavily betting on its mobile app to handle service.
It can be challenging for some Tesla owners to simply directly contact their local Tesla service center. Instead, everything is handled through Tesla’s mobile app, from explaining the issue to scheduling an appointment. You often won’t talk to a human until your car is already in the shop.
Some prefer this experience; others would like to be able to talk to a technician about their issues beforehand.
One of the main reasons Tesla believes this is a more efficient model for them is the level of connectivity inside its vehicles, resulting in the ability to remotely diagnose a lot of issues.
Some of them are even fixed remotely through a software update, but the remote diagnostic capability is also useful to pinpoint problems that need a physical fix before the vehicles come into the service center.
This is always something that Tesla’s service team has been able to do remotely on all its vehicles, but a Tesla fan looking at the source code of the latest Tesla app software update was able to find that the automaker has also been working on a “self-diagnostics” feature:
I finally saw the new ""self diagnostics"" feature in action, which @Tesla_App_iOS and I discovered in the source code of the app a few weeks back.Scheduling a service for certain categories triggers the diagnostics and informs you if a fault is present and if service is required pic.twitter.com/YPnrzCLBPg
Based on the information found in the app update, a Tesla owner having an issue with their car could now be prompt to run self-diagnostics, depending on the category of issue reported for a service appointment.
In this example, the system found a problem with a Bluetooth endpoint in the Tesla vehicle:
This is not a blanket self-diagnostic available to owners on all of Tesla’s systems inside vehicles, but it does provide a little more information to owners when they are having specific issues with their vehicles.
What do you think of this new feature? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/07/16,"Elon Musk says that Tesla is getting closer to integrating Valve’s Steam, which would take its in-car gaming platform to a whole new level.
We know that Tesla has been investing heavily into integrating video games into its in-car entertainment system, but it still surprised many when Tesla said earlier this year that it planned to go as far as integrating Valve’s Steam, an online video game store and distribution platform, in its vehicles. It would result in a massive increase in games playable inside Tesla vehicles.
This week, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is getting closer to achieving Steam integration and the automaker is aiming for a demonstration next month:
We’re making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month.
The demonstration is likely going to involve some computing-power-demanding video games to show what the gaming capacity is like inside Tesla vehicles.
Update: the Steam integration has been delayed, but Tesla is still working on it as CEO Elon Musk himself tested the software.
As we previously reported, Tesla has a team of software engineers working on video games in Seattle, and they recently started building a similar team in Austin. The automaker has been building a video game platform called Tesla Arcade inside its vehicles, and it has been working with video game studios to port games to it.
Right now, it is mainly to create some added value to its ownership experience, but Tesla might have bigger plans for gaming inside its vehicles. Musk has been indicating recently that he believes “entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves,” which he thinks Tesla can achieve later this year.
In preparation for that, the automaker has been releasing more video games in its Tesla Arcade, and it has indicated that it might turn it into a business. We have seen indications that Tesla plans to offer paid packages of different video games inside its vehicles, which would get the company into the same business as Valve’s Steam, the PlayStation Store, and the Xbox Live store.
But it looks like Tesla is instead betting on Steam integration.
With the unveiling of the new Model S and Model X, Tesla has announced a new gaming computer inside the vehicles:
Up to 10 teraflops of processing power enables in-car gaming on-par with today’s newest consoles via Tesla Arcade. Wireless controller compatibility allows gaming from any seat.
A known chip leaker, Patrick Schur, posted a diagram of Tesla’s new gaming computer powered by the AMD Navi 23 GPU:
The system is integrated and connects directly to two touch screens inside the Model S and Model X to play games, watch entertainment, and perform some other functions.
Musk also revealed that the new computer has more storage space to be able to handle more games on the platform at the same time.
The website videocardz compared the specs with existing consoles from the latest generation – showing that it does indeed match up well based on the specs available:

2022/07/15,"Elon Musk says that Tesla is waiting for inflation to “calm down” before it can finally start reducing the prices of its electric vehicles, which have increased 20-30% over the last two years.
Early in the electric vehicle revolution, one of the main complaints was the cost.
EV enthusiasts counter the argument with the claim that cost would go down with volume and as battery cost would improve with new technologies.
They were right until 2020, when the pandemic and out-of-control inflation hit the world’s economy pretty hard.
Tesla has been the best example of that due to its direct-to-consumer approach that doesn’t rely on car dealerships that agree on the final price with the customers.
Instead, Tesla’s advertised prices on its website are the final prices, and they have been going up steadily.
For example, the Tesla Model Y started at $53,000 in early 2020, and today, the same vehicle starts at $66,000.
That’s a 25% increase in price in less than two years, and the same is happening across Tesla’s entire vehicle lineup.
Interestingly, those price increases have not affected Tesla’s demand as the automaker still enjoys a significant backlog of orders with some of its models still having a 6- to 10-month delivery timeline on new orders.
But Tesla has stated that its goal has been to reduce electric vehicle prices to make them accessible to more people.
On Twitter today, CEO Elon Musk was asked about when can we expect Tesla to lower prices again, and the CEO said that Tesla plans to lower prices when “inflation calms down”:
If inflation calms down, we can lower prices for cars
It’s important to note that while Tesla has been increasing prices significantly over the last two years, its gross margin on vehicles has also significantly improve – indicating that Tesla’s price increase has been greater than its cost increases due to inflation and supply chain issues.
Tesla has explained this by saying that because of its backlog of order, it has to increase prices based on the cost of vehicles to be produced in 6-10 months from now when they produce vehicles being ordered today. The automaker has not always been able to predict those increases acccurately.

2022/07/15,"Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 exportation from Gigafactory Shanghai accounts for half of China’s electric vehicle exportation during the first half of 2022.
When Tesla first announced its plan to build a giant electric car factory in Shanghai, CEO Elon Musk said it was solely to supply China’s local demand for electric vehicles and wouldn’t export any vehicle to other markets.
But it didn’t end up turning out that way.
Tesla was extremely successful in ramping up production at Gigafactory Shanghai, which became the most productive electric vehicle factory in the world at an incredible pace.
In 2021, Tesla decided to take advantage of the production rate and turned Gigafactory Shanghai into its “export hub.”
Now the automaker had a tough first half of 2022 in China due to Gigafactory Shanghai being shut down for a significant part of Q2 due to lockdowns in the city.
Despite those difficulties, Tesla’s exports account for half of China’s electric vehicle exports during the first half of the year according to data compiled by CnEVPost:
Tesla’s Shanghai plant exported 97,182 vehicles in the first half of the year, accounting for 48 percent of all NEVs exported from China in the same period, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) monitored by CnEVPost.
China refers to all non-gas-powered vehicles as “new energy vehicles” (NEV), but electric cars account for most of those.
Here are Tesla’s historical exports from China:
Historically, Western markets have been reticent to buy cars that were built in China even if they were built by major American or European automakers, but things are changing and especially for electric vehicles.
But now Tesla, Volvo, BMW, and Polestar are all exporting electric cars from China and having success with this model.
It’s a trend that started before 2020, but it has been ramping up fast over the last two years, and it is expected to continue.

2022/07/15,"PG&E announced that more than 1,500 Tesla Powerwall owners have already decided to joined the new virtual power plant it launched in partnership with Tesla in California.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems, like Tesla Powerwalls, used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants. Last year, Tesla launched a test VPP in California, where Powerwall owners would join in voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it.
Last month, Tesla and PG&E, a large electric utility company in Northern California, announced the launch of a new commercial VPP where homeowners with Powerwalls would get compensated for helping the grid with the energy in their battery packs.
PG&E has now released an update on the virtual power plant and said that more than 1,500 Tesla Powerwall owners have already joined the program:
On June 22, Tesla invited approximately 25,000 PG&E customers with Powerwalls to join the VPP and help form the world’s largest distributed battery. In the first two weeks of the new program, more than 3,000 customers have expressed interest in enrolling, with more than 1,500 customers officially in the program.
Aaron August, vice president of Business Development & Customer Engagement at PG&E, commented on the progress of the VPP:
VPPs are a valuable resource for supporting grid reliability and an essential part of California’s clean energy future. Our customers’ home batteries offer a unique resource that can positively contribute to our state’s electric grid and will become more significant as our customers continue to adopt clean energy technology. In collaborating with Tesla, we are further integrating behind-the-meter battery-based VPPs on the largest scale yet, helping to make customer resiliency technologies more accessible and continuing a long tradition at PG&E of actively integrating VPP resources into our energy supply portfolio.
Drew Baglino, senior vice president of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, added:
Enabling Powerwall customers to support the grid and their community is a necessary and important part of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy. We seek to partner with utilities and regulators everywhere to unlock the full potential of storage to bring more renewable, resilient, and less costly electricity to everyone.
With an average of two Powerwalls per customer, the VPP most likely already has a 13 MW load capacity.
PG&E says that if all eligible Powerwall owners join, the VPP would have the available megawatts equivalent to “the energy generated by a small power plant.”
Tesla Powerwall owners can join through the Tesla app and receive $2 per kWh that they send back to the grid during emergency events.

2022/07/14,"Tesla is now allowed to sell the Model Y vehicles it produced during the long “test phase” at Gigafactory Berlin.
While no number has been disclosed, we are talking about potentially thousands of electric vehicles.
For the better part of a year, Tesla was stuck in a regulatory limbo at Gigafactory Berlin before it was finally allowed to officially start production in March 2022.
But the automaker disclosed that it actually started producing vehicles at the plant in late 2021.
Those vehicles were produced under temporary permits for “testing purposes” and Tesla was not allowed to sell them.
It’s not clear how many of those test vehicles Tesla produced, but there are at least 2,000 of them since in January alone Tesla received a permit to produce 2,000 Model Y bodies and that was after receiving other permits for smaller production test runs.
Now we learn that the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment (LfU) has authorized Tesla to sell those vehicles.
Tesla reportedly made the request last month and it was granted. Some people in Germany are suggesting that Tesla is violating the conditions under which it was allowed to produce those vehicles, but German magazine RBB asked LfU about it and the government agency disagrees:
When asked by rbb, the LfU rejected the accusation that Tesla was violating the requirements of the approval authority with this possible sale. “Tesla is free to process bodies that were created during the period of testing the operational capability and to sell them if they are marketable,” explains Thomas Frey from the LfU.
In the application, it wasn’t revealed how many vehicles from the test phase Tesla plans to deliver to customers.
This is a no-brainer. If the vehicles pass inspection and quality control, there’s no reason to waste them.
Yes, they were produced during a “test phase,” but they were many factors involved that had nothing to do with the quality of bodies and vehicles Tesla was producing at the time.
As for how it affects Tesla, it is obviously going to help the automaker. As CEO Elon Musk recently disclosed, Tesla is losing billions of dollars at GIgafactory Berlin and Texas until those factories ramp up to volume production.
The ability to deliver those vehicles to customers is going to at least give a temporary output boost to Giga Berlin.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/07/14,"Elon Musk, who is known to hype Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software updates with adjectives like “fire” and “mind-blowing,” surprises by actually managing expectations on Tesla’s upcoming v11 FSD Beta software update.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has frequently been releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
The last update came in May, so it has been a little while since Tesla has pushed something new to the FSD Beta fleet.
When asked on Twitter about it this week, Musk said that FSD Beta testers should expect a 10.13 update next week:
10.13 goes to internal beta tomorrow, external next week. Should handle Chuck’s complex left turn.
When talking about “Chuck’s complex left turn,” he is referencing Chuck Cook, an early FSD Beta tester, who has been posting videos of attempting an unprotected left turn that has been giving Tesla’s systems some issues:
In the same tweet, Musk commented on Tesla’s upcoming v11 update – a bigger FSD Beta software update that should deliver a single software stack for both highway and city driving.
Interestingly, instead of his usual superlative about these bigger software updates, Musk managed expectations and said that most of the improvements were already incorporated in the number 10.x releases:
Beta v11 hopefully end of next month, which just amounts to incorporating highway. Importance of “v11” has been reduced by all the 10.x releases. We’re already mostly at v11.
The update is now expected in late August, but Musk and Tesla have been known to deliver those late.
Knowing what the “mind-blowing” FSD Beta updates actually looked like, we certainly know to manage our expectations if that’s how Musk talks about this one.
With that said, I think a single stack for both highway and city driving is an important step closer to Tesla delivering on its promise of delivering a full self-driving system.
But after driving with FSD Beta for two months now, I have to say that I still have a hard time seeing getting from here to there. The computer vision system is impressive and extremely good at detecting its environment, but the decision-making is still the equivalent of a 14-year-old who has been learning to drive for the last week and sometimes appears to consume hard drugs.

2022/07/14,"A bunch of Tesla alums has launched a new electric RV startup with its first product being a travel trailer equipped with an electric powertrain to help increase the range of an electric vehicle towing a trailer.
At Electrek, we have been arguing that the RV market is primed to be electrified for a few years now, but there are only a few projects being developed.
Winnebago has its e-RV electric motorhome concept and the electric Airstream concept, but it appears that we are still far from an actual product that we can buy.
One thing is clear, more and more companies are looking at the market, and we learned of an interesting new entry this week: Lightship Energy, a small startup launched by former Tesla alums that is slowly stepping out of stealth mode with an interview with Techcrunch.
It was cofounded by Ben Parker, a mechanical engineer who worked on the Model 3 battery pack and more recently Tesla’s 4680 battery cell, and Toby Kraus, who managed the Model S program at Tesla before becoming an executive at electric bus maker Proterra.
The startup was originally launched to electrify food trucks, but when talking about it they were so often asked about electric RVs that they decided to explore the space.
After a 6,000-mile RV trip to learn about the product and industry, they decided that they could design something from the ground up that could result in a greater product for electric vehicle drivers.
Kraus, who is chief operating officer at Lightship, said:
We pulled the most aerodynamic trailer we could rent behind a Tesla Model X and we actually had to drop the trailer in the middle of an off ramp on an interstate because we couldn’t pull it to the next Supercharger. It was miserable.
After $1 million in pre-seed and $3 million in a seed round, the company recently closed a $23 million Series A round to deliver their first working prototype, which they are not ready to show yet.
But with 90% of the 600,000 units a year RV market consisting of travel trailers, the company decided to address that first.
Parker, who is now CEO of Lightship Energy, said:
Our goal is definitely to create a super satisfying long-range, EV roadtripping experience. As any good Tesla alum would work, we started with going back to the fundamentals and asking, ‘what should a travel trailer be?
When you have a 300-mile electric truck towing a trailer, it often becomes a 100-mile truck.
Lightship aims to deliver a trailer equipped with its own electric powertrain that would result in the EV pulling it not losing its range.
Parker explained:
“I think the gravity of the problem around towing and towing range is just starting to hit home with people as more EV trucks are hitting the market. With an EV powertrain on board you can use that additional energy for the trailer to propel itself, reduce all of the load on the tow vehicle and get back to a range loss zero experience — now you have a 300-mile trailer and a 300-mile truck.”
Of course, the electric trailer could also be useful to gas-powered trucks and not only EVs, but it is designed to enable a great RVing experience for electric vehicle drivers.
It’s not clear when Lightship plans to unveil its first product, but we are going to keep an eye on the startup.

2022/07/13,"Andrej Karpathy, senior director in charge of AI and computer vision at Tesla, announced that he is leaving the automaker. It is a big loss for Tesla’s Autopilot team and self-driving effort.
Karpathy joined Tesla more than five years ago as a neural net and computer vision expert. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a big part of Tesla’s Autopilot team and the automaker’s effort to develop a full self-driving system.
As Tesla expanded its effort from self-driving to broader artificial intelligence, Karpathy was promoted to senior director of AI at Tesla.
He was one of the rare executives not named Musk who was allowed to take center stage during presentations, and he was widely seen as leading Tesla when it comes to software related to AI, Autopilot, and self-driving.
In March, Karpathy announced that he was going on sabbatical for four months. At the time, we reported that it was worrisome since Tesla executives taking breaks has most often resulted in them not coming back.
Sure enough, Karpathy announced today that he is leaving Tesla:
It’s been a great pleasure to help Tesla towards its goals over the last 5 years and a difficult decision to part ways. In that time, Autopilot graduated from lane keeping to city streets and I look forward to seeing the exceptionally strong Autopilot team continue that momentum.
The AI expert said that he doesn’t know where he is going from here, but he said that he will continue to pursue his “long-term passions around technical work in AI, open source and education.”
We had heard several rumors that Karpathy was not coming back, but we couldn’t confirm it. Looks like they were true. The departure is likely going to be a big blow to Tesla’s self-driving program and broader AI effort.
The automaker has plenty of other smart people on the team, but Karparthy was seen as a competent leader and appeared to be well liked across the industry.
We don’t know who will be taking over his leadership role, but people like Ashok Elluswamy and Milan Kovac, who have both taken broader leadership roles on the software side of Autopilot in the last few years, are likely candidates.

2022/07/13,"Panasonic is reportedly going to build a new battery cell factory in Kansas to supply Tesla with its new 4680 cell.
Update: Governor Laura Kelly (D-KS) has now made the project official.
Earlier this year, we reported on Panasonic looking for a site in the United States for a new large-scale battery factory to produce the new 4680 battery cell for Tesla. At the time, it was reported that Panasonic was zeroing in on Oklahoma or Kansas for the location of the factory. 
In April, it looked like Oklahoma became the front-runner when the governor started to urge the legislature to approve an incentive package for a “multibillion dollar investment” with ties to the electric vehicle (EV) industry.
The project was quickly rumored to be the factory Panasonic planned to build in the United States.
Now, however, a new report has put the final location in Kansas.
Nikkei, a Japanese-based business publication that often has good information on Japanese companies like Panasonic, published a new report today stating that the battery manufacturer has chosen the state of Kansas for its next US battery cell factory:
“Panasonic Holdings will invest several billion dollars in a second U.S. electric vehicle battery factory in Kansas to supply a new high-capacity battery for Tesla, Nikkei has learned.”
They didn’t report the planned production capacity of the new factory, but as an investment evaluated at several billion dollars, it should be in the high tens of gigawatt-hours.
The cells Panasonic plans to produce at the new plant are the new 4680 format designed by Tesla for its next-generation electric vehicles.
The 4680 format has about five times the capacity of the previous cell and it is much bigger in size. Tesla is currently building the cells itself, a first for the automaker, but it said that it also wants as many battery manufacturers as possible to adopt the format since it plans to buy every viable battery cell available.
A factory in Kansas would be well be located to supply cells to Tesla’s new Gigafactory Texas factory in Austin. The factory is expected to need hundreds of gigawatt-hours of battery cells per year at full capacity when it builds Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, along with the current production of Model Y vehicles.
This is not a confirmed report, but Nikkei has credibility in this case. I’d put this in the highly likely possibility category.  Update: It’s now official.
Interestingly, it would put Oklahoma at 0-2 when it comes to securing large EV-related projects.
Either way, the sooner the project goes forward, the better it is for the EV space, since starting next year, Tesla is likely to be highly cell limited, and any production capacity is going to help.

They all shut them down except for Panasonic.
It took some convincing, but the Japanese manufacturer started a long relationship with Tesla that propelled the smaller battery manufacturer into the EV space and turned into a top supplier in the auto industry.
The relationship involved over the years with projects like Gigafactory Nevada where Panasonic produces battery cells under Tesla’s roof.
The two companies have also been sharing technology and working on battery chemistry together to improve performance and cost.
Today, Reuters reported on comments by Shoichiro Watanabe, CTO of Panasonic Energy and the leader of the partnership with Tesla for the Japanese company, in which he stated that the firm is looking at a 20% improvement in energy density in its battery cells within the end of the decade:
Panasonic Energy Co, a major Tesla supplier, is working on new technology to increase battery energy density by a fifth by 2030, the Japanese company’s chief technology officer told Reuters.
It could enable longer range in existing electric vehicles, lighter and more efficient vehicles with the same range, or even expanding electrification to new segments like planes.
Panasonic is reportedly looking at new additives in electrolytes to achieve higher voltage in order to achieve these improvements:
Panasonic Energy, a core Panasonic Holdings unit, plans to achieve those gains by using a new mix of additives to allow individual cells to run at a higher voltage without damaging the batteries’ performance, Shoichiro Watanabe said in an interview.
According to the report, a 20% increase in energy density would likely bump the cells currently produce by Panasonic for Tesla from 750 Wh/l today to about 900 Wh/l. 
Ideally, Panasonic wants to up the voltage from 4.2 volts to 4.5 or 4.6 volts. Watanabe said:
If we can get that to 4.5 or 4.6 volts, I think the whole world view in terms of what’s possible for EVs would change.
The firm is also looking into longevity, which has room for improvement.
We recently reported on Tesla looking into a new nickel and manganese-based battery cell that could last 100 years without significant degradation.
Panasonic wouldn’t comment when exactly when the energy density increase would come beyond that it would this decade.
The company is currently working with Tesla to start production of its new 4680 battery cell format that is expected to come with some significant capacity improvements. Panasonic is expected to start production next year.

2022/07/13,"Aptera has launched a petition to ask Congress to make Tesla Superchargers and its plug the standard for electric vehicles in the US.
When Tesla started making electric cars, there was no dominant charging standard, and therefore, Tesla developed its own. Things have changed a lot since then, and now, CCS has become the global standard.
While CCS has now been globally adopted, it doesn’t necessarily make it the best charging standard out there, and that’s what Aptera believes.
Aptera is building a battery and solar-powered super-efficient three-wheeler electric car. It claims a range of up to 1,000 miles and achieves that by making the vehicle extremely lightweight, with three wheels and a drag coefficient (Cd) of only 0.13.
When you are building a super-efficient vehicle like that, every little bit of volume and weight improvement is important down to the connector,  and as we previously reported, Apetra already said that it wants to adopt Tesla’s connector in its vehicle.
In the same report, we also stated that Aptera appears to want to encourage broader adoption of the Tesla connector, but it wasn’t clear how it plans on doing it.
Now Aptera cofounders Chris Anthony and Steve Fambro have launched a petition on Change.org to ask Congress to make Tesla Superchargers and its plug the standard for electric vehicles in the US:
If you agree that Tesla’s charging standards are good for EVs and the U.S., please help. Sign this petition and encourage decision-makers in Congress to adopt Tesla’s charging standards and connectors as the U.S. industry standard. With Washington D.C.’s goal for 50% of car sales to be electric by 2030, our country needs to adopt Tesla Supercharger and Plug standards before another dollar is wasted on inferior technology.
As part of their arguments, they mention that the current CCS and SAE J1772 standards are “clunky, cumbersome, and expensive” compared to “Tesla’s lightweight, incredibly efficient, elegant connector.”
They also cite our recent report that shows that the Superchargers Tesla planned to deploy in Texas cost about a fifth of the stations planned by other charging network owners.
The two founders wrote in the petition:
If our country began to support Tesla’s charging standards now, we could begin expanding our infrastructure at a much reduced cost, saving $4 billion dollars on projected charging infrastructure spending through 2027. Imagine what other EV programs we could support with that $4 billion in savings! 
The petition has already received over 1,000 signatures after the first few hours of being online.
As I wrote in my last report when Apetra suggested that it might try to do that, I, unfortunately, think that this is a lost cause.
I agree with the sentiment. Having used both standards at many charging stations across North America for years, there’s no doubt in my mind that Tesla Superchargers are the gold standard, but forcing the standard on all other automakers at this stage would be an almost impossible task.
I get why they could see it as a possibility. Tesla still represents the majority of EV sales in the US market, and therefore, its connector is the dominant standard. They somewhat open-sourced their patents, and so others could adopt it.
However, there are now many other EV models and thousands of CCS fast-charging stations in the US, and it would be hard and costly for them to switch connectors.
Tesla is not even pushing for that at this point as it appears to accept that CCS has won. The automaker is even talking about adding CCS adapters to its Supercharger stations in the US by the end of the year.
Again, I appreciate the sentiment, but petition or not, I think it’s a lost cause.

2022/07/12,"Inflation and global supply chain constraints continue to take their toll on EV automakers, especially those based in the United States. Young automakers like Rivian and Arrival have announced plans to restructure their businesses, hinting at potential layoffs. Meanwhile, EV veteran Tesla has laid off hundreds of employees the past month and continues to do so.
Last we heard, Rivian was reporting an optimistic uptick in EV production for last quarter, assembling a total of 7,969 EVs since the start of production late last year. At the same time, Rivian reiterated that its goal of producing 25,000 vehicles this year is still achievable. 
Despite the need for a significantly larger ramp-up in the second half of 2022, CEO RJ Scaringe relayed that Rivian’s new results show that the company is working through its previous supply chain and production issues. 
According to a recent report from Reuters, Scaringe sent an email to employees Monday night, alerting them to plans for a briefing this Friday to discuss potential layoffs. Furthermore, Scaringe shared that Rivian plans to suspend certain internal programs as part of a restructuring of the company. 
Since these details remain quite vague, we don’t want to speculate before Friday, but the restructuring could further cut costs and optimize the business as it looks to bolster EV output to swing hard for its 2022 production targets. At the end of Q1, Rivian had over $16 billion cash in hand, so potential layoffs feel like a precautionary move to stay as lean as possible.
Similar to Rivian, UK- and US-based commercial EV manufacturer Arrival is making some internal adjustments to reach scaled production of its van this year. In a press release this morning, it proposed a “reorganization of its business in response to the challenging economic environment.” 
The reason for the pivot is so the company can ensure it reaches its start of production of the Arrival Van sometime in Q3. Here’s an official statement:
Arrival has proposed plans that include a realignment of the organization that would enable it to deliver business priorities until late 2023 primarily utilizing the $500M cash on hand. Arrival’s proposal includes a targeted 30% reduction in spend across the organization and anticipates that it could potentially impact up to 30% of employees globally.
Unlike Rivian, Arrival has yet to use the word “layoffs,” but the verbiage used above indicates that nearly a third of Arrival’s staff around the globe is going to feel some sort of impact. The company said it will share more details of the revised business strategy during its Q2 earnings call on August 11.
Last month, we reported that Elon Musk had emailed Tesla executives, telling them they needed to cut 10% of the workforce and pause hiring due to the CEO’s “super-bad feeling” about the economy. 
Musk later clarified the scope of the layoffs in an email to all employees, claiming the 10% reduction would be applied to “salaried headcount” due to overstaffing following Tesla’s long growth phase. Layoffs continued through the rest of June and despite Musk’s promises, struck hourly employees in service, sales, and deliveries. That being said, most of the layoffs were in fact salaried employees. 
According to the same report from Reuters, Tesla is shuttering up its office in San Mateo, California, where staff has been developing the automaker’s Autopilot system. A filing shows that 229 additional Tesla employees will be laid off as a result of the closure. 
Funny enough, a survey of 457 recently laid-off Tesla employees showed that many of them have already moved on to Rivian and other smaller EV companies. Good luck y’all! 
All three of these companies have plenty of capital and exciting EVs in their production pipelines to stay afloat, so there’s little concern there for the time being. However, these moves do demonstrate that these automakers are not invincible and supply chain issues are truly taking their toll. 
It makes you worry about smaller EV startups facing many of the same issues. What might be the worst factor in the news above, is that so many people helping promote EV adoption have lost their jobs, and a whole bunch more are about to. Let’s hope they all bounce back quickly.

2022/07/12,"Tesla is trying to help Texas’s electric grid again amid another heat wave with its electric cars until it can with Powerwalls as it lobbies for some rule changes.
Texas has a notoriously fragile grid that is having issues supporting increasing peak electricity demand.
The issues have mostly come in the winter amid cold fronts, but the state’s electric grid has had issues this year with early heat waves.
The first one hit as soon as May, and it tripped six power plants in the state.
At the time, Tesla introduced a new way to try to help out with a new in-car alert to Tesla owners in the state encouraging them not to charge between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. if they can avoid it:
A heat wave is expected to impact the grid in Texas over the next few days. The grid operator recommends to avoid charging during peak hours between 3pm and 8pm, if possible, to help statewide efforts to manage demand.
Texas is now being hit by another heat wave, and Tesla has brought back the alert yesterday, and it is expected to be active for the next few days since the temperature is well over 100F (38C).
But Tesla would prefer to help with its Powerwall owners instead of just its electric cars.
Its electric cars represent a partially controllable load – meaning that Tesla can influence whether they add a load on the grid or not.
Powerwalls can actually send electricity back into the grid when needed, like right now. That obviously would have an even greater impact.
As we reported last month, Tesla has launched a virtual power plant demonstration with Powerwall owners in Texas, and the goal is to demonstrate the value to ERCOT, Texas’s electric utility regulating body. 
The company needs ERCOT to change some rules in order to compensate those homeowners to use the power in their home battery packs. Right now, they are not being compensated, and it obviously reduces the appeal of helping the grid after investing in your own home energy system.
Nonetheless, Tesla managed to convince 64 Powerwall owners in Texas to join the demo as of last month, and it has hundreds of Powerwalls that could help the Texas grid.

2022/07/11,"Tesla has been laying off thousands of employees over the last month, and a survey of where they are going has yielded interesting results. Where they are not going is just as interesting.
Last month, we reported on Elon Musk telling Tesla executives in an email that they need to cut 10% of the workforce and pause hiring due to having a “super-bad feeling” about the economy.
Later, the CEO decided to clarify the Tesla layoffs in an email to all employees. He claimed that the 10% reduction would be for “salaried headcount” due to Tesla becoming overstaffed following a long growth phase.
Tesla ramped up the layoffs at the end of June and continued over the last weeks, and we reported that – unlike what Musk previously said – hourly employees in service, sales, and delivery were affected. But, most of the layoffs were salaried employees, many with long-term experience at the automaker.
A look at the talent recently leaving Tesla has shown which companies are snapping them up (via Reddit):
The survey showed that Rivian, the electric pickup truck maker, has snapped up the most former Tesla employees. Tech companies are also interested in Tesla talent with Apple and Amazon both hiring a significant number of the 457 former Tesla employees.
Lucid Motors, a Tesla competitor, comes in fourth with 34 former Tesla employees hired. Lucid’s CEO, Peter Rawlinson, is himself a former Tesla employee. He was chief engineer of the Model S early in the vehicle program. 
In the same vein, Redwood Materials and Aurora, both cofounded by former Tesla executives, are also among the companies hiring many former Tesla employees.
On the other side, it’s interesting that no legacy automaker tops the list. Ford, GM, Audi, or BMW are nowhere in there.
One thing that I would like to note because I see a lot of Tesla fans commenting things like “good riddance” is that the employees being laid off are not necessarily the worst performers at the company.
In many cases it’s the opposite scenario.
Obviously, Tesla is not actively trying to let go of its superstars, but in those kinds of wide layoffs, senior employees with high salaries are often targeted for cost reasons. In my own search on LinkedIn, I’ve seen many employees with four, five, and six years of experience at Tesla being let go.
So, this is a real opportunity for companies to snap up some top talent. I think it could have a real impact. I wish everyone good luck.

2022/07/11,"I moved to a different state, and it took nearly three months to complete the registration of my leased Tesla Model 3. Here’s what to know.
I leased my first Tesla, a Model 3, in June 2021. In spring 2022, we moved from Florida to Vermont.
We visited the Vermont DMV office on April 13 to register our Model 3. They gave us our license plates (front and back plates are required in Vermont), and I got our car inspected within the required 15 days. But in order to complete a leased car’s registration, Tesla must hand the title over to the new state since it’s the owner of all its leased cars. 
Vermont DMV immediately sent off a letter to Tesla formally requesting that the original certificate of title be sent to its HQ in Montpelier. There’s a time limit to complete this process:
A Resident who has moved to Vermont from another jurisdiction must register their motor vehicles within 60 days of moving to Vermont. It is illegal for a person to operate a motor vehicle or draw a trailer or semi-trailer on any highway unless such vehicle is registered.
Vermont DMV does not formally make exceptions for tardiness. (More on that later.) If registration isn’t complete, your car is grounded. That prospect was worrisome, so I emailed a copy of the letter to TeslaFinance@tesla.com the same day to ensure it got there.
Tesla Finance emailed back the next day:
Thank you for reaching out to Tesla Finance and notifying us of your relocation.
We have requested the paper title from your original registration state of Florida. Once we receive the title from the state of Florida, we will mail you any supporting documents needed to self register your vehicle at your local DMV.  
Please note, taxes and fees may change as a result of changing your physical address. Let us know if you have any further questions.
All set and straightforward, right? Turns out, not so much.
At the end of April, I called Tesla Finance to see check on progress. Any Tesla owner knows that calling Tesla and getting a person on the phone is… challenging. But I managed to get a call back, and he told me that it’s not actually the state of Florida that holds my title; it’s the state of California, because it’s California-based Tesla that owns the car. He also told me that California DMV was averaging around six weeks to hand over titles to Tesla.
On May 27, I figured I’d better follow up again, as the clock was ticking. I left a voicemail asking about my title’s status. And I got a voicemail from Tesla Finance back – because AT&T’s signal in Vermont stinks, so it all goes to voicemail – stating that they now had my title and would be overnighting it to me. Phew. But nothing came, and I heard nothing more.
At the six-week point – seven days before the deadline – I emailed Tesla Finance again, asking where my promised title was. This is what she replied:
I am truly sorry to hear about your experience thus far, I have reached out to my re-registration team who confirmed this matter is being investigated. 
Please allow me to explain that unlike other dealerships Tesla does not hold titles on hand and they must be ordered for release from the state. This provides an unclear timeframe as to when we are going to receive it since the state uses standard mail with no tracking. This process is currently undergoing improvements for better experiences moving forward. In the meantime we are experiencing increased delays with several states with averaging timeframes of about 8 weeks. 
I am unsure of who provided you with the information in the voicemail you received stating we had your title as it is not notated in your case per usual. Please be advised that if this information was not directly from our re-registration team we can not ensure that it is accurate. Again, apologies for any miscommunications with in Tesla.
To ensure this is being reviewed with the highest urgency I have escalated this directly with our re-registration team who let me know that they will be reaching out directly to provide tracking for your documents as soon as it becomes available. 
We hope to resolve this for you as soon as possible as we understand the incredible inconvenience and urgency of the matter.  
What a disjoint of communication. So I stopped calling, as according to above,  and there’s no track record of phone calls.
On June 13 – Day 60 – I went back to the Vermont DMV office in person to beg for mercy. Someone there whispered to me that I should email the DMV’s commissioner to appeal. It worked: The commissioner immediately replied that someone on her team would get back to me, and two hours later I had an extended registration document in my inbox.
The process became less stressful when the Vermont DMV extended my registration, as I sent them the entire email string proving that I wasn’t just messing around. 
Also on June 13, I finally got an email from Tesla Finance:
I just wanted to touch base with you as I have reached out to our registration team again regarding this urgent matter. They have let me know that this packet is being prepared to send before the end of the week. We will be reaching out with tracking as soon as it becomes available. Apologies again for the delays! 
On June 22, Tesla Finance amusingly emailed me my tracking number. That email arrived a day after my car’s title had actually landed on my doorstep via UPS – the day before. Yeah, thanks, Tesla.
The funny-not-funny part: The title was marked “State of Florida.”
I love our Model 3 – let’s just establish that first and foremost.
Let’s also establish that Tesla has no control over the length of time that a state DMV takes to hand over a title.
But I have no idea who was responsible for this whole process taking three months, and Tesla really dropped the ball on numerous occasions.
It’s ridiculous that there are Tesla Finance employees who don’t know where Tesla’s titles are held, and are in turn misinforming customers. A number of them told me that Tesla’s lease car titles are held in the state of California, yet my title came from Florida. We should be able to trust that Tesla knows where their own cars’ titles are held. 
It was also incredibly annoying that Tesla kept saying that my case had been escalated, when that was clearly not the case. For example, my title was not sent out “before the end of the week.” It was sent out the following week. Tesla, don’t say you’re treating a case with the “highest urgency” when you clearly aren’t. They never proactively contacted me without me sending pleading emails first. That doesn’t instill confidence or establish trust.
Tesla cars are in high demand, despite their well-earned reputation for mediocre customer service. Imagine if they had outstanding customer service – they’d be untouchable.
The only reason we were able to extend our 60-day deadline and avoid our car being stuck in our garage was because we now live in a small state. I never would have been able to get a response from the DMV commissioner in a big state like Florida. Living on the edge like that was no fun. My husband needs our car to get to work.
So here’s what you need to know, those of you who drive a leased Tesla and are moving to a new state: First, Tesla allows the movement of a leased car from one state to another. 
If you’re planning a move, be proactive, and stay on top of your registration process. Assume nothing. Also have a plan for worst-case scenario, i.e., missing the new state’s deadline.
Check your destination state’s DMV website to see what it requires to register your car, as each DMV’s procedure and deadline is different. Also, call or visit your current state’s DMV, and ask them how long it will take to obtain the title. I wouldn’t trust what Tesla tells you after my experience. (And if you live in California, then it really is California.)
Tesla has a page where you can find out whether it handles titling and registration for you, or whether it processes and mail you the documents you’ll need to complete registration. (Vermont is one of 24 self-registering states.)
Since Tesla is the title holder, you and/or your new state must let them know that you’re moving and list Tesla as the legal owners. Vermont DMV let Tesla know, and I also let Tesla Finance know via email. Tesla has to send the original title to your new state to secure a new Certificate of Title.
And to reiterate: If you are moving to a different state with a leased Tesla, know that either you or your new state will be contacting your former state of residence – not California – to obtain your title. 
Note that the address my title was snail-mailed to was: Tesla Lease Trust, 12832 S. Frontrunner Blvd., Draper, UT 84020.
The registered owner is: Tesla Lease Trust, 1410 SW Morrison St., Suite 700, Portland, OR 97205-1930. (Not. California. Sigh.)
The 1st lienholder address is: TLT Leasing Corp, 12832 S. Frontrunner Blvd., Ste 100, Draper, UT 84020-5499.

2022/07/11,"After months of negotiations, Elon Musk has officially moved to terminate his takeover of Twitter, but the CEO has still sold around $8 billion worth of Tesla (TSLA) stock to make it happen. What is he going to do with that money?
After Tesla went public in 2010, Elon Musk often said that he would be the “last one to sell Tesla stocks.”
The CEO periodically had to do it to cover his taxes after receiving large stock compensations.
That started to change last year.
In late 2021, Musk said he would sell 10% of his stake in Tesla if a Twitter poll agreed, which it unsurprisingly did.
The CEO framed the idea as pressure from the media and politicians about the rich not paying taxes on unrealized gains.
However, Musk wasn’t as vocal about the fact that he was facing a giant tax bill regardless of his sale of shares, due to a large number of stock options he needs to exercise over the next year. The CEO did end up selling more Tesla shares than he needed to cover his tax burden from the stock options being exercised.
In December 2021, Musk announced that he was done selling Tesla.
A few months later, we learned that he used some of that extra money from selling those shares to invest in Twitter.
Soon after, Musk announced a deal to buy Twitter and take it private. The CEO again broke his promise to be the last one to sell Tesla shares and sold about $8 billion worth to cover some of the equity needed in the deal.
Now a few months later, Musk has officially moved forward to terminate his offer to buy Twitter after months of back and forth where the CEO claimed that Twitter wasn’t being forward about data regarding the number of “bot accounts” on its platform.
Now Musk and Twitter are expected to be embroiled in a long legal battle over who is responsible for the deal falling through and who is going to have to pay a $1 billion penalty for it.
In the meantime, Musk still has money from his Tesla share sales, and quite remarkably, he managed to sell his stocks basically at peak value not once but twice:
Amid those sales, Musk has been making comments about concerns regarding an economic downturn.
In an email to Tesla executives last month, Musk said that he has a “very bad feeling” about the economy.
Elon Musk fans with conspiracy theorist tendencies are going to have a field day with that one. 
Obviously, it would be almost impossible to prove, but the timing of those sales is incredibly convenient, and the reasons he gave for them are somewhat flimsy. 
One is vague public pressure about paying taxes, which super-rich people with money tied to stocks only do when exercising options or selling their stocks.
In his case, he absolutely needed to exercise some options, but he did indeed sell more than he needed to cover the taxes.
The second reason is to cover the purchase of a social media platform that many industry analysts suspected would be extremely difficult to pull off in the first place.
Now Musk, again who promised to be the last one to sell Tesla stocks, finds himself having sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla stocks at almost peak value right ahead of a global recession.
Now the question is: What is he going to do with that cash? Buy back Tesla shares? Start another media company? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

2022/07/08,"Tesla has been spotted gathering a massive number of Megapacks outside its Gigafactory Nevada. Is it a backlog due to supply chain issues or a new giant battery is in the work?
Drones are often flying over Tesla factories to try to document progress.
These days, they mostly fly over Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla’s latest factories, which are still growing as the automaker is starting to ramp up production.It has been a long time since we have seen a drone or a plane fly over Gigafactory Nevada near Reno and spotted something interesting, but today is the day.
A Twitter user going by OttoPilot flew over Gigafactory Nevada and spotted an impressive number of Tesla Megapacks outside the factory:
GigaNevada not only makes the M3/MY 2170 packs, but also Powerwalls and Megapacks. Lots of Megapacks revenue preparing for shipments. Today's photo.@SawyerMerritt pic.twitter.com/KpKMOA1i8u
Megapack is Tesla’s biggest stationary energy storage product, and it can hold up to 3 MWh of energy capacity in a single container-size pack.
We see more than 500 Megapacks in this picture, which would represent up to 1.5 GWh of energy capacity. That’s more than Tesla has ever delivered in an entire quarter all sitting in one place.
However, it’s not clear why all those battery packs are there. Tesla produces the Megapacks at Gigafactory Nevada, along with its new Megafactory in California, but it’s not clear why these many Megapacks are sitting there.
It could be that Tesla is preparing to ship them out for one or more energy storage projects, or they might be waiting for parts.
Tesla has had a lot of success with the Megapack lately, as it has become the option of choice for utility-scale energy storage projects. For example, Tesla recently deployed a 730 MWh project for PG&E in Northern California.
At a company-wide meeting last month, Elon Musk told Tesla employees that PG&E CEO Patricia Kessler Poppe contacted him after launching the project to tell him they were very happy with it and that they planned to deploy a lot more energy storage capacity.
For an idea of the scale here, this project at Moss Landing with PG&E is one of the largest battery systems in the world, and yet, the amount of Megapacks sitting outside GIgafactory Nevada right now is more than twice that.

2022/07/08,"Tesla appears to now expand its deployment of Starlink satellite internet systems at Supercharger stations as the satellite dish appears at a new station.
The Supercharger network currently undeniably offers the best charging experience for electric cars. Other charging networks are closing the gap, but Tesla’s early investment in offering a great complimentary charging experience has paid off.
With charging, the goal is always to make the charging sessions shorter, but it is still not unusual for Tesla owners to spend over 30 minutes at the stations.
It’s generally a good time for a snack or a bathroom break, but the automaker has also been building an experience inside the car while charging. Tesla has been building in-car apps for entertainment, such as Tesla Theater, which includes Netflix, Youtube, Twitch, and other streaming apps, and Tesla Arcade, which includes several video games.
Owners with premium connectivity, a $10 monthly subscription for data-heavy apps, can use those features through Tesla’s LTE cellular connectivity.
We reported that Tesla recently shortened the trial period for premium connectivity, forcing more owners to decide to pay up or let go of the features. Those who don’t spring for it can still use those features when their cars are connected to Wi-Fi.
In order to make the Supercharger experience better, CEO Elon Musk has been promising to deploy Wi-Fi connectivity at the stations.
Musk, who happens to also be CEO of SpaceX, has hinted at using SpaceX’s Starlink internet system to deploy internet at Supercharger stations.
Last year, the first Starlink satellite dish was spotted being deployed at a Supercharger station in Lake City, Florida.
We hadn’t seen any other examples of Tesla using SpaceX’s satellite constellation-based internet at Supercharger stations since, but Tesla now appears to finally be expanding the use of Starlink internet at its Supercharger stations.
The Tesla Owners CLub of Kentucky spotted a Starlink dish at the Lexington Supercharger:
Lexington Supercharger now has Starlink! pic.twitter.com/da1w8lJlSi
At this point, it’s not clear if Tesla is going to use the technology to offer Wi-Fi to Tesla owners stopping to charge or if it is simply going to be used to support Tesla’s own back-end connectivity to monitor and service the Supercharger station.
Starlink itself is growing fast by more than doubling its subscriber base this year to over 400,000 subscribers as of May 2022.

2022/07/07,"Elon Musk suggests that Tesla will make a “highly configurable Robovan” to transport both people and cargo. The comment comes after the CEO announced that Tesla will make a dedicated electric vehicle to work as a “robotaxi.”
Tesla hasn’t unveiled a new vehicle in a long time.
In a product roadmap update earlier this year, Musk said that Tesla’s focus in 2022 will be to ramp up production of Model Y and Model 3 at its existing factory, and the automaker doesn’t plan to unveil new vehicles or bring to production previously unveiled products that haven’t made it to market yet – like Cybertruck.
However, Musk promised “a massive wave of new Tesla products” coming in 2023. One of them is expected to be “a new futuristic-looking electric vehicle used as a ‘dedicated robotaxi.”
The CEO announced the new vehicle program at Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo event earlier this year, but not much is known about the new Tesla vehicle yet. 
Today, Musk tweeted about Tesla possibly making “a highly configurable Robovan”:
Maybe Tesla should make a highly configurable Robovan for people & cargo?
It’s not clear if this would be the robotaxi, since he referenced that it would transport both people and cargo, or a separate vehicle program. Tesla making an electric van or a vehicle to transport a higher number of people is something that has been discussed many times. It was actually mentioned in Musk’s Tesla Master Plan Part 2, and it is still the only vehicle from that plan that has yet to be unveiled by the automaker.
Such a vehicle has also been rumored to be in the works by Tesla to use in The Boring Company’s Loop system, which utilizes Tesla vehicles to move people in tunnels underneath cities with the first application currently being deployed in Las Vegas.
Last year, Musk also said that a Tesla electric van is coming as soon as there are enough batteries available to make it in volume without negatively affecting the automaker’s other vehicle programs.
The company hasn’t offered a clear timing for when that would happen, but Tesla has been betting heavily on its new 4680 battery cell format. It is currently ramping up the production of those cells in Texas, and it is preparing to build them in Berlin.
Several cell suppliers are also investing in 4680 cell production to supply them with Tesla. Higher availability is expected in 2023, but the real high volume in the hundreds of gigawatt-hours might more likely arrive in 2024.

2022/07/07,"Tesla is preparing to open up its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US later this year, according to a memo from the White House.
The company already announced plans to open its Supercharger network to all-electric vehicles globally, but the rollout of the initiative has been slow and is currently limited to Europe. The move makes sense considering Tesla has adopted the CCS standards in Europe like all other automakers and its Supercharger stations are already equipped with CCS connectors.
In North America, Tesla uses its own proprietary connector on both its vehicles and its Supercharger stations. This approach prevents non-Tesla EV owners from using the Supercharger network and limits Tesla owners to the Supercharger network for fast-charging unless they can get their hands on a CHAdeMO or CCS adapter.
It hasn’t been clear how Tesla plans to implement its plan to open the Supercharger network in the United States, but CEO Elon Musk previously talked about having an adapter at the stations for non-Tesla EV owners to use.
Earlier this year, Musk hinted that Tesla will be adding the CCS connectors directly at the stations.
Now we get an idea of the timing thanks to a new memo from the White House that gives details on different efforts from a bunch of companies in the EV sector.
In an excerpt about Tesla, the White House writes will add “equipment” to Supercharger stations, enabling non-Tesla EVs to charge on the network:
Tesla is making investments at its Gigafactory in Buffalo, New York to support the deployment of new fast charging stations to add to its fast-charging network. More than 1,600 employees work at Giga New York producing the Tesla Solar Roof and Supercharger stations, which are capable of charging vehicles up to 250 kW. Tesla is expanding production capacity of power electronics components that convert alternating current to direct current, charging cabinets, posts and cables. Later this year, Tesla will begin production of new Supercharger equipment that will enable non-Tesla EV drivers in North America to use Tesla Superchargers.
The equipment is likely the CCS connectors.
It is strange to see this news coming from the White House, but it would make sense that they would know since they met with Tesla regarding charging issues in April.
The federal government is making $7.5 billion available to accelerate electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the US, and one of the conditions to be eligible for the money is that the charging stations being deployed are available to EVs from more than one automaker.
Therefore, Tesla is expected to open up its Supercharger network if it wants access to those funds.

2022/07/07,"Tesla has achieved its best solar deployment in the US residential solar market since back in 2017 after acquiring SolarCity, but its solar roof deployment is still at a crawl.
While Tesla fans and shareholders often like to say that Tesla is not just an “automaker” but a tech company, or even an AI-company based on CEO Elon Musk’s more recent comments, based on revenue, Tesla is very much an automaker.
Its energy division, which deploys solar power systems and stationary battery packs for energy storage, represents a much smaller part of its business. The company still has the ambition to become a “global decentralized electric utility,” and Musk has said that he expects Tesla’s energy division to eventually be as big or bigger than its automotive division.
That’s still far from a reality considering Tesla Energy brought in $616 million out of the $18.7 billion in revenue the company made last quarter.
The division has had ups and downs with solar deployment being unstable and a hard time ramping up its solar roof product, which directly embeds solar cells in roof tiles instead of installing solar panels on existing roofs.
Today, Electrek learned that Tesla is making progress with its solar installation as its US residential division, which represents the vast majority of its solar deployment, had its best quarter since 2017 right after the acquisition of SolarCity.
A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Tesla deployed 71.5 MW of solar system in the US residential solar market in Q2 2022. The final number reported by Tesla at the end of the month will be higher since it will include some commercial installations and some installations outside the US.
The bad news is that Tesla’s solar roof product deployment is still disappointedly low.
Tesla has never revealed the mix of solar deployment between solar panels (solar retrofit) and solar roof. The closer it got to releasing data was its previous disclosure that it produced 4 MW of solar tiles in one week in 2020, but that is the actual production of the product and not installation.
In a quarterly report last year, Tesla also said that it doubled solar roof installations, but without revealing the actual deployment rate.
Now Electrek can confirm for the first time that Tesla has deployed 2.5 MW of solar roofs during the second quarter of 2022.
With a conservative average system output of 8 kW, it would mean that Tesla was able to deploy solar roofs on about 300 houses in Q2 or about 23 roofs per week.
It’s nice to see Tesla ramp up its overall solar deployment, but it is clear that Tesla still relies primarily on solar panels.
The solar roof deployment has been quite disappointing.
CEO Elon Musk had set the goal of Tesla deploying 1,000 solar roofs per week, but it looks like the company is roughly at 23 per week as of last quarter.
That’s despite now Tesla deploying version three of the solar roof.
It’s not clear what is the bottleneck at this point. We know that Tesla had a hard time testing the longevity of the roof, but it hasn’t talked about that challenge in years. The installations themselves can be quite hard too as roofs are often very different and therefore hard to standardize.

2022/07/06,"“Tesla is no longer the world’s largest electric car producer” is the take that the media is parroting this week, but it stems from adding plug-in hybrids into the mix, while everyone agrees that all-electric vehicles are the future of the industry.
For years, Tesla has been investing heavily in large-scale production of electric vehicles while most legacy automakers were still focusing on compliance vehicles and building just enough of them to comply with government regulations.
Only in the last years have those automakers admitted that all-electric vehicles are the future of the industry and started to heavily invest in producing them in large volumes.
It resulted in Tesla building a massive lead in EV volume production that it still maintains today.
That’s why it was surprising that many media yesterday were propagating some variation of the headline that “Tesla is no longer the world’s largest electric car producer”:
The news comes after both Tesla and Chinese automaker BYD reported their production results for Q2 2022. 
Tesla reported having delivered just over 250,000 vehicles in Q2 – its first down quarter in two years due to a factory shutdown in Shanghai. It adds up to Tesla having delivered 564,743 electric vehicles in the first half of 2022.
As for BYD, it reported having delivered 638,157 “electric vehicles” during the first half of the year.
That’s what is prompting all those headlines, but what most of the media is failing to highlight is that almost half of BYD’s EV sales are vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines burning gasoline.
314,638 vehicles out of BYD’s reported 638,157 “EV sales” in 2022 are plug-in hybrids.
When comparing all-electric vehicles for all-electric vehicles, Tesla still outsold BYD by a significant percentage in 2022 despite its bad quarter.
I have no problem with BYD. I think it’s a great company helping accelerate EV adoption, but I think it’s important to make a distinction with plug-in hybrids, which is mostly a transitional technology. Everything points to the technology dying as all-electric vehicles are taking over.
The goal of the game in the auto industry is still ramping up all-electric vehicle production. The internal combustion engine is basically dead. 
When it comes to producing all-electric vehicles with large battery packs enabling long-distance travel without burning any fossil fuel (at the tailpipe), Tesla is still king.
I think it’s possible for some companies to eventually catch up to them, but no, it has not happened yet.

2022/07/05,"Tesla (TSLA) achieved record production in June – exiting the year’s first half – setting the automaker up for an impressive second half of the 2022.
This weekend, Tesla released its Q2 2022 production and delivery results. It confirmed its first quarterly setback in deliveries in more than two years due to its factory shutdown in Shanghai.
However, there was a silver lining in Tesla’s results:
June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in Tesla’s history.
The automaker didn’t confirm how many vehicles it produced during the month of June, but we estimate it to be around 120,000 electric vehicles.
If Tesla manages to maintain, and most likely increase this production rate with massive investment into production ramps in Gigafactory Berlin, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Shanghai, it will set the automaker up for an impressive second half of 2022.
Goldman Sachs wrote about the results in a note to clients this weekend:
However, we believe that the record production in June is a sign that Shanghai is ramping back up well and that the company made progress recently at its Berlin and Austin factories.
Electrek recently reported that production significantly ramped up at Gigafactory Texas at the end of June.
Goldman Sachs has lowered its Tesla delivery estimate for the full year of 2022 to 1.401 million units, which is still very close to Tesla’s rough guideline of roughly 50% increase year-over-year.
Unless there’s another unforeseen event like the Shanghai lockdowns, I think Tesla is going to have a truly impressive second half of 2022.
If it was to only maintain the rate it had in June, it would likely produce just over 700,000 units for a total of over 1.2 million units for the year. However, I think we are going to see them achieve a significant ramp-up at most factories, – especially Berlin and Texas – for closer to 900,000 to 1 million vehicles during the second half.
It’s not going to be easy, but Tesla has been preparing its supply chain for this kind of volume for years and now it has the installations to do it. The automaker needs to work through its bottlenecks at its facilities to support that capacity.
The difficult part appears to still be 4680 battery cell production as Tesla won’t benefit from supply from partnering manufacturers, like Panasonic, for around another year. Once that supply starts, we are likely to see another important growth phase for Tesla’s production.

2022/07/04,"Tesla has unveiled a new solar range extender trailer with a SpaceX Starlink internet satellite system at an exposition in Germany, but don’t expect to be able to buy it any time soon.
As electric vehicles become more efficient, many are starting to think about the potential of adding solar panels to EVs to extend the range. Companies like Aptera, Sono and Lightyear have had some success with projects involving super-efficient vehicles using embedded solar cells.
But when it comes to full-size electric vehicles, it hasn’t been as popular since solar power doesn’t add much range due to the lower efficiency.
However, many EV owners have been thinking about adding deployable solar panels as portable independent charging solutions that could extend the range of their electric vehicles – sometimes in the form of a trailer. At the IdeenExpo in Hannover, Germany, this week, Tesla surprised attendees by unveiling a system that equips a trailer with deployable solar panels:
Tesla is at the ""IdeenExpo"" in Hannover.They brought a solar range extender trailer with Starlink.And a Model Y with the 4680 structural battery pack.Next to the Tesla stand is the VW stand. There are apparently more VW employees at the Tesla stand than Tesla employees. pic.twitter.com/8IHxLI5ukW
Tesla also brought a Model Y cutout, showing off its new structural battery pack with 4680 battery cells, for its booth at the exposition, but the new solar range extender is the more novel product.
The solar range extender trailer is also equipped with a Starlink satellite internet receiver from SpaceX. Starlink recently updated its system to enable using its terminal to get internet in moving vehicles.
It’s not clear why Tesla built the trailer and unveiled it at the show, but the automaker is not expected to sell it to the public any time soon. If those are all 300W panels (and they look a little small for that), then the optimum output would be 2.7kW. That means it would generate less than 50 miles of range a day extended or a third of that folded up. 
It appears to be more of an attraction for the exposition – something that Tesla rarely participates in other than as a recruiting effort.
Would you be interested in Tesla selling this solar range extender trailer to consumers? If so, let us know what kind of application you think it would be useful for. Let us know in the comment section.

2022/07/04,"Tesla is reportedly going to shut down production at Gigafactory Berlin in order to upgrade the factory and add a shift to achieve higher production capacity.
The top priority at Tesla is to ramp up production to catch up with customer demand.
The automaker is doing that at all its factories, but the ramps are more significant at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, which only recently started production.
Giga Berlin appeared to be doing relatively well thanks to utilizing the 2170 cells, which enables a battery infrastructure that Tesla is used to, and it achieved a production rate of 1,000 Model vehicles per week in June.
Giga Texas appeared to be falling behind since it had difficulties ramping up production of the 4680 battery cell and structural battery pack, but we reported that last week that the factory ramped up production significantly with Tesla starting to build Model Y Long Range with 2170 cells at the plant.
Now Tesla is looking for Gigafactory Berlin to catch up, and it will reportedly shut down the factory for about two weeks in order to upgrade it.
Germany’s Bild reported the news today:
According to BILD information, Tesla therefore wants to interrupt operations for two weeks starting next Monday. It is unclear how many of the 4,500 employees will be sent on vacation and how many technicians will remain to convert production.
The publication also says that the automaker will add a third shift and start producing electric motors at the factory instead of importing them from Gigafactory Shanghai:
According to employees, after the break in production, work should be carried out in three instead of two shifts. In addition, Tesla could then start manufacturing the drive in a neighboring hall.
While the upgrade could help, Gigafactory Berlin’s biggest bottleneck is reportedly its workforce. 
Over the last few months, there have been many reports of Tesla having issues hiring and retaining employees. Some of them suggested that salaries have been a particular issue and the local union, IG Metall, was starting to get involved. But Tesla did increase salaries by 6% for many employees in order to address the concern.
It will require a significant hiring effort for Tesla to add a third shift at the plant after the factory restart later this month.

2022/07/04,"Tesla is bringing its Green Light Chime feature, which previously was only for people with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta to most of its cars, helping cut down on road rage at traffic lights.
When Tesla started to bring traffic light controls to its vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Capability package, the automaker introduced a feature that would recognize when a traffic light turns green and emit a chime to let the driver know.
With the new software update 2022.20, Tesla has expanded the feature to all cars with Autopilot when “Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control” is activated:
A chime will play when the traffic light you are waiting for turns green. If you are waiting behind another car, the chime will play once the car advances unless Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer is active. When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is activated, a chime will play when you can confirm to proceed through a green traffic light.
While the feature was expanded, it sounds like it would only work with vehicles with the hardware 3.0 computer – also known as the self-driving computer – but it doesn’t sound like drivers need to purchase the expensive self-driving package to activate the feature.
Tesla writes about how to activate the feature:
To enable, tap Controls > Autopilot > Green Traffic Light Chime.
In the release notes, the automaker notes that the chime is “only designed as a notification,” and it is still “the driver’s responsibility to observe their environment and make decisions accordingly.”
I had this feature for a while now, and I find it useful. When I’m arguing with my girlfriend at a red light, sometimes I don’t see when it turn green, and the chime proves useful.
Hopefully, it can help reduce some road raging because some people are quick to get upset when people don’t accelerate right away when it turns green.
The next step would be to have a green light count down – something Audi has it in some of its newest vehicles. I experienced it in the e-tron in Sacramento, and it is pretty cool. It only works in cities where their traffic light system supports the integration, but there is a growing number of those cities. When stopping at a red light, a countdown appears on the instrument cluster telling you when the light is going to turn green.
Maybe Tesla could add that in a future software update. 
",tesla
2022/07/04,"Tesla confirmed in a new software update that its vehicles are now scanning for rough roads, like potholes, to help avoid them damaging the vehicles by adjusting the suspension.
In order to achieve full self-driving, a system would have to be able to handle a wide range of different scenarios, including different weather and road conditions.
These conditions, like potholes, can sometimes be difficult for human drivers to handle, and some people find it improbable that self-driving systems will be able to appropriately navigate them. Tesla is leveraging its large customer fleet equipped with Autopilot hardware to capture data on those corner cases and teach its neural network to handle them.
Back in 2020, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla Autopilot is eventually going to detect potholes and make mini-maps to remember them and avoid them.
Two years later, Tesla Autopilot is not quite there yet, but we are now seeing the first confirmation that Tesla’s fleet of vehicles is looking for them or more “rough road sections” in general.
In a new 2022.20 software update, the automaker writes in the release notes about a new feature of the “Tesla Adaptive Suspension” system:
Tesla Adaptive Suspension will now adjust ride height for an upcoming rough road section. This adjustment may occur at various locations, subject to availability, as the vehicle downloads rough road map data generated by Tesla vehicles.
This is the first confirmation of the Tesla vehicle fleet scanning the roads to evaluate its conditions.
For now, it’s not about Autopilot, or Full Self-Driving Beta, navigating around those “rough road sections,” but Tesla adapting the suspension for those conditions.
Tesla explains how to activate the feature:
The instrument cluster will continue to indicate when the suspension is raised for comfort. To enable this feature, tap Controls > Suspension > Adaptive Suspension Damping, and select the Comfort or Auto setting.
Obviously, this feature is only going to be available in Tesla vehicles with adaptive suspension, like the new Model S and Model X.
This is a nice step toward the direction of Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving, being able to avoid potholes.
Personally, when I drive on Autopilot, the two top reasons I have to take over controls are phantom braking events – which Tesla has yet to completely fix and to avoid potholes – or bad road conditions that Autopilot is about to drive right through.
While as mentioned above, this is just to adapt suspension for now, Tesla at least confirms that it is scanning the road to determine its conditions and I would assume that the next step is to make Autopilot/FSD avoid those issues.

2022/07/02,"Tesla announces its second quarter (Q2) 2022 production and delivery results today and confirmed just over 250,000 deliveries – its first down quarter in a long time.
While most of the auto industry saw a significant decline in deliveries in 2020 due to the pandemic and subsequent chip shortage, Tesla managed to grow at an impressive rate. In fact, Tesla had nine quarters of delivery growth in a row since 2020, making the company completely unique in the auto industry for volume producers.
The automaker managed to navigate both restrictions and limitations due to the pandemic and pivot to alternatives to avoid the bulk of the chip shortage. It’s not like Tesla was completely unaffected; it was a difficult time, but its quarterly didn’t show it.
In Q2 2022, it finally caught up to the automaker as COVID-19 restrictions in Shanghai forced the automaker to shut down its factory for a significant part of the quarter.
Most industry analysts put Tesla’s Q2 delivery estimates between 250,000 and 270,000 units – or about 50,000 units down from the previous quarter, which was an all-time high.
Today, Tesla released its production and delivery results for the second quarter of 2022 and confirmed that the estimates were mostly right.
The automaker confirmed 254,695 deliveries during the quarter and production of 258,580 vehicles:
In a brief press release for the results, Tesla confirmed the “supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns” resulted in its first down quarter in two years.
Interestingly, Tesla also mentioned that June 2022 was the company’s best month ever for vehicle production:
In the second quarter, we produced over 258,000 vehicles and delivered over 254,000 vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns beyond our control. June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in Tesla’s history.
We reported that Tesla recently managed to impressively ramp up production at Gigafactory Texas. The automaker is also increasing production capacity at every single one of its production facilities.
Tesla is aiming to have four factories, each with a production capacity of over half a million vehicles per year within the next 12 months. That’s more all-electric vehicles than any other automaker can produce.

2022/07/01,"Tesla is offering free Supercharging during off-peak hours at select locations during the 4th of July weekend to help with traffic during busy travel days.
As we previously reported, Tesla has been having a hard time keeping up its charging infrastructure growth with its fleet growth over the last few years.
Its deliveries are growing at a roughly 50% annual rate while its Supercharger is closer to a 30% annual growth rate.
It is causing some stress on Tesla owners who are experiencing wait times to access a Sueprchager stall at some busy stations, especially during popular travel times like holidays.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been implementing a solution to try to help by offering free or discounted charging during off-peak hours during high travel times.
The automaker is bringing back the strategy for the fourth of July weekend this year.
Tesla wrote on its website:
Avoid the rush this Fourth of July holiday and charge for free during off-peak hours at Superchargers along select travel routes in the United States.
It is valid from today until Monday, but interestingly, Tesla decided to only apply it to only a few stations in five states in the US:
Times
Before 9 AM and after 6 PM
Locations
Times
Before 11 AM and after 8 PM
Locations
Presumably, Tesla expects those stations to be the busiest this weekend ,and the incentives should help lower traffic during the day.
Supercharger costs at those locations can go up to $0.58 per kWh; therefore, free Supercharging can easily save between $20 and $100 depending on the length of a road trip.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/07/01,"Tesla has filed with the city of Austin to expand Gigafactory Texas with a giant new 500,000-square-foot building at the site.
Now Gigafactory Texas is already giant. It’s already one of the biggest buildings on Earth.
The current building is equivalent to about 15 city blocks or three Pentagons as CEO Elon Musk said earlier this year.
It offers just over 4 million square feet of space and fits about 338 million cubic feet of volume.
But regardless of how big it is, Tesla still has plenty of room to expand at the location since the project currently sits on a 3.3-square-mile piece of land.
This week, Tesla has filed a building permit to expand on that land with another extremely big building:
In the description for the permit application, Tesla writes:
“All above ground piping and underground plumbing, GA 2 and 3 expansion, 500,000 square foot.”
A 500,000-square-foot new expansion would be a significant new building at the factory.
“GA” normally refers to general assembly – meaning that Tesla plans to build two new assembly lines in that new building.
It’s not clear if it would be to increase production of the Model Ys currently being built at the factory or if Tesla plans to use the space to build new models that are supposed to come to Gigafactory Texas next year, like Cybertruck and Tesla Semi.
Tesla is not revealing much about the production ramp-up of Model Y at Gigafactory Texas, but Electrek recently reported that insider information puts production at a few thousand units in a week for the first time.
However, it is unclear if this is sustainable as Tesla has complained about its new 4680 battery cells and its structural battery pack being a bottleneck. We also have indications that Tesla is now building Model Y Long Range vehicles with 2170 cells in order to get around that bottleneck.
Gigafactory Texas is one of the world’s biggest factories not only because Tesla wants high volume production at the plant but also because the automaker wants to be vertically integrated down to battery cell production on site.
Tesla has been ramping up production of 4680 cells at the factory, and it is even adding a cathode processing plant on the same piece of land.

2022/06/30,"A Tesla Model S Plaid that has been hacked to remove software limitations has reached a top speed of over 200 mph (and then some) for the very first time, delivering on Tesla’s promise.
When Tesla first announced the Model S Plaid, its new top-performance flagship electric vehicle, the automaker promised a top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h). However, when it was first delivered last year, the vehicle “only” featured a top speed of 163 mph (262 km/h).
Earlier this year, Tesla released a new ‘Track Mode’ for the Model S Plaid that pushed the top speed to 175 mph (282 km/h).
As far as we know, this has been the fastest top speed a Tesla Model S Plaid or any Tesla vehicle has achieved to date. It’s not clear what is really preventing Tesla from enabling the promised 200 mph top speed. It could be the brakes, which Tesla is now offering to upgrade with a carbon ceramic kit for $20,000, or it could also be worries about the three motors or battery pack.
What is now clear is that Tesla wasn’t lying about the vehicle being capable of reaching 200 mph because I witnessed a Model S Plaid achieving just that this morning, but it wasn’t thanks to the automaker.
Ingenext, a Quebec-based company better known for selling modules that help unlock software-locked features in Tesla vehicles, has managed to get around the software limitations in the Model S Plaid to completely unlock the top speed.
This morning, Guillaume André, CEO of Ingenext, got behind the wheel of his hacked Model S Plaid and tried to break the top speed record at the Trois-Rivières airport in Québec, Canada.
The Ingenext team has tried to reach 200 mph with the vehicle before at other locations, but they literally ran out of space to safely reach that speed; the Trois-Rivières airport has a ~3 km (1.8-mile) long runway that was perfect for the test. They briefly shut down the runway for André to make attempt.
Ingenext’s Model S Plaid is basically a stock production vehicle except for bigger brakes from Mountainpass Performance and higher performance tires (Michelin Pilot Super Sport) – mainly for safety reasons. 
The only other modification is the Ingenext module, which allows them to bypass Tesla’s software restrictions.
André had about 1.2 miles (2 km) in his Tesla Model S Plaid to reach the top speed for starting to decelerate over about 6,000 feet, and it turned out that he needed almost that entire distance even with the higher performance brakes, but the attempt was successful.
Not only did they manage to achieve a top speed of 200 mph, delivering on Tesla’s promise for the Model S Plaid, but the electric vehicle achieved a top speed of 216 mph (348 km/h).
Here’s a quick video I put together of the new Tesla Model S Plaid top speed record:
The sound was the craziest thing. It sounded like a jet was taking off right in front of us, but no, it was just a family sedan going 216 mph. That’s also the loudest I’ve ever heard Tesla’s cooling system trying to cool down the three motors and battery pack.
It is the first time a Tesla vehicle has achieved a top speed of 216 mph and likely a first time that a production electric vehicle has achieved that speed. Also, I think it’s important to note that while the Model S Plaid has hypercar-like performance, it is still a 4-door family sedan, which also makes it quite impressive.
For now, that’s the only Model S Plaid with the capacity unlocked, but Ingenext plans to soon offer its module to the public with the capacity unlocked and other features.

2022/06/30,"One of the rare Tesla Semi electric trucks came out of hiding this week to deliver pre-assembled Superchargers to the Laguna Seca racetrack in California.
With the Tesla Semi program being delayed by three years at this point, the automaker rarely publicly uses the electric semi-truck.
The company only produced a handful of them at a facility in Nevada, and it has yet to bring it to volume production as it waits on higher volume availability of its 4680 battery cells.
However, Tesla has always said that it would be its own best customer when it comes to the Tesla Semi, and it is already putting the few electric trucks it has to good use.
We have seen the automaker use its Tesla Semi electric truck to deliver Model 3 vehicles to customers in the past.
Now Tesla shared footage of using the electric truck to deliver pre-assembled Superchargers at the Laguna Seca racetrack in California:

Earlier this year, we reported on Tesla using pre-fabricated Supercharger stations to accelerate the deployment of the fast-charging stations.
In one case, Tesla managed to deploy a new Supercharger in just eight days thanks to delivering the chargers in a pre-fabricated system with both the charging stalls and cabinets on concrete footings. 
Also, it’s interesting that the automaker is building a station at the Laguna Seca racetrack. 
The track is popular with EV owners and especially owners of performance Tesla vehicles in California who can’t push their vehicles to their limits on public streets.
Tesla owners have often used the racetrack as a benchmark for the top performance versions of the electric vehicles, like breaking the EV record with the Model S Plaid last year.
It will be super useful to have a fast-charging station at the track since electric vehicles perform best when they have a high state of charge.
And now for what might have been the first time, the charging station to charge electric vehicles was delivered by an electric vehicle: the Tesla Semi electric truck.

2022/06/29,"In 2022, electric vehicle sales continue to boom. Nearly all legacy automakers have set end dates for manufacturing new combustion vehicles and have begun introducing all-electric options into their fleets more and more. This year alone, the world will see over twenty new electric vehicle models ranging from most expensive, to rather affordable.  Below is a list of which EVs are or will soon be available, and how expensive they are.
There are many factors at play in the pricing of electric vehicles these days. Supply chains, assembly lines, and R&D can all play some part in the MSRP of an electric vehicle before its first sale. 
Probably the most notable factor today is the cost of batteries. Battery packs are vital to the longevity and performance of any electric vehicle, but they are expensive. Developments in battery technology as well as swapping practices have significantly helped lower the cost of EVs in recent years. 
However, current battery components are gathered and produced by a select group of manufacturers, like in China for instance. The price of importing multiple resources and parts from overseas can add to the overall price an automaker must charge consumers to make a profit.
In the US in particular, automakers are breaking away from this battery reliance, and have begun erecting their own manufacturing facilities stateside, to shorten supply chains and overall costs.
The vehicles mentioned below come with plenty of pricey features, even in their most standard trims. 
To begin, we want to point out that this list caters to some of the most expensive consumer EVs today. There are plenty of electric supercars out there that cost much more, but they’re not exactly prevalent on roads and highways. 
Keep in mind that the prices provided are the MSRPs and do not include any state or federal incentives, or any additional fees for destination and documentation unless specifically noted. 
All prices are accurate at the time of posting, and we will update them as they change.
Even before a single pickup was delivered, Ford’s F-150 Lightning had the makings of greatness. With well over 200,000 reservations in place, the early demand for the all-electric pickup was there. As a result, Ford has increased the Lightning’s production capacity twice already. 
While the Standard Pro trim F-150 Lightning starts just under $40,000, its price goes through several other options topped by Platinum. The Platinum F-150 Lightning has finally arrived and already sits as one of the most expensive electric pickups on the market this year. This trim comes with 22″ aluminum wheels with black painted pockets, heated and ventilated Nirvana leather seats, and the extended battery pack standard. 
That delivers an EPA estimated range of 280 miles, all for only $90,874. All 2022 trims of the Ford F-150 Lightning have begun deliveries, but if you haven’t reserved one yet, you’ll waiting until the 2023 models come out… possibly 2024.
Rivian is one of the EV manufacturers that should find continued success in 2022. Last September, Rivian officially began rolling customer versions of its R1T pickup off its assembly lines, becoming the first company to deliver a fully-electric truck.
Considering all the Launch Editions are spoken for, the seven-seat R1S SUV is arriving to customers next. Its Adventure Edition trim starts at a purchase price of $75,500 for the Large Pack battery which promises 316 miles of EPA estimated range. 
The R1S trims will be assembled at Rivian’s current facility in Normal, Illinois and eventually at the automaker’s second planned facility in Georgia. The Adventure and Explore trims of R1S are expected to follow sometime this year.
We wanted to point out Fisker’s flagship SUV, the Ocean, because it sits as both one of the pricer EVs as well as one of the most affordable depending on what trim you get. When the Ocean was unveiled at the LA Auto Show last fall, it made a splash based off its overall look, features, and most importantly, price. 
Founder and CEO Henrik Fisker revealed at the time that the Sport trim of the upcoming Ocean will start at an MSRP of $37,999 – meaning that if someone were to qualify for the entire $7,500 EV tax credit in the US, they could purchase an Ocean for just over $30k. 
That’s a huge selling point for consumers looking to go electric, but the Ocean Sport may not be for everyone. On the other side of the pricing spectrum is the Ocean One. 
This launch edition trim of the Ocean comes with all top tier features including 22″ F3 SlipStream Wheels, a SolarSky roof which can supposedly add an additional 29 miles of range per week, and a special “Ocean One” designation including an optional Big Sur Blue w/ Metallic Matte Finish. 
Only the first 5,000 Oceans will debut in the One trim, but you can get all of the same features aside from the paint and Ocean One monicker in the Extreme trim – both have an MSRP of $68,990 and should arrive in November.
For the sake of keeping a tidier list, we have only added 2022/2023 model year EVs that have MSRPs of $45,000 or more.
Note – All prices listed below do not include taxes, destination fees, or federal tax credits unless specifically noted.
As you may have noticed looking at the table above, some anticipated electric vehicles scheduled for 2022 are not present. That’s because several upcoming models have been confirmed for arrival this year, but pricing has not yet been shared.
Here’s several of them to start. As prices arrive, these EVs will make their move up above so you can see where they land in comparison.
Are there any ridiculously expensive electric vehicles we are forgetting? Is there anything you’d like to see added to the list? Let us know!

2022/06/29,"Tesla has managed to ramp up production at Gigafactory Texas to thousands of units per week, adding production of the Model Y Long Range on top of the Standard Range version.
The automaker is being secretive about data on its production ramp at Gigafactory Texas.
It is one of Tesla’s most important projects, as it invested billions of dollars in the giant factory, and it will not recoup that money until the plant reaches volume production.
After slowly starting production of the Model Y late in 2021, Tesla has been gradually ramping up and started deliveries of Texas-built Model Y vehicles in April.
The ramp up has been difficult as Tesla has been building the Model Ys at Gigafactory Texas with its new 4680 battery cell and structural battery pack, which have been the bottleneck.
Tesla has been aiming to produce 10,000 vehicles per week at the factory by the end of the year.
The current production rate of Gigafactory Texas has been unknown, but it was believed to be less than a thousand Model Y vehicles per week.
Now Electrek has obtained inside information for the first time that gives us a better idea of Tesla’s production rate at the new factory.
Sources familiar with the matter say that Tesla has managed to ramp up production since adding a new version of the Model Y, Model Y Long Range, and it now produces several thousand vehicles per week.
One source said that Tesla is making as many as 5,000 vehicles available to deliver per week from Gigafactory Texas, but it’s not clear if that’s a sustainable rate. Another source said that Tesla is capable of producing at least 2,000 Model Ys per week at the plant since adding the Model Y Long Range to the mix.
However, some buyers taking delivery of the Model Y Long Range from Gigafactory Texas are being told by their Tesla advisors that the vehicle is equipped with the 2170 cells and not the new cell format.
Recent drone flyovers of the factory show that Tesla is getting hundreds of cars out every day. In this flyover by Joe Tegtmeyer from Monday June 27, we can see Tesla prepping more than 300 Model Ys for delivery in the parking lot:
Anywhere between 2,000 and 5,000 units of production capacity in a week would be incredible for Gigafactory Texas for just a few months after starting production.
However, it depends on how sustainable that production capacity is going to be over the coming weeks and months.
Also, it is a little disappointing if Tesla is only achieving those levels by making the Model Y Long Range with 2170 cells instead of the new 4680 cell, which is clearly going to be the new standard going forward; Tesla needs to figure out how to ramp up production of the new cell modules.
",tesla
2022/06/29,"Samsung SDI is reportedly setting up a new pilot production line to build 4680 battery cells for Tesla. It will be the third manufacturer to try to secure a volume contract to supply Tesla with the new battery cell format.
Korea’s TheElec reports that the Korean manufacturing giant is preparing the new battery cell production line at its  Cheonan plant in South Korea:
Samsung SDI was preparing a pilot line at its Cheonan plant in South Korea to test batteries it will be supplying to Tesla, TheElec has learned.
The batteries are 4680 cylinder batteries (46mm diameter, 80mm length) and the South Korean battery firm will verify the technology within the year, sources said.
Interestingly, the publication also reports that Samsung SDI is also planning to test the production of a similar but slightly shorter battery cell for BMW.
Samsung is aiming for the new production line to have a capacity just under 1 GWh, but it will significantly ramp up production if successful as Tesla made it clear it would buy all viable battery cells available.
Tesla is making its own 4680 battery cells, but the automaker has little experience in producing cells, and it has had issues ramping up production. 
The company plans to rely on both its own production and supply from established manufacturers to produce the new 4680 format in order to support its production ramp-up and new upcoming vehicle programs like the Cybertruck.
Panasonic is believed to be the most advanced in supplying the battery to Tesla with volume production expected next year.
LG Energy Solutions also recently invested $450 million in producing Tesla’s 4680 battery cell.
Samsung’s timeline is not clear, but TheElec reports that once pilot production is established in Korea, the company is likely to start producing the new cell in a factory with a capacity between 8 and 12 GWh of annual production capacity in Seremban, Malaysia.
The company is reportedly ordering similar manufacturing equipment as Tesla from Hanwha and Koem for the production of the battery cells.

2022/06/29,"Tesla has laid off about 200 people working at its San Mateo offices as it closes the location. Most of the employees were working as Autopilot data labelers – a critical project for Tesla to achieve self-driving capability.
LinkedIn is flooding with posts from now former Tesla employees working at its San Mateo office after the automaker let them know yesterday that it would be shutting down the office and letting go of the employees there.
For example, Marilyn Alvarez, a data annotation specialist at Tesla, posted:
To all my fellow Tesla San Mateo folk, I just want to say I’m sorry for what has happened today. No one deserved this and it breaks my heart how many good people have lost their job today. I am so thankful for meeting you all, problem-solving, innovating, and adapting through this experience together. There is so much to be proud of that was done because of your hard work. You are all worthy, kind, and brilliant people who deserve the best. May better bigger opportunities that your values align with come to reality.
Most of the people working at the office were data labelers working on Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving programs. They label data coming from Tesla’s customer fleet in order to feed it to machine learning neural nets.
Tesla employs thousands of data labelers across the country.
The layoffs are part of larger mass layoffs that Tesla initiated earlier this month. CEO Elon Musk claimed that it would only be for salaried employees, but Electrek confirmed that many hourly workers were also affected.
It is surprising that people in the Autopilot and self-driving programs are also being affected considering how important those programs are to the company according to the CEO.
However, Tesla has also been working on auto-labeling technology that could reduce the need for manual labeling from workers.

2022/06/28,"Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said he believes that Tesla’s decision to ramp up 3 Gigafactories simultaneously will weaken the automaker and help VW catch up in the race to dominate the EV space.
Tesla and the Volkswagen Group are widely recognized as the leaders in electrification, especially in their respective home markets of the United States and Europe. But, Tesla is still the clear leader with about twice the all-electric sales volume of Volkswagen last year.
Some believe that is going to change and fast.
Earlier this year, Diess said that VW can sell more electric cars than Tesla by 2025. And, Bloomberg recently came up with a report that claimed that the German automaker can actually take the lead by 2024.
Diess commented on the situation during a new works meeting this week and said that he believes VW’s profits and subsiding chip shortage is going to allow the automaker to catch up to Tesla (via Reuters):
This should allow the carmaker to narrow the Volkswagen-Tesla gap this year and meet its goal of becoming market leader by 2025 if it seizes the moment while the U.S. electric car maker burns cash on large investments, the CEO said.
Interestingly, the CEO commented on Tesla’s effort to ramp up production at the new Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin as well as the expansion at Gigafactory Shanghai. He said that this is going to “take strength out” of Tesla or even Musk specifically:
Elon (Musk) has to ramp up two highly complex factories in Austin and Gruenheide at the same time – as well as expand production in Shanghai. That’s going to take strength out of him.
As for VW, it is itself ramping up production EV production at factories in Germany and China, and it is about to start VW ID.4 production in the United States at its Chattanooga factory. 
I’m not sure I get his point. Yes, it’s hard to ramp up production at two factories simultaneously, but Tesla has quite a lot of experience with that at this point. Gigafactory Berlin and Texas are actually the reasons why I doubt that VW is going to catch up to Tesla any time soon and certainly not in 2024 or 2025.
I think Tesla is likely to exit 2023 with a production rate of about 500,000 cars per year at those two factories.
With Fremont and Shanghai still growing, I think it will likely put Tesla’s annual production capacity at around 2.5 million vehicles. VW’s EV production capacity is expected to be at around 1.5 million in 2023.
Tesla is also looking for locations for new factories. I doubt that those will be producing any cars until 2024 and more realistically 2025, but I still think that Tesla’s lead in EV volume appears to be growing, not going down.
That said, I love this competitive spirit between Tesla and VW when it comes to electrification. Competition is good.

2022/06/28,"Uber announced that 15,000 Tesla vehicles are already in the hands of its drivers in more than 30 US cities through its deal with Hertz to expand access to electric vehicles.
Last year, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles to be delivered over the next year.
Shortly after, Hertz announced that on top of adding Tesla vehicles to its rental fleet, the company also made a deal with Uber to offer its drivers access to the Tesla vehicles. 50,000 Tesla vehicles will be offered for rent to Uber drivers, and the company has an option for more if the program is successful.
Today, Andrew Macdonald, Uber’s senior vice president of mobility and business operations, announced that already 15,000 Uber drivers have rented Tesla vehicles through the program:
To date, more than 15,000 drivers have rented a Tesla through this program – and they’re making a real impact. Together they’ve completed more than five million fully-electric trips and driven over 40 million electric miles.
The program appears to be a success with driver satisfaction being high.
Uber drivers pay only $334 a week to rent a Tesla Model 3, insurance and maintenance included, and some drivers are reporting over $160 a week in gas savings alone.
Manuel Barros, an Uber driver in Boston and one of the first to take advantage of the Tesla rental program, said:
When I had a gas car, I would spend $25-30 dollars a day [on gasoline]. I’m saving almost $160 a week, if not more, driving an electric vehicle.
On top of the gas savings compensating for the renting cost, Uber gives an extra $1 per trip to drivers of battery-electric vehicles for up to $4,000 per year, and it recently launched the “Comfort Electric” option that pays drivers more when Uber users choose an electric ride.
Uber also reports some interesting statistics, like the fact that 95% of drivers renting a Tesla through Hertz are driving electric on the Uber platform for the first time, and 92% of them say they are considering purchasing an electric vehicle since participating in the program.
Raphael Veira, who drives for Uber in Los Angeles, commented:
I was always curious as to how an electric vehicle could handle the mileage you put on your car when doing Uber. It handles the mileage really well. I want to buy a [Tesla] Model S eventually. And this was a perfect opportunity to see how they drive.
The program for Uber drivers to rent Tesla vehicles through Hertz is now available in the following cities:

2022/06/27,"Tesla had to pause deliveries of some Model Y vehicles built at Gigafactory Berlin, and the buyers are being told that there’s a problem with the electric motor.
The production ramps at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas are undoubtedly Tesla’s most important projects at the moment. Until the automaker can ramp up to volume production at those facilities, it is going to lose billions of dollars operating those large plants.
Tesla is believed to have a tough time at Gigafactory Texas where the bottleneck is the production of 4680 cells and structural battery packs. The automaker is doing better at Gigafactory Berlin where Model Y vehicles are still being built with 2170 battery cells.
Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it produced 1,000 Model Y vehicles in a week at Gigafactory Berlin for the first time. It was an important milestone for the company.  However, the automaker is now experiencing a setback as many Model Y buyers are reporting that Tesla delayed their deliveries. 
Based on buyer reports to Electrek and European Tesla message boards, the problem appears to only affect the Performance version of the Model Y, and several buyers are reporting being told by Tesla that the problem is with the drive units (electric motors).
Tesla is believed to be getting its drive units from Gigafactory Shanghai for Model Y production at Gigafactory Berlin. The goal is to eventually move production to Germany, but the company relies on supply from China for the meantime.
Based on Tesla’s communications to buyers, the automaker has paused deliveries due to an unspecified defect with the motors. Buyers who had upcoming delivery dates are reporting being pushed, and those with delivery windows are seeing them also extended to later this year.
It’s unclear at this point how this issue will affect Tesla’s overall production capacity at the factory.

2022/06/27,"Tesla Megapacks are on their way to Hawaii in order to create a giant new energy storage system that is about to replace the state’s last remaining coal power plant.
Hawaii aims to reach 100% green energy by 2045 and already has the highest amount of solar capacity deployed per capita. However, in order to handle all that renewable energy, the state needs to balance it with energy storage capacity since the sun doesn’t always shine.
Tesla has been deploying batteries in Hawaii for years in order to help toward that goal. The company works with Hawaiian Electric on giant new battery systems and on a virtual power plant using Powerwalls.
Now the Tesla Megapacks are coming to Hawaii, and they will be used to retire the state’s last coal power plant.
Once completed, the Kapolei Energy Storage facility (KES) will become one of the largest battery systems in the world with a capacity of 185 megawatts/​565 megawatt-hours. It is a project in partnership with Plus Power and Hawaiian Electric – the former decided to use Tesla Megapacks to power the system.
Megapack is Tesla’s largest energy storage solution – a container-size battery system with a capacity of up to 3 MWh. 158 Megapacks are on their way to Hawaii’s Oahu to build the project. 
The goal is to have the project operational by September 2022 when Hawaii’s last remaining coal plant, which is located just down the road from KES, is expected to be retired.
The coal power plant is used to maintain grid frequency – something Tesla’s energy storage products have proven capable of doing – and that’s what KES is aiming to do along with absorbing excess solar power during the day and discharging during the evening.
Plus Power’s lead developer Bob Rudd said at a ground blessing ceremony last year (via Canary Media):
“Here, today, on Oahu, Plus Power and Hawaiian Electric are sending a postcard from the future. ​I’m certain that someday we’ll all look back, when there are dozens of projects just like KES on the mainland and all across the world, and we’ll think, ​‘We were there. Hawaii showed the world how to do it first.’ “
Plus Power also says that the Tesla Megapack will act as a “black-start” system to jump-start the island’s electric grid if it gets shut down by any calamity. They are calling it the “Ultimate pacemaker for the grid.”
For Tesla, it is quite a large project with 565 MWh of Megapacks to deploy, but the company has deployed larger systems, like the recently commissioned Moss Landing project, which has a capacity of 730 MWh and is planned for an expansion to over 1GWh.

2022/06/24,"Tesla is preparing to partly shut down Gigafactory Shanghai for a few weeks in order to upgrade the factory to a production capacity of 21,000 electric vehicles per week.
After a forced shutdown due to COVID-19 restrictions in Shanghai and then supply chain issues limiting the production, Tesla is now preparing to do a voluntary shut down to at least part of the production in order to do some significant upgrades.
Bloomberg reported that the upgrade will start in July and run through early August, and the upgrade aims to bring the total production to over 21,000 vehicles per week:
Upgrade work at the factory south of Shanghai is expected to be complete by around Aug. 7, with output of the Model Y SUV then increased to 14,000 units a week, from about 11,000 pre-pandemic, and production of the Model 3 sedan at 7,700 units a week from 5,500 previously, the people said.
This would bring Tesla’s production capacity in Shanghai to over 1 million electric vehicles per year.
CEO Elon Musk recently noted that Gigafactory Shanghai is just now back to a full production capacity of about half a million vehicles per year after the citywide lockdown. But prior to the shutdown, Tesla was already planning to greatly expand Gigafactory Shanghai to the point where the expansion has been referred to as a whole new factory.
If the upgrade is successful, Tesla is expecting that Gigafactory Shanghai will become the world’s largest vehicle export hub. Many vehicles produced at Gigafactory Shanghai are exported to other Asian markets, Oceania, and Europe.
Simultaneously, Tesla is also trying to ramp up production at Gigafactory Berlin and Texas, where Model Y production started just a few months ago.

2022/06/24,"Tesla has relaunched its Enhanced Autopilot option and pulled almost all the features from its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package in the process.
Over the years, Tesla has changed its Autopilot options and pricing so many times, it has been hard to follow.
Ultimately, the automaker has ended up making the Autopilot’s Autosteer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control standard on its vehicles and bundled the rest of the features into its “Full Self-Driving package” (FSD), which gradually increased in price to now $12,000.
Before that, Tesla used to offer “Enhanced Autopilot,” which included most of the features currently available in the FSD package except for the potential future capacity to unlock a true full self-driving system through software updates.
Since the automaker kept missing deadlines to achieve that, Tesla gradually moved some of the Enhanced Autopilot features into the FSD package and killed Enhanced Autopilot rather than bringing it back a few times as an optional software upgrade.
Today, Tesla has reversed the move by fully bringing back Enhanced Autopilot as a $6,000 option on new purchases:
As you can see, it took all the main features from the Full Self-Driving Capability package:
The Full Self-Driving Capability package is left with:
But of course, the real value is in eventually achieving a true full self-driving system that doesn’t require driver attention at all times and where the responsibility doesn’t lie with the driver, which is currently the case for all those other features.
Tesla has never disclosed the take-rate of FSD, but it is believed to be quite low, especially these days at $12,000.
This move likely aims at improving Tesla’s margins since the Enhanced Autopilot option at $6,000 is likely going to be more popular, and it doesn’t cost anything for Tesla to activate those features since all the hardware is already in every car it produces. 
It also makes the FSD package a harder sale because it’s now a $6,000 option on top of Enhanced Autopilot, and it literally only adds “Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control,” which is in beta and not super useful.
People who buy FSD over Enhanced Autopilot would have to be super confident that Tesla can deliver on its promise as well as willing to bet $6,000 on it.
CEO Elon Musk has always said that Tesla plans to increase the price of the FSD package as it gets closer to a true self-driving system.

2022/06/23,"Tesla has launched a new virtual power plant in partnership with PG&E in California that will pay Powerwalls owners to help stabilize the electric grid and end brownouts in California.
A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems, like Tesla Powerwalls, used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants. Last year, Tesla launched a test VPP in California, where Powerwall owners would join in voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it.
Today, Tesla has partnered with PG&E to launch a new version of its virtual power plant that will actually compensate people participating:
Become a part of the largest distributed battery in the world and help keep California’s energy clean and reliable. Opt-in to the Tesla Virtual Power Plant (VPP) with PG&E and your Powerwall will be dispatched when the grid needs emergency support. Through the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP) pilot, you will receive $2 for every additional kWh your Powerwall delivers during an event. Adjust your Backup Reserve to set your contribution, while maintaining backup energy for outages.”
The $2 per kWh amount is quite significant and reflects just how much value a VPP can add to the grid in case of an emergency event where the grid needs more capacity.
Depending on the events and the number of Powerwalls homeowners have, they could earn anywhere from $10 to $60 per event or even more for bigger systems.
Tesla lists some of the advantages of the VPP with PG&E:
Tesla said that it has about 50,000 Powerwalls that could be eligible for this VPP, which add up to a significant 500 MWh of energy capacity than can be distributed in any event.
I think people don’t fully understand how important this technology is going to be. With the rapidly rising demand for electricity, partly because of electric vehicles, and an aging grid that is subject to brownouts, this is a great seamless decentralized solution – or at least part of the solution.
It is going to greatly increase the value of home battery packs, make renewable energy more useful, and avoid costly grid brownouts.
For Tesla, it is basically going to turn the company into a major decentralized electric utility. It’s already in operation in Australia. Now it’s in California, and soon it is going to be in Texas.

2022/06/23,"Tesla has expanded the availability of its new Texas-built Model Y by adding units to new inventory, and it raised the price of the brand-new electric SUV.
At the Cyber Rodeo event last month, Tesla delivered its first made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles.
We noted that it was strange that Tesla didn’t reveal any details, like specs and pricing, about the new version of the electric SUV.
It is equipped with the new 4680 battery cells and structural battery pack technology, which is resulting in a significantly different car with different specs in the new Model Y trim.
Yet, Tesla never listed this new trim for sale, and all we know about it was through an EPA filing that revealed it has 279 miles of range and an all-wheel-drive powertrain. It is billed as a “Model Y Standard Range AWD.”
We suspected that Tesla is only delivering the vehicle to employees for now through internal deals, which would explain why it never showed up on its website.
We were later able to confirm that based on a communication Tesla sent to employees and obtained by Electrek.
It revealed that the new Texas-built Model Y Standard starts at $59,990, has a 0-60 mph acceleration in five seconds, and is equipped with a few new features, including a magnetic center console armrest and a parcel shelf.
Last month, Tesla started offering the new Model Y to some customers who had other versions of the Model Y on order. Customers were offered a faster delivery if they decided to downgrade to the Model Y All-Wheel Drive built at Gigafactory Texas.
That has been the only way Tesla has been selling the new vehicle to the public until now.
Tesla has now started adding the Texas-built Model Y to its new car inventory with a few units popping up at a few locations around the US:
These electric cars are available immediately as Tesla is trying to ramp up deliveries at the end of the quarter.
We also noticed that Tesla has now raised the base price of the new Texas-built Model Y from $59,990 to $61,990.
Each one of these inventory units has also a few options, like wheels and paints, that raise the price a little higher.

2022/06/22,"Elon Musk says that he is considering Tesla ads, which are against the company’s current marketing policy, to counter what Musk perceives as media bias against Tesla.
For years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously said that he despises advertising. He said that Tesla doesn’t pay or provide discounts for celebrities to drive its cars and that the automaker doesn’t pay to advertise – though we have seen exceptions before.
Instead, Musk says that Tesla uses money that other automakers spend on advertising to improve their products:
Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great.
The CEO went as far as claiming that the mainstream media doesn’t like him or Tesla because they don’t buy advertising from them.
Now in a new interview, Musk says that Tesla might start advertising to counter this perceived media bias:
Maybe we should advertise because the traditional media will not run negative pieces about automotive because automotive is one of the biggest if not the biggest advertisers in papers. Tesla is basically free game. It’s safe to say that if they run a negative piece about General Motors next to a General Motors ad, General Motors marketing executives are going to call them up and ask: Why did you do that? We will be spending nothing with your publication next year.
Musk suggested that Tesla could start advertising to avoid bias, but it is not a priority right now since the automaker has strong demand that far outpaces its production capacity.
Musk is not wrong. I am sure that lack of advertising is part of the issue with Tesla’s treatment in the media, but there are so many other factors at play.
First and foremost, Musk has developed a tendency to put all negative coverage in the same category: people who have ulterior motives about him or Tesla. That’s a problem because there are real concerns about Tesla and its actions that do deserve negative coverage. Let’s not forget about that.
Now to Musk’s point, there is certainly some unwarranted negative coverage about Tesla in the media, but I don’t think it’s all intentional. A lot of it is incompetence. 
If he wants better media coverage about Tesla, he should start by building a new PR team. I know that Tesla was getting unfair coverage back when it had a PR team, but the team was always way understaffed. A strong PR team would help correct coverage and raise the level of accurate information being reported about Tesla in the media. It will never be perfect, but it would certainly be better than now.
I certainly think that this approach would help more than ad spending, which is problematic if your real goal is reduction of negative coverage. To solve that problem, you would have to spend specifically with publications that you believe unfairly cover you because you don’t spend money with them. Do you really want to reward that kind of behavior?

2022/06/22,"After several revisions, Elon Musk says that the final Tesla Cybertruck design is “finally locked,” and he updated the timeline to production for mid-2023.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
In March 2022, it was confirmed that Tesla aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023.
A significant part of the delay has been attributed to Tesla updating the design of the Cybertruck on several occasions and until now, it was known if the automaker had finally settled on the final design.
During a new interview with the Tesla Owners Club of Silicon Valley, Musk confirmed that the Cybertruck design is now “locked”:
We need to get on that [getting the Cybertruck to production]. At least, the design is finally locked. We got too carried away [with design updates].
Musk has previously disclosed that Tesla added rear-wheel-steering to the Cybertruck and made several slight design changes.
However, the CEO added that regardless of the design revisions, Tesla wouldn’t have been able to bring the electric pickup truck to volume production either way because of the chip shortage. During the interview, Musk updated the production timeline for the Cybertruck to now “mid-2023.”
Earlier this year, new Cybertruck prototypes were spotted being tested by Tesla as well as being used for promotion at events.
Finally, some progress with the Cybertruck, which is likely the most anticipated new electric vehicle right now.
I feel like a lot of Musk’s comments about the Cybertruck, like being “carried away” with the design, reflect the situation with the Model X, which Musk admitted that Tesla overdesigned and made too complicated.
As the CEO noted, at least the timing was right, since Tesla wouldn’t have been able to produce it in any meaningful volume anyway; hopefully, it doesn’t complicate the production ramp either. We know that Tesla is preparing to take delivery of a new world’s largest Giga press for the production of the electric pickup. I think just getting that machine to operate correctly is, in-and-of-itself, going to be a massive task. 
Hopefully, Tesla can stick to the mid-2023 timeline, but I wouldn’t be shocked if it slips again.

2022/06/21,"Tesla dominates the list of most American-made cars, now with the Model Y taking the top spot on the 2022 list.
Until somewhat recently, there were still many people who don’t even know that Tesla is an American automaker. There would be, semi-regularly, someone who would compliment my Tesla without knowing what it was, and they would ask where it is from.
That has stopped over the last few years, however, as Tesla has become completely mainstream. The truth is that Tesla is not only an American automaker, but it is arguably the most American automaker.
Cars.com runs an annual American Made-Index to determine what cars made in the US are the most American-made:
Tesla already took the first place last year with the Model 3, but they have now released their 2022 list, and Tesla dominates it this year with the number 1 and 2 spots and four vehicles in the top 10:
Jenni Newman, Cars.com editor-in-chief, commented on the new list:
The composition of this year’s much-anticipated American-Made Index is particularly interesting in the context of our current marketplace, where high gas prices and scarce inventory meet peak consumer interest in electric vehicles and a heightened demand for American-made products. That Tesla — an American-made all-electric make — appears frequently and high up on the list may indicate a coming alignment of market forces that could really explode once we break through microchip supply chain issues, especially if gas prices remain historically high. It also bodes well for other OEMs, including Honda, Ford and GM, working to diversify product lines with more EV and hybrid options.
Tesla benefits from being highly vertically integrated while the rest of the industry has focused on vehicle bodies, assembly, and engines while relying on suppliers for much of the rest of their vehicles.
Model 3 and Model Y score higher than Model S and Model X because Tesla is getting the battery cells for the formers from Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada, while the cells for Model S and X are coming from Japan.

2022/06/21,"Aptera wants to adopt Tesla’s charge connector for its upcoming solar electric car and believes that the entire US EV market should do the same.
When Tesla started making electric cars, there was no dominant charging standard and therefore, Tesla developed its own. Things have changed a lot since then, and now, CCS has become the global standard.
While CCS has now been globally adopted, it doesn’t necessarily make it the best charging standard out there, and that’s what Aptera believes.
Aptera is building a battery and solar-powered super-efficient three-wheeler electric car. It claims a range of up to 1,000 miles and achieves that by making the vehicle extremely lightweight, with three wheels and a drag coefficient (Cd) of only 0.13.
When it first unveiled the new vehicle in 2020, a prototype featured a Tesla connector, it caught our attention since this is a proprietary connector.
Two years later, Aptera still has hope to use Tesla’s connector said Chris Anthony, Aptera Co-CEO, during a new Q&A:
Years ago, we saw the evolution of the J1772 connector and I think we all marveled at the inadequacy of the connector. It was big, clunky, and it looks like a hairdryer. It wasn’t elegant at all. Then one Tesla brought up their plug and it was beautiful, elegant with a little handle that you can easily plug into your electric vehicle.
Here’s the difference between the CCS connector (J1772 with DC fast-charging CCS pins) and the Tesla connector:
Anthony argues that the Tesla connector is much easier to manipulate and also there’s the fact that the same connector supports all levels of charging. The co-CEO argued that the entire US market should adopt Tesla’s connector and hinted that the company plans to leverage its investor and reservation holder bases to try to make it happen.
Aptera has now over 25,000 reservation holders, and it is aiming to deliver its first vehicles by the end of the year.
I tend to agree with them, but it’s not happening. If even Tesla is not taking this battle, I doubt that Aptera can make a big difference.
Tesla has already folded in Europe, where it is using CCS, and it plans to launch CCS compatibility at Superchargers in the US.
Yes, the Tesla connector is better, but it looks like CCS has already won.

2022/06/21,"Elon Musk says that Tesla is tracking to have a working prototype humanoid robot, Tesla Optimus, by the end of September.
Last month, Musk announced “Tesla AI Day #2” with “many cool updates” on August 19.
The original “Tesla AI Day” held last year was an event focused on the company’s self-driving program. The automaker also unveiled its Dojo supercomputer and announced plans for the “Tesla Bot” humanoid robot – now known as Tesla Optimus.
The AI Day #2 was supposed to be held a year to the day after the first one, but Musk took to Twitter earlier this month to delay the event to September 30. As for the reason for the delay, the CEO said that Tesla may have a working prototype of Optimus by then.
Today, during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk said that Tesla is “tracking” toward having a working prototype of its humanoid robot:
Well, I hope that we will have an interesting prototype to show people. We have a very talented team at Tesla that I’m working with closely to have a prototype humanoid robot ready by the end of September. And I think we are tracking to that point.
The CEO also teased other things to be unveiled during the event that will position Tesla as more than an automaker and more like a “real-world AI company”:
And there’ll be a few other exciting things that we talk about at the Tesla AI Day. We have these sort of AI Day events to just emphasize that Tesla is a lot more than a car company and that we are, in my view, the leading real-world AI company that exists.
Tesla is expected to give updates on its Dojo supercomputer, which trains its neural nets, and a more general update on its self-driving effort, which is the first real-world application of Tesla’s AI.
During the interview, Musk also called again for an agency to oversee and regulate AI development in order to help steer the technology toward public good.

2022/06/21,"Elon Musk has now moved the target for the new wave of layoffs at Tesla from 10% reduction of the workforce to 3% of employees.
Earlier this month, we reported on Musk telling Tesla executives in an email that they need to cut 10% of the workforce and pause hiring due to having a “super-bad feeling” about the economy.
Later, the CEO decided to clarify the Tesla layoffs in an email to all employees. He claimed that the 10% reduction would be for “salaried headcount” due to Tesla becoming overstaffed following a long growth phase.
Tesla ramped up the layoffs last week, and we reported that unlike what Musk previously said, they did include hourly employees with hourly workers in service, sales, and delivery also being affected by the layoffs.
Commenting on the layoffs, the CEO said today that the company is now aiming for a reduction of 3% to 3.5% of the workforce (Bloomberg):
“We grew very fast on the salaried side,” Musk said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday. “A year from now, I think our headcount will be higher” in salaried and hourly workers, but for now the reduction will be 3% to 3.5%, he said.
Some employees have already sued Tesla over the layoffs – more specifically in Nevada where two former Tesla workers allege the automaker didn’t comply with the 60-day notification mandate under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.
Musk stated that he believes the lawsuit has “no standing”:
Let’s not read too much into a preemptive lawsuit that has no standing.
Prior to announcing the layoffs, Musk also asked all remote employees to come back into the office.
This was seen as a wave of layoffs in itself and many employees being laid off now have been mostly doing remote work. Some who have been hired as remote workers and don’t even live anywhere near Tesla offices are being offered to relocate, but if it’s not possible, they are being let go.
Tesla had about 100,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year. So 3% to 3.5% would be roughly 3,000 to 3,500 employees.

2022/06/20,"Tesla has laid off both the president of its LGBTQ+ community and a lead involved in diversity and inclusivity programs at the company. 
While they were let go as part of a broader wave of layoffs, it comes amid several comments Tesla CEO Elon Musk made, concerning what he describes as the “woke mind virus.”
Earlier this month, we reported on Musk telling Tesla executives in an email that they need to cut 10% of the workforce and pause hiring due to having a “super-bad feeling” about the economy.
Later, the CEO decided to clarify the Tesla layoffs in an email to all employees. He claimed that the 10% reduction would be for “salaried headcount” due to Tesla becoming overstaffed following a long growth phase.
Tesla ramped up the layoffs last week, and we reported that unlike what Musk said, they did include hourly employees.
Now we learn that many employees involved in diversity and inclusivity programs were part of the layoffs – including the president of Tesla’s LGBTQ+ community – and a lead involved in diversity and inclusivity programs at the company.
According to sources familiar with the matter, Bobby Berretta-Paris, a five-year Tesla veteran, was let go last week. He was hired as a recruiter and promoted three times during his tenure. He was also the volunteer president of LGBTQ+ at Tesla.
Sources also told Electrek about a software engineer that was also let go by Tesla last week. They had been working at Tesla for four years – most recently as senior software engineer in charge of naming conventions in Tesla’s vehicle UI team – and had been promoted three times. The software engineer volunteered as a diversity and inclusion leader and was involved in employee protection when it came to issues of diversity and inclusion. (Update: we removed their name.)
Berretta-Paris and the software engineer involved in the diversity and inclusion program didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The layoffs of those diversity leaders at Tesla come amid CEO Elon Musk making several comments about what he calls “the woke mind virus,” which he believes is “destroying civilization.”
Unless it is stopped, the woke mind virus will destroy civilization and humanity will never reached Mars
The CEO never elaborated on what he meant by “woke mind virus.”  While the word “woke” originally represented someone who is alert to societal injustice, it has now mostly been co-opted by the right to mock progressive activism or more extremist left-wing ideas.
Musk never used the word publicly until the last few weeks, around the time that he started to get more political and declared that the Democratic Party is “the party of hate.” He said he will be voting Republican going forward.
It could be a coincidence that many people involved in what some could describe as “wokeness” at Tesla were part of the layoffs, but it is certainly not a good look when some of the top people involved in diversity programs are laid off amid Musk’s comments on “woke.”
Musk’s recent comments mimic many in the right about concerns regarding “woke ideas” infiltrating the tech industry. I wouldn’t be surprised if Musk sees that happening at Twitter and would be taking steps to prevent it from happening at Tesla.
As a progressive person myself, I’ll be the first to admit that there are some more extreme progressive ideas that are problematic and worth keeping an eye on, but diversity is certainly not one of them as long as it doesn’t override competence. 
I sincerely hope that people at Tesla who benefited from on those programs are still going to be able to do so in the future.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/06/20,"Tesla cars have been banned from entering Beidaihe, a Chinese resort town, for two months over concerns about spying amid a meeting of the country’s leadership.
For the most part, Tesla and the Chinese government are believed to have a good relationship.
The two came to a deal that resulted in Tesla being the first foreign automaker to fully owned a car factory in China without having to have a joint venture with a state-owned company. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also been known to praise the Chinese people and has refrained from criticizing the Chinese government.
Nonetheless, the Chinese government has indicated clear concerns that Tesla vehicles could be involved in spying activities in its country.
Last year, the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military, issued a notice banning Tesla owners from parking their vehicles on bases and in housing complexes.
The concerns appeared to be related to Tesla’s use of cameras all around its vehicles and where the data is going.
Musk even commented on the story by stating the obvious: “Tesla is not using its vehicles’ cameras to spy on China,” but it didn’t seem to alleviate the concerns as even more government entities reportedly told employees not to park their Tesla vehicles on government property.
Following those situations, Tesla later announced that it will store all data collected in China locally.
A few months later, Tesla announced a new data center in the country in order to do just that, but it didn’t seem to alleviate all concerns.
Today, the local traffic authorities in Beidaihe announced that all Tesla cars are going to be banned from its roads for at least two months:
Tesla cars will be prohibited from entering the Chinese coastal district of Beidaihe, site of a secretive annual summer party leadership conclave, for at least two months starting on July 1, a local traffic police official told Reuters on Monday.
Beidaihe is a resort town not too far from Beijing, and it has been known to host meetings of the Chinese leadership in the summer.
While the authorities didn’t comment on the reason behind the ban, the assumption is that they don’t want the cameras on Tesla vehicles to catch anything related to the meeting.
China is Tesla’s most important market in the world, and the automaker is planning to grow in the country as it doubles the production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai.

2022/06/18,"Tesla announced that it has achieved production of 1,000 Model Y vehicles in a week at Gigafactory Berlin. This is an important milestone – though the automaker originally planned to achieve it in April.
Tesla is currently in the middle of ramping up production at two major new factories, Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, and all of that amid a major global supply chain crisis.
It has to manage to both ramp up its production systems for a highly complex product, the Model Y, and manage this growing supply chain.
It has proved difficult.
After starting production in March at Gigafactory Berlin, it aimed to achieve a production rate of 1,000 units per week by the end of April, but we learn that Tesla had difficulties producing more than 350 units around that time.
The main bottleneck was the paint shop.
Today, Tesla announced that Gigafactory Berlin finally achieved the milestone of 1,000 Model Y vehicles built in a week:
1k Model Y built at Giga Berlin this week. Thanks Tesla team! pic.twitter.com/jCT1qkzvpS
If the factory can at least maintain that going forward, it means that Gigafactory Berlin is now adding 50,000 cars to Tesla’s annual production capacity.
Of course, the goal is to ramp that up by an order of magnitude, but more bottlenecks are going to show up along the way. 
The factory is believed to be doing a lot better than Gigafactory Texas, which is limited by the production of 4680 cells and structural battery packs.
Gigafactory Berlin is still producing Model Y with 2170 cells, which is more widely available, and it plans to move to 4680 cells later once production has ramped up.
Tesla is obviously behind schedule on the factory, but it is not surprising in the current global supply chain context.
At this current production volume, Tesla is also likely still losing money with the factory, but it is still positive for the value it gives to Gigafactory Shanghai.
Every car that Gigafactory Berlin produces is a car that Gigafactory Shanghai doesn’t have to ship halfway around the world and can deliver to China or other closer markets.

2022/06/17,"Tesla has started another wave of layoffs, and this time it also includes hourly workers instead of just salaried employees like CEO Elon Musk claimed.
Earlier this month, we reported on Musk telling Tesla executives in an email that they need to cut 10% of the workforce and pause hiring due to having a “super bad feeling” about the economy.
Later, the CEO has decided to clarify the Tesla layoffs in an email to all employees. He claimed that the 10% reduction would be for “salaried headcount” due to Tesla becoming overstaffed following a long growth phase.
He even stated that “hourly headcount will increase.”
However, we can now confirm that Tesla is also laying off hourly workers across its organization.
Sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Electrek that Tesla started another wave of layoffs yesterday that included many hourly employees in its sales and delivery teams across North America.
Surprisingly, the layoffs come amid Tesla’s being in the middle of a difficult end-of-quarter delivery wave, which Musk himself warned employees about – saying that it will be “nutty.”
After Gigafactory Shanghai was shut down for a significant part of the quarter, the automaker finds itself having to deliver more vehicles at the end of the quarter in order to compensate.
Well, that’s hard to follow. The layoffs are due to a “bad feeling about the economy.” No, it’s about being overstaffed following a long hiring spree.
It will only affect salaried employees. Nope, never mind. They are letting go of hourly workers too now.
On top of it, that’s all in the middle of an end-of-quarter delivery push that Musk tried to rally employees around.
And on top of that, Tesla is also pulling employees from its sales and delivery teams across North America to go work in service centers.
I’ve seen some strange times at Tesla, especially during the ends of quarters, but I think this one takes the cake.
At least, I don’t feel too bad for the employees being laid off, since with the massive labor shortage we have currently, I think they will land on their feet fairly quickly.

2022/06/17,"Tesla Insurance, the automaker’s growing insurance division, has launched its real-time driver data insurance product in Nevada. It is now available in eight states, plus California but without real-time driver data, and there’s evidence that several more states are coming.
Tesla updated its website to note that its real-time data insurance product is now available to customers in the state of Nevada.
The addition makes for a total of eight states with Tesla Insurance based on real-time driving data:
Tesla still hasn’t been able to get the full product adopted in California, but the automaker recently started to let people who get Tesla Insurance in California use the Driver Safety Score for “educational purposes.”
Recently, Tesla filings for its insurance products have surfaced in Florida, New Jersey, and Maryland – indicating that the automaker is looking to expand in those states soon.
In October of last year, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla Insurance is aiming to be “in most states” by the end of 2022. The regulatory landscape for insurance is complex and varies state by state. Therefore, Tesla has a lot of work to do to launch in any new state, but the effort appears to be paying off with many new markets being added in the last few months.
Tesla originally introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data or Tesla’s safety score, which had been the original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, Tesla wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October 2021, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes compared the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month to month depending on your score:
Since releasing the product, Tesla has integrated everything into its mobile app, from ordering insurance to using the safety score to paying and managing claims.
The company expanded the insurance product to Illinois in December and then to  Arizona and Ohio in January.
In April, Tesla launched insurance based on real-time driver data in Colorado, Oregon, and Virginia.
Now in June, the automaker has expanded the product to Nevada with more to come.

2022/06/16,"Tesla expands Supercharger pilot program for non-Tesla EV owners to Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.
The program to give access to the Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric car owners is now in most of Europe.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers. In November 2021, we saw Tesla take its first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands, where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
In January, the automaker announced that the program is expanding to more stations in Norway and France, and a month later, the program was expanded to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands. Now Tesla has expanded the pilot program to some Supercharger stations in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria.
Last month, the automaker also added Spain and the UK to the program. Today, Tesla expanded the program again to include Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.
With the update, the program covers most European countries in which Tesla operates:
However, Tesla didn’t open all Supercharger stations in those markets to non-Tesla EV owners.
The automaker has only fully opened the Supercharger network in the Netherlands to all EV owners.
With the latest expansion of the program, Tesla claimed its Supercharger network became the “largest public 150 kW+ fast-charging network” in Europe.
Tesla is gradually expanding the pilot program to study the impact of onboarding non-Tesla EV owners on the network. It is expected to eventually give EV drivers access to more if not all stations in Europe and use the new revenue to accelerate the expansion of the network.
The automaker is expected to also do the same in North America, but it is going to be more complicated in this market since Tesla uses its proprietary plug instead of the CCS standard. However, Musk recently hinted that Tesla will be adding CCS connectors to new Supercharger stations in the US.

2022/06/16,"Tesla is sending some of its employees who are not in service and are untrained to work on cars into service centers to fix vehicles. It looks like Tesla’s service issues are bigger than we thought.
Earlier this month, we reported on CEO Elon Musk’s announcement that Tesla is working on service in North America and how Telsa is aiming to make the majority of appointments same-day repairs. As we noted, it is much needed since Tesla’s customer fleet is growing much faster than its service infrastructure.
Last week, the CEO also held a companywide meeting at Tesla where he said that the automaker wants to ‘revolutionize’ service with bigger centers and more specialization.
Musk made it sound like the company was mostly engaging in an effort to revamp its service division, but we now learn that there are more serious issues with service short-term that Tesla is trying to address.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Musk has strongly communicated internally that he is unhappy with the state of Tesla’s service and he is making it a top priority.
It is so much of a priority that Musk has canceled sales and delivery targets for the quarter and pulled employees from those teams to work on service. The result is that sales employees, entry-level workers or managers, who have no training in servicing cars, are finding themselves in service centers working on vehicles.
To be fair, they are focusing on easier tasks, like changing tires, but it is still an extreme solution that points to a more extreme problem with Tesla’s service.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that the main concern is reducing the metric of “next available appointment,” which is the time between when a Tesla owner requests a service appointment and when Tesla has service slots available. 
That metric is widely different depending on the market, but there are some markets in North America where Tesla owners can currently not get a service appointment for up to a month. Musk wants no more than a week and, as previously reported, he also wants two-thirds of appointments to be same-day.
Service availability changes widely in different regions. I had heard from owners about some long wait times, but I didn’t know it was big enough of an issue. Apparently, Tesla is internally concerned about this issue for many reasons.
Customer satisfaction is down and some owners are giving up their Tesla vehicles over the bad service. Tesla has an incredible retention rate, and this is probably the only reason people are giving up their Tesla vehicles.
Interestingly, I’m hearing that Tesla is also concerned because the service appointment time is sort of public data since anyone with a Tesla vehicle can go through the app and check it out, which means that Tesla shorts can use the data. Tesla doesn’t like that.
We will be following this story in the coming weeks to see where it goes.

2022/06/15,"Tesla (TSLA) has significantly increased the prices of its electric cars across its entire lineup with some models going up by as much as $6,000.
After a year of increasing prices almost every month in 2021, Tesla slowed down the rapid rise in prices across its electric vehicles in early 2022.
The last major price increase was in March 2022 – followed by a smaller one on long-range vehicles in April.
But now the automaker is back at it.
Today, Tesla updated its online configurator overnight to again increase prices across its entire lineup.
Electrek tracked the price increases:
The Model 3 is the one that got the smallest price increase of all Tesla’s lineup today.
Only the Model 3 Long Range is affected as it went from $54,490 to $57,990 – a $2,500 price increase:
The Model Y, which has become Tesla’s most popular model, has received a bigger price increase with both versions of the electric SUV going up in cost.
Tesla also now sells a Model Y Standard Range, the new version built in Texas, but Tesla has yet to let people buy it through its online configurator and only offers it to local Model Y buyers in Texas on an invitation basis for now.
Tesla Model S also saw its price increase significantly today, and that’s after a big $5,000 price increase just a few months ago.
The Model S Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive Long Range went from $99,990 to $104,990 with the price increase today.
The Plaid version of the flagship electric sedan stays the same price at $135,990.
Like the Model S, the Model X saw a significant price increase earlier this year and now again today.
The Model X Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive Long Range went from $114,990 to $120,990 with the price increase today.
That’s a significant $6,000 price increase for the electric SUV.
Like with the Model S, Model X Plaid stays the same price for now at $138,990
As usual, Tesla doesn’t disclose the reason behind those price increases, but we have our suspicions.
Increases in raw material prices and logistic costs are usual suspects.
Also, Tesla has a significant backlog of orders with new orders for several of those models only being delivered 6 to 12 months from now, according to the online configurator.
Therefore, Tesla has to try to predict cost increases for around the time that it will be producing those vehicles 6 to 12 months from now.
Or Tesla could just be looking to increase its gross margins. While the company was complaining about increasing costs during its price increases last year, its gross margins on vehicles have consistently increased over the last year.

2022/06/15,"Tesla has topped the list of most crashes on advanced driver-assist (ADAS) features – Autopilot in Tesla’s case – in NHTSA’s first report on “Safety Performance of Advanced Vehicle Technologies.”
Dr. Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s Administrator, commented on the report:
The data released today are part of our commitment to transparency, accountability and public safety. New vehicle technologies have the potential to help prevent crashes, reduce crash severity and save lives, and the Department is interested in fostering technologies that are proven to do so; collecting this data is an important step in that effort. As we gather more data, NHTSA will be able to better identify any emerging risks or trends and learn more about how these technologies are performing in the real world.
The report is broken down into two sections: one for the SAE Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems and one for SAE Levels 3-5 automated driving systems. Systems with traffic-aware cruise control and lane-keeping features fall under the level 2.
Tesla Autopilot falls under that category and according to the report, it leads in crashes by a wide margin:
However, it is not adjusted for the number of vehicles on the road with ADAS – nor the number of miles driven on ADAS – and Tesla is believed to have more vehicles than anyone equipped ADAS features, since it has included Autopilot for free on all vehicles for years while most other automakers charge for ADAS features.
As for levels 3 to 5, NHTSA describes those as systems capable of handling the “entire dynamic driving task under defined operating conditions and will not require a human driver to monitor and supervise the automation system.”
It looks like NHTSA considers Tesla’s FSD Beta in its category because Tesla showed up in the report with one crash:
In February, we reported on a Tesla vehicle on Full Self-Driving Beta running into a pole in what we believed could be the first FSD Beta accident caught on video. In levels 3 to 5, Alphabet’s Waymo leads crashes with 62, followed by Transdev and GM’s Cruise with 34 and 23 crashes respectively.
Those systems are currently mostly used in test programs in specific areas, especially in California and Arizona.
All the data is from July 2021 to May 2022.
Again, NHTSA specifies that it hasn’t normalized the data for miles driven and therefore, it doesn’t represent the level of safety in any of those systems.

2022/06/15,"Tesla (TSLA) has lost over $500 million in value from its Bitcoin investment amid what people are now calling a “crypto winter.”
Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin.
Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network showed a higher mix of renewable energy.
A year after the investment, Tesla’s Bitcoin holding increased to $2 billion just a few months ago.
But in the crypto world, a lot can change in just a few months.
Several major cryptocurrencies have seen a major decline in value amid the broader market downturn, and Tesla’s Bitcoin investment is now worth $905 million, according to Bitcoin Treasuries, which tracks Bitcoin holdings from companies:
It means that Tesla has lost almost $600 million in value through its Bitcoin investment.
The only good news for Tesla here is that its Bitcoin holding represents only 10% of its cash position and 0.1% of its total market capitalization.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also personally invested in Bitcoin and he has previously used the “diamond hands” meme, which generally indicates that he plans on holding the investment.
Musk also said that he believes Tesla will resume taking Bitcoin payment as he sees improvements in the energy mix of Bitcoin mining.
More recently, Tesla also directly helped improve renewable energy use in Bitcoin mining with Megapacks at a Bitcoin mine in Texas.

2022/06/15,"Elon Musk made an interesting comment about Tesla’s effort to develop self-driving. The CEO says that solving self-driving is the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or almost nothing.
Like the rest of the market lately, Tesla’s stock has taken a beating – though even more so than the rest of the market since Musk announced the acquisition of Twitter, which he sold Tesla shares to finance, and decided to become political, which has divided his fans.
Despite those tough past few months on the market, Tesla is still one of the most valuable companies in the world and worth almost $700 billion.
That’s why it’s interesting that when discussing Tesla’s software effort in an interview this week, Musk said the following:
The overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving. That’s essential. It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.
Musk suggests that Tesla would be worth almost nothing if it doesn’t solve self-driving, which the CEO has been confident that the company would solve despite several missed timelines.
Here’s the relevant part of the interview:
Tesla’s is currently developing self-driving technology through its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program.
The automaker has been selling a FSD package for up to $12,000 that comes with a few driver assist features and the promise that Tesla will eventually enable self-driving capability through future software updates.
Tesla has missed a few deadlines on that front, and it is still not clear when the company can deliver on the promise.
Most recently, Musk has moved the goal post to Tesla simply having 1 million people in the FSD Beta program by the end of the year, but the FSD Beta is not a self-driving system as it requires a driver monitoring the system at all times and to be ready to take control at a moment’s notice. 
This is an interesting comment within the context of many people seriously doubting Tesla’s ability to deliver on its self-driving promises.
There have been more and more talks about Tesla actually needing to upgrade its hardware before it can deliver a true self-driving system through software updates.
Now on the other side, I think no one can argue that Tesla would be worth a lot of money if it solves the issue. If Tesla can enable a self-driving system in all its vehicles produced since 2016, as it promised, it will unlock hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of value in its customer fleet and make every vehicle it produces today significantly more valuable.
On the other hand, would it be worth “basically zero” if it doesn’t achieve that? You would think not considering Tesla already has a very profitable business just selling electric vehicles driven by humans, but I think Musk is right and that’s his own doing.
FSD is a hole that Tesla has to crawl itself out of because it has been selling it to customers with promises. If it doesn’t deliver on those promises, or keeps delaying them, there’s going to be a reckoning – and it could be a costly one for Tesla.

2022/06/14,"Elon Musk says that electric vehicle startups Lucid and Rivian are tracking toward bankruptcy unless something changes.
During an interview with the Tesla Silicon Valley Owners Club, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that both Lucid Motors and Rivian, two US-based electric vehicle startups, are trending toward bankruptcy.
The CEO said:
Unless something changes significantly with Rivian and Lucid, they will both go bankrupt. They are tracking toward bankruptcy.
Musk added:
I hope they can do something, but unless they can cut their cost dramatically, they are in deep trouble and will end up in the car cemetery like every other with the exception of Tesla and Ford.
Here’s the relevant part of the interview:
Musk also added later during the interview:
My advice to Rivian would be to cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they are doomed.
He also commented on Rivian increasing the prices of its electric vehicles earlier this year and noted that when you increase the price, you “reduce the number of people who can afford the vehicles exponentially.”
Obviously, he is technically accurate, but I think that the comments need a lot more nuance that wasn’t communicated during the interview. 
Rivian lost $1.5 billion last quarter, and it has significant negative gross margins. If it keeps losing money on electric vehicles it sells and delivers, it will go bankrupt unless it can raise more money, which can be difficult without signs of the trajectory changing. Lucid is in a similar situation. 
However, this is where you’d expect Rivian and Lucid to be at this stage in their evolution and Tesla was in a very similar situation around the same time.
Tesla was losing money and relied on raising more capital for a long time before it got its costs under control.
I’d say that the biggest difference is – especially when it comes to Rivian – that they are doing it on a bigger scale than Tesla. By the time Tesla was delivering thousands of vehicles per quarter, the automaker had achieved a positive gross margin on them – though it was still losing money overall.
Rivian is still losing money on every vehicle it delivers. But, again, signaling doom assumes that Rivian can’t cut costs by scaling and cutting production costs. 
The other difference is that Rivian can afford it with over $16 billion cash on hand at the end of last quarter. But to Musk’s point, it is on a downward trajectory and something needs to change, but again – not unlike Tesla just five years ago.
Both Lucid and Rivian have good products that are getting people excited, and they are now focusing on ramping those products up while reducing the costs. Yes, it is something to keep an eye on, but Musk’s “doom” comments are very similar to the naysayer’s comments that frustrated him a lot when Tesla’s was in the same growth phase.
As an aside, I really wish Musk would go back to giving interviews to people that are not just superfans and would actually challenge him on comments like that. I am not blaming those guys because it’s not their job – they are fans and they just want to hear him talk, but the whole interview is Musk making statements with them nodding, without ever challenging anything he says. 
In my opinion, it doesn’t make for the most informative content, but that’s been Musk’s media treatment for the past year or so.

2022/06/14,"According to a comprehensive report published this morning by research firm Bloomberg Intelligence, Tesla will hold its global crown for EV sales for the next 18 months but will then be usurped by Volkswagen electric vehicles. The full BEV outlook report predicts that many legacy automakers will lag in sales through 2025, but Volkswagen is on track to overtake Tesla’s production volume by 2024.
Both Volkswagen and Tesla are major names in autos, so we will spare you their history lessons. While the latter has been all-electric since day one, the former has made more recent efforts to embrace BEVs and has done so much more aggressively that other legacy automakers.
Perhaps that emissions scandal put a little chip on Volkswagen’s shoulder to motivate a shift in its public image – either way, it’s working. Last fall, we reported Volkswagen was expanding EV sales and deliveries at a staggering pace, seeing YOY growth well over 100%. 
This trend has continued into 2022 as BEV demand grows alongside the number of VW models available. While Volkswagen is still staring at Tesla’s back, the German automaker has been gaining ground. 
Tesla on the other hand, continues its very public role as the darling of EV adoption, donning a crown decorated with badges like a $686 billion market cap and hundreds of thousands of units produced each quarter. With new Gigafactories in Berlin and Austin ramping up, Tesla has no intention of slowing down, despite multiple setbacks.
In light of Tesla’s growing efforts, Bloomberg Intelligence believes the American automaker’s days as the top dog in BEV sales are numbered and Volkswagen is next in line.
Research firm Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) shared a summary of its new report this morning, which included the sales prediction chart you see above. The full report, titled “Battery Electric Vehicles Report – Automakers Race to the Top” is available for download and specifically predicts BEV sales for the top automakers through 2025.
The report suggests that most legacy automakers will be unable to divest their BEV-related assets from their combustion vehicle production since those gasoline models are helping fund the transition to BEV models. Volkswagen, however, is the exception, thanks in part to an IPO for its Porsche marque expected in Q4 of this year.
Predicted BEV sales mixes of 30% in 2023 and ~45% in 2025 could help boost Volkswagen’s valuation for the IPO, offering even more cash flow for accelerating its transition to electrification, according to the report. Senior European automotive industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence Michael Dean spoke to future of EV sales, predicting when other automakers might catch Tesla:
Looking ahead, automakers in Europe, China and elsewhere will continue to challenge Tesla via an impending wave of new models, though profit incentives are limited amid rising battery costs and a lack of scale. That may change in 2025-26 as more brands achieve critical mass on new-generation models with proprietary software. There are a number of challenging external factors to consider and bold BEV ambitions have done little to prevent crisis-level valuation multiples, stoked by recession fears, rising interest rates, supply-chain constraints and inflation.
The BI report also points out that batteries are and will remain a critical factor in every automaker’s ability to stay competitive in the EV sales market. Volkswagen has already committed tens of billions of dollars toward battery development and its necessary supply chain, including plans for six 40 GWh battery factories in the EU by 2030. The German automaker also has three separate strategic partnerships in place to further its battery development.
Volkswagen’s foresight to invest big into EV battery technology is another reason Bloomberg Intelligence believes the automaker is bound to pass Tesla in BEV sales. According to the report, Chinese automaker BYD is on pace to rank third in EV sales by 2025, followed by a saturated pack of legacy automakers all circling around 1 million annual sales. 
Along with BYD, Chinese automakers like NIO and XPeng are closing the technology and branding gap overseas, setting the stage for a serious showdown in China against Volkswagen, BMW, and Tesla. China’s growing sales mix of BEVs leads all global markets – obtaining a large chunk of it could prove critical to any automaker looking to dethrone Tesla in EV sales.
These predictions by Bloomberg Intelligence are just that, but the full report does provide the data used to make its predictions. We recommend checking it out for yourself. Tesla will be tough to catch at the rate it’s moving now, but we can all keep an eye on the EV sales market to see if Volkswagen does in fact take over as predicted. Place your bets now.

2022/06/14,"LG announced that it is investing $450 million into producing 4680 battery cells, a format pioneered by Tesla.
While the Korean battery manufacturer didn’t confirm that the new cells will be for Tesla, it is extremely likely.
When Tesla unveiled its plan to produce its own new tabless battery cell in a bigger format with a new chemistry, the automaker claimed to have solved some major issues that were preventing the industry from producing bigger cylindrical Li-ion cells in a new format called 4680.
Tesla’s new 4680 battery cells have the potential to be cheaper, more efficient, and, therefore, enable a longer range or smaller battery packs.
The automaker had to develop new manufacturing processes to make the battery cell and deploy those at scale in its own new battery factories being built near Berlin, Shanghai, and Austin.
On top of those in-house production plans, Tesla is also partnering with current battery suppliers to deploy their own production of the new 4680 cell.
LG Energy Solutions was among the first to show an interest in building the new cell format.
This week, the company announced that it has greenlighted a $450 million investment into a 4680 cell production line at a factory in South Korea (via Reuters):
The South Korean battery maker, which counts Telsa Inc, General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG among others as customers, said it planned to invest 580 billion won to add 9 giga-watt hours worth of production capacity of 4680 cylindrical batteries at its No.2 Ochang factory.
With an average of 70 kWh per pack, 9 GWh would enable the production of around 125,000 electric vehicles per year.
On top of it, LG also announced a smaller $116 million investment into a production line to build 4 GWh of 2170 battery cells at its No.1 Ochang factory in Korea.
The 2170  cylindrical battery cell is also a format primarily used in Tesla electric vehicles, but a few other automakers are starting to use it, such as Lucid Motors.
The two new production lines are expected to enter mass production during the second half of next year.

Ok, you’ve seen the hype and have your eyes set on owning a Tesla, but first, you wonder, “how much is a lease?” Fair question – you don’t want to rush into anything after all. A Tesla lease certainly has its benefits in 2022, but the question is whether those benefits are right for you. Below, we have broken down all the factors to consider in a 2022 Tesla lease so you can more accurately decide if it’s the right option for you.
Trick question. Only you can decide what the best Tesla model is for you, regardless of whether it’s a lease, a brand new purchase, or the purchase of a used EV. While the are still two additional Tesla models in the pipeline (Cybertruck and second-generation Roadster), the American automaker currently offers four EVs to choose from:
Who are we kidding? You already knew that. You’ve already done your homework and scoped out all the purchase prices for these EVs, right? If not, you can check out our 2022 Tesla pricing guide to get up to speed.
Later on, you can compare that to the 2022 prices for a Tesla lease and more easily decide what’s the best path for you. If you’re still considering a lease, let’s make sure you can do so in your state. 
While most states in the US do allow for Tesla leases, not all have joined the party yet, and some of these states have flip-flopped in recent years. For example, one of Tesla’s pages excludes Vermont as a lease state, but a separate leasing page includes it, which is currently correct.
According to Tesla’s website, here are the current states (and districts) that allow you to lease a Tesla in 2022:
Well, that all depends, of course. Like any and all vehicle leases, there are a number of factors at play to determine how much a prospective customer may pay each month. 
In addition to varying prices by model, details like lease term, down payment, and annual miles will all have their respective effect on your monthly dues. With that said, Tesla only offers 36-month lease options, so we will go with that.
For the sake of comparison of each Tesla model below, each of the pricing options is a result of the following terms: 36-month lease, 12,000 miles per year. For the two newer models (3 and Y), we will pay the minimum $4,500 down payment. For the veteran models (X and S), we will use the minimum required $7,500 down payment.
Please note: 2022 Tesla lease prices are accurate at the time of publishing and are subject to change.
To give you a taste of the low end of the lease pricing spectrum, we will begin with the Model 3, Tesla’s most affordable EV to date. The Model 3 is currently for sale in three separate trims, which we have broken down for you below:
The Tesla Model Y is similar to its Model 3 sibling in that it only requires a $4,500 down payment. Similarly, the first payment and amount due at signing are only a couple of hundred dollars more. 
However, your monthly payment for a Model Y will be significantly more compared to the cheaper sedan, particularly for the Long Range trim. On the trade-off, you’ll be driving off in a more spacious EV, although the Model 3 generally still wins in performance specs.
When you look at the specs of the next two Tesla EVs, you’ll notice a leap in performance compared to the previously mentioned lease options. Due to this fact, it’s no surprise that vehicle pricing correlates with such.
Even with the larger $7,500 down payment, upfront and monthly costs come at a higher mark for the Model S, but that’s the price you gotta pay to experience Plaid. Here’s how its lease options break down in 2022:
As the most expensive Tesla EV currently available for sale, the Model X tops our list as the most expensive lease option in 2022. You get what you pay for though… as long as you can afford it. 
As the largest available Tesla model, the Model X now comes in its own Plaid version, offering potential customers like yourselves the most bang for the most bucks.
So we’ve offered a taste of what sort of costs you may be looking at for a 2022 Tesla lease, and hopefully, you’re located in one of the forty-three territories where leasing is allowed.
That’s a great start, but we’d be remiss to point out that not all states that offer Tesla leases are created equal. Just because Tesla allows you to purchase a lease in your state, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best option. 
For example, the state of Vermont allows Tesla leases but does not have any centers for pickup or maintenance. That means you’ll have to acquire your Tesla from a nearby state which is not so easily done. Nearby New Hampshire does not allow for Tesla leases, nor does Maine. 
Massachusetts is to the south but will not supply temporary tags to out-of-state lessees. New York is close, but there are potential tax implications, so Tesla usually sends those customers to New Jersey to pick up their EVs. 
Additionally, if you need to service your Tesla after you jump through all the hoops of acquiring it, you’ll need to drive to either New York, Massachusetts, or New Jersey. Not ideal.
Some states have showrooms and stores, but like Vermont, no service centers:
Others have service centers, but only one for the entire state. How inconvenient that is depends on the size of your given state obviously, but this is another factor to be mindful of. Here are the current states with only one service center:
We recommend checking out Tesla’s “find us” page to determine where the nearest showroom and service center is to you so you’re not driving hundreds of miles any time you have an issue.
This is a pertinent question and one certainly worth asking yourself as you explore 2022 Tesla lease options. The answer is subjective, but it would be advantageous for you to explore all possible options to ensure you get the best value for your shiny new EV.
While down payments and upfront costs can be comparable, the monthly charge for a lease is considerably lower than a loan payment to own. That being said, you’re making payments to rent your EV rather than own it. 
Following the 36-months of your Tesla lease, you can trade up for that new model you’ve been eyeing. Cybertruck perhaps? On the flip side, a lease locks into that same Tesla EV for three years and can get quite expensive to buy out of. If you buy, however, you can sell it and upgrade whenever you want!
While you can (perhaps) purchase your Tesla at the end of your lease, your APR may have been higher compared to a purchase loan, so it’s possible you end up paying more in the long run had you begun purchase payments to begin with. Most recently, Tesla has been more strict on letting lessees buy their EV at the end of the term, so you may end up making three years of payments with nothing to show for it at the end. Definitely something to consider.
Your annual mileage should be a huge consideration as well. If you drive more than 15,000 miles a year, it’s a safer bet to buy, but if you can stay within the limits of a Tesla lease, you’ll pay slightly less, albeit with more attention to your odometer.
Thanks to a significantly smaller number of mechanical components in EVs compared to combustion engines, EVs require limited invasive maintenance and do not break down as quickly as gas cars. As a result, they can retain more value over time. Still, 2022 has seen a boom in the used vehicle market, so reselling your owned EV could benefit you down the road. 
The used ICE vehicle bubble will eventually burst, but EVs still remain more popular than ever. Tesla is still trying to keep up with customer demand, leaving fewer EVs available than the number of people looking to drive one. As an owner, you might be able to sell your Tesla for cash back in your pocket, thus lowering your total cost of ownership.
Whether it’s better to buy a Tesla than lease, however, is still a question of money, daily usage, and model availability. While monthly payments to own a Tesla have grown significantly due to skyrocketing prices from the automaker, paying toward ownership (albeit much more) gains equity, especially as the option to buy your leased Tesla isn’t guaranteed.
This is a decision that definitely requires research and budgeting. Tesla offers a financing calculator on its website to help guide you toward whether a Tesla lease or cash payments work best for you.
If you feel like buying might be a better option, you can check out the current Tesla prices for 2022 and see how those options compare to a potential lease. You can also try your luck in the used Tesla market. Good luck!

2022/06/13,"Elon Musk says that Tesla’s factory might not necessarily be in the US as the automaker is also considering options in Canada and Mexico for a new North American plant.
Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a company-wide meeting with employees. Electrek obtained a recording of the meeting, which included a Q&A with workers. During the Q&A, an employee asked Musk where Tesla’s next factory in the US is going to be located.
Musk said that Tesla hasn’t decided yet, but he did specify that it might not be in the US:
We are looking at sites, but we are considering some sites options more broadly in North America, so including Canada and Mexico, and the US as well.
The CEO made it sound like Tesla is actively looking at sites, but he did make it clear that the priority in North America right now is to ramp Gigafactory Texas to volume production.
Musk said during the meeting:
The priority is definitely getting Giga Texas up to volume production and it’s difficult to get to volume production. It is much more important that we get Texas to volume production than to find a new site, but we are looking…
Ramping up production of complex products, like an electric car, is always difficult and even though Tesla has a lot of experience with that at this point, Gigafactory Texas is going to be especially difficult to ramp up.
That’s due to the Texas-built Model Y being equipped with Tesla’s new 4680 cell and structural battery pack. Tesla needs to both ramp up production of the new cell and of the new electric SUV with the updated structural battery pack architecture.
Tesla has previously stated that it aims to achieve volume production at Gigafactory Texas by the end of 2022. Musk has also said that Tesla is likely to announce the site of a new factory around the end of the year.
There is still a chance that the next Tesla factory might again be in the US, but the way the employee asked the question and Musk responded, he made it sound like there’s a good chance it might be in Canada or Mexico instead.
The employee specifically asked where in the US is going to be the next Tesla factory, and the CEO quickly said that the search was more about North America, and then specifically mentioned Canada and Mexico. Obviously, I’m a bit biased about Canada; Musk did mention in the past about Tesla building a factory on or closer to the east coast of the US. Maybe the east coast in Canada could make sense.
Canada has all of the natural resources needed to build batteries and a competent workforce. It could make a good location for the next Tesla Gigafactory.

2022/06/13,"Tesla confirmed that Oracle’s billionaire founder, Larry Ellison, is leaving its board of directors, and he won’t be replaced.
As part of Elon Musk’s and Tesla’s settlement with the SEC over the former’s comments about taking the company private, the board had to nominate two new “independent” directors within 90 days.
The automaker complied by appointing two new independent directors to its board, Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a longtime human resources executive, back in December 2018.
Larry Ellison, who is one of the richest men on earth with a net worth of $60 billion, had previously disclosed that he made a “large” investment in Tesla last year prior to being appointed to the board. After joining Tesla’s board, he had to disclose his investment, which was worth about $1 billion at the time.
Ellison was up for reelection at Tesla’s upcoming annual shareholder’s meeting, but Tesla has now disclosed that he will not seek reelection:
In June 2022, Lawrence J. Ellison, a Class III director, determined collectively with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board that he will not stand for reelection to the Board when his current term ends at the 2022 Annual Meeting. The Board currently expects to reduce the number of Board seats to seven upon the expiration of Mr. Ellison’s term at the 2022 Annual Meeting, and therefore votes or proxies may not be submitted for the election of more than two board seats. The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to frequently evaluate the optimal size and composition of the Board to allow it to operate nimbly and efficiently, while maintaining new ideas, expertise and experience among its membership.
The automaker also said that it will not seek to replace Ellison and, therefore, Tesla’s board simply will have one less seat for the time being.
While Ellison was elected as an independent board member, he was believed to closely align with Musk and support him. But other than that, it isn’t likely to affect Tesla in any major way. Musk still has a strong hold on the company.

2022/06/13,"Tesla has been surprised by the demand for the Model Y in right-hand drive markets, and CEO Elon Musk says that the automaker will increase production.
The Model Y has been on the market for a few years, and it has already become the most popular electric vehicle in the world.
While it has been on the market for a few years, it always takes Tesla a few years to launch its new vehicles with a right-hand drive configuration, and the Model Y was no exception.
Tesla opened Model Y orders in the UK late in 2021, and it started deliveries in February 2022.
By March, it was already the best-selling electric vehicle in the UK and pushing the country’s EV shares to new records.
But there are a few other right-hand drive markets out there, and Tesla is still expanding the Model Y to those markets – with the biggest ones being Australia.
Tesla has just launched the Model Y in the country, and it is reportedly seeing strong demand, which CEO Elon Musk acknowledged and said that Tesla plans to accelerate Model Y right-hand drive production:
We’re working on accelerating RHD Model Y production. Didn’t expect demand to be so high!
A few days ago, you could still place an order for the Model Y and get an August-November for the base version or get it a bit faster, November-February, for the Performance model.
Tesla apparently received a surge of orders since the Model Y arrived in the country as the delivery timelines for new orders have now extended to February-May 2023.
Tesla was already successful in Australia before the Model Y. In the first quarter of 2022, Tesla vehicles accounted for around two-thirds of EV sales in the country with 4,417 units.
If Australia is like any other market where the Model Y has been introduced, the electric SUV is expected to quickly catch up to its smaller older brother.

2022/06/13,"Tesla is operating a virtual power plant demonstration in Texas to show the grid authorities the potential of such a product.
But until some rule changes, the company needs the collaboration of local Powerwall owners without compensation.
Last month, we reported on Tesla lobbying for any homeowner with solar and batteries to participate in Texas’s energy market.
The company was asking for a rule change with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an organization operating Texas’s electrical grid, that would enable electric utilities with customers with behind-the-meter solar and batteries, meaning people with residential solar, to bid on the extra capacity.
At the time, we speculated that Tesla could be seeking the rule change to enable a virtual power plant with its Powerwall customers in the state.
Sure enough, Tesla has now launched a virtual power plant demonstration in Texas in order to demonstrate to ERCOT the value that VPPs can bring to the grid.
Tesla wrote about the project:
Your Tesla Powerwall is capable of providing powerful support to the grid. Currently, however, homes in Texas are not allowed to provide some of the critical grid-supporting services that are typically provided by conventional power plants. Allowing Powerwall’s clean energy to provide these services is important to creating a more resilient grid and accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
The company says it has about 200 Powerwall owners in the ERCOT “North” sector in Texas that can choose to opt in the program as volunteers:
People participating in the demonstration have to agree to let Tesla control 80% of the capacity of their Powerwalls:
You agree to allow Tesla to control your Powerwall, including charging, discharging and configuring your Powerwall to automatically respond to grid conditions, to support tests that demonstrate grid services. Tesla will not draw down the battery below 20% of its capacity, to allow for backup. Except for this limitation, Tesla may charge or discharge your Powerwall at any time and to any extent.
Tesla is bundling that capacity with a “fleet of Powerwalls” to provide grid services.
However, until the rule change and since this is a demonstration to justify the rule change, no one is being compensated for those grid services.
For now, Tesla is only offering a $40 gift cards to those participating:
If you participate in 80% or more of the tests during the term and provide market ID data if requested, Tesla will mail you a $40 Tesla gift card for your participation. This is the sole compensation for participation and for costs incurred related to your participation, including any increased energy charges.
Tesla says that it already has 64 Powerwall owners in the VPP demonstration and the early results are promising:
Now if ERCOT adopts the rule change, those same Powerwall owners could start participating in Texas’s energy market through the Tesla VPP and get fairly compensated for those grid services.
It would unlock more value in home energy storage, and therefore, it would reduce the payback period of home battery packs like the Powerwall while helping stabilize the Texas electric grid.
Tesla is aiming for a rule change by the end of the year.

2022/06/12,"Elon Musk says that Tesla had a “very tough quarter” and asks employees to “rally hard to recover” in leaked emails.
Over the weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent emails to employees and Electrek has obtained copies.
In the first email, Musk tried to instill meaning about building Tesla products to workers:
“We *actually* build great, real products that people love and make their lives and the world better. That is so profound. It is an honest day’s work that you can feel in your heart. Whatever else is going on in this messed-up world, know that at least what you are doing is pure goodness and that I have infinitely more respect and admiration for you than the richest person on Wall St.”
The next email was more familiar. Musk often sends emails to rally the troops at the end of the quarter to push for deliveries and this is one of those emails.
The CEO wrote it was a “very tough quarter” and employees need to “rally hard to recover”:
“This has been a very tough quarter, primarily due to supply chain and production challenges in China, so we need to rally hard to recover!”
Earlier this week, Electrek reported that Musk warned Tesla workers of a ‘nutty’ end-of-quarter delivery wave for the same reason.
By “supply chain and production challenges in China”, Musk is referring to Gigafactory Shanghai being closed for weeks earlier in the quarter, along with several suppliers, due to the restrictions to control COVID cases in Shanghai.
The CEO said that production is now “returning to full strength” in Shanghai.
Interestingly, Musk also gave some insight into the production status at other Tesla factories.
He wrote about Fremont:
“I’d like to congratulate the Fremont team for achieving a new all-time record production day last week,”
We reported this week that Tesla now produces more cars at Fremont factory than when it was operated by GM and Toyota.
The CEO also announced that Gigafactory Berlin achieved the production of “almost” 1,000 Model Y vehicles in a week for the first time last week.
Tesla originally aimed for Gigafactory Berlin to achieve a production of 1,000 vehicles per week in April, but we reported that the factory was nowhere near that at the time.
Musk also said that “Austin is spooling up” – referring to Gigafactory Texas.
He didn’t disclose the production rate at the factory, but he said during a company-wide meeting earlier this week that Gigafactory Texas was still limited due to 4680 cell and structural battery pack production.
Here’s the email in full:
Production and Delivery
This has been a very tough quarter, primarily due to supply chain and production challenges in China, so we need to rally hard to recover! 
I’d like to congratulate the Fremont team for achieving a new all-time record production day last week and Berlin for making almost 1000 cars last week! This is great stuff. 
Shanghai is returning to full strength and Austin is spooling up. Onward to victory!

2022/06/11,"Tesla is now producing more cars at its Fremont factory than when it was the NUMMI factory operated in partnership by GM and Toyota. And it’s only the beginning. CEO Elon Musk says it could grow production by about 50%.
New United Motor Manufacturing, better known as NUMMI, has a long history – and not always a good one.
Before it was NUMMI, it was a car assembly plant established in Fremont, California, by General Motors way back in 1962. Interestingly, workers at the factory were “considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States” by the workers’ own union representative. Employees were drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana on the job. There was a real disconnect between workers and management – such that any disciplinary attempt was met by strikes or even “sabotage” on the assembly line, like putting soda bottles inside the door panels to create rattles.
In the early 1980s, it got so out of control that “near chaos” reigned at the factory.
In 1982, GM closed the factory altogether, but it quickly reopened in 1984 through a partnership with Toyota and became NUMMI. Toyota implemented its own production system and continuous improvement processes – resulting in significant improvements in quality and output.
Between 1984 and 2010, NUMMI produced over 8 million vehicles and peaked at a production of 428,633 vehicles in 2006. However, Toyota had many other factories in the US by 2010, and NUMMI was the only one with a unionized workforce.
GM and Toyota ended up closing the factory and selling it to Tesla in 2010.
The factory showed its age, and it wasn’t the most efficient as it was Frankensteined together as it grew over the years.
But Tesla couldn’t pass on the deal because of the terms, which consisted of Toyota investing $50 million in Tesla and the latter giving back $42 million to the former for the factory. Tesla basically ended up with a factory and $8 million to invest in it.
It wasn’t easy. After years of headaches, sweat, and literally unfortunately some blood, Tesla eventually managed to ramp up production of electric vehicles at the factory, where it produces its entire lineup: Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X.
Earlier this year, Tesla Fremont Factory even became the most productive car factory in the US.
Earlier this week, Elon Musk held a companywide meeting at the factory, and Electrek obtained a recording.
During the meeting, Musk acknowledged the milestone of becoming the largest factory in North America per volume of production:
We are now the biggest car factory in North America. That’s pretty sick. Sometimes people are surprised, like “Tesla is making cars in the Bay Area?” Yeah not only we do, but we have the biggest car factory in North America.
He added that the Tesla Fremont factory has also exceeded the production from the Toyota and GM days:
We also recently exceeded the number of cars produced from when it was a Toyota/GM factory, and I think we even have the potential to beat that number by 50%.
The CEO has mentioned on several occasions lately that he believes there is still room to grow at the factory, which is already extremely busy with around 10,000 employees and running out of space.
Musk expects that efficiency to improve at the factory once Tesla moves current vehicle production to 4680 battery cells and structural battery packs, but that is still at least a year or two away. He specified that the automaker needs to achieve volume production at Gigafactory Texas first.

2022/06/10,"Tesla (TSLA) announced today that it is going to put a three-for-one stock split to a shareholder vote at its upcoming annual meeting.
The company announced its intentions to do another stock split back in March, but it didn’t reveal the details.
Today, as part of the release of its prospectus for its 2022 annual shareholder meeting, Tesla announced that it is going with a three-for-one stock split – meaning that if you own one Tesla share, you will get two more.
The automaker is asking shareholders to approve increasing its common stock to 6,000,000,000 shares in order to enable the stock split:
The primary purpose of the Authorized Shares Amendment is to facilitate a 3-for-1 split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend (the “Stock Split”). As of June 6, 2022, we have 1,036,390,569 shares of common stock outstanding, and the current number of authorized shares of our common stock is 2,000,000,000, which is insufficient to effectuate the Stock Split. Our Board intends to approve the Stock Split, subject to and contingent upon stockholder approval of the Authorized Shares Amendment.
As a reason for the stock split, Tesla notes that its stock price increased by 43% since the last stock split and lowering the price per share will help accessibility with employee stock options and retail investors.
The company wrote in the prospectus:
Our success depends on attracting and retaining excellent talent, not only through providing a respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace, but also through offering outstanding benefits and highly competitive compensation packages. Unlike other manufacturers, we offer every employee the option of receiving equity. Since our stock split in August 2020 to June 6, 2022, our stock price has risen 43.5%. While this value appreciation has led to our employees benefiting enormously through the years, we want to make sure all employees, no matter when they join, have access to the same advantages. We believe the Stock Split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity, all of which, in our view, may help maximize stockholder value. In addition, as retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in our stock, we believe the Stock Split will also make our common stock more accessible to our retail shareholders.
Tesla’s last stock split dates back just a few years ago in 2020. At the time, Tesla’s stock was trading at around $1,300 a share, but the stock-split announcement sent its stock price surging to a record high of $2,000 a share.
The split resulted in the price per share being reset at around $460 and a valuation of about $430 billion.
Today, Tesla’s stock trades at around $700 per share and a market capitalization of $720 billion. If the stock were to trade at the same level by the time the stock split goes through, Tesla’s stock would be trading at ~$233 per share.

2022/06/10,"Tesla announced that it has deployed its 35,000th Supercharger stall today at a new station in Wuhan, China.
Tesla is currently growing its Supercharger network at an impressive rate. The automaker went from 23,277 Superchargers at 2,564 stations at the end of 2020, to 31,498 Superchargers at 3,476 stations at the end of 2021. That’s growing at a 35% year-over-year pace.
However, it is lagging behind vehicle deliveries, which grew 87% during the same period of time – on top of now gradually starting to allow non-Tesla EV owners to use the network. It also lags behind Tesla’s own goal to triple the Supercharger network in two years, but the automaker is nonetheless deploying new and larger stations at an impressive rate.
Today, Tesla announced its Supercharger network hit a new milestone by deploying its 35,000th Supercharger in the world:
We achieved a new milestone.🙌🏼The 35,000th Supercharger landed in Wuhan, China today.📍Tesla, owns the largest fast-charging network in the world.⚡ pic.twitter.com/yayJsUOgZp
The automaker also noted that it deployed 5,000 Superchargers over the last six months.
As Tesla also noted, it operates the largest fast-charging network in the world, and it remains an important advantage for the automaker, but it is in a transition phase. The company is starting to open up the network to non-Tesla electric vehicles – increasing the charging options for all electric vehicles.
As it does that, Tesla has to accelerate deployment in order to support both its own growing fleet of customer vehicles and other EVs looking to use the Supercharger network.
We expect that Tesla is going to continue accelerating its Supercharger station deployment in the coming months, especially with its new pre-fab method that can deploy a new station in days. It greatly simplifies the installation process, which is just one part of the complex process involved in deploying new charging stations. It includes finding an appropriate location, making a deal with the property owner, getting approval from the local electric utility, building the station, and lining up an installer.

2022/06/10,"Early experiences with the new Tesla Model Y with 4680 cells and a structural battery pack are showing some impressive potential for faster charging and better energy density.
When Tesla delivered its first made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles, we noted that it was strange that Tesla didn’t reveal any details – like specs and pricing – about the new version of the electric SUV.
We learned a little more over the next few weeks. The new Texas-built Model Y Standard starts at $59,990, has a range of 279 miles, goes 0-60 mph acceleration in five seconds, and is equipped with a few new features, including a magnetic center console armrest and a parcel shelf. But we are more interested in the impact of the new battery cell and structural battery pack.
Unfortunately, no one has been able to confirm the exact energy capacity of the new Model Y, but we have a much better idea now that some early Texas-built Model Y owners are performing some tests.
One of those early owners, going by Spoken reviews on Youtube, took the Model Y for a range test and charging on a Supercharger V3:
When it comes to the energy capacity, the vehicle accepted 59 kWh going from 9% state of charge to 97%. It’s hard to produce a perfect representation of the energy capacity of the vehicle, but it would put the usable capacity around 67 kWh.
As for the charging capacity, the new Model Y owner shared the details of his charging session:
Going to 80% in roughly 30 minutes is excellent.
Some Tesla fans were disappointed by the fact that the vehicle peaked at 227 kW instead of the 250 kW that the Model Y with the 2170 cells can achieve, but we need to keep in mind that this battery pack has a much smaller energy capacity. When breaking it down, the 4680 battery cell actually appears to have at least a 10% higher peak C rate and average C rate.
I’d note that there could be room for improvements. After first launching the Model 3 and Model Y with the then-new 2170 cells, Tesla pushed several software updates over time that enabled higher charge rates. Now without further improvements, it is certainly not revolutionary in terms of improvements, but it is a good incremental improvement.
What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/06/10,"Tesla has reportedly secured a multibillion-dollar deal with Samsung to get new cameras for its self-driving sensor suite.
Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) program relies on cameras to get imagery to feed its neural nets.
Unlike most other self-driving programs, the automaker doesn’t use radar and lidar. However, we recently reported on Tesla’s filing with the FCC to use a new radar.
But for now, Tesla relies on cameras, specifically a suite of eight cameras in the current version of its Autopilot sensors.
Now The Korea Economic Daily reports that Samsung has a won a contract estimated to be worth between 4 trillion won and 5 trillion won ($3.2 billion-$4 billion) to supply Tesla with new cameras:
Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co., the electronic components unit of Samsung Group, has won a multi-billion-dollar deal to supply camera modules to Tesla Inc. for most of the US company’s electric vehicles.
The publication reported on the specific cameras to be supplied to Tesla:
The components to be supplied this time will be Samsung’s version 4.0 camera modules with 5 million pixels, which show five times clearer images than the company’s previous 3.0 modules.
This would be a major upgrade over the cameras used in Tesla’s current Autopilot sensor suite, which are believed to only have a resolution of about 1.2 megapixels.
Sources told the economic publications that the cameras will be used in all Tesla vehicles for the next few years.
Over the next few years, Samsung will be supplying its latest camera modules to be installed on Tesla’s Model 3 sedan, Model S sedan, Model X SUV and Model Y crossover as well as electric trucks such as the Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi, the sources said.
Interestingly, Samsung reportedly won another contract to supply cameras for Tesla specifically for the Cybertruck last year.
The Korean electronics giant is expected to start mass production of the new cameras as soon as next month.
Last year, Tesla started a retrofit program for cameras on older vehicles with “Full Self-Driving.”

2022/06/09,"At a company-wide meeting yesterday, Tesla employees asked Elon Musk what to do with the Twitter drama around his attempt to acquire the social media platform. The CEO says “ignore” it.
Elon Musk’s attempt to buy Twitter and take it private doesn’t have much to do with Tesla at first glance, but it has been affecting the company in some ways.
First off, Musk sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares to finance the acquisition, which has negatively affected the stock. In turn, that affects Tesla employee morale since it affects stock options, which can be a significant part of their compensation.
On another level, there have been a lot of controversies around the acquisition that are affecting Tesla employees on a political level. Musk has made it clear that he wants to change Twitter into something closer to a true free speech platform.
That shouldn’t be political by itself, but the right believes that Twitter has a leftist bias that has pushed the platform to ban or suppress several prominent conservative figures, despite some studies discrediting the theory. Musk has aligned himself with that theory and said that he would allow back some of those conservative figures if the acquisition goes through.
This position has created a lot of drama, especially on the left of the political spectrum, and it is also impacting Tesla employees. One of those employees asked Musk during an all-hands meeting at Tesla yesterday “how the Twitter drama affects people at Tesla and what … can you do to shield them from it”.
The CEO thought about it for a second and said to ignore Twitter:
Well, you know. Ignore Twitter. Ignore. Ignore.
Musk then went on his pitch for buying the social media company and trying to turn it into a free-speech platform. Interestingly, he mentioned during the pitch that he is aiming for about 80% of Americans to be on the platform:
In the case of Twitter, it’s about how can we assure that there’s a digital town square that is inclusive and as trusted as possible and where ideally, I don’t know, 80% of Americans are on it. They can speak their minds with reasonable freedom.
That would be a massive jump from the roughly ~25% of adults in the United States reportedly using the platform.
Musk’s acquisition has yet to go to a shareholder’s vote and the Tesla CEO has threatened to kill the deal if he is not presented with data that shows what percentage of Twitter’s user base consists of bots.
Today, the company finally agreed to send Musk the data. Now it’s a waiting game to see what Musk thinks of the data and if the acquisition will go through.

2022/06/09,"NHTSA announced today that its investigation into Tesla Autopilot has been upgraded to a step closer to a possible recall.
Last year, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that it is launching an investigation into Tesla Autopilot after identifying 11 crashes involving first responder vehicles.
Today, NHTSA announced that it is upgrading the investigation to an Engineering Analysis (EA):
PE21-020 is upgraded to an Engineering Analysis (EA) to extend the existing crash analysis, evaluate additional data sets, perform vehicle evaluations, and to explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver’s supervision. In doing so, NHTSA plans to continue its assessment of vehicle control authority, driver engagement technologies, and related human factors considerations.
This is often described as moving a step closer to asking for a recall, which could be a significant problem for Tesla, but we are not quite there yet.
On top of the upgrade to the investigation, NHTSA also identified five other crashes that it believes could be related to this issue with Autopilot under investigation:
It’s far from the first time that Tesla’s Autopilot system is under investigation by NHTSA, but it has yet to lead to any recall. Several accidents linked to Autopilot were found to be due to driver inattention. This is not necessarily a defect with the manufacturer, but the manufacturer – in this case Tesla – has a “driver engagement strategy,” and if that’s determined to be inefficient, it could also be a problem.
NHTSA wrote in its report about the upgraded investigation today:
With respect to driver behavior, during this PE, NHTSA examined information submitted by Tesla and peer manufacturers in response to an IR question that requested driver engagement and attentiveness strategies to the DDT during system operation designated as Level 2. Of those crashes involving first responder or roadside maintenance vehicles for which car log data existed, under the driver engagement strategy alerts were presented to only two of the drivers within 5 minutes of the crash. This suggests that drivers may be compliant with the driver engagement strategy as designed.
There’s no timeline for the investigation to come to its final findings.

2022/06/09,"Tesla is launching an effort to ‘revolutionize’ service and aiming to be 10 times better than the competition. CEO Elon Musk elaborates on the effort during a company-wide meeting.
Earlier this week, we reported on Musk’s announcement that Tesla is working on service in North America and how Telsa is aiming to make the majority of appointments same-day repairs. As we noted, it is much needed since Tesla’s customer fleet is growing at a much faster pace than its service infrastructure. However, Musk didn’t elaborate on how Tesla plans to achieve that.
During a company-wide meeting last night, Musk elaborated after being asked by an employee:
I think we still have a relatively conventional approach to servicing – although we kind of use the vehicle app. So we definitely have better servicing than the rest of the industry, but I really want Tesla to look at how we can revolutionize service and I don’t know, make it 10 times better than the rest of the industry.
The CEO said that the goal to get to two-third thirds of appointments being same-day repairs is part of that mission. He said that Tesla looked at the data of all the different repairs, and he believes that most of them can be done on the same day as long as parts are available at the service centers.
Part availability has been a weakness for Tesla’s service, but Musk said that better part inventory at the service centers is part of the plan.
Musk elaborated on other initiatives to improve service during the meeting:
We definitely want to increase the number of people who actually repair cars. When looking at the total head count at a service center, the ratio of people fixing cars to everyone else doesn’t make a ton of sense. I think there should be a higher percentage of people fixing cars.
The CEO also added that Tesla is moving to a model where the service centers are going to be bigger with more “specialization.” He explained:
Kind of like we have in the factory, we are going to have say one service bay for 12-volt battery changes, another bay for fixing the computer, another one is drivetrain replacement – like more specialize like at the factory.”
While the previous announcement was more about North American service, Musk added during the meeting that the changes are eventually going global.

2022/06/09,"Elon Musk revealed more details about what his Tesla Master Plan Part 3 will be about during a new companywide meeting with employees last night.
Part One and Two of Musk’s “master plan” for Tesla have been important pieces of literature at the company that, in many ways, laid the path to its success.
Back in March 2022, six years after part 2, Musk announced that he is working on a Tesla Master Plan Part 3.
Three months later, he has yet to release the plan and during a companywide meeting held last night, with details obtained by Electrek, Musk was asked by an employee what the new plan is going to be about. The CEO responded:
Master Plan Part 3 is all about achieving very large scale. In order to shift the entire energy infrastructure and transport infrastructure of earth, there has to be a very high scale. We have to ask what is the actual tonnage? If we work backward from let’s say about 300 TWh of installed capacity in vehicles and stationary (battery packs) then how do you achieve that tonnage from a mining and refining standpoint, but also do so in a sustainable way.
Musk then summarized:
That’s what Master Plan Part 3 is: How do you get to enough scale to actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth?
You can say a lot about Elon Musk but you can’t say the man is not ambitious. 
Tesla has lately been ramping up its partnerships with mining companies in order to secure long-term supply of critical minerals for battery production like nickel and lithium. 
The company has even talked about getting directly involved into the mining and refining business. With the completion and current buildout of Texas and Berlin Gigafactories added to Fremont and Shanghai, Tesla now has the blueprint for building Giga-scale factories fast and efficiently.
On August 2, 2006, Musk published a blog post titled “The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me).”
The post is worth a read, but it ends in a summary with the core principle being laid out in four steps:
It didn’t happen smoothly, but Tesla managed that for the most part with the Roadster, Model S, and then Model 3.
In 2016, Musk followed up with the “Tesla Master Plan Part 2.”
Part 2 came as Tesla was delivering the Model 3 and acquiring Solar City, which are basically the last two steps of the original plans.
In Part 2, Musk emphasized the integration of energy storage with renewable energy generation under the new “Tesla Energy” division. The creation of the solar roof was also announced in the plan.
The updated plan was also focused on self-driving capabilities, which became a priority at Tesla.
Musk summarized the Master Plan Part 2 at the end:
Among the other segments mentioned in the plan, Musk mentioned “a new kind of pickup,” which ended up being the Cybertruck; a compact SUV, the Model Y; a “heavy-duty truck, which became the Tesla Semi; and finally “high passenger-density urban transport.”
Every vehicle announced in the plan was unveiled, though they now need to be brought to production, except for the “high passenger-density urban transport.” It was rumored through a partnership with The Boring Company, but we have never seen anything official from Tesla.

2022/06/08,"Elon Musk told Tesla employees to expect a “nutty” end-of-quarter delivery wave this quarter at a new company-wide meeting.
The automaker has been trying to move away from quarterly delivery waves, but special circumstances made one inevitable at the end of this quarter.
Tesla has been known to have intense end-of-quarter delivery pushes due to its distribution system, which is very different from other automakers that use third-party dealerships.
Since Tesla sells directly to customers, the automaker owns the vehicle until it is fully delivered to the buyer and paid for.
It results in transit times being extremely important for Tesla financially since the automaker takes on the cost of building those cars and doesn’t get any money until the customers can actually pick them up.
Therefore, when Tesla has a lot of vehicles in transit at the end of a quarter, the quarter looks bad for them financially.
It’s why Tesla tries to build vehicles for exportations at its Fremont factory and Gigafactory Shanghai early in the quarter and vehicles for local deliveries later in order to allow for transit time by the end of the quarter.
However, this strategy results in Tesla’s sales and delivery team having to handle significant volumes of vehicles to deliver toward the end of each quarter, which are called “delivery waves” or “delivery pushes.”
This both increases costs as Tesla does everything logically to get the cars to customers and negatively affects the delivery experience for the customers who are often rushed to take delivery.
At the end of last year, CEO Elon Musk told employees to worry more about cost than delivery waves.
However, he told Tesla workers to expect a significant delivery wave this quarter during tonight’s company-wide meeting.
During the meeting, Musk was asked by an employee when delivery cycles will level off to avoid the “insane end-of-quarter delivery push”.
The CEO responded:
“This has been a challenge since late 2008. There always seems to be something that happens and causes the end of the quarter to be nutty and this quarter will not be an exception – mostly because we had this huge challenge with the COVID restrictions in Shanghai. It basically shut down the Shanghai factory for much of the early part of the quarter. It is only now getting back to full production. It will be pretty intense this quarter.”
Musk tried to reassure employees that “unless something happens,” Tesla should have a “much smaller wave” next quarter and it should get gradually better as Gigafactory Berlin ramps up production and frees up capacity from Gigafactory Shanghai, which is currently exporting a lot of vehicles to Europe.
The CEO previously said that will probably not break another delivery record because of the production shutdown, but he hinted that Tesla could possibly still deliver close to 300,000 vehicles.

2022/06/08,"Tesla is planning to get Gigafactory Shanghai out of its ‘closed loop’ system with workers sleeping at the factory by the end of the week.
Like many other companies, Tesla had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory last month after local authorities imposed serious lockdowns on the population in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 after a surge in cases during the first quarter. The automaker was finally able to restart production on April 19 after 22 days of being shut down.
Tesla brought back 8,000 people to work in a “closed-loop” shift, where people slept at the factory to help reduce worker movements in the city. At the time, we noted that on top of missing 22 days of production, it would take time for Tesla to ramp production back up to pre-lockdown levels.
Last month, we learned that Tesla was actually making a lot of progress and aimed to ramp production back to 2,600 vehicles per day by May 16. However, we noted at the time that it appeared to be an ambitious goal that is going to be difficult to achieve.
Sure enough, Tesla confirmed supplier issues in May that some reports suggested resulted in production stalling to just 200 units a day. In a new memo in late May, Tesla said that it is sticking to one shift for now and doesn’t plan to ramp up to 2,600 units until at least May 23. The automaker ended up achieving that during the last week of May.
Now we learn that Tesla employees can finally go back to a resemblance of a normal life by commuting to work again.
South China Morning Post reported: 
Tesla plans to exit the so-called “closed loop” system at its Shanghai factory on Saturday after nearly eight weeks, said two executives with the electric carmaker’s suppliers.
Some employees have been living at the plant since April 19, making great sacrifices in allowing Tesla to continue operations at the factory.
Now Tesla is looking to double the output of the factory compared to pre-shutdown numbers.

2022/06/08,"Tesla has filed to use a new radar in its electric vehicles, and everyone is confused since Elon Musk has made it clear that Tesla plans to achieve self-driving with camera-based vision only.
After years of using a suite of sensors that included both cameras and a radar, Tesla announced a transition to its “Tesla Vision” system without radar and only using cameras and neural nets.
The idea is based on the fact that the current road system is designed to work for human drivers who operate vehicles using their vision (eyes) and their brain (neural nets). Tesla believes that it can build a system safer than human drivers by replacing eyes with cameras and the brain by its silicon-powered neural nets.
Musk told Electrek in June of last year after Tesla stopped using its radar:
The probability of safety will be higher with pure vision than vision+radar, not lower. Vision has become so good that radar actually reduces signal/noise.
However, the CEO also added that Tesla might still use radar if it had a “very high resolution radar”:
A very high resolution radar would be better than pure vision, but such a radar does not exist. I mean vision with high res radar would be better than pure vision.
We saw some indications of Tesla working on that. We previously reported on Tesla looking to add a new “4D” imaging radar with twice the range of its previous radar.
Now the automaker has actually filed with the FCC to use a new radar in its vehicles:
lol is tesla already bringing radar back?https://t.co/v870eDeQOL pic.twitter.com/QGpqoPyPa5
Tesla hacker Green, who has followed Tesla’s test of new radar, has noted that the radar uses a frequency in line with Tesla’s previous front-facing radar, which would point to a similar use.
The move has some Tesla owners who bought Tesla’s Full Self-Driving worried that their vision-based system is now not going to be enough if Tesla decides to add new hardware.
Since 2016, Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles produced are equipped with all the hardware necessary to achieve self-driving capability in the future through software updates.
It turned out to be not true as Tesla needed to upgrade the onboard computer. Now they are also concerned about some of the older cameras inside the vehicles, and as we learn today, a new radar might be added to the list.

2022/06/08,"A BYD executive revealed that the Chinese company is about to start supplying Tesla with battery cells.
In a new interview on a state-owned media channel in China this week, Lian Yubo, executive vice president and president of BYD’s automotive engineering research institute, was asked if he sees Tesla as competition.
He responded (via cnevpost):
Tesla is a very successful company no matter what, BYD respects Tesla and we admire Tesla. We are good friends with Elon Musk, and we will soon supply him with batteries. We are friends.
The comment comes after there were rumors that Tesla was testing BYD’s new “blade batteries” for a potential supply partnership last year.
In 2020, BYD, a China-based electric vehicle and battery company, introduced its new bladed battery cell.
The new cells use LFP chemistry, but the new form factor, which looks like a blade, is the real innovation enabling a safer cell and higher energy density at the pack level, according to the company.
BYD wrote in a press release:
While undergoing nail penetration tests, the Blade Battery emitted neither smoke nor fire after being penetrated, and its surface temperature only reached 30 to 60°C. Under the same conditions, a ternary lithium battery exceeded 500°C and violently burned, and while a conventional lithium iron phosphate block battery did not openly emit flames or smoke, its surface temperature reached dangerous temperatures of 200 to 400°C. This implies that EVs equipped with the Blade Battery would be far less susceptible to catching fire – even when they are severely damaged.
While this feature obviously offers great safety advantages, it also delivers thermal management improvements, and BYD claims the form factor enables energy density improvements by eliminating the need for modules.
It goes directly from cell to pack, not unlike Tesla’s structural battery pack technology.
When the report came out last year about Tesla testing the new cell from BYD, it stated that Tesla already had the cells in test vehicles and that it could start deliveries for production in the second quarter of 2022.
This is surprising and not surprising at the same time. 
Elon Musk has made fun of BYD in the past and it would be strange to see Tesla partner with them, but at the same time, the CEO said that Tesla would be buying any viable battery cell it can get its hands on.
Now the form factor is also radically different than the cylindrical battery cells that Tesla uses, but the automaker has also already moved to different cell formats for the vehicles it is building with LFP cells.
So this could really be happening, especially now that a high-level BYD executive is confirming it.

2022/06/07,"Tesla’s futuristic diner with drive-in theater and Supercharger station is finally becoming a reality, and we get a look at what could look like thanks to renders based on the construction plans.
This project has been in the work for a long time.
In 2018, Elon Musk said that Tesla plans to open an “old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in Los Angeles.” It was yet another, “Is he joking?” kind of Elon Musk idea, but he apparently wasn’t kidding.
A few months later, Tesla actually applied for building permits for “a restaurant and Supercharger station” at a location in Santa Monica. However, the project has since stalled, apparently due to local regulations. Nevertheless, Tesla still moved forward with a Supercharger at the location, but it had to move the diner project to Hollywood earlier this year.
Last month, Tesla filed the construction plans with the city – giving us the first look at what the automaker intends to build.
We learned from the plans that it will be a semi-circular two-story diner with 29 Supercharger stalls and two movie theater screens, but everything is from architectural plans.
Ed Howard, an expert in architectural models, built renders based on those plans to give us a better idea of what the Tesla diner could look like:
Tesla Diner, Drive-in theater and Supercharger station final renderings. 20 Easter eggs to be found – if you know Elon's world. To see hi-res images, after clicking an image, right click in bigger image, open in new tab(pc). pic4 is cheat sheet.#Tesla #SpaceX #boring #ElonMusk pic.twitter.com/7QsN7faJQ9
Obviously he took some liberties for things that weren’t in the plans, like the name of the diner, Milliways, the restaurant at the end of the universe from Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
But for the most part, that’s what the building and layout should look like:
It looks like the right mix of retro-looking, which was the original plan, and a more futuristic design, which was the new plan once it got moved to Hollywood. The renders are accurate down to the bamboo walls that are going to separate the Tesla diner’s lot from the rest of the block.
We don’t have a solid timeline on when Tesla plans to open the diner, and it is going to be dependent on permit approvals, but things are moving forward.

2022/06/07,"A Tesla Cybertruck prototype with an updated windshield wiper and new look inside has made a rare new appearance at an official event to launch the Tesla Megapack project at Moss Landing,  California. 
Moss Landing is the site of several major energy storage projects including a giant 730 MWh Tesla Megapack project for PG&E – making it one of the largest battery energy storage projects in the world.
As we previously reported, it was turned on for the first time back in April.
While it was first activated a few months ago, the commissioning ceremony was officially held yesterday:
Happening Now: Commissioning our Elkhorn Battery System in Moss Landing w/ @Tesla @CalEnergy @California_ISO. A key milestone in making clean energy available on demand to support California’s electric grid reliability. pic.twitter.com/IUKVd0iVgb
As you can see, a Tesla Cybertruck prototype made a rare appearance at the event. 
Here’s a quick video of the electric pickup truck prototype arriving at the event:
A post shared by @never.enough.cars
One of the first things that we noticed is that this prototype is equipped with a much smaller windshield wiper than the previous prototype spotted in the wild.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk had previously said that the giant wiper wasn’t what will make it to the production version.
Local news KSBW also managed to get some rare pictures of the interior of the Cybertruck prototype during the outing:
We can see that the prototype is not completed with the airbag seemingly having been removed from the steering wheel and the front-facing camera enclosure being removed.
But we do get rare looks at the instrument cluster screen and the center console.
The Cybertruck was unveiled back in 2019. The electric pickup truck was already supposed to be in production, but the automaker delayed the program as it focused on growing Model Y production.
Now, the company is planning for the production of the Tesla Cybertruck to start in 2023, and we recently saw some progress toward that actually happening with Idra preparing to deliver a new giant Giga press designed to produce the Cybertruck’s body.

2022/06/06,"Elon Musk says that Tesla is working on its service in North America and aiming for the majority of appointments to be same-day repairs.
Tesla has been growing at an incredible pace over the last few years.
Car deliveries grew 68% from 184,877 vehicles in Q1 2021 to 310,048 vehicles in Q1 2022 – the last quarter reported.
The growth in deliveries is so fast that Tesla’s infrastructure growth is not keeping up.
For example, Tesla grew the Supercharger network 37% during the same period, its store and service locations grew 20%, and its mobile service fleet grew 35%.
Those are all impressive growth rates on their own for a company as big as Tesla, but it doesn’t keep up with new deliveries adding to its customer fleet.
On the service side, the growing fleet is putting a lot of pressure on the service capacity, which sometimes lacks in accessibility, meaning that service centers can be far for owners, and the delay to get an appointment can be days to weeks depending on the location.
When asked about the situation, CEO Elon Musk often gives his line about “no service is best service” and says that Tesla is improving reliability in order to need service less often, which would in turn free up capacity for when needed.
However, Tesla still ends up needing to readjust its service capacity every few years. In 2019, Musk admitted a “foolish oversight” of Tesla’s service coverage and made several statements about expanding service.
Tesla opened a record number of service stations the next year.
Now it sounds like Tesla is readjusting again as Musk announced on Twitter this weekend that he is working on Tesla service in North America:
Working on Tesla North American service. Goal is 2/3 of cars receive same-day service, no wait.
He said that the goal is for two-thirds of cars to have access to same-day service – though it’s not clear if he means being able to get a same-day appointment or same-day repair.
Either way, it would be an improvement in most cases.
Tesla currently operates over 673 stores and service centers and a fleet of 1,372 mobile service vehicles to service over 2 million electric vehicles – and growing fast.

2022/06/03,"Tesla is finally preparing to honor its referral program prize and launch photos of owners who won into space.
Back in 2018, Tesla had a referral program to help sell vehicles where owners could share a referral code with new buyers who would receive Supercharging credits. In exchange, referrers would get prizes based on how many people they referred.
One of the prizes was launching a picture into deep space:
Launch Your Photo into Deep Space Orbit We’ll laser-etch any image onto glass and send it into deep space orbit for millions of years. Refer more friends while you wait for an alien race to discover your payload.
Just last week I reported that Tesla had yet to deliver on the prize – four years after the program ended.
Now Tesla is finally planning to deliver on its promise and has started reaching out via email to some owners who won the prize. Tesla is asking them to upload the photo that they want to be launched into space:
Our records show that you earned the chance to launch a photo into space under a previous Tesla Referral Program. After much anticipation, we are excited to begin your photo’s journey to space. To participate, please submit your photo before June 30, 2022. Each referrer may submit one photo – choose wisely.
The automaker said that it will have more information closer to the launch date, which hasn’t been announced yet.
Tesla is expected to hitch a ride on an existing SpaceX mission to fulfill its obligations from the referral program. Since only a single referral was required to get the price, it’s likely that Tesla is going to have to send thousands of pictures to space.
Don’t panic if you have won the prize but haven’t received the email yet. I am in the same boat. I’ve also heard the same thing from other people, so I think it is being sent out in waves.
I have no idea what picture to send. What would you send into space? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/06/03,"Elon Musk has clarified that Tesla laying off 10% of its workforce only applies to “salaried employees,” and that the automaker is still hiring hourly workers.
Earlier today, we reported on Elon Musk telling Tesla executives in an email that they need to cut 10% of the workforce and pause hiring due to having a “super bad feeling” about the economy. Now, the CEO has decided to clarify the Tesla layoffs in an email to all employees.
Musk clarified that the 10% reduction in headcount only applies to “salaried employees”:
Tesla will be reducing salaried headcount by 10% as we have become overstaffed in many areas.
The automaker plans to still hire hourly employees, which mainly consists of service and sales workers, factory workers, and people installing solar and home battery packs.
Musk added in the email:
Note, this does not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar. Hourly headcount will increase.
Tesla has now over 100,000 employees worldwide, and it had over 5,000 open positions prior to the layoff announcement. Many of the open roles are at Tesla’s growing factories, especially Gigafactory Berlin and Texas.
Here’s the email in full:
Headcount Reduction
Tesla will be reducing salaried headcount by 10% as we have become overstaffed in many areas.
Note, this does not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar. Hourly headcount will increase.

This new email is more aligned with what we discussed this morning, specifically that Tesla has hired many people during the pandemic, and that is creating some problems right now.
Firstly, it literally cannot support having all those people at its offices, which might be why Musk announced the stop of remote work. It will facilitate layoffs – some people will just quit.
Secondly, when you hire 15,000-20,000 people over a year, you will inevitably have inefficiencies and a round of layoffs to balance things out, which is not out of the ordinary after such mass hiring.
Of course, Musk also stated to execs that he is worried about the economy, which led to Tesla’s stock falling more than 8% this morning. He didn’t mention that in the email for all employees, which he knew would leak.
Instead, he says that it is due to Tesla being “overstaffed in many areas,” which as I discuss above is likely true, but both can be true at once.

2022/06/03,"Tesla has to respond to an inquiry from NHTSA regarding the increasing number of phantom braking complaints that it has been receiving.
Back in November of 2021, Electrek released a report called “Tesla has a serious phantom braking problem in Autopilot.” It highlighted a significant increase in Tesla owners reporting dangerous phantom braking events on Autopilot.
Phantom braking is a term used to describe when an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) – or a self-driving system – applies the brakes for no good reason. The system can be falsely detecting an object on the road or anticipating a collision that won’t actually happen and apply the brake to try to avoid it.
Obviously, phantom braking is something you want to avoid since it can create accidents if someone is following too closely behind you.
This issue is not new in Tesla’s Autopilot, but our report focused on Tesla drivers noticing an obvious increase in instances based on anecdotal evidence, but it was also backed by a clear increase in complaints to the NHTSA.
Our report made the rounds in a few other outlets, but it didn’t really go mainstream until now. However, the Washington Post ended up picking the story up with a very similar report in February that was more widely distributed.
At the time, NHTSA commented on the report saying that they were looking into the issue and talking to Tesla about it. A few weeks later, its Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) confirmed that it opened an investigation into the matter.
In a letter dated last month but recently published, NHTSA has asked a series of questions regarding the 758 phantom braking complaints it received and Tesla has to respond by June 20th:
Tesla’s response to this letter, in duplicate, together with a copy of any confidentiality request, must be submitted to this office by June 20, 2022. Tesla’s response must include all nonconfidential attachments and a redacted version of all documents that contain confidential information.
NHTSA is asking for a wide range of documents related to Tesla’s testing of Autopilot, hardware, and software changes that could have resulted in the increased number of complaints, and much more.
The investigation focuses on 2021-22 Model 3 and Model Y, but as we previously reported, owners of older Model 3 and Model Y vehicles have also been reporting an increased number of phantom braking events, especially after the software update to vision-only Autopilot in May 2021.
I am glad that Tesla is finally getting some pressure on the issue. I know that the idea is that when there’s a safety issue, “Tesla is always first to address it” before any outside investigation, but in this case, if it is addressing, it is not saying anything about it and it is not showing in the updates.
I love Autopilot, especially Navigate on Autopilot. I think it makes my long-distance traveling much more enjoyable and for the most part safer, except for the phantom braking events.
If it can be successfully addressed, it would be a major improvement to Autopilot.

2022/06/03,"Elon Musk has reportedly asked Tesla executives to “pause all hiring worldwide” and cut about 10% of the staff due to what he called a “super bad feeling about the economy.”
Earlier this week, we reported on Elon Musk asking all Tesla employees to come back to the office or quit.
Many people suspected that this was a wave of layoffs in disguise since Musk had to know a certain percentage of remote workers wouldn’t want to come back to the office.
Now he apparently confirmed it in an email to Tesla executives obtained by Reuters:
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a “super bad feeling” about the economy and wants to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric carmaker, he said in an email to executives seen by Reuters.
This would be a significant move for Tesla, a company with more than 100,000 employees, which would mean letting go of about 10,000 of them.
The email was also reportedly titled “pause all hiring worldwide.” Tesla pausing hiring would slow down its growth as the company had about 5,000 open positions around the world at the time Musk sent the email.
The CEO had recently made comments about how he believes the US is going to be in a recession for the next 18 months. Musk also said that he believes that “it is a good thing” and that “some bankruptcies need to happen.”
Tesla itself is expected to have a tough second quarter due to the Gigafactory Shanghai month-long shutdown. The automaker is expected to break its streak of record quarters for deliveries.
When Musk sent the email asking employees to come back to work, we suspected that there was a ulterior motive.
Several Tesla employees reached out to point out that Tesla grew significantly during the pandemic when many employees worked remotely. The company didn’t invest in the office and parking spaces to accommodate those new employees. We’ve been told by current and former employees that there aren’t even enough desks for all remote workers to use. 
Therefore, Musk not only knew that some employees would quit based on the requirement to come back to the office for “at least 40 hours per week,” but he also knew that it would be impossible for all of them to even come to work.
That said, Tesla is growing so fast that there are always some inefficiencies in mass hiring that slip through the cracks. A round of layoffs is not uncommon after a long phase of mass hiring. 
On the other side, Tesla pausing hiring worldwide is a more critical move and would point to other concerns. Like Musk reportedly wrote in the email, he is apparently worried about the economy and appears to want Tesla to be leaner in order to withstand a bigger economic downturn if it comes.

2022/06/02,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla might have a working prototype of Tesla Bot, also known as Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot, by September 30, the end of the third quarter of 2022.
Last month, Musk announced “Tesla AI Day #2” with “many cool updates” on August 19.
The original “Tesla AI Day” held last year was an event focused on the company’s self-driving program. The automaker also unveiled its Dojo supercomputer and announced plans for the “Tesla Bot” humanoid robot – now known as Tesla Optimus.
The AI Day #2 was supposed to be held a year to the day after the first one, but Musk took to Twitter today to delay the event to September 30.
As a reason for the delay, the CEO said that Tesla may have a working prototype of Optimus by then:
Tesla AI Day pushed to Sept 30, as we may have an Optimus prototype working by then
When first announcing the project last year, Musk said that Tesla would have a working prototype by the end of 2022, and recently, the CEO even said that the company aims to start production of the robot in 2023.
This is an extremely ambitious timeline for such an ambitious project, but Musk said on several occasions that it has become a priority.
In January, the CEO said that Tesla is prioritizing product development of the Optimus humanoid robot in 2022 over other products.
Tesla plans to leverage its existing expertise in power electronics and batteries for electric vehicles to build the robot and use its AI expertise to give it a brain.
Musk said that the robot would at first be programmed to perform simple and repetitive tasks, including in manufacturing operations like Tesla’s own.
Tesla plans for the robot to improve over time and be able to perform a wider range of tasks that would make it useful for both commercial and consumer applications.
If successful, the project could have a massive impact on economies, which explains why Tesla has shifted its focus to it.
Late, Musk has even claimed Tesla could play a role in making artificial general intelligence (AGI) a reality through the humanoid robot project.
It sounds like we may learn a lot more about that on September 30.

2022/06/01,"Tesla has received 4680 battery cell samples from Panasonic ahead of the manufacturing giant moving to mass production of the new battery that is going to power the Cybertruck and more.
Back in 2020, Tesla unveiled its 4680 battery cell, a new tab-less battery cell in a bigger format with new chemistry, enabling cheaper and/or longer-range electric vehicles.
The cells have already made it to the Model Y being produced at Gigafactory Texas. For the first time, the automaker its using its own cells to support its electric vehicle production. However, Tesla is going to need so many cells that it is also partnering with current battery suppliers to deploy their own production of the new 4680 cell.
Panasonic, Tesla’s oldest battery partner, has tentatively announced that it would be deploying a prototype production line for the new battery cell. Later, Panasonic’s new CEO, Yuki Kusumi, said that it is prepared to make a “large investment” in producing Tesla’s new battery cell if test production proves successful.
In October 2021, the Japanese manufacturer unveiled its own 4680 cell developed with Tesla. Then, Panasonic greenlit a $700 million investment to produce the 4680 cell in Japan, and it has been rumored to be looking for a location for a new factory in the US to produce the cells.
Earlier this month, we learned that Tesla asked Panasonic to speed up the development of its 4680 battery cell.
It looks like Panasonic listened because Kazuo Tadanobu, CEO of the Panasonic’s energy business, confirmed today that the company has sent Tesla samples of 4680 cells (via Reuters):
Panasonic Holdings Corp, which makes batteries for Tesla, said on Wednesday it had shipped samples of its more powerful 4680 format electric car battery to the U.S electric vehicle maker as it prepares for a surge in North American power pack production.
Tadanobu added:
A pilot line, created first in Japan, made it possible to start large-scale prototype production in May.
The CEO reiterated that mass production is set to start during the next fiscal year starting in March. He also confirmed the rumors that it plans to eventually have 4680 production capacity in North America.
As we previously reported, Panasonic is rumored to be planning a giant new battery factory in the US, possibly in Oklahoma, to supply Tesla with 4680 cells.
Tesla is using 4680 cells in its new Model Y produced at Gigafactory Texas, but it is also expected to power all future electric vehicles, including the Cybertruck.

2022/06/01,"Elon Musk has requested that all Tesla employees stop remote work and come back to the office for 40+ hours per week or they will be let go.
Like every other company, Tesla has allowed remote work for every role where it is possible since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.
As the pandemic subsides, those companies have been reevaluating their remote working policies. Many of them have come to the conclusion that workers are just as if not more productive when remote working and have decided to allow workers to continue to work remotely. Others have been incentivizing employees to come back to the office.
Now it’s Tesla’s turn, and the company definitely falls under the latter category though perhaps “incentives” isn’t the right word in this case. 
CEO Elon Musk sent a series of emails yesterday that basically requests employees come back to the office or be terminated:
Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers.
The CEO added that there might be some exceptions, but he will review and approve those himself, which is a good way to incentivize people not to ask for exceptions.
In a follow-up email, Musk reminded employees that he set the example by sleeping in the factory:
The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence. That is why I lived in the factory so much – so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.
Finally, the CEO took a dig at the companies who still allow remote work:
There are of course companies that don’t require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It’s been a while.
Here are the emails in full:
First email:
Subject: Remote work is no longer acceptble
Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers.
If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible, I will review and approve those exceptions directly.
Moreover, the “office” must be a main Tesla office, not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties, for example being responsible for Fremont factory human relations, but having your office be in another state.
Thanks,Elon
Second email:
Subject: To be super clear
Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week. Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.
The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence. That is why I lived in the factory so much – so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.
There are of course companies that don’t require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It’s been a while.
Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in.

2022/05/31,"Tesla is getting the world’s largest casting machine, also known as Giga Press, and will be using it for for Cybertruck’s body.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been heavily investing in casting and alloy technology to enable larger casted parts that have the capability to greatly simplify manufacturing.
The company acquired several units of the biggest casting machine in the world. These giant, multi-million dollar machines are developed by Idra. Tesla’s first Giga Press, which was installed at the Fremont factory, was put into operation in 2020. The machine was the first of its kind at the time and has a clamping force of 55,000 to 61,000 kilonewtons (5,600 to 6,200 tf).
Tesla has already been producing the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle.
The automaker took deliveries of several more giant casting machines at Gigafactory Texas, and Tesla has now started producing the Model Y at the plant with both front and rear single-piece casting.
Over the last few weeks, Idra has been teasing a new 9,000-pound Giga press that will take the prize as largest in the world. Considering Tesla’s relationship with Idra, it was rumored that the new machine (pictured below) would be for the automaker again.
Now, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that the machine is going to be used for the Cybertruck body.
This is not surprising considering that Tesla already disclosed that the Cybertruck is going to be built using a stainless-steel exoskeleton body that was going to require a new level of casting capability.
Tesla wrote about the Cybertruck’s exoskeleton on its website:
“Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.”
Early on, the company admitted that it was going to need to develop new manufacturing techniques in order to bring the vehicle to production. It looks like this giant new casting machine is part of that plan.
The Cybertruck was unveiled back in 2019. The electric pickup truck was already supposed to be in production, but the automaker delayed the program as it focused on growing Model Y production.
Now, the company is planning for production to start in 2023 for the Cybertruck. And, while there are doubts about Tesla sticking to this timeline, this new machine is a rare sign that the company is investing in deploying Cybertruck production.

2022/05/31,"Elon Musk said that Tesla is going to consider adopting Apple’s AirPlay protocol to improve audio quality over the current Bluetooth.
In recent years, Tesla has put an emphasis on the sound system inside its vehicles.
The sound system in the Model 3 has been well-received by audiophiles, and the one in the new version of the Model S has also received positive reviews.
It has been compared to an expensive Bang & Olufsen system often found in premium vehicles, but for a fraction of the price.
When a reviewer made the comparison on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented:
Tesla audio engineers come from B&O & many other companies. They literally rock. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates.
While on the subject of improvements, another commenter agreed that the Tesla sound system is impressive, but it is limited by the quality of the audio that can be transmitted through Bluetooth when playing music off of a driver’s phone.
They then suggested that enabling AirPlay would provide lossless streaming, and Musk said that the solution will be discussed with the audio team:
Will discuss this and other improvements with Tesla audio engineering. The new Model S and X sound system is incredible.
AirPlay is a proprietary wireless communication protocol stack developed by Apple that allows streaming between devices.
The protocol uses Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth, and since Tesla vehicles are equipped with Wi-Fi capability, everything is there to implement the solution.
However, Tesla has been reticent in adopting Apple software in the past – most famously over enabling the use of Apple CarPlay.
Tesla owners have been asking for it for years, and the possibility of adopting Apple CarPlay was discussed by the company at some point, but the automaker has since decided to keep its customers in its own software ecosystem.

2022/05/30,"Elon Musk has long promised that Tesla will deploy solar and batteries to all its Supercharger stations in order to reduce their dependence on the grid.
It has yet to happen, and now we are seeing some examples of why it should happen sooner rather than later.
There are several reasons why you would want to deploy batteries and solar power at electric vehicle charging stations.
From a financial standpoint, a large part of the cost of running an EV charging station consists of demand charges, which is a higher rate of electricity during surges in demand.
The nature of a charging station results in a lot of the operating time at peak level since you can go hours without a car charging, and then there can be five cars charging at once.
Batteries would be able to reduce the peak demand to greatly reduce the demand charges, which often account for more than a third of the cost of operating a charger.
The other reason why you would want batteries is that you could at least provide some charging capacity in case of a power outage – something that would be critical if you were counting on that charging station to get to your destination.
Early in the deployment of the Supercharger, Tesla promised to add solar arrays and batteries to the Supercharger stations.
The deployment has been extremely slow compared to the growth of the network, but back in 2016, CEO Elon Musk told me that Tesla was waiting for the new Supercharger V3 to accelerate the deployment.
There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place.
In 2017, Musk even added that Tesla plans to add solar and batteries to all Supercharger stations and eventually disconnect most of them from the grid.
The Supercharger V3 was delayed a few times, but it finally came in 2019. Yet, Tesla didn’t accelerate the deployment of solar and batteries at the charging stations.
Ironically, Electrify America might have more Tesla Powerpacks at its charging stations than Tesla has at its own Superchargers. As of the end of last year, Electrify America had deployed Powerpacks at over 140 stations and growing. The charging network’s main reason for installing the batteries is to curb the demand charges, especially in California.
Meanwhile, Tesla’s own cost of Supercharging is surging, especially in California. In Southern California, Tesla’s supercharger prices have increased to between $0.46 and $0.58 per kWh for daytime charging.
Alan Hagge, a Tesla Model 3 owner in Southern California, told Electrek that this is now more than double what it used to be when he bought the car four years ago:
I don’t have access to Tesla’s historical Supercharger costs, but when we first purchased our Model 3 in April 2018, the rate for CA Supercharging was around $0.21 to $0.26 per kWh.  So the price has more than doubled in a span of 4 years, even with lower-cost renewable energy becoming more prominent during that time.  The lower cost-to-drive was a significant factor in our purchasing decision.
Hagge argues that the higher Supercharger cost can now result in a trip being cheaper with a ~40 mpg gas-powered vehicle than in a Tesla vehicle if the EV uses the Supercharger network.
In comparison, Electrify America’s charging in California is cheaper at $0.43/kWh for non-members and $0.31/kWh (plus $4 per month) for members.
Without batteries, Tesla’s Supercharger network is also more vulnerable to power outages.
There were some significant storms that hit the Northeast last week and more than half a million people were without electricity for an extended period of time.
Several Tesla Supercharger stations were down. I was myself driving back from Shawinigan, Canada, and the Supercharger I was going to use in Yamachiche was down due to the power outage. I was able to change my route to go to another Supercharger, but some people weren’t as fortunate.
Claude Lenden needed to stop at a Supercharger near Ottawa on his way to Montreal, but the Supercharger was down due to the outage.
Lenden arrived at the station at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday where he found several other Tesla vehicles waiting. He called Tesla:
When I told a Tesla rep that there were currently six people waiting in their Teslas, with no ETA from Hydro One, I felt the appropriate response would be “hold tight, we are sending a rental minivan to pick everyone up.” I got, “We’re really sorry but nothing we can do.”
The frustrating part is that the Supercharger station was still showing online in Tesla’s system when he arrived.
The customer service told him that it would take between 24-48 hours to get a flatbed on location and it would cost about $300 since Tesla doesn’t cover “running out of charge,” even though Lenden argued that he didn’t run out of charge but Tesla ran out of Supercharger.
Several other Tesla vehicles stopped by to charge, but they had enough range to try to make it to the next charging station. With only 10 km left, Lenden wasn’t as lucky and had to sleep in his car.
A few Powerpacks wouldn’t be able to provide energy for many vehicles if the grid is down, but it would be enough to add some energy to a handful of vehicles that were counting on that station before Tesla can warn other vehicles coming to the station and show it as “offline” in its system. It would avoid a lot of trouble.
And to be fair, power outages are also a problem for gas stations. In Ottawa, where Lenden was stuck, several gas stations ran out of gas amid the storms.
I am not sure what the hold-up is here. Tesla knows the advantages of stationary storage better than anyone and it owns the solution.
Of course, the company is supply constrained when it comes to stationary battery systems, and it has a long backlog of orders from customers – it may be prioritizing them.
But Musk specifically said that Tesla will “add solar and batteries to all Supercharger stations and eventually disconnect most of them from the grid,” and this is far from the truth five years after he made this announcement.
Tesla has thousands of Supercharger stations, and we can only identify a few dozens with solar and batteries.

2022/05/30,"Tesla, along with other EV companies and environmental groups, is lobbying for some of the federal funding going to EV charging infrastructure to be used to deploy charging stations for electric trucks.
Last year, the US legislature approved a new infrastructure bill that included $7.5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
The officials are still in process of figuring out how to distribute this funding most efficiently.
Now several EV companies, including Tesla, and environmental groups, are lobbying the government to set aside 10% of $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure specifically for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDV).
They wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this week (via The Verge):
Most public EV charging infrastructure has been designed and built with passenger vehicles in mind. The size and location of spaces reflect an interest in servicing the. driving public, not larger commercial vehicles.
The group argues that while heavy-duty vehicles account for only 10% of the US vehicle fleet, they account for “45% of the transportation sector’s nitrogen oxide pollution, 57% of fine particulate: matter pollution, and 28% of its global warming emissions.”
In the letter, they also highlight how commercial electric trucks are often already financially competitive, but access to charging infrastructure is still a major obstacle to adoption.
They are asking for 10% of the funding in the infrastructure bill goes to charging for MHDVs:
If America’s MHDV fleet is to go electric, the charging infrastructure built under the BIL will need to take its unique needs into account. As the Biden Administration drafts guidelines, standards and requirements for EV infrastructure paid for by the BIL, we ask that they encourage states to develop charging infrastructure designed to service MHDVs. More specifically, we ask that at least ten percent of the funding included in the BIL’s Section 11401 Grants for Fueling and Infrastructure Program be spent on charging infrastructure designed to service MHDV — both along designated alternative fueling corridors and within communities.
If the request is successful, it would help finance the deployment of a newly developed >1 MW charging standard for electric trucks.
In 2019, we reported that Tesla submitted their own >1 MW high-power charging standard for electric trucks within CharIN, an industry association behind the CCS standard.
CharIN is working on High Power Charging for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV) with its members in order to create a standard for interoperability of vehicle charging stations for electric trucks.
Tesla was one of five companies that submitted designs, along with Electrify America, ABB, paXos, and Staubli, to develop the standards for high-power charging.
In 2020, Jerome Guillen, Tesla’s head of heavy trucking at the time, said that the automaker was working with partners to develop the Megacharger, which is the fast-charging solution for the Tesla Semi electric truck.

2022/05/28,"Tesla has updated its referral program reward for solar roof installations by reducing the reward from $500 to $300 per referred installation.
Last year, we reported that Tesla plans to completely revamp its referral program:
According to a source familiar with the matter, Tesla plans to eliminate referral links, which owners often spam on social media, and instead turn to an app-based referral program promoting in-person referrals.
A few months later, Tesla ended its referral program for everything except its solar roof.
The company has yet to launch a new version of its referral program for electric vehicles. We don’t expect it to come for a while as the company still has a massive backlog of orders, resulting in being production constrained for the foreseeable future.
But in the meantime, it has been tweaking the referral program for solar products. While it was only for solar roof installations at first, Tesla added solar panel installation back to its referral program with a $300 award per installation late last year.
Now Tesla is reducing the $500 reward for solar roof referrals to match the reward for solar panel installations.
The automaker updated the language on its referral program support page:
Friends and family who order through your referral link can earn $300 for Solar Roof or Solar Panels upon permission to operate, while also reducing reliance on the grid and producing clean solar energy. You will earn $300 for each Solar Roof or Solar Panels referral.
Tesla has been known to not always pay out its awards from the referral programs. Most famously, it has yet to deliver on the many Roadsters and Roadster discounts that it had promised buyers for the referral program between 2017 to 2019, a critical time in Tesla’s history. The company has also yet to deliver on some special rewards, like sending an image of the referrer’s choice to space on a SpaceX rocket.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/05/27,"Tesla appears to have a serious supply issue when it comes to its charging port electronic control unit (ECU) since many owners are reporting delays in deliveries due to the missing part.
Compared to the rest of the auto industry, Tesla has faired quite well amid the global supply issues, especially the chip shortage. While most other automakers saw their production and deliveries slow down, Tesla has managed to grow significantly over the last two years.
However, it hasn’t been immune to the issue, especially when it comes to the chips and control units. Tesla did warn that it expects continued various supply chain issues throughout the rest of the year, until the bottleneck again becomes battery cells sometime next year.
We are getting a good example of that today as many Tesla buyers are reporting getting their deliveries delayed over a missing charging port electronic control unit (ECU).
About a dozen Tesla Model 3 and Model Y buyers are reporting on the Tesla Motors Club forum that their new cars have been built, but they can’t be delivered since they are missing the charging port ECU.
Based on their reports, it looks like the issue started in mid-April and Tesla still delivered the vehicles from the factory to local service centers to wait for the part. In some cases, the vehicles have been sitting at the service centers for more than a month.
One of the buyers described his situation:
My issue now is I have a VIN assigned vehicle that was last charged on 4/19 sitting at a service center exposed to the elements without any type of ETA for the missing part meanwhile Fremont is pushing out cars and has the parts in stock. It seems like they’ve forgotten about our cars and we are just waiting indefinitely for when Tesla decides to send them the parts. I’m actively making the payments on the vehicle, large down payment paid on the 4/28, and nothing to show for it.
Several other buyers are in a similar situation – albeit maybe not for the payments on a car not delivered, since that’s related to locking the interest rates in this case.
Based on the number of reports it looks like a fairly widespread issue, and the fact that Tesla is shipping the cars to service centers with a missing part hints toward it affecting a lot of vehicles and/or having a long timeline for delivering the missing part.
Otherwise, it would be more efficient to fix the issue at the factory, but at this point, it makes more sense for Tesla to ship the part to the service center, which would add a significant workload for the service team.

2022/05/26,"Tesla has started to officially move to expand Gigafactory Berlin on a new 250-acre lot with the submission of the construction plan to the municipality.
The automaker has just started production at the factory, and it is still having issues ramping things up, but that’s not stopping the company from already expanding the plant.
Tesla has ambitious plans for Gigafactory Berlin that includes more vertical integration to limit its exposure to supply chain issues and a ramp-up of vehicle production to eventually 1 million units.
As we reported earlier this month, Tesla has been looking to acquire a 100-hectare (~250 acres) parcel of land next to its existing property at Gigafactory Berlin. The factory currently sits on about 300 hectares that Tesla acquired for the giant manufacturing project already constructed over the last few years.
Now local paper RBB reports that the expansion has officially started this week with the submission of the expansion application with the municipality (translated from German):
The planned expansion of the Tesla plant in Grünheide (Oder-Spree) officially started on Wednesday. According to rbb information, the US electrical manufacturer is planning to expand its area in the east by around 100 hectares. However, the development plan (B plan) for this area must be changed for this. The US electric car manufacturer Tesla has now submitted an application, as the mayor of Grünheide, Arne Christiani (independent), confirmed: “The municipality of Grünheide has submitted an application to initiate a B plan procedure in the immediate vicinity of the current 300 hectares get a big B plan.”
The council is expected to weigh in on the matter as soon as next week, and if we are to believe the mayor, it sounds like it’s going to be a formality and the expansion should move ahead.
However, he believes that not unlike the first phase of the project, the official approval is likely to take about a year. In the meantime, Tesla is still working on ramping up Model Y production at the factory, but we hear that there are still some major bottlenecks, especially in the new paint shop.

2022/05/26,"Tesla has delivered four Megapacks to a giant new Bitcoin mining facility in Texas that is going to be the first to be powered by the automaker’s solar and batteries.
Last month, the project was announced as a partnership between Tesla, Blockstream, and Jack Dorsey’s Blocks (formerly Square).
The idea is to build a new 30 Petahashes per second open-source Bitcoin mining facility powered by a 3.8 MW solar farm and 12 MWh Megapack system provided by Tesla.
Blockstream raised ~$40 million for the project through a token, which enables people to technically invest in the Bitcoin mining operation powered by Tesla Megapacks and solar by trading the token on Bitfinex.
The project is moving quickly as Tesla has now delivered the four Megapacks to the mining facility:
Megapacks have landed, repeat the Megapacks have landed!  The @Blockstream, @blocks and @Tesla 100% renewable zero-emission #BitcoinMining facility is just getting started. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/5hMj6F8yT4
Tesla’s involvement in the project is also interesting within the context of the company adopting the cryptocurrency in its own business.
Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin, and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network shows a higher mix of renewable energy. Last summer, CEO Elon Musk said that he believes Tesla will resume taking Bitcoin payment as he sees improvements in the energy mix of Bitcoin mining. That has yet to happen, but Tesla is now directly involved in helping power Bitcoin mining with clean energy through this project in Texas.

2022/05/25,"Tesla has pushed a new software update in order for its vehicles to start applying regular brakes when regenerative braking is limited. It’s an optional feature.
Tesla used to offer drivers options in the strength of the regenerative braking, which is one of the coolest features of electric vehicles. 
Instead of using your regular brakes, an EV’s electric motor can reverse power in order to slow down the vehicle and recuperate the energy in deceleration. This feature can even enable one-pedal driving since other than in emergency situation, you don’t need to touch the brake pedal and activate the regular brakes.
The feature has become such an important aspect of electric driving that Tesla decided to not even give a choice of regenerative braking strength in 2020 and made the strongest regenerative braking standard.
There are times where regenerative braking doesn’t work or is greatly limited – mainly in cold temperature and when the battery is already full. When operating in cold temperatures, the regenerative braking does come back as the drivetrain warms up.
Most Tesla owners have experienced the limitation with the regenerative braking, which Tesla warns about when putting the vehicle in drive. When it does happen, it takes some adjustments since the car doesn’t decelerate as quickly when lifting your foot off the accelerator pedal.
Tesla is now launching an interesting feature to address this issue. In its latest software update (2022.16.0.2), Tesla says that it is adding the option to apply the regular brakes to compensate for the lack of regenerative braking when it is limited.
The automaker wrote in the release notes:
Your vehicle can now automatically apply regular brakes for consistent deceleration when regenerative braking is limited due to battery temperature or state of charge. To enable, tap Controls > Pedals & Steering > Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking Is Limited.
As mentioned in the release notes, this feature is optional.
Interestingly, the change is currently only active for some Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with the latest update. It’s not clear what change is enabling this new feature.

2022/05/25,"Tesla has filed to enter Thailand as its latest market expansion. Interestingly, it plans to sell not only its electric vehicles but also its batteries and solar products.
It has been a little while since Tesla has expanded into a brand new market. The company was trying hard to enter the Indian market for years, but the effort was put on hold earlier this month.
It looks like Tesla has now turned its attention to Thailand. Tesla has filed to register its product for sale in Thailand, according to a new filing that has been going around social media:
@Tesla is coming to Thailand (reg. on 4/25)! In the filing, the first name is David Jon Feinstein, Global Senior Director, Trade Market Access, at Tesla that was appointed to Director of Tesla India in January 2021. Thank you, @elonmusk ❤️. Can we also have a giga factory? pic.twitter.com/wUykL5YMyd
While Tesla hasn’t officially entered the country yet, there are already quite a few Tesla vehicles in Thailand. They have been imported privately by the owners – and that’s a factor that Tesla takes into account when considering entering a new market. If many people are willing to go through the trouble of importing the vehicle, there’s a good chance that there’s a market for its vehicles in the country. We even reported on the Thai police buying a fleet of Tesla Model 3 vehicles for police patrol back in 2020, pictured above.
The Thai auto market is more significant than most people would think; over 750,000 cars were sold in the market last year, and it is expected to ramp up to 800,000–900,000 this year. However, most of those vehicles are not in the same price range as Tesla vehicles.
Thailand would be the first Southeast Asian country where Tesla would officially sell its vehicles. Tesla’s map still doesn’t show any planned service centers or Superchargers, which are generally the first sign of the company entering a new market.
Interestingly, Tesla has also registered in Thailand to sell its solar and battery products, which have been limited to the US for the most part.

2022/05/25,"Tesla has started to release a new software update (2022.16.0.2) with a better range calculation incorporating more environmental factors and the ability for media accounts to be linked to driver profiles.
The latter is pretty simple. You can now have multiple Spotify accounts linked to your vehicle, and they will automatically shift between them based on the driver profile selected.
Tesla wrote in the release notes:
Media Player accounts (e.g. Spotify Login) are now linked to your driver profile. Simply log into your media account while your driver profile is selected.
The second feature in the update is arguably way more important and it’s something that Tesla has actually been testing for a while. 
We reported on it back in March when it showed up in the code, but now Tesla appears to be confident enough to put it in the release notes:
“Energy prediction for your route has been improved by incorporating forecasted crosswind, headwind, humidity and ambient temperature when using online navigation.”
Range calculations are difficult regardless of the type of powertrain, electric or internal combustion engine.
There are just so many factors that can affect the efficiency of a vehicle on a road that it is hard to determine how far it can go on a full battery pack or tank of gas.
But it is important. I’d argue that accurate range prediction is better at curbing range anxiety than longer range.
Tesla has been a leader in efficiency and long-range electric vehicles for a long time, but despite that, it still has issues predicting the energy consumption of a trip.
In 2018, Tesla added more environmental factors (elevation changes, weather, etc.) in the calculation. It helped, but it is still far from accurate. You put a destination in the system and Tesla’s trip advisor tells you how much energy you will have left by the time you get there, but it’s not rare to see the amount of energy go down fast as you drive.
Now some of that can be due to how fast you drive, but environmental conditions along the planned route can also affect the efficiency and that’s what Tesla is trying to account for in a better way with this update.
While these factors could only account for a few percentage points of difference, it can be a big deal for some trips. Every percentage point counts when doing efficiency and range calculations.

2022/05/24,"A group of environmentalists is asking the city of Austin to withhold Tesla’s permit for its upcoming  battery cathode material factory next to Gigafactory Texas over concerns about water supply along the Colorado River.
Over the last two years, Tesla was simultaneously building massive factories in Germany near Berlin and in Texas, near Austin.
In Germany, the company ran into many issues with environmentalists challenging the automaker’s permits over a multitude of concerns ranging from deforestation to water usage. Meanwhile, it was smooth sailing in Texas, which is notoriously pro-business and where environmental assessments are often nothing more than a formality.
Now it seems that Tesla is facing its first serious environmental challenge in Texas as a group of environmentalists are asking for the city of Austin to hold the permit for Tesla’s upcoming cathode factory.
Local publication Austonia reported:
The groups, which include East Austin group PODER, the Texas Anti-Poverty Project, Hornsby Bend Alliance and others, demand that the city wait on permit approval until the company makes commitments to engage the community and protect the environment.
Tesla is planning to produce its own battery cells at Gigafactory Texas, and it is also planning to locally produce the cathode for those battery cells on-site in a new factory.
According to the letter sent to the city, they are particularly concerned about water supply and potential contamination with the Colorado River:
Right now, Tesla is planning to build – in addition to their 4.2 million square foot car factory – a toxic battery cathode plant along the Colorado River, near neighborhoods that do not have access to satisfactory, affordable water, while the company is planning to receive vast amounts of water from the City of Austin for its industrial operations. We are counting on you, our representatives, to hold the company accountable to the public interest before further harm is done to communities and the environment.
The municipal, county, and state governments have all been very welcoming of Gigafactory Texas, and therefore, it would be surprising if the effort is successful in stopping Tesla’s permits.
Meanwhile, the company has committed to “doing the right thing” when it comes to the environmental impact of the factory, and CEO Elon Musk even said that Gigafactory Austin is going to be an ‘ecological paradise’ open to the public.

2022/05/24,"Tesla’s advanced battery research group in Canada in partnership with Dalhousie University has released a new paper on a new nickel-based battery that could last 100 years while still favorably comparing to LFP cells on charging and energy density.
Back in 2016, Tesla established its “Tesla Advanced Battery Research” in Canada through a partnership with Jeff Dahn’s battery lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.
Dahn is considered a pioneer in Li-ion battery cells. He has been working on the Li-ion batteries pretty much since they were invented. He is credited for helping to increase the life cycle of the cells, which helped their commercialization.
His work now focuses mainly on a potential increase in energy density and durability, while also decreasing the cost.
The group has already produced quite a few patents and papers on batteries for Tesla. The automaker recently extended its contract with the group through 2026 as it added two new leaders to be mentored by Dahn.
One of those new leaders, Michael Metzger, along with Dahn himself, and a handful of PhDs in the program, are named as authors of a new research paper called “Li[Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2]O2 as a Superior Alternative to LiFePO4 for Long-Lived Low Voltage Li-Ion Cells” in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.
The paper describes a nickel and manganese-based battery chemistry meant to compete with LFP battery cells on longevity while retaining the properties that people like in nickel-based batteries, like higher energy density, which enables longer range with fewer batteries for electric vehicles.
The group wrote in the paper’s abstract:
Single crystal Li[Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2]O2//graphite (NMC532) pouch cells with only sufficient graphite for operation to 3.80 V (rather than ≥4.2 V) were cycled with charging to either 3.65 V or 3.80 V to facilitate comparison with LiFePO4//graphite (LFP) pouch cells on the grounds of similar maximum charging potential and similar negative electrode utilization. The NMC532 cells, when constructed with only sufficient graphite to be charged to 3.80 V, have an energy density that exceeds that of the LFP cells and a cycle-life that greatly exceeds that of the LFP cells at 40 °C, 55 °C and 70 °C. Excellent lifetime at high temperature is demonstrated with electrolytes that contain lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt, well beyond those provided by conventional LiPF6 electrolytes. 
The cells showed an impressive capacity retention over a high number of cycles:
The research group even noted that the new cell described in the paper could last a 100 years if the temperature is controlled at 25C:
Ultra-high precision coulometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to complement cycling results and investigate the reasons for the improved performance of the NMC cells. NMC cells, particularly those balanced and charged to 3.8 V, show better coulombic efficiency, less capacity fade and higher energy density compared to LFP cells and are projected to yield lifetimes approaching a century at 25 °C.
One of the keys appears to be using an electrolyte with LiFSI lithium salts, and the paper notes that the benefits could also apply to other nickel-based chemistries, including those with no or low cobalt.

2022/05/23,"After recently expanding its Supercharger pilot program for non-Tesla EV owners, the Supercharger network became the ‘largest 150 kW+ public fast-charging network’ in Europe overnight. It’s quite impressive that Tesla did that basically by just flipping a switch.
Tesla was early in investing in charging infrastructure, which led to the Supercharger becoming the largest global fast-charging network.
The company has been criticized for only providing charging for its own customers when most other networks are for all electric vehicles, but there basically wasn’t any other electric vehicle when Tesla started working on the Supercharger network.
Only lately has the automaker started to work on opening up the network to other EVs. 
In November 2021, we saw Tesla take its first step with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
In January, the automaker announced that the program was expanding to more stations in Norway and France, and a month later, the program was expanded to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands.
Finally, Tesla made its biggest expansion of the pilot program last week by opening many more Supercharger stations in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria to all EV owners.
Jeroen van Tilburg, Tesla’s Head of Supercharging in EMEA, had an interesting note about the pilot program. Following the latest expansion, he said that the network of Supercharger stations opened to non-Tesla EV owners in Europe has become the largest network of 150 kW+ public fast-charging stations.
He wrote on LinkedIn:
Becoming the largest 150kW+ CPO instantly: Today we’ve expanded the Non-Tesla Supercharger pilot to Austria, Belgium, Spain, Sweden and the UK (in addition to our existing (pilot) sites in the Netherlands, France and Norway), accelerating the transition to a sustainable future for everyone.
It’s a hard claim to confirm, but it is likely true that Tesla is already offering more fast-chargers with a capacity of 150 kW or more for all EVs than any other charging network operator.
Ionity has 417 charging stations deployed in Europe, about twice as many as Tesla Supercharger stations in the pilot program for all EVs, but Ionity is averaging only 4.1 chargers per station for a total of 1738 fast-charger stations.
I couldn’t verify the number of chargers at all ~200 stations in Tesla’s pilot program, but it appears to be close to its overall average of 9 chargers per station, which should put Tesla’s pilot program just above Ionity’s whole network in Europe.
Of course, it was more complicated than simply “flipping a switch,” as Tesla had to validate charging a variety of EVs on its Superchargers, but it is still way simpler since the automaker didn’t deploy any new stations to achieve that feat.

2022/05/23,"Tesla has filed to change rules for grid operators in Texas in order to enable anyone with solar and batteries, including residential homeowners, to participate in the state’s energy market.
Since moving to Texas, Tesla has been lobbying to change several energy market rules in order to more efficiently deploy its energy products on the state’s notoriously fragile electric grid.
It mainly focused on deploying its Megapacks at the utility level, but now it is pushing for its residential customers with solar and Powerwalls to participate in the state’s energy market more efficienctly.
Arushi Sharma Frank, Tesla’s US Energy Markets Policy Lead, commented on LinkedIn:
So basically, it’s horrendously hot in large parts of the country too early in the year compared to past years. The early heat waves are a huge challenge for electric grid operators, and that’s on top of other climate concerns. Home solar and battery customers have been providing their extra clean energy capacity back to constrained grids daily, around the world, and gotten paid for it. We’re trying to enable that in Texas/ERCOT this year. I keep hearing how that will take 4-6 years and it’s like, what a joke! Let’s do it now and figure out something that doesn’t take years and cost the earth.
Tesla has filed a OBDRR – a request for a rule change – with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an organization operating Texas’s electrical grid. This will enable electric utilities with customers with behind-the-meter solar and batteries, meaning people with residential solar can bid on the extra capacity.
The company wrote in the filing:
This OBDRR will enable Retail Electric Providers (REPs) with Customers with behind-the-meter controllable generation, energy storage or other technologies to provide bids to buy in Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and participate in Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin).  This is already allowed under the policies established by ERCOT; however, minor clarifications are required to allow the first of these aggregations to register with ERCOT this year.
As Sharma Frank wrote, Tesla is trying to expedite the process, and it argues that it will unlock megawatts of power:
Tesla asks for a quick consideration by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on this document so that it can launch a retail offer associated with this functionality this year, and thus enable additional megawatts to be procured and dispatched by ERCOT.  To that end, Tesla respectfully requests that minimal additional comments should be added to this document; instead, Tesla commits to working with ERCOT and interested stakeholders to bring a second OBDRR for this OBD later this summer that will allow new functionality, such as providing Responsive Reserve (RRS).  This forthcoming OBDRR will offer an appropriate opportunity to modernize this document.
If successful, it should automatically unlock a lot of value for homeowners with solar and/or home batteries, which Tesla has been deploying in Texas.
The change could also allow Tesla to operate all its distributed energy assets as a virtual power plant in the state as it does in California. Tesla could combine individual extra capacity with its residential customers to provide grid services and spread the benefits between the customers, thus improving the financial viability of going solar in Texas.
On top of its regular solar and Powerwall deployment, Tesla is also installing solar roofs and Powerwalls in new homes in a giant new residential project in Austin, Texas.

2022/05/23,"Tesla is back to ramping up production at Gigafactory Shanghai. The automaker could reportedly be back to pre-shutdown level as soon as tomorrow and plans to ramp up to new records later this week.
Like many other companies, Tesla had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory last month after local authorities imposed serious lockdowns on the population in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 after a surge in cases during the first quarter.
The automaker was finally able to restart production on April 19 after 22 days of being shut down.
Tesla brought back 8,000 people to work in a “closed-loop” shift, where people slept at the factory to help reduce worker movements in the city. At the time, we noted that on top of missing 22 days of production, it would take time for Tesla to ramp production back up to pre-lockdown levels.
Earlier this month, we learned that Tesla was actually making a lot of progress and aimed to ramp production back to 2,600 vehicles per day by May 16. However, we noted at the time that it appeared to be an ambitious goal that is going to be difficult to achieve.
ˆSure enough, Tesla confirmed supplier issues earlier this month that some reports suggested resulted in production stalling to just 200 units a day. n a new memo last week, Tesla said that it is sticking to one shift for now and doesn’t plan to ramp up to 2,600 units until at least May 23.
Now in a new memo, the automaker says that it will ramp up daily output to 2,600 units as soon as Tuesday (via Reuters):
Tesla will more than double its daily output to 2,600 electric vehicles at its Shanghai plant from Tuesday, according to the memo detailing the plan. That compares to around 1,000 EVs produced on Monday, according to the memo, and would bring Tesla’s weekly output to nearly 16,000 units, the memo showed.
With a weekly output of 16,000 units, it will bring Shanghai to new records with an annualized capacity of over 800,000 electric vehicles.
It sets Tesla up for a good output in June, but the automaker has likely missed out on more than 60,000 vehicles during the second quarter due to the Gigafactory Shanghai shutdown.

2022/05/23,"An almost brand-new Tesla Model Y caught on fire after powering down while driving. The driver claimed to be stuck inside the car and had to break the window to get out.
It serves as a good reminder to know and remember that all doors in Tesla vehicles have manual releases.
The incident happened last Friday in North Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Jamil Jutha was driving in his 2021 Tesla Model Y that he bought just eight months ago when he claims that the vehicle pushed an error notification and then powered down.
He felt the cabin fill with smoke. He told the fire department when they arrived, after being asked if there was someone else in the car:
No. I had to smash the window to get out of the car. I kicked through the window. Everything stops. The power didn’t work. The door didn’t open. The windows didn’t go down so I’m thinking I need to get the f*ck out of this car so I kicked through.
While it’s true that the primary way to operate the doors in a Tesla vehicle is through the electronic releases, which don’t work in case of a loss of power, every door is also equipped with a manual release in plain view.
In fact, it’s often a problem for people who are not familiar with the car as they use the manual release instead of the electronic release, which enables the windows on the frameless door to go down before enabling the door to be pushed open – ensuring a safer opening of the doors.
After a few minutes of smoke coming out of the car, flames started to be visible inside the vehicle. The fire department arrived about five minutes  after the car started smoking, and they were able to quickly extinguish the fire.
Here’s a video of the whole incident:
While you should avoid using them too often, you should be aware of the manual releases on your doors. Regardless of your car, since this is not unique to Tesla at this point.
It’s important to note that electric vehicles are not known to catch on fire at a higher rate than gasoline-powered vehicles.
Most instances of EV fires come after a severe crash, which is fairly normal for an electric or gasoline-powered vehicle. There are some more worrisome instances of EVs catching on fire without a crash, like this instance, or while charging. 
Battery fires also offer different challenges for fire departments than other vehicle fires, but in this case, it’s not clear if the battery was on fire.
They are currently investigating the source of the fire, but with battery fires, the fire generally engulfs the whole vehicle since it is located at the bottom. They also tend to be difficult to extinguish, but the fire department got it under control within seconds in this case.
It’s going to be interesting to see the results of this investigation.

2022/05/22,"Elon Musk told reporters in Brazil that Tesla will have self-driving cars without the need for human drivers behind the wheel for supervision (or at all really) around this time next year.
It’s Musk’s latest timeline on Tesla’s full self-driving effort, but he has always been wrong about those in the past.
The Tesla CEO was in Brazil on Friday. The reason for the trip was a partnership with the local government to launch a program to connect Amazonian regions with SpaceX’s Starlink satellite-based internet, but he also reportedly talked about Tesla to local reporters.
Musk said that Tesla will have self-driving cars without the need for people behind the wheel about a year from now – therefore, around May 2023.
It’s not the first time that Musk made this announcement. 
He has famously been claiming that Tesla will have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the end of the year since 2020.
Recently, we reported that for this year, Musk changed Tesla’s 1 million robotaxis by end of the year goal to ‘1 million people in FSD Beta’. There is a massive difference between the two.
The term “robotaxi” implies that a vehicle can provide a taxi service without a driver at the wheel.
On the other hand, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has all the features of a self-driving system, but they often fail, which is why it requires a driver behind the wheel at all-time to be attentive and ready to take control.
The responsibility also lies with the driver behind the wheel. 
The idea is that Tesla keeps improving the system by testing through its FSD beta fleet and collecting data to train its neural nets. With enough improvements, Tesla hopes that its FSD system will eventually become safe enough to use without drivers monitoring it, but there have been doubts about making it happen after several missed timelines.
As I’ve stated before, I have a lot of appreciation for Tesla’s effort to develop a self-driving system. It’s an extremely difficult thing to do, and I think that there’s a lot that makes sense in the company’s approach to developing a system based on computer vision and artificial intelligence.
However, I think that there are many issues in how Tesla has been promoting the system using timelines that Musk hyped up every chance he could get, even though he has been wrong about them several times.
At least he has admitted recently the difficulty of predicting solving self-driving and that he might be wrong again, but evidently, it is not stopping him from making a new prediction.
At this point, I’ll believe it when I see it.

2022/05/21,"Tesla has reportedly filed plans for a 29-stall supercharger and diner/drive-in theater location in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. The location is at 7001 Santa Monica Boulevard at the intersection of Orange Drive.
Tesla originally planned to build the diner in the coastal city of Santa Monica but then moved the plans to Hollywood. Now, perhaps a little confusingly to out-of-towners, we’ve learned the diner will still be in Hollywood – but on Santa Monica Boulevard, one of the main streets in town and along historic Route 66.
The old site in Santa Monica does have a supercharger that opened in February, though that supercharger is no longer getting a diner.
The new location is currently occupied by a Shakey’s Pizza Parlor, which seems to still be operational. The plans would involve demolishing the Shakey’s and building a new two-story diner in its place. The property already has a large parking lot, though the lot would need remodeling to add superchargers.
The bottom floor will consist of the kitchen, a bar with stool seating, several booths, and an outdoor bar around the edge of the building. The top floor will have outdoor rooftop seating with a bar, several tables, two rows of a theater-style seating area, and a standing bar behind the theater seats. The bottom floor will also have a “carhop area” for waitstaff to bring meal orders out to cars in the parking lot.
The theater-style seating will look out on a parking lot with 29 supercharger stalls and 34 total spots – the last five will have level two chargers for lower-speed charging. The parking lot will have two screens visible to the rooftop area and to the cars in the parking lot.
The theater will show short features, around 30 minutes long, meant to last as long as a standard meal/charging session might last.
It’s hard to tell from these drawings what aesthetic the diner will fit. Originally, it was billed as an “old-school” diner, but the addition of bamboo landscape screens surrounding the property on the north and west sides seem to diverge from that aesthetic. Tesla may now be targeting a “futuristic” aesthetic, rather than the original “old-school” one, and these drawings look like they could go either way.
Tesla is asking the city to allow the site to be operational 24 hours a day – including the restaurant. The theater may not operate all night long, though, as Tesla hasn’t asked for the city to change restrictions on theater operation. We don’t know if this means the restaurant will definitely be open 24 hours, but Tesla at least wants the permit to be able to stay open that long.
Tesla has filed for permits before for this project when it was in the City of Santa Monica, so plans could change again, especially if the city comes back and says that this project has deficiencies. The parking lot, in particular, does seem to have a few oddly-shaped spots, so we’ll see if the city has some issues with that.
What do you think about the new plans? Let us know in the comments below.

2022/05/20,"Elon Musk announced today that Tesla is building a “hardcore litigation department” to “directly initiate and execute lawsuits.” The timing of the effort is strange since it comes right after an allegation of sexual misconduct against the CEO.
Musk made the announcement on Twitter:
Tesla is building a hardcore litigation department where we directly initiate and execute lawsuits. The team will report directly to me.
He said that the team will commit to two things:
This reflects previous comments made by Musk about his and Tesla’s policy for litigations:
Tesla policy is never to give in to false claims, even if we would lose, and never to fight true claims, even if we would win.
Musk has previously said that he doesn’t settle under any condition, and he put that policy to the test during a lawsuit over the acquisition of SolarCity. All other defendants, who consisted of Tesla’s board, settled when investors sued over alleged mishandling of Tesla’s SolarCity allegation except for Musk.
The case went to trial last year, and Musk recently came out on top.
But the timing of the announcement is strange as it comes a day after an allegation of sexual misconduct came out against Musk that involved a reported settlement between the alleged victim and SpaceX over the situation.
However, Musk is specifically talking about Tesla’s legal department.
Tesla already has an extensive legal department, including litigation lawyers, but it also works with outside firms in bigger cases.
The company is always embroiled in many different cases before the courts, but it has been involved lately in some more high-profile cases, including a lawsuit over allegations of racial discrimination that resulted in a $137 million award that was later slashed to $15 million.
Interestingly, in Musk’s new statement, he mentions Tesla “directly initiating” lawsuits.
While Tesla gets a lot of press when it is being sued, the automaker has also been known to file lawsuits, too, especially when it comes to cases of intellectual property theft.
Update: The news coincides with the launch of NYTimes/FX/Hulu’s documentary on Tesla’s Autopilot which seems to fit the ire of Elon Musk a little better. He could also be threatening former employees who spoke negatively in the documentary including former Tesla president John McNeil who headed up global sales, marketing, delivery and government relations.

2022/05/20,"Tesla (TSLA) stock has fallen by as much as 10% today after the allegation of sexual misconduct against CEO Elon Musk came out, which is now being called the ‘Elongate’ scandal. Musk has now denied the claim and even challenged the alleged victim’s friend who shared the story.
As we reported yesterday, a publication released a second-hand account of alleged sexual misconduct by Musk on a flight attendant on his private plane.
A friend of the flight attendant told her story after she reportedly signed an NDA and received a $250,000 settlement from SpaceX. She claimed that Musk exposed himself and asked for sexual favors during a massage he requested on the plane.
Musk commented on the original report, but he didn’t outright deny the claim at first other than hinting that it was politically motivated.
The CEO has since took to Twitter to more clearly deny the story calling it “utterly untrue”.
He even challenged the person who told the story to describe distinguishable marks on his body, like scars or tattoos, that haven’t been public:
But I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me “exposed” – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened.
The statement hasn’t helped Tesla’s stock, which has been taking a beating lately, but even more so today. Tesla (TSLA) is down by as much as 10% today, and the stock is now down to a level that we have not seen since June 2021:
It’s hard to link the latest drop directly to the ‘Elongate scandal,’ but Tesla’s stock is down way more than the rest of the market today despite no other significant news.
This is bad news for all Tesla shareholders obviously, but even more so for Musk who has about $6 billion of his Twitter acquisition deal tied to loans backed by his Tesla shares.
I won’t try to weigh in on the issue of who is saying the truth here because we simply can’t know at this point, but there’s one thing that I think is important to clarify.
I see lots of people saying that Elon was “dead on” for calling out a day before the story came out that the “political attacks” on him were going to ramp up after he called the Democratic party “the party of hate” and said he would be voting Republican.
To be clear, the Insider, who first reported the story, said that they reached out to Musk ahead of publishing the story and even gave him more time to comment.
Therefore, it is almost certain that he was already aware this story was coming out when he announced that he would be voting Republican and predicted that “political attacks” were coming his way.
I think that’s an important distinction, but it doesn’t mean the allegations are true, either.

2022/05/20,"Tesla has reportedly agreed to build a battery and electric vehicle factory in Indonesia, according to the country’s head of investments. The comment comes after Musk met with the Indonesian president.
Last week we reported on Tesla being rumored to be near a deal for a battery venture in Indonesia after a new round of talks with representatives of the automaker and the Indonesian government; it wasn’t the first time that talks of Tesla making a major investment in Indonesia had emerged.
In 2020, we reported on Tesla allegedly being in talks with the Indonesian government to build a new nickel venture in the country, which has a strong nickel reserve – nickel is one of the main materials used in the production of cathodes for battery cells used in electric vehicles. The move came after CEO Elon Musk pleaded with mining companies to increase their nickel production.
Later, we also learned that Tesla was actually in talks with Indonesia not just about nickel, but to possibly build a full battery factory in the country. After a pause in the talks, things ramped up again earlier this month after Tesla sent a group to Indonesia to talk with the government and Elon Musk met with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.
Now a week later, the local news report that Tesla has “agreed” to a deal to build a battery and electric vehicle factory in Indonesia:
Tesla agreed to build a battery and electric vehicle plant at an industrial complex in Central Java province, following stateside talks last weekend between President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and Tesla chief Elon Musk, Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said on Wednesday.
Lahadalia did clarify that nothing is “signed” yet, but he did say that it was agreed:
God willing, Tesla will enter Indonesia this year. But I can’t announce the month yet. Let’s wait, because we haven’t signed an agreement yet. How much investment is still being kept secret, still waiting. But this is good stuff, big stuff.
He didn’t elaborate on the details of the plan, but both a factory for batteries and for electric vehicles were mentioned. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to announce locations for new factories by the end of the year.
I’d take it with a grain of salt for now. It looks like a decent source, but it’s better to be careful until anything is signed. It would be a big deal for Tesla, since it would likely come with them securing a large supply of nickel.
Indonesia has introduced regulations that force companies to process the nickel locally – so it’s not that big of a jump for them to make the full battery cells locally – but building the full electric vehicles in Indonesia is more surprising, though not impossible.

2022/05/20,"Tesla’s latest service manual does reveal that Tesla’s structural battery pack is removable – something that was thought of as a problem due to the design.
It’s actually doable, but it is quite an ordeal.
When Tesla introduced its new 4680 battery cell at its Battery Day in 2020, it featured several major improvements on its own, but it also enabled this idea of a structural battery pack. 
The idea was to make those new battery cells part of the structure of the new vehicles.
Inspired by the aerospace innovation of building airplane wings as fuel tanks instead of building the fuel tanks inside the wings, Tesla decided to build a battery pack that acts as a body structure, linking the front and rear underbody parts while the battery cells themselves contribute to the integral structure of the pack and therefore the whole car body.
The result is quite elegant:
They call it a “structural battery,” meaning that the battery is not just an energy device but an actual structural part of the vehicle.
It brought obvious advantages in terms of weight and simplicity of manufacturing. Tesla originally announced that the new design reduces overall vehicle mass by 10% and increases range by 14%.
But on the other hand, it did raise a few questions about what happens if you need a battery pack replacement since the pack is now part of the body.
Now that we have access to Tesla’s service manuals for the new Model Y with structural battery pack, we can actually see that the pack is removable and replaceable, but it is quite an ordeal.
According to the service manual (hat tip to Brian Krause for spotting it), it takes a total of 143 steps just to remove the structural battery pack.
I won’t go through all of them because it would take forever, but it involves basically removing a large part of the interior of the vehicle before actually starting to work on the pack.
Once removed, the vehicle looks fairly strange since it’s as if the whole floor is gone:
Then you have another 171 steps to put a new battery pack in there for a total of 314 steps to replace a structural battery pack.
Hopefully, it doesn’t have to be done too often.

2022/05/19,"Tesla’s (TSLA) stock has fallen significantly in the last few months, and even more so over the last week with the broader market and being removed from the S&P 500 ESG Index. Now some important investors appear to panic, and one is asking for a stock buyback program from Tesla.
Tesla has long benefited from a large core group of investors who believe in the company’s long-term mission and are holding the stock. These investors have benefited greatly over the years as the company’s valuation surged to $1 trillion dollars.
But now, amid a broader market pullback and some more specific news that has been bad for Tesla, the stock is now down 28% over the last month alone. The market has erased roughly $250 billion of Tesla’s valuation so far this year.
Yesterday’s removal from the S&P 500 ESG appears to have been particularly difficult on investors, and CEO Elon Musk went on a rant about it on Twitter. 
Several Tesla investors are fighting back.
Cathie Wood, the head of the Ark fund, which has been invested in Tesla for a long-time, and criticized Tesla for being excluded from the index.
A clear case of wacktivism. Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.
It is even triggering some surprising responses from investors.
For example, Leo Koguan, a self-proclaimed ‘Elon Musk fanboy’ who has become the third-largest Tesla investor, has become somewhat of an active investor following the recent decline in stock price, and he is now calling for Tesla to start a stock buyback program:
Tesla must announce immediately and buy back $5B of Tesla shares from its free cash flow this year and $10B from its free cash flow next year, without effecting its existing $18B cash reserves with ZERO debt. Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin money printing machines are running in full speed, Tesla can invest in FSD, bot and factories while buying back its undervalued stocks. Shock and wake up few braindead analysts to their senses. Tesla is a Phoenix rising from the ashes.
Tesla investors had a mixed response to the proposal with some of them agreeing that the stock is undervalued, and it would be a smart move for the company and others insisting that Tesla should keep focusing on the mission.
That is kind of a panic move since it would make Tesla spend $15 billion over two years in order to support its share price in the short term, and you don’t know where the stock price is going to be next year. That said, I’d be surprised if Tesla goes for it.
It would look bad for Elon Musk, since his Twitter deal still relies on about $6 billion of loans back by Tesla shares, and it would like the company spending its cash to bail him out, though Musk is looking for more financing that wouldn’t be attached to Tesla stock.
What do you think of Leo Koguan’s proposal? Would you be OK with a Tesla share buyback program? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/05/19,"Tesla might not love California, or at least not enough to keep its headquarters there, but California still loves Tesla, or at least enough to buy more Tesla vehicles than ever.
Tesla sales in California are up 83% this year.
To be fair, it’s not exactly that Tesla doesn’t “love” California anymore, but CEO Elon Musk hasn’t been shy about criticizing the state lately.
It all started during the pandemic when Musk was extremely critical of California’s restrictions that prevented Tesla from operating the Fremont factory.
The CEO threatened that Tesla would move to Texas or Nevada if the state wouldn’t quickly allow reopening its California factory, which at the time was its largest in the world.
Musk being so quick to threats was surprising considering California’s long history of helping Tesla. There’s an argument to be made that Tesla wouldn’t have succeeded anywhere else early in its history.
California has strong EV incentives for both manufacturers of electric vehicles and buyers – creating the biggest EV market in the US and making EVs more profitable for manufacturers.
Without California, the market for electric vehicles in the US would have been almost insignificant until very recently.
Tesla ended up officially moving its headquarters to Texas last year – partly concretizing Musk’s threat.
However, California has remained Tesla’s most important market, and it is still growing.
The California New Car Dealer Association released its Q1 2022 report and confirmed that Tesla’s deliveries have increased an impressive 83.7% so far this year:
Tesla’s impressive performance has helped the state achieve a new record of 15% market share for all-electric vehicles in California:
It’s easy to understand how popular Tesla vehicles are in California by looking at the market shares of the Model 3 and Model Y in their respective segments.
Model 3 holds a massive 65% market share in the near-luxury car segment and Model Y holds a 55.5% market share in the highly competitive luxury compact SUV segment:
These results are undeniable and show that Tesla dominates the market in California.
However, it’s important to note that it doesn’t necessarily reflect Californians’ opinions of Tesla today since most of those vehicles delivered in Q1 2022 were ordered between 3 and 12 months ago.

2022/05/19,"Tesla has started to push a new Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software update with improvements based on over 250,000 training video clips from its fleet.
Based on the release notes, it’s a big update.
FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
The company now has around 100,000 owners in the program, and with more people in it, it is expected to have more data to train its neural nets.
Today, Tesla has started using a new FSD beta software update (2022.12.3.10), and according to the release notes, it is one of the most extensive updates to date. 
Interestingly, Tesla notes for the first time the number of video clips pulled from the fleet and used to train certain new behaviors. The automaker has mentioned a total of over 250,000 new video clips used in the training set for this update.
Tesla also said that it has removed three older neural nets from the system, which enabled 1.8 frames per second improvement in the system frame rate.
The release notes also mentioned many more improvements – several of them related to the level of confidence in which the system takes action, which has been a source of frustration for using FSD Beta in the past.

2022/05/18,"Tesla has significantly expanded its Supercharger pilot program for non-Tesla EV owners to several more European countries, including the UK and Spain.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers. In November 2021, we saw Tesla take its first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands, where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
In January, the automaker announced that the program is expanding to more stations in Norway and France, and a month later, the program was expanded to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands. Now Tesla has expanded the pilot program to some Supercharger stations in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria.
Here’s the updated list of countries with Supercharger stations opened to non-Tesla owners:
Except in the Netherlands, not all stations are accessible to non-Tesla EV owners, but it was a significant expansion nonetheless.
Tesla is gradually expanding the pilot program to study the impact of onboarding non-Tesla EV owners on the network. It is expected to eventually give EV drivers access to more if not all stations in Europe and use the new revenue to accelerate the expansion of the network.
The automaker is expected to also do the same in North America, but it is going to be more complicated in this market since Tesla uses its proprietary plug instead of the CCS standard. However, Musk recently hinted that Tesla will be adding CCS connectors to new Supercharger stations in the US.
Update: Tesla now says it is the largest 150kW Charge Point Operator in Europe…at the flick of a switch.

2022/05/18,"Tesla has been removed from the S&P 500 ESG index after CEO Elon Musk trashed the system that is supposed to measure the sustainability of a company or investment.
S&P Global announced this week that it has removed Tesla from its ESG index. ESG stands for ‘Environmental, Social, and Governance.’ This index is used as a standard for investors to rank companies based on those standards. However, it has been criticized for using a flawed assessment system that doesn’t truly take into account the environmental benefits of a company’s business.
Lately, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been vocal about his disagreement with ESG rankings. He wrote on Twitter recently:
Stop the outrageous false ESG assessments, where Tesla gets a bad grade, but an oil company can get a good grade. Total gaming of the system!
ESG doesn’t really take into account the fact that Tesla’s entire business is about transitioning the world to sustainable energy but rather looks at strategies to decarbonize operations.
Tesla has notoriously scored poorly – though it’s not just about the environmental aspect but the assessments that have also criticized Tesla’s company culture.
This week, S&P Global commented on removing Tesla from its ESG Index:
First and foremost, the GICS industry group in which Tesla is assessed (Automobiles & Components) experienced an overall increase in its average S&P DJI ESG Score. So, while Tesla’s S&P DJI ESG Score has remained fairly stable year-over-year, it was pushed further down the ranks relative to its global industry group peers. A few of the factors contributing to its 2021 S&P DJI ESG Score were a decline in criteria level scores related to Tesla’s (lack of) low carbon strategy and codes of business conduct. In addition, a Media and Stakeholder Analysis, a process that seeks to identify a company’s current and potential future exposure to risks stemming from its involvement in a controversial incident, identified two separate events centered around claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s Fremont factory, as well as its handling of the NHTSA investigation after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot vehicles. Both of these events had a negative impact on the company’s S&P DJI ESG Score at the criteria level, and subsequently its overall score. While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens.
The group said that Tesla could be added back to the index in another upcoming rebalance.

2022/05/18,"Tesla has started to offer its new Giga Texas-built Model Y to some customers as an option to accelerate delivery.
At the Cyber Rodeo event last month, Tesla delivered its first made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles.
We noted that it was strange that Tesla didn’t reveal any details, like specs and pricing, about the new version of the electric SUV.
It is equipped with the new 4680 battery cells and structural battery pack technology, which is resulting in a significantly different car with different specs in the new Model Y trim.
Yet, Tesla never listed this new trim for sale and all we know about it was through an EPA filing that revealed it has 279 miles of range and an all-wheel-drive powertrain. It is billed as a “Model Y Standard Range AWD.”
We suspected that Tesla is only delivering the vehicle to employees for now through internal deals, which would explain why it never showed up on its website.
We were later able to confirm that based on a communication Tesla sent to employees and obtained by Electrek.
It revealed that the new Texas-built Model Y Standard starts at $59,990, has a 0-60 mph acceleration in five seconds, and is equipped with a few new features, including a magnetic center console armrest and a parcel shelf.
Now Tesla is reaching out to local buyers around Austin with a Model Y on order to offer them the new version of the Model Y:
Accelerate Yout Model Y Delivery
You have the opportunity to experience our latest configuration and take delivery within weeks.
Select Model Y All-Wheel Drive and experience one of the first vehicles built at Gigafactory Texas – and currently available in the area. Go anywhere with up to 279 miles on a single charge and accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 5.0 seconds.
Check your Tesla Account regularly for updated inventory, or if you would like to keep your current configuration, we will contact you to schedule a delivery appointment once a vehicle is available.
Buyers then have a few options if they want to technically “downgrade” their order to the Standard Range version.
Interestingly, this is basically exactly how I thought it would be the best way to roll out the vehicle in a fair manner.
If you just add it as an option to the Model Y configurator, you are resulting in a lot of people skipping a long line.
That way, you are offering the option to existing buyers with a Model Y on order to consider this as an option. It might be a better one for some of them, cheaper, and you get it faster.
Considering only a few vehicles are made available as inventory right now, it’s likely that Tesla is also simultaneously still delivering the new Model Y to employees. We are likely to see this keep going for the next days and maybe even weeks until the new version becomes available to order for everyone.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/05/18,"Tesla has started to push a new software update to increase the top speed limit of Autopilot for vehicles with ‘Tesla Vision’ to 85 mph.
It is almost a year to the day that Tesla announced the transition to its “Tesla Vision” Autopilot without radar.
The idea was that it would transition to only using camera-based computer vision in its Autopilot system instead of using inputs from both cameras and radars.
You’d think that more data would be better, but Tesla’s idea is that the roads are designed for humans who operate them using a vision-based system with their natural neural nets in their brains. The automaker believes it best to try to replicate that purely with cameras and artificial neural nets and not let the data from the radar pollute that.
However, Tesla warned that the transition would result in limitations of some Autopilot features at first.
One of those limitations has been the top speed at which Autosteer, Autopilot’s main feature that keeps a vehicle in its lane, was limited to 75 mph.
This was quickly raised to 80 mph, but it has stayed at that speed for a while and owners have been asking for Tesla to raise it. Regular Autopilot with radar would have a 90 mph top speed.
Now Tesla has started to increase the limit for vision-only vehicles to 85 mph, according to an update on Tesla’s website (hat tip to Artem Russakovskii):
“Autosteer will be limited to a maximum speed of 85 mph and a longer minimum following distance.”
It’s not quite at parity with pre-vision-only Autopilot, but it is getting closer in terms of the top speed.
Though there are other bigger problems that the vision-only system brought to Autopilot.
As we have previously reported, reports of phantom braking errors have soared since Tesla transitioned to vision-only Autopilot. 
Back in November, Electrek published an article titled “Tesla has a serious phantom braking problem in Autopilot.“
It highlighted a significant increase in Tesla owners reporting dangerous phantom braking events on Autopilot.
Phantom braking is a term used to describe when an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) or a self-driving system applies the brakes for no good reason.
The system can be falsely detecting an object on the road or anticipating a collision that won’t actually happen and apply the brake to try to avoid it.
Obviously, phantom braking is something you want to avoid since it can create accidents if someone is following too closely behind you.
This issue is not new in Tesla’s Autopilot, but our report focused on Tesla drivers noticing an obvious increase in instances based on anecdotal evidence, but it was also backed by a clear increase in complaints to the NHTSA.
We linked the start of the increase in phantom braking reports to the transition to Tesla Vision.
Our article made the rounds in a few other outlets, but it didn’t really go mainstream until the Washington Post ended up picking the story up with a very similar report that was more widely distributed earlier this year.
Since then, NHTSA announced an investigation of Autopilot’s phantom braking problem.

2022/05/17,"A new research paper showing a vulnerability with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is being used to single out Tesla for potentially resulting in unlocking vehicles remotely.
Today, Tesla is in the news with headlines like “millions of Tesla vehicles vulnerable to hacking.”
These reports are coming up after a paper from the NCC Group came out exposing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):
We’ve conducted the world’s first link layer relay attack on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the standard protocol used for sharing data between devices that has been adopted by companies for proximity authentication to unlock millions of vehicles, residential smart locks, commercial building access control systems, smartphones, smart watches, laptops and more.
As they wrote, this is a specific exploit related to BLE, and it affects virtually every device that uses the protocol, but the reason Tesla is being singled out is that they demonstrated the vulnerability in Tesla vehicles.
They wrote in the report:
Cars with automotive keyless entry – an attacker can unlock, start and drive a vehicle. NCC Group has confirmed and disclosed a successful exploit of this for Tesla Models 3 and Y (over 2 million of which have been sold).
They are describing a relay attack, which has been a known issue with every car using key fobs, and Tesla has moved to BLE key fobs in 2016. Thefts of Tesla vehicles are quite rare in North America, but in Europe, they have some more sophisticated thieves that managed a string of Tesla vehicle thefts through relay attacks, and most vehicles haven’t been recovered.
In response to those attacks, Tesla started rolling out extra layers of security with an “improved cryptography” key fob and optional “PIN to Drive” feature. These measures can be applied to greatly decrease the chances of your Tesla vehicle being stolen – even with this BLE vulnerability.
As we previously reported, Tesla has been heavily investing in cybersecurity, especially though having a good relationship with whitehat hackers. The automaker increased its max payout per reported bug to $15,000 in 2018, and it has ramped up its security team as well as its relationship with hackers through participation in hacking conferences.
Over the last few years, Tesla has brought its cars as targets in the popular Pwn2Own hacking competition. 
Cybersecurity has been a top priority at Tesla. You can read more about it in our article: The Big Tesla Hack: A hacker gained control over the entire fleet, but fortunately he’s a good guy.

2022/05/17,"Elon Musk’s claim that Tesla will have “1 million robotaxis by end of the year” has now become “1 million people in Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta.”
Musk has a long history of making claims about Tesla’s self-driving effort that haven’t come through, especially when it comes to the timing. The biggest claim has been that “Tesla will have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the end of the year.” That year was originally 2020, but it has since been pushed several times.
Until somewhat recently, Musk was still claiming that this was the goal in 2022, but he has now greatly changed it. Instead of “1 million robotaxis” on the road, now, the CEO is talking about Tesla having 1 million people in its FSD Beta program.
Musk said this week during the All-in Summit:
The Full Self-Driving Beta at this point can very often take you with zero intervention across the Bay Area from San Jose to Marin through complex traffic. It’s really quite sophisticated. I invited anyone to join the Beta or look at the videos of those in the beta. We got over 100,000 in the beta, so it’s not tiny, and we will be expanding that to probably 1 million people by the end of the year.
Tesla FSD Beta enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
It’s true that FSD beta is capable of driving impressive distances without driver interventions, but it has also been known to be inconsistent, and most objective people who have been using the Beta believe that it is still far from being operated without driver supervision, which would be required to have a robotaxi.
We don’t have a lot of data to show if the system is improving beyond the anecdotal videos mentioned by Musk.
When asked to share more data about the program, especially the driver intervention rate, the CEO instead said that people should just join the FSD Beta program.
In order to have access to the FSD Beta program, you first need to have purchased or subscribed to the FSD package, which costs up to $12,000 depending on when youe bought it. Then, you need to have a high enough “Driver Safety Score,” and even then, Tesla has been known to not include everyone with a high enough score.
To be fair, an order of magnitude (10x) increase in people in the Beta program by the end of the year would be impressive. I don’t even know if there are currently 1 million Tesla owners who purchased the FSD package.
However, there’s a giant gap between a robotaxi and FSD Beta. A giant gap. 
I know I sound like a broken record, but I think Tesla and Musk have been wrong so many times about their publicized timelines and goals when it comes to FSD that they need to do two things to regain some goodwill. 
I think Tesla needs to offer refunds on the FSD package for those who want it, and it needs to start relating concrete disengagement and driver intervention data. It would help track actual progress with the program.

2022/05/16,"Tesla currently has the top three electric cars in the United States so far in 2022, and the competition isn’t even close.
The United States is trailing far behind Europe and China when it comes to electrifying its passenger car market. There are many factors at play, including weaker incentives and a preference for pickup trucks, which is a segment that is just now being electrified.
But, we are starting to see a significant increase in EV adoption over the last year, and this last quarter was particularly important for EV adoption in the United States.
As we previously reported, the United States saw a 29% increase in EV deliveries compared to last year, according to data coming from CARB.
Now Experian is out with more data giving us a better idea of the most popular electric vehicles in the United States so far this year:
As you can see, Tesla has the top 3 most popular electric vehicle in the United States and the first two are in a league of their own in terms of volume.
Model S comes in third with over 9,000 units delivered in Q1 2022 – 33% more than the Mustang Mach-E that comes in fourth despite the former’s average sale price likely being twice as high as the latter’s.
However, the important thing to keep in mind is that those numbers are not representative of the demand for these vehicles but rather the production capacity or US allocation for each.
Most of the vehicles on this list have four to 12 months wait times for deliveries on new orders, but they are production-limited and, in the cases of vehicles like the IOniq 5 and EV6, they are limited by the allocations that Hyundai gives to US dealers.
Tesla has been early in investing in high volume production of its electric vehicles – giving it a massive lead with more than 70% of all electric vehicles in the United States being produced by the now-Texas-based automaker.
Speaking of Texas, Tesla is still heavily investing in production in the United States with Gigafactory Texas in Austin, which should help ramp up Model Y deliveries in the United States and extend the electric SUV’s lead.
Until other EVs come to market in high volumes next year, like the Ford F-150 Lightning, Tesla is expected to remain alone at the top.

2022/05/16,"Uber has launched a new product called “Comfort Electric” to get people to ride in electric vehicles, more specifically the Tesla and Polestar vehicles that the ride-sharing companies have been helping its drivers get.
Over the last few years, Uber has been making a lot of moves to make electric vehicles a larger part of its fleet. In 2020, the company announced an $800 million investment to push for electrification. We noted that the plan wasn’t really ambitious since they were aiming for all-electric by 2040.
However, since the announcement, we have been seeing more electrification moves from them. The company partnered with Arrival to design an EV specifically for ride-share drivers, but it will take some time until those vehicles come to market – if ever.
In the shorter term, Uber has ordered up to 50,000 Tesla vehicles that it is making available to drivers through its partnership with Hertz by 2023. Uber also has a similar deal on Polestar vehicles, but it is on a longer timeline.
Now that some of those electric vehicles are starting to be deployed, Uber announced the Comfort Electric product for riders so that riders can specifically request them:
As part of Uber’s global commitment to becoming a zero-emissions mobility platform by 2040, we’re continuing to take steps to help you go electric. Last year, we announced a partnership with Hertz to make up to 50,000 Teslas available for drivers to rent by 2023. Now, with more electric vehicles on the road in the US than ever before, we’re excited to introduce Comfort Electric, our newest way for you to get around town in style and be a part of the climate solution. It’s as simple as tap a button and request a ride in a premium EV like a Tesla or Polestar. Comfort Electric is now available in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Dubai, with more cities to come soon.
The product sits above Uber Green, which includes both electric vehicles and hybrids, and below Uber Black.
It comes at a significant premium, according to first reports:
New @Uber option starting today in Los Angeles, San Diego and S.F.: Comfort Electric. Get a ride in an EV including Teslas and Polestars. pic.twitter.com/D1qcTp8CwO
Along with the new product for riders, Uber also launched a new EV Hub for drivers that includes everything they need to go electric:
Helping earners go electric is core to our goal of becoming the cleanest mobility platform in the world. That’s why we’ve built an EV Hub in the Uber Driver app, a one-stop shop where they can get information and incentives to join the electric revolution, and even compare the cost of ownership of an EV with a non-EV.
Uber is also including a Charging Map directly to the Driver app to help Uber EV drivers find charging solutions near them.

2022/05/16,"Tesla has officially delayed Gigafactory Shanghai’s ramp-up back to pre-shutdown production capacity as it remains on one closed-loop shift for at least another week. This delay will likely result in Tesla missing out on about 10,000 vehicles produced this quarter.
Like many other companies, Tesla had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory last month after local authorities imposed serious lockdowns on the population in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 after a surge in cases during the first quarter.
The automaker was finally able to restart production on April 19 after 22 days of being shut down.
Tesla brought back 8,000 people to work in a “closed-loop” shift and sleep at the factory to help reduce worker movements in the city. At the time, we noted that on top of missing 22 days of production, it would take time for Tesla to ramp production back up to pre-lockdown levels.
Earlier this month, we learned that Tesla was actually making a lot of progress and aimed to ramp production back to 2,600 vehicles per day by May 16. However, we noted at the time that it appears to be an ambitious goal that is going to be difficult to achieve.
Sure enough, Tesla confirmed supplier issues last week that some reports suggested resulted in production stalling to just 200 units a day.
Now a new internal memo shows that Tesla is sticking to one shift for now and doesn’t plan to ramp up to 2,600 units until at least May 23 (via Reuters):
But the latest memo said that it plans to stick to one shift for its Shanghai plant for the current week with a daily output of around 1,200 units. It also said that it would now aim to increase output to 2,600 units per day from May 23.
Many businesses in Shanghai are currently only allowed to operate under a closed-loop system where workers sleep at the factories to limit exposure to COVID-19; for Tesla to bring in another shift would require them to accommodate thousands more employees at the factory.
On top of its own employee issues due to local restrictions related to the pandemic, Tesla continues to have supply issues as it relies on other local Shanghai suppliers who are also operating under the same conditions.
The market is currently trying to estimate the impact of the Gigafactory Shanghai shutdown and current ramp up to full production capacity during Tesla’s second quarter.

2022/05/16,"Tesla has decided to close reservations for the Cybertruck in Europe and Asia, and it is now only taking reservations for the electric pickup truck in North America, where the vehicle is expected to come next year.
The Cybertruck was unveiled back in 2019. The electric pickup truck was already supposed to be in production, but the automaker delayed the program as it focused on growing Model Y production.
Now, the company is guiding a start of production in 2023 for the Cybertruck. In the meantime, Tesla is still taking reservations for the electric pickup truck. 
The Cybertruck reservation program has been quite successful – CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla received over 250,000 reservations for the Cybertruck within a week of unveiling the vehicle. Generally, Tesla receives a lot of reservations early after an unveiling, and then it tapers off, but that wasn’t the case with the Cybertruck.
Even throughout the pandemic, sources told us that some Tesla stores were getting hundreds of Cybertruck reservations per week, and Cybertruck pre-orders even helped boost sales. The number was last updated in June 2020, and at that point, the number had risen to over 650,000 Cybertruck reservations.
A crowdsourced Cybertruck reservation tally by the Cybertruck forum with over 28,000 entries put reservations at over one million back in May 2021. The number has kept growing over the last year, and it is now estimated to be close to 1.5 million reservations.
Musk recently said that Tesla has enough Cybertruck reservations that it would only deliver to reservation holders for at least the first three years of production.
Now, Tesla has removed the option to reserve the Cybertruck for anyone outside of North America:
Tesla was previously taking reservations also in Europe and Asia. In Europe, the Cybertruck was expected to come much later than in North America, which is not unusual for Tesla as the company generally starts deliveries where a new vehicle is being produced.
In this case, the Cybertruck is going to be produced at Gigafactory Texas in Austin.
Tesla was also expected to run into some regulatory issues with the Cybertruck in Europe due to its design. The company has been considering a smaller and slightly redesigned version of the electric pickup truck for the market.
As for the version that is going to be built in Texas, we are still waiting for details of the production version after Tesla removed Cybertruck specs and pricing from its website late last year.

2022/05/16,"Last week, French company Renault announced its plan to fully review spinning off its electric car business into a separate company in 2023, in hopes of catching up with rivals Tesla and Volkswagen.
Renault said that the new EV spin-off could bring on board 10,000 new employees by 2023, and its business model would be “adapted to the specificities of electric vehicles and would be able to forge partnerships in new technologies and services,” according to a statement from Renault.
The company says that it is studying the possibility of combining its ICE and hybrid engine and transmission activities outside of France. The EV business, which would be kept in France, could potentially be grouped together under the mobility brand name Mobilize.
The goal of the plan is to add value to its electric business, and particularly to attract Telsa-like valuations while phasing out ICE sales in the coming years. Renault plans to go purely electric by 2030 – and with the French government holding a 15% stake in the company, keeping its high-profile EV business in the country is essential, with the tandem goal of relocating the combustion division outside of France.
Rumors of the plans stirred in April, when media reports said that CEO Luca de Meo presented the idea to analysts, which he later confirmed. Still, it’s not clear in which form the plan will take shape.Earlier this year Ford announced that it would split its car business into two separate units, with electric vehicles to be designed and manufactured under Ford Model e and ICE models under Ford Blue. General Motors, too, is facing pressures to separate its dusty ICE business from tainting the public appeal of an electric future, but media reports suggest the company is debating the financial necessity of this – EVs and conventional cars share some 80% common parts, “and people who develop most of both kinds of vehicles are scrambled up in carmakers like eggs in an omelette,” reports Bloomberg. So separating the two businesses isn’t always easy. Meanwhile, the nimble young Polestar in Sweden, which spun-off as EV brand from Volvo, has been criticized for its lack of a clear branding image, which further points to the difficulties in striking a balance between a fiery upstart and a safety-backed legacy brand the likes of Volvo.
Nissan just announced that it is too early to spin off its own electric vehicle company. Renault owns a majority stake of Nissan, which in turn has a 15% non-voting stake in Renault – Renault’s CEO Meo plans to meet executives in Japan to discuss the proposal.

2022/05/16,"Tesla is again rumored to be near a deal for a major new battery venture in Indonesia after a new round of talks with officials and even CEO Elon Musk meeting with the Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.
It’s not the first time that talks of Tesla making a major investment in Indonesia have emerged.
In 2020, we reported on Tesla allegedly being in talks with the Indonesian government to build a new nickel venture in the country, which has a strong nickel reserve.
Nickel is one of the main materials used in the production of cathodes for battery cells used in electric vehicles.
The move came after CEO Elon Musk pleaded with mining companies to increase their nickel production.
Later, we also learned that Tesla was actually in talks with Indonesia not just about nickel, but to possibly build a full battery factory in the country.
As we detailed in our previous report on Tesla’s interest in Indonesia, the country is one of the world’s biggest nickel producers, but it has also recently put a ban on exporting nickel ore in order to encourage the industry to process it locally.
In short, the country is saying that if you want its resources, you are going to have to create jobs and process nickel locally or even produce the battery cells in the country.
The strategy has been working with LG Energy signing a massive ~$10 billion deal to make batteries in Indonesia. CATL also announced a large investment in battery production in the country.
LG Energy and CATL are both suppliers of battery cells for Tesla, but now it looks like the automaker getting directly involved in Indonesia is back in the cards.
After a year without new information on Tesla’s plans in Indonesia, the rumor mill is back in operation amid a new round of talks between Tesla and officials.
During an interview last week, CEO Elon Musk was directly asked if Tesla plans a battery or cathode factory in Indonesia, and the CEO refused to comment.
Now we learned that while he was asked that question, Tesla actually had representatives in Indonesia to talk with government officials (via Reuters):
Representatives from Tesla were in Indonesia last week for meetings regarding a potential battery-related investment, Indonesian officials and two people familiar with the talks have said.
Rumors that the two parties are now closer to a deal are ramping up as Musk then met President Jokowi over the weekend.
They have reportedly met at Tesla Gigafactory Texas before Musk invited the president to visit SpaceX’s facilities in Boca Chica, Texas:
Seusai berdiskusi di kantornya, @ElonMusk mengajak saya meninjau lokasi fasilitas produksi roket Space X di Boca Chica, Amerika Serikat. Sejam lamanya kami melihat-lihat dari dekat pabrik roket Space X.Saya juga telah mengundang Elon Musk untuk datang ke Indonesia. pic.twitter.com/U3TKgfwNBW
Representatives for the president said that they discussed “a potential investment in Indonesia’s nickel industry and supply of batteries for electric vehicles.”
Musk previously said that Tesla aims to announce locations for new factories by the end of the year.

2022/05/14,"Tesla is trying to help the grid in its new home state of Texas as rising temperatures cause record electricity demand in the state.
The automaker is pushing a new in-car alert to encourage off-peak charging.
Texas has a notoriously fragile grid that is having issues supporting increasing peak electricity demand.
The issues have mostly come in the winter amid cold fronts, but the state’s electric grid is now not handling these early summer temperatures very well.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) announced that six power generation facilities tripped offline yesterday.
In a statement propagated yesterday, ERCOT commented asked Texans to limit their electricity usage between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m:
With unseasonably hot weather driving record demand across Texas, ERCOT continues to work closely with the power industry to make sure Texans have the power they need. This afternoon, six power generation facilities tripped offline resulting in the loss of approximately 2,900 MW of electricity. At this time, all generation resources available are operating. We’re asking Texans to conserve power when they can by setting their thermostats to 78-degrees or above and avoiding the usage of large appliances (such as dishwashers, washers and dryers) during peak hours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. through the weekend.
Interestingly, Tesla picked up the statement and shared the advice with its fleet of electric vehicle owners in Texas.
In a new in-car notification, the automaker recommended to owners not to charge during peak hours (via Karlan Mitchell on Reddit):
A heat wave is expected to impact the grid in Texas over the next few days. The grid operator recommends to avoid charging during peak hours between 3pm and 8pm, if possible, to help statewide efforts to manage demand.
While Tesla is most known in Texas for its Gigafactory in Austin and moving its headquarters there last year, the company also has important plans to help the electric grid in the state.
The company has deployed a big energy storage project made of 81 Megapacks, and it plans to deploy a lot more residential storage and solar.
Tesla is installing solar roofs and Powerwalls in new homes in a giant new residential project in Austin, Texas, and its energy division, Tesla Energy, is expected to do more on that front since officially entering Texas’ mostly deregulated energy market.

2022/05/13,"Tesla has officially abandoned its effort to enter the Indian market and even started to reassign local employees. The automaker couldn’t get the government to change its mind on high import tariffs for foreign electric vehicles. 
India has the biggest auto market that Tesla has yet to enter.
For years, Elon Musk said that Tesla’s launch in India was imminent, but strong import tariffs have made it difficult. Nonetheless, the automaker has had some indications of preparing for a launch over the last year.
In 2021, Tesla officially incorporated an Indian company in Bengaluru, the capital of India’s southern Karnataka state. During the summer, Indian government officials said that they are considering Tesla’s proposal to greatly reduce import duties for electric cars, which has been the main hurdle for the company to enter the market.
The government has maintained high import duties on EVs to encourage local production, but so far, it has mainly resulted in preventing automakers to import popular EVs produced outside the country, including in China.
Tesla has expressed interest in building a factory in the country, but as it has done in every other market, the automaker prefers to first test the waters with imported vehicles.
More recently, Tesla vehicles have been spotted being tested on Indian roads, and it got seven electric vehicle variants approved in the country.
But months later, Tesla had yet to move forward with service centers and Supercharger stations.
It looks like the automaker was still waiting for the Indian government to lower import duties, but it wouldn’t budge despite a strong lobbying effort from Tesla.
Last month, transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced that Tesla is still welcome to build a factory in India, but it doesn’t want Tesla to import vehicles from China.
It looks like this was the last blow to Tesla’s effort to launch in India as the automaker has now officially stopped its search for service center and Supercharger locations in the country. It has also started to reassign employees (via Reuters):
Tesla Inc. has put on hold plans to sell electric cars in India, abandoned a search for showroom space and reassigned some of its domestic team after failing to secure lower import taxes, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
For example, Tesla’s head of Indian policy and business development based in Delhi, Manuj Khurana, has been moved to the US for a “product” role.
India’s protectionist strategy doesn’t seem to be working with Tesla, which is not ready to build a new factory just to enter a new market yet, but it did work with Mercedes-Benz, which recently announced plans to start assembling electric cars in India in order to launch in the market.

2022/05/12,"During a media day for Magna International’s “Tech Week,” we got to visit the M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan, to test drive some of the contract manufacturer’s electrified tech. This included a GMC Sierra 2500 converted to a BEV using Magna’s Etelligent Force 4WD powertrain. With it, we were able experience the system’s 14,500 lb towing capacity and drive some other unique EVs too. 
Even if you haven’t heard of Magna International, it’s a safe bet you’ve driven a vehicle that contains at lease one component the contract manufacturer has produced. During its “Tech Week” event in Pontiac, Michigan, Magna CEO Swamy Kotagiri detailed some of the company’s production numbers. 
In total, Magna has produced over 3.7 million vehicles across thirty different models for ten different OEM customers including the likes of Ford, Rivian, GM, and soon, Fisker. In 2021 alone, Magna garnered $36 billion in sales, solidifying its title as the largest contract manufacturer in North America and the fourth largest in the world.
As the automotive industry as a whole is shifting drastically toward electrified models, Magna has followed suit. By developing everything from electrified powertrains, to battery enclosures, and ADAS systems, Magna is providing several OEMs with the technology and components to go all-EV. Here is a quick recap of some of the electrified tech we’ve covered from Magna in the past:
After covering this electrified technology from afar, Magna International was nice enough to invite us out to the M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan, to experience it first hand. This included Magna’s eDS Low CE 3-in-1 eDrive front axle system, currently present on the Volkswagen ID.4. 
What’s cool about this electric motor is that it manufactured without rare earth materials, making it more sustainable and cost effective.
Behind that EV in line was a Tesla Model S equipped with Magna’s EtelligentDrive system. This 3-in-1 eDrive system uses a motor at the front axle and two in the rear joined by a summation gearbox with clutch-based torque vectoring. The result is a Tesla sedan with 480 kW of total power that was built years before the Model S Plaid came out; it currently sits as an early example of Magna’s electrified expertise.
One of the more interesting BEVs available to drive during Magna’s event was the Arcfox αT, an electrified model sold in China as part of a joint venture between Magna and Beijing Electric Vehicle Co. Ltd (BJEV).
I got to drive the FWD version around the M1 Concourse and was excited at the opportunity to drive a Chinese EV, a market I have a particular adoration for. The design itself felt very European, and I thought it was a smooth drive all-around. Nothing too flashy or luxurious, but nothing to scoff at either. The overall performance quality was certainly apparent.
The dual-motor, AWD version of the αT comes with a battery capacity of 67.3 or 93.6 kWh, delivering NEDC ranges between 525-708 km (326-440 miles). It can accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.2 seconds and reach a top speed of 180 km/h (~112 mph).
The one electrified model most of the journalists were clamoring to drive was the GMC Sierra equipped with Magna’s EtelligentForce technology. Magna had two of the Sierra’s available to drive, so my first few laps were in the electrified pickup without the trailer to experience the truck itself.
EtelligentForce is a drop-in 4WD powertrain system for passenger trucks and light commercial vehicles that electrifies the vehicle’s capabilities without compromising its payload or towing. 
Magna’s eBeam is part of the system and can assist in OEMs electrifying existing ladder frame chassis without having to start over with a ground up platform. eBeam also helps provide 14,500 lbs of towing capacity, which was on display at M1 during our test drives.
While consumers will soon be able to purchase an all-electric GMC Sierra Denali pickup, we got to experience the towing technology early using a combustion model GMC Sierra 2500 made electric with Magna’s EtelligentDrive powertrain swapped in. 
The electrified pickup drove smoothly, offering regenerative braking while towing over 10,000 pounds on a trailer behind it. Magna’s EtelligentDrive system is available on Class 1 to 6 vehicles. Here’s the electrified GMC pickup in action:
After hearing from the company’s CEO, there’s a lot to be optimistic about as Magna continues to grow its arsenal of EV technology. Its eDrive components will appear in more and more EVs from OEMs going forward, including the Fisker Ocean which begins production with Magna in Austria this fall. Additional vehicles include an unnamed OEM in China in 2023 (Magna currently manufacturers for NIO and XPeng, so it’s probably one of those two), and an American OEM in 2024.
A major focus of Magna looking ahead will be its battery enclosures, which have already been developed and implemented in EVs like the Ford F-150 Lightning and GMC Hummer EV pickup. Magna’s CEO wouldn’t elaborate on what future models it would provide enclosures to, but the company is confident it will continue work with those same automakers in the future.
Kotagiri explained that Magna’s manufacturing of enclosures is both material and processing agnostic, meaning it can design and build EV battery enclosures to any customer’s specifications. 
The best part is, every EV needs one, so Magna is in a lucrative position to provide to the growing demand for such components. Kotagiri also shared that Magna is investing about $500 million to expand battery enclosure assembly lines over the next three years. 
Overall, this was a cool trip to Michigan to see a bunch of the EV tech – that we have covered for years – operate in real life. There’s a lot to be high on at Magna, as the company continues to make money hand over fist with no signs of slowing down as it shifts toward electrification.

2022/05/12,"Elon Musk is reportedly looking to secure more equity for the acquisition of Twitter in order to proceed without billions of dollars worth of loans back by Tesla shares. It comes as Tesla’s share price has fallen to significantly.
Last month, Twitter’s board officially accepted Elon Musk’s acquisition offer. It still needs to go to a shareholder’s vote and some details are still being figured out but in the meantime, Musk has proven that he has the funding ready for the transaction.
However, it looks like he might be changing things up a bit.
Ahead of the offer being accepted, Musk showed that he managed to secure $25.5 billion of fully committed debt and margin loan financing, most of which is backed by his stake in Tesla, and he is going to provide an additional $21.0 billion in equity himself, with money from previous sales of Tesla shares.
Over the last few weeks, he revealed several partners proving over $8 billion in equity, including Tesla board member and Oracle founder Larry Ellison providing $1 billion. With the new funding, Musk reduced the number of loans backed by his Tesla shares to $6.25 billion.
Now, Musk is apparently looking to raise enough capital through other investors to avoid Tesla-backed loans completely (Bloomberg):
Elon Musk is in talks to raise enough equity and preferred financing for his proposed buyout of Twitter Inc. to eliminate the need for any margin loan linked to his Tesla Inc. shares, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The billionaire’s advisers, led by Morgan Stanley, have begun soliciting interest from potential investors for as much as $6 billion in preferred equity financing, the people said, asking not to be named discussing a private transaction.
The moves come after Tesla’s stock crashed to levels not seen since last summer:
Tesla’s stock is going down amidst a broader market correction, and it is bad timing for Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

2022/05/12,"A bunch of maniacs decided to turn a Tesla Model 3 into a tank with some giant chain tracks – resulting in a 6-ton electric off-roading machine.
At Electrek, we believe every ground transport vehicle is going to go battery-electric over the next few decades, and that includes off-roading vehicles. It is certainly not a priority segment to electrify, but it slowly getting some electric options.
Some people can’t wait, though, and decide to build some themselves using existing electric cars. Tesla vehicles, thanks to their popularity and great electric powertrains, have been popular for those conversions.
We have seen Tesla owners putting snow tracks on their vehicles and off-road suspensions to make the Model 3 the ultimate off-road machine, but all of those efforts don’t hold a candle to what these German YouTubers did with this Model 3.
They added giant tank tracks to the electric car, turning it into a giant 6-ton electric tank:
It took them four weeks to build the vehicle, and most of that time was spent on building those giant tracks using 1.3-ton chains.
The result is undoubtedly impressive; uou end up with a Model 3 with 80 cm (31″) of ground clearance that is going to be able to some rough terrain.
The YouTuber added a front winch with a 6-ton capacity in case those tracks get stuck somewhere. They haven’t release a video of the vehicle being tested off-road, but they say that it is coming soon.

2022/05/11,"Tesla has asked Panasonic to speed up its development of the 4680 battery cell, which is going to power its next-gen electric vehicles.
The Japanese manufacturer is reportedly still looking for a location for a US factory.
Back in 2020, Tesla unveiled its 4680 battery cell, a new tab-less battery cell in a bigger format with new chemistry, enabling cheaper and/or longer-range electric vehicles.
The cells have already made it to the Model Y being produced at Gigafactory Texas. For the first time, the automaker its using its own cells to support its electric vehicle production.
However, Tesla is going to need so many cells that it is also partnering with current battery suppliers to deploy their own production of the new 4680 cell.
Panasonic, Tesla’s oldest battery partner, has tentatively announced that it would be deploying a prototype production line for the new battery cell.
Later, Panasonic’s new CEO, Yuki Kusumi, said that it is prepared to make a “large investment” in producing Tesla’s new battery cell if test production proves successful.
In October 2021, the Japanese manufacturer unveiled its own 4680 cell developed with Tesla. Later, Panasonic greenlit a $700 million investment to produce the 4680 cell in Japan, and it has been rumored to be looking for a location for a new factory in the US to produce the cells.
Now Hirokazu Umeda, Panasonic’s Chief Financial Officer, said that Tesla has been pushing for a faster development of the 4680 cell:
We can’t say more than what has been released, but we are getting many requests. We seeing continued strong demand from Tesla, for 2170 batteries, but also for faster development of the 4680.
Tesla is currently deploying 4680 production capacity at Gigafactory Texas and Berlin, and it doesn’t anticipate a battery cell shortage to support its production until next year when it starts production of the Cybertruck.
The average Cybertruck will likely use twice the battery capacity as Tesla’s average Model 3 and Model Y, its most popular vehicles. It will greatly increase Tesla’s demand for battery cells, and it will rely on both internal production and production from suppliers establishing 4680 cell capacity, like Panasonic.

2022/05/11,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk shut down the idea of Tesla buying another automaker, but the CEO seems very open about the automaker possibly buying a mining company.
Ever since Tesla’s valuation surged to over $500 billion, there have been rumors about the company absorbing smaller but more established automakers.
At the FT Future of the Car conference yesterday, Musk was asked directly about that possibility, but the CEO made it clear that it’s not in the plans.
Musk has previously commented on Tesla preferring to build a factory from the ground up rather than retrofitting one for EV production as it did at Fremont factory, which it acquired from Toyota and used to be operated under the Toyota/GM Nummi partnership.
However, Musk was also asked about Tesla potentially buying a mining company and the CEO was much more open to that idea:
It’s not out of the question. We will address whatever limitations are on accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. It’s not that we wish to buy mining companies, but if that’s the only way to accelerate the transition, then we will do that.
The prospect comes amid rapidly rising costs of key minerals for battery production.
In response to those rising costs, Musk said last month that Tesla “might” now get into the lithium mining business even though it’s already supposed to be in it.
At Tesla’s Battery Day event in 2020, the automaker announced that it is getting into the mining business – starting with buying lithium claims on 10,000 acres in Nevada.
However, almost two years later, Tesla has yet to do anything with this claim or a new lithium mining technology announced at the same event.
But now with lithium prices 400% higher since that original announcement, Tesla seems to be making more moves in the space.
We are not talking about buying mines just yet. Tesla is more focused on securing long-term supply agreements with existing miners and potential new mines, but it sounds like outright buying a mining company to take over its workforce and accelerate production is not out of the question.
Tesla did try to buy a lithium mining startup back in 2014, but the deal failed.

2022/05/10,"Tesla will add CCS connectors to its Supercharger stations in the United States to let non-Tesla EV owners access the extensive charging network.
The company already announced plans to open its Supercharger network to all-electric vehicles globally, but the rollout of the initiative has been slow and is currently limited to Europe. The move makes sense considering Tesla has adopted the CCS standards in Europe like all other automakers and its Supercharger stations are already equipped with CCS connectors.
In North America, Tesla uses its own proprietary connector on both its vehicles and its Supercharger stations. This approach prevents non-Tesla EV owners from using the Supercharger network and limits Tesla owners to the Supercharger network for fast-charging unless they can get their hands on a CHAdeMO or CCS adapter.
It hasn’t been clear how Tesla plans to implement its plan to open the Supercharger network in the United States, but CEO Elon Musk previously talked about having an adapter at the stations for non-Tesla EV owners to use.
Now at the FT Future of Cars Conference, Musk hinted that Tesla will be adding the CCS connectors directly at the stations:
“It’s a little trickier in the US because we have a different connector than the rest of the industry, but we will be adding the rest of the industry connector as an option to Superchargers in the US.”
This comes after Tesla filed for incentives to deploy Supercharger stations in Texas with both CCS and Tesla connectors.
It’s also an approach similar to the one that Tesla took in Europe when first switching to the CCS standard with the Model 3. New Supercharger stations would get both Tesla and CCS connectors, and the automaker started to retrofit some existing stations as well.
The CEO didn’t offer a timeline on when Tesla plans to start adding CCS connectors to stations in the United States.
There’s going to be a balance to achieve in terms of giving non-Tesla EV owners more charging options and not alienating Tesla owners by overloading the already well-loaded Supercharger network. 
If done right, opening will unlock a lot of value for the Supercharger network and non-Tesla EVs – especially if Tesla releases a CCS adapter.
Tesla is learning some from the pilot program in Europe right now, but these lessons won’t all apply to the United States, where the charging infrastructure for non-Tesla EVs is more limited.
It’s going to be interesting to see this story develop in the next few months.

2022/05/10,"Elon Musk said that Tesla may stop taking orders on some models of its popular electric vehicles because of the long delivery timelines.
There’s currently a rush to order electric vehicles as the technology gains momentum – both naturally, as it becomes more mainstream, and in the short term, more directly through the gas price increase.
For Tesla, we previously reported that this has resulted in a significant increase in its order rate in several regions of the US. In March, this resulted in many Tesla models being sold out until 2023 in the US. That’s despite several price increases throughout Tesla’s entire lineup over the last two years.
Now Tesla is even considering stopping taking orders on some models. CEO Elon Musk said during an interview at the FT Future of Cars Conference:
Demand is now exceeding production to a ridiculous degree. We are actually probably going to limit or just stop taking orders for anything beyond a certain period of time because some of the timing (for delivery of new orders) is more than a year away.”
The comment comes as Tesla updated many delivery timelines for some of its most popular vehicles in the US. A new order of a base Model Y now shows a delivery timeline of February 2023–May 2023. More expensive versions of the vehicle, like the Model Y Performance, get a much faster delivery timeline of July to September 2022.
Over the last year, Tesla has also started to offer faster delivery timelines by adding some options on certain trims. For example, the base Model Y (Long Range AWD) gets a faster November 2022–February 2023 delivery timeline if you add the bigger 20-inch wheels, which cost an extra $2,000.
Model 3 is also still popular, but the delivery timelines are more reasonable than with Model Y. All trims of the Model 3 can get delivered by the end of the year in the US.
If Tesla stops taking orders on some trims of its vehicles, the base Model Y is likely going to be the first one to go.
Now you might think: What’s the advantage of not taking new orders? Don’t you just want as big of a backlog as possible?
Yes, but the delivery timelines are becoming long enough that people are now buying a vehicle that is probably going to be different by the time they get it. Tesla is always updating its vehicles, and if you are getting yours a year after ordering it, it is likely going to have several new features and changes.
Also, the price is likely going to change. Tesla is now delivering new Model Ys to people who ordered them last year for $5,000 to $10,000 cheaper than it is to buy one right now with a new order.
Elon Musk recently explained Tesla’s difficulties in adjusting pricing for vehicles that they are delivering six to twelve months from now, especially with rising costs of materials.
So while Tesla does want to have a significant backlog of orders, there comes a point where it becomes too difficult to manage.

2022/05/10,"Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai has managed to produce over 10,000 electric vehicles in April despite the factory being shut down for most of the month.
The automaker had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory in late March after local authorities imposed serious lockdowns on the population in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 after a surge in cases during the first quarter.
The automaker was finally able to restart production on April 19 after 22 days of being shut down. Tesla brought back 8,000 people to work in a “closed-loop” shift and had employees sleep at the factory to help reduce worker movements in the city.
At the time, we noted that on top of missing 22 days of production, it would take time for Tesla to ramp production back up to prelockdown levels. Last week, we learned that Tesla had made a lot of progress and aimed to ramp production back to 2,600 vehicles per day by May 16. However, today, we reported on some supply issues temporarily slowing production to a crawl for the coming days.
Investors and analysts are trying to understand how the shutdown and ramp-up are going to affect Tesla’s performance in Q2 – especially now that Gigafactory Shanghai is now Tesla’s most productive factory.
We got our first glimpse of data that helped us gauge the impact as the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) confirmed Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai produced 10,757 vehicles by the end of April, delivering 1,512 of them. However, that is significantly down from over 65,000 vehicles coming out of the factory in March.
The impact resulted in missing out on over 55,000 vehicles as of the end of April. Even though production had restarted by May, the production ramp-up is expected to have an impact throughout this month, especially with recently reported supply chain issues.

2022/05/10,"Tesla issued a new recall affecting almost 130,000 2021 and 2022 vehicles over a problem regarding the CPU of the center screen’s computer overheating.
The good news is that the fix is again an over-the-air software update.
The automaker has detected a problem where the center display may become laggy due to CPU overheating when pre-conditioning the battery pack for Supercharging or when Supercharging:
Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2021-2022 Model S, Model X, and 2022 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles operating certain firmware releases. The infotainment central processing unit (CPU) may overheat during the preparation or process of fast-charging, causing the CPU to lag or restart.
When Supercharging, it’s not a safety risk that warrants a recall, but NHTSA determines that an official recall is needed since it can affect critical functions when pre-conditioning the pack on the way to a Supercharger.
Tesla wrote in the recall notice:
A lagging or restarting CPU may prevent the center screen from displaying the rearview camera image, gear selection, windshield visibility control settings, and warning lights, increasing the risk of a crash.
Fortunately, Tesla believes it can fix the issue with a software update, and, therefore, there will be no physical recall:
Tesla will perform an over-the-air (OTA) software update that will improve CPU temperature management, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed July 1, 2022. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752. Tesla’s number for this recall is SB-22-00-009.
129,960 Tesla vehicles are affected. Here are the specific models:
As usual, Tesla will contact the specific owners with an official recall notice, but the software fix will likely already be pushed to the car by then.
Lately, Tesla has had to issue a lot of recalls, but most of them were minor issues that were fixed by simple over-the-air software updates.
For example, the automaker issued a recall that was reported as a “massive” recall on over 800,000 vehicles due to “a seat belt issue,” which sounds pretty bad, but in fact, it had to do with a reminder alert to buckle the seat belt that sometimes wouldn’t appear under very specific conditions.
It is creating a situation where the media sensationalizes major “recalls” when, in fact, a simple over-the-air software update is needed, and no owner actually needs to bring back the car to a dealership or service center, as is the case with traditional recalls.
It actually highlights one of Tesla’s biggest advantages over the rest of the industry: the high level of connectivity in its vehicles, and its lack of reliance on third-party dealers to service them.

2022/05/10,"Tesla is facing a setback in ramping up production at Gigafactory Shanghai after the three-week shutdown of the plant. Some supply issues are negatively affecting production to the point that it might need to shut down again.
Like many other companies, Tesla had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory last month after local authorities imposed serious lockdowns on the population in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 after a surge in cases during the first quarter.
The automaker was finally able to restart production on April 19 after 22 days of being shut down.

Last week, we learned that Tesla was actually making a lot of progress and aimed to ramp production back to 2,600 vehicles per day by May 16.
However, it looks like Tesla has hit a setback based on several media reports coming out of China. Reuters reported that Tesla had to stop production on Tuesday due to part shortages.
A Tesla China spokesperson told Bloomberg that production has not stopped at Gigafactory Shanghai, but they confirmed that the automaker is having some supply issues.
Reuters updated its report to say that production output today will be limited to just 200 vehicles due to the supply constraints. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo added that the reopening was unstable due to supply and logistics bottlenecks but that those were temporary:
(1/3)Tesla Giga Shanghai resumption updates:1. The production after reopening is unstable, and main bottlenecks are component supply & logistics.2. The halted production is considered temporary, so Tesla hasn't yet moved orders from Shanghai factory to others since lockdowns. https://t.co/REHQTgvUDo
Sources told Bloomberg that production may have to completely stop later this week if the supply issues are not solved.
The reports don’t go into details about the nature of the supply issues, but Aptiv, a company that supplies wire harnesses to Tesla, recently announced that it had to halt shipments. It is expected to contribute to Tesla’s current supply issues.

2022/05/09,"Tesla released interesting and rare details about its approach to sourcing lithium, nickel, and cobalt directly from mines instead of through its cell suppliers. This approach is going to be critical as companies fight to secure those minerals for battery production to support electric vehicle growth.
While Tesla sources the vast majority of its battery cells from suppliers, it actually sources a large part of the materials used to build those batteries directly from mines.
This approach enables Tesla to have direct relationships with miners of critical minerals and helps secure supply while allowing the company to monitor quality closely and ensure responsible environmental and social sourcing.
Tesla explained in its latest Impact Report:
While cobalt, nickel, and lithium go through multiple processing steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and social data.
Tesla even released some very rare and interesting details about the effort.
The automaker says that it had directly sourced over 95% of the lithium hydroxide, 50% of the cobalt, and more than 30% of the nickel used in its high-energy density cells (NCA and NCM) in 2021. The rest came from deals between the battery cell manufacturers and their own material suppliers.
As we previously reported, Tesla also released a list of the nine mining companies that are supplying those minerals.
Another, less discussed aspect of the company’s Impact Report is that it makes it clear how aware Tesla is that mining and its environmental and social impact are going to become more significant challenges for EV adoption in the future.
The automaker wrote:
Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also “minerals” – in that they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the impact of mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors.
In response, Tesla has joined the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), and the company’s direct-sourcing approach also helps ensure the implementation of those standards.
",tesla
2022/05/09,"Tesla confirmed that it has significantly increased its battery recycling capacity over the last year, but it currently only sees a few battery packs from consumer vehicles coming back. This effort is key to making battery-electric vehicles sustainable long term.
When it comes to emissions throughout the entire life cycle, electric vehicles have two main advantages over gas-powered vehicles.
Electric vehicle owners have more choices of energy sources to charge their vehicles than just gasoline to operate their vehicles. They can charge their vehicles using renewable energy, which will greatly reduce emissions generated by the use of their vehicles.
On the manufacturing front, EV detractors often claim that the energy and resources that it takes to build batteries counterbalance all the tailpipe advantages. However, those detractors often leave out battery recycling, which makes all the difference for the full-emission cycles for electric vehicles since you can recover most of the materials in a battery pack.
Originally, Tesla has been working with third-party recyclers, but we reported on the company working on its own “unique battery recycling system“ back in 2019.
Last year, Tesla reported that it achieved 92% battery cell material recovery in its new recycling process, and it recycled 1,300 tons of nickel, 400 tons of copper, and 80 tons of cobalt in 2020.
In Tesla’s 2021 Impact Report, it has released an update on its battery recycling effort. In 2021, Tesla increased its battery material recycling to 1,500 tons of nickel, 300 tons of copper, and 200 tons of cobalt.
Interestingly, copper recovery went down, but cobalt recovery went up significantly. At the current price of $80,000 per ton for cobalt, Tesla has recovered the equivalent of $16 million worth of cobalt last year.
With the recent surge in nickel prices, the nickel recovered by Tesla last year is worth more than $45 million now.
Tesla also confirmed that it significantly increased its recycling capacity with a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material per week at the end of 2021. While the automaker has increased the capacity, it says that it is still receiving a only small number of battery packs to recycle from consumers’ vehicles. Interestingly, Tesla noted that most packs that it has recycled come from vehicles that have been used as taxis or for taxi-like services:
The small number of post-consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles on the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.
Tesla says that most battery packs it currently recycles come from its R&D and quality control departments:
Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped lithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal ecosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.
The automaker did note that “battery recycling will play a critical role” in supplying battery materials; it recognized that the industry is going to have to rely on expanding mined material production in order to support the growth of electric vehicles.
In the impact report, Tesla also included an update on its effort to secure more battery materials from mining companies.

2022/05/09,"Herbert Diess, the CEO of the Volkswagen Group, believes that the German automaker can sell more electric cars than Tesla by 2025. Is that goal even possible?
When it comes to all-electric vehicle sales, everyone is trying to catch up to Tesla, but the automaker has a big lead, and it’s not slowing down.
With early investments in electric vehicles and making it clear that it is willing to learn from Tesla, VW has been seen as a potential contender. At the FT Future of the Car 2022 conference today, Diess said that VW has for goal to beat Tesla to the become the top EV automaker by 2025 – though he admitted that it will be difficult (via Reuters):
It will be a tight race but we won’t give up on it. I have to say we didn’t expect our main U.S. competitor to be so fast and well-prepared.
Last quarter, the VW group – which includes Porsche, Audi, and others – delivered 99,064 all-electric vehicles. During the same period, Tesla delivered over 310,000 all-electric vehicles.
This is a tough task because Tesla is a moving target. The automaker already has a bigger EV production capacity than any other automaker, and it is adding more capacity faster than anyone.
By 2025, Tesla will likely have a production capacity of more than four million electric cars per year. I’d be surprised if VW can jump from 400,000 to four million units in just three years.
They have the advantage of having quite a few brands and a lot more EV models coming to market than Tesla, but it just hasn’t been able to compete on volume.
I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the goal of beating Tesla by 2025 also matches the timing of VW’s expected release of the production version of the ID. Life, an electric car that should launch for less than $25,000.
With Tesla seemingly being willing to give up the lower-end of the market, there’s an opportunity for VW to come in and deliver a lot of volume in the large market of vehicles that start under $30,000.
But are they going to have high enough volumes by 2025? I have my doubts.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/05/09,"Tesla has filed a lawsuit against Alexander Yatskov, a recently hired engineer who Tesla claims stole trade secrets related to its Dojo supercomputer project.
It’s the latest in a series of lawsuits that Tesla has filed against former employees who have participated in stealing important information, according to the automaker.
In this case, first reported by Bloomberg, Yatskov was only recently hired by Tesla back in January.
He was hired as a thermal engineer, though now Tesla claims that he lied about his qualifications, and he was assigned to the Dojo project to work on a cooling system.
Project Dojo is a new supercomputer that Tesla is developing to help train its neural nets, which are primarily used in its self-driving effort.
Tesla claims that quickly after starting the job, Yatskov started downloading “confidential and tightly guarded” information related to the Dojo supercomputer project to his personal computer.
In the lawsuit, the company claims that Yatskov admitted to stealing the information when confronted about it. He was placed on administrative leave starting April 6, 2022, and asked to bring Tesla his personal laptop to recover the allegedly stolen information.
Tesla claims that the engineer brought the company a “dummy laptop” that was set up to make it look like he only accessed “inoffensive Tesla information, like an offer letter” and not trade secrets related to Dojo.
Yatskov ended up resigning from Tesla on May 2.
The company writes in the lawsuit:
This is a case about illicit retention of trade secrets by an employee who, in his short time at Tesla, already demonstrated a track record of lying and then lying again by providing a “dummy” device to try and cover his tracks. 
As part of the lawsuitTesla is seeking “compensatory and exemplary damages and an order that would stop Yatskov from disseminating its trade secrets and direct him to return all proprietary data.”
It’s not the first time that Tesla is suing former employees over alleged stolen information.
Tesla is currently suing Rivian and former employees hired by the EV startup over allegedly stealing information related to its “next-gen battery.”
Previously, the company also sued a former employee who went to work at Xpeng after Tesla claimed that the engineer stole the Autopilot source code.
Finally, Tesla also won a lawsuit against self-driving startup Zoox for the theft of some proprietary information related to its logistics systems.

2022/05/06,"Tesla has released a list of direct battery material suppliers and confirmed that it has a long-term nickel deal with Vale, the world’s largest nickel producer.
There’s currently a race to secure battery materials in order to support the rapid growth of the EV industry. Several players in the industry have been raising the alarm that there are going to be massive shortages of some of the key materials.
Generally, the miners and refiners deal with the battery cell manufacturers and not the automakers, but the latter started building direct relationships with miners of base metals in order to secure long-term contracts and ensure the flow of batteries years ahead.
Tesla has been amongst the early automakers looking to build those relationships – on top of starting to build its own battery cells recently.
For the first time, Tesla released a list of all its “direct supplier relationships in the battery supply chain”:
Most of these suppliers were known to have a relationship with Tesla; Vale has been rumored lately to have “secret deals” for long-term nickel supply with Tesla. The list confirms the supply relationship.
Vale commented on its following Tesla’s disclosure today:
Vale notes the disclosure by Tesla Inc today and confirms it signed a long-term contract with Tesla Inc to supply Class 1 nickel in the United States from its operations in Canada. This agreement is in line with our strategy to increase exposure to the electric vehicle industry, leveraging our low-carbon footprint and market-leading position as North America’s largest producer of finished nickel.
Deshnee Naidoo, Vale’s Executive Vice President of Base Metals, added: 
We are pleased to have the leading electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla among our customers. This agreement reflects a shared commitment to sustainability and shows very clearly we are the supplier-of-choice for low-carbon and high purity nickel products essential for long-range batteries.
It shows that Tesla is building strong relationships with some of the world’s biggest mining companies in order to secure long-term supply.

2022/05/06,"Tesla (TSLA) is adding shifts at Gigafactory Shanghai in the hopes to return to full production this month after being shut down for 22 days.
Like many other companies, Tesla had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory last month after local authorities imposed serious lockdowns on the population in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 after a surge in cases during the first quarter.
The automaker was finally able to restart production on April 19 after 22 days of being shut down.
Tesla brought back 8,000 people to work in a “closed-loop” shift and sleep at the factory to help reduce worker movements in the city.
At the time, we noted that on top of missing 22 days of production, it would take time for Tesla to ramp production back up to pre-lockdown levels.
A few weeks later, we get a better idea of Tesla’s timeline to ramp production backup thanks to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.
The memo stated that Tesla plans to add more shifts starting on May 16 in order to ramp production back to 2,600 vehicles per day:
Tesla is aiming to increase its Shanghai plant’s daily output to 2,600 cars from May 16, an internal memo seen by Reuters said, as it seeks to return production to levels before the city locked down to control the spread of COVID-19.
That would be an impressive ramp-up in production that shows the truly giant production capacity of the factory.
At 2,600 vehicles per day, it would put Gigafactory Shanghai’s annualized production capacity back to over 900,000 vehicles per year.
With the production shutdown and ramp-up back up, Tesla likely missed out on over 100,000 vehicles from the plant in the second quarter, but CEO Elon Musk said that the automaker still has a shot at maintaining its record-level of deliveries this quarter.
Moderate outputs from Gigafactory Berlin and Texas are starting to contribute to Tesla’s global production capacity, but they are not expected to have a significant impact until toward the end of this year.

2022/05/05,"Tesla is reportedly looking to expand at Gigafactory Berlin with the acquisition of a piece of land adjacent to the plant.
Gigafactory Berlin currently sits on about 300 hectares that Tesla acquired for the giant manufacturing project.
Now we learn that Tesla is looking to acquire a 100-hectare parcel of land next to its existing property (via RBB24):
The Tesla company is planning to massively expand its property in Grünheide (Oder-Spree). The rbb learned this from official circles. Accordingly, the company intends to purchase approximately 100 hectares of land located directly east of the Tesla site between the RE1 railway line and the L23 and L38 state roads.
According to the information that the German media company received, Tesla plans to build a train station and storage areas on the new land:
Tesla had already announced in 2020 that it would have as many supplier products as possible delivered to the Grünheide plant by train. Completed Teslas are also to be transported away by rail. The group is now planning additional storage areas and a freight station for this purpose. This suggests that Tesla plans to keep the rest of its property free for future car factory expansions.
The plan is reportedly not finalized and a price for the new parcel has not been determined yet – though it sounds like it could be around €13 million (or about $13.7 million).
If it goes through and the plan is approved, construction should start next summer.
In the meantime, Tesla is currently trying to ramp up production of the Model Y at the factory while also establishing battery cell production at the plant, but there are some challenges.
As we reported yesterday, an environmental group has called for Tesla Gigafactory Berlin’s operating license to be revoked after learning of a paint leak around the paint shop.
A source familiar with the matter told Electrek that the paint shop is currently one of the main bottlenecks for Tesla to expand production at Gigafactory Berlin.

2022/05/04,"Tesla is going to supply up to 8 MWh of Powerpacks for SpaceX to expand its solar farm at Starbase in Boca Chica. It’s the latest of many collaborations between Tesla and SpaceX.
SpaceX has a solar farm at its Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. It consists of 1 MW of solar power and 3.87 MWh of energy storage capacity.
New documents uncovered by CNBC show that SpaceX plans to expand the solar facility:
“The expansion underway, with construction expected to take place over two years in all, would add 750 kilowatts of power for a total of 1.6 MWs of energy, and an additional battery system enabling up to 8 MW-hours of storage, the documents said.”
The documents show that the new energy storage capacity is going to consist of Tesla Powerpacks. It’s the latest of many collaborations between Musk’s two biggest companies, Tesla and SpaceX.
Due to the former being a public company and Musk being involved in both, Tesla has to report transactions between the companies.
Tesla started providing Powerpacks for SpaceX at its Texas facilities back in 2018.
Last year, SpaceX bought $2.8 million worth of components from Tesla.
Here’s a list of some of the transactions between Tesla and SpaceX for 2021 and the first quarter of 2022:
SpaceX also licenses software from Tesla and the automaker has provided some engineering work for the launch provider.

2022/05/04,"The Green League, an environmental group, has launched an effort to revoke Tesla’s operating license for Gigafactory Berlin after learning of a significant paint leak.
Part of the reason why it took so long for Tesla to obtain its operating license at Gigafactory Berlin was environmental groups, including The Green League, petitioning the courts to stop the project for a myriad of reasons from deforestation to water control.
It didn’t work because Tesla finally managed to obtain its operating license during the first week of March.
But the environmental groups are not giving up even though the factory is now in production.
The Green League applied with the authorities of the district of Oder-Spree to have the license revoked after they learned of an incident involving a paint leak at Gigafactory Berlin.
RBB24 reported on the incident (translated from German):
According to the State Environment Agency and the lower Oder-Spree water authority, 15,000 liters of a paint mixture leaked out in the Tesla paint shop on April 11, which was pumped out by a disposal company. A day later, when loading, two to three liters ran onto the access road and were bound. The liquid is considered slightly hazardous to water.
A state report does claim that the paint did not get into the sewage system or groundwater.
Nonetheless, The Green League is asking for the license to be revoked until Tesla paves some unpaved areas around the paint shop to help prevent hazardous materials from entering the aquifer.
The group claims that if the district doesn’t act on its request, it will ask the Ministry of the Environment to intervene.
Tesla Gigafactory Berlin is currently producing Model Y vehicles for the European market. 
A report last month claimed that Tesla was producing about 350 Model Ys per week at the plant and pushing to get to 1,000 units per week by the end of the month.
A source familiar with the matter told Electrek that the paint shop is actually the main bottleneck in Tesla’s production at Gigafactory Berlin at the moment.

2022/05/03,"Tesla has updated the Model S and Model X with a new motorized swivel function for the center screen. The feature enables a better viewing experience in the car as the automaker is betting on more in-car entertainment.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been putting a lot of efforts into entertainment inside its vehicles. From Tesla Theater for streaming services to video games, there have been a lot of software updates to bring new features to entertain inside its electric vehicles.
The automaker is even doing some hardware design around entertainment. That has become evident  with the refreshed Model S and Model X. Tesla’s two flagship vehicles got a new large horizontal center display that is better suited for watching videos and a new backseat display powered by a gaming computer.
Now Tesla has made the center display in the Model S and Model X even more entertainment friendly by adding a swivel capability:
Tesla finally added screen swivel to the refreshed model s pic.twitter.com/JeldBrRTXw
The powered front trunk is an aftermarket modification made by the person making the video, Larry Li, and not something that is standard in Tesla vehicles, but the motorized swivel screen is brand new.
It’s not clear when Tesla made the change to the Model S and Model X, but Li mentioned that the vehicle was produced during the last week of April. It would be fair to assume that Model S and Model X vehicles produced since then are equipped with this new version of the center display.
As you can see, the swivel gives enough of an angle to either make the screen face more toward the driver or full-on face the front passenger.
The change enables a better driver-focused experience, but the degree to which it can swivel to the right also makes it perfect for the front passenger to use the screen.
Tesla currently doesn’t enable video playback on the center display when the vehicle is not in park, but that’s expected to change in the future as Tesla achieves a higher level of autonomous driving.

2022/05/03,"Tesla says it will turn Shanghai into “the world’s largest vehicle export hub” with a new factory capable of producing 450,000 electric vehicles per year, next to the existing plant.
Gigafactory Shanghai is a massive success for Tesla and enabled the automaker to grow at an impressive rate during the pandemic while the rest of the auto industry slowed down.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk disclosed that Gigafactory Shanghai has now surpassed Fremont Factory in production capacity, and Tesla has made the Chinese factory its new main export hub. The factory looked unstoppable, until it was shut down for most of last month due to serious COVID-19 restrictions in Shanghai.
Tesla finally managed to restart production a few weeks ago, and now we learned that it received significant help from the local authorities.
In a letter that Tesla sent to authorities on May 1 and obtained by Reuters, the automaker thanks local authorities in Shanghai’s Lingang Special Area for their help in transporting more than 6,000 workers and doing disinfection work to reopen Gigafactory Shanghai.
The city reportedly provided buses to help carry the employees to the workplace and operate in a “closed-loop” system with workers sleeping at the plant.
More interestingly, Tesla mentioned in the letter the new factory that they are building next to Gigafactory Shanghai and confirmed that they plan to build Model 3 and Model Y vehicles there. According to the letter,
The company will build a new plant on nearby land in the same area, which is poised to add an annual capacity of 450,000 cars, including Model 3s and Model Ys, becoming “the world’s largest vehicle export hub. 
Back in February, there were several indications that Tesla planned to use the land next to Giga Shanghai to build either a brand new factory or a major expansion to the existing plant.
There’s no clear timeline for the expansion, but it looks like it will bring Tesla’s capacity in Shanghai to 1 million cars per year once completed.
This is a wild expansion.
Along with Giga Shanghai, Tesla is also simultaneously planning a similar capacity in Berlin and Texas, but the company plans to also start with a capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year at each factory. We are talking about 1.5 to 2.5 million vehicles of annual production capacity to be added in the next two to three years.
That’s why I think Tesla is going to keep its lead in electrification for the foreseeable future. If it really can build the supply chain around that capacity, Tesla will have an EV production capacity of more than two million vehicles by the end of next year.

2022/05/03,"Tesla has decided to cancel any employee bonuses tied to its quarterly delivery quotas. The automaker is also raising base salaries for sales and delivery employees to compensate for the bonuses going away.
However, it looks like it will result in an overall reduction in compensation for most of those Tesla employees.
Tesla famously uses a different distribution model than most other automakers by owning stores across the US instead of relying on third-party dealerships.
That means that it also controls the compensation of its sales employees. Many people believe that it means Tesla doesn’t use commissions, but the automaker actually did for years.
Things started to change in 2019 when CEO Elon Musk said that they plan to move all sales online-only, close most stores, and reduce retail headcount.
It resulted in Tesla slashing retail employee compensation and closing a first wave of stores, but the automaker ended up reversing some of those changes and has since not only kept most stores open, but it has now significantly expanded its retail presence.
While the idea of closing stores went away, the reduction in employee compensations, especially through removing the commissions model, stayed.
Tesla was still offering bonuses to its sales and delivery staff, but it was based on bigger store-based and region-based quarterly delivery quotas. If those quotas were made, employees would get a 25% bonus on their salaries issued in a choice of cash or stock options on a vesting schedule.
Now sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is canceling those employee bonuses too.
In order to compensate for the bonuses going away, Tesla is raising sales and delivery employee base salaries by 12.5%.
The bonus model was quite successful for Tesla with delivery records for seven quarters in a row. Historically, most Tesla employees have been getting their bonuses every quarter for the past two years, and therefore, it will be a reduction in total compensation for them.
But it will remove the stress of hitting the quarterly quotas.
Late last year, Tesla started to tell employees to focus less on the end-of-quarter delivery waves, which have historically been a big part of Tesla’s quarterly results. 
Production at new factories in Berlin and Austin is expected to improve the flow of vehicles throughout the quarters and reduce the need to squeeze more deliveries toward the end of quarters, but the impact is mostly going to be felt once production ramped up at those facilities, which is expected to happen during the second half of the year.
As discussed, this is effectively another reduction in overall compensation for sales and delivery employees, who have already seen their compensation slashed on several occasions over the last three years.
In hindsight, the changes to the compensation model in 2019 were more understandable considering we later learned that Tesla was in a massive cash crunch related to introducing the Model 3 in Europe at the time.
But now a few years later, Tesla is in a completely different financial position with record deliveries and record profits. Those sales and delivery employees are a big part of what made that success possible.
Unfortunately, it looks like Tesla doesn’t feel like it needs to compensate them for it due to the demand currently being organically extremely strong. It’s a shame.
What do you think? Do you think the salary increase is enough to compensate for the bonuses going away? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/05/03,"You’ve read about all the improvements to emerge both inside and out each current Tesla model as well as the new versions to come in the future, and maybe you’re more than a little bit tempted. Next, reality sets in, and that age old question rears its head: “how much?” No need to click through several variations of each model on Tesla’s website, it’s all been compiled for you here. 
The information below offers the lowest and highest price version of each trim of every 2022 Tesla model to give you the full spectrum of how little… or how much… you’ll have to spend. 
Note that these prices are accurate as of publish date, but we’ll keep them updated. Bear with us as Tesla seems to change its prices often. Furthermore, all prices listed do not include the additional $1,200 destination and doc fees, or federal or state tax credits.
Despite its role as the most affordable Tesla, the Model 3 has seen some large price hikes in 2022. Its Standard Range RWD trim starts at a purchase price of $48,490 with zero upgrades, and can go as high as $63,490.  The latter price includes every top feature available such as red paint, 19″ sport wheels, and the ever-controversial full-self driving capability for $12,000. 
The Long Range Model 3 starts at $57,490 and can reach a top end price of $72,490 fully loaded. 
Lastly, the Performance version of the Model 3 starts at $62,990 and can go even higher to $77,990 with 20″ Überturbine wheels and all other added features. No matter which trim you choose, you also now have to pay for your mobile or wall charging connector. 
Prices on the Model 3 continue to fluctuate every couple weeks, but you can save some cash by getting yourself a pre-owned Model 3. 
As a much larger EV, Tesla’s Model Y currently comes in two different options, both of which are priced higher than the Model 3. For the prices below, you’ll see the bare bones option as well as the completely loaded option with add-ons like red paint, 20″ wheels, white interior, a tow hitch, and the $12k FSD capabilities – although choosing not to add FSD could affect your delivery date. 
An important add-on to point out in all of these high end prices is the seven seat interior for the Model Y. For an extra $3,000, customers are able to select the third row option as they order their new EV. 
Note: This option is currently only available on the Long Range trim.
The Model Y’s dual-motor AWD Long Range trim starts at a base price of $62,990 and can jump to $83,990 with all the fixins’. This higher price includes all the available features mentioned above. 
The Model Y Performance drivetrain starts at $67,990 and increases to $83,990 when souped up (without the seven seats). 
Recently, we covered news that Tesla is preparing to launch a new AWD of the Model Y with a puzzling 279 miles of range. However, we do not have any pricing on that version yet. 
Here’s where things really start to increase quickly. Where the newer Teslas like the Model 3 and Model Y combine performance with value, the Model S instead dominates in nearly every category, but at a much higher price point. 
For example, the Dual Motor Model S (the EV’s least expensive trim) begins at a  price of $104,490 and can currently go as high as $120,990 including add-ons like 21″ Arachnid wheels and cream interior. 
Hold onto something because it’s “Plaid” time. You may have already read about how impressive the Plaid Model S is, but the only thing larger than its list of top specs is its price tag. 
The Tri Motor Model S Plaid starts out at a cool $140,490 with zero upgrades, not even an exterior color. All in, you’re looking at purchase price of $156,990. 
Pound for pound, Tesla’s refreshed Model X SUV is the automaker’s largest and most expensive EV, with AWD dual and tri motor drivetrains to choose from.
The Model X Dual Motor will cost you $120,490 at the bare minimum. It then vaults up to $143,490 with added bonuses like 22″ Turbine wheels, cream interior, and a $6,500 up-charge for a six seat interior that includes captain’s chairs. If you prefer the seven-seat row, that will cost $3,000 less. 
As for the new Plaid version of the Model X in lieu if the previous Performance trim, that starts at $144,490 and levels out at $160,990. The top end prices includes all the most expensive features. 
Like the Model S, The Model X also saw an increase of $10k after the Plaid+ disappeared, and it has jumped another $5k since then. New customers for the Model X Plaid are not scheduled to receive their EV until fall, and Dual motor reservations holders who order today are looking at a delivery window between December 2022 and March 2023. Might be worth considering a pre-owned Model X if you’re truly thirsting for one,
This is more evidence that the demand for Tesla EVs is still growing, no matter how much they cost. The automaker remains the dominant name in the EV market. 
Since the Cybertruck has not rolled off the assembly line yet, the pricing is not as granular.  Nevertheless, the public was briefly offered an idea of the starting price for each of the three drivetrains. 
Originally, the single-motor RWD Cybertruck was listed on Tesla’s website at a starting price of $49,900. The dual-motor AWD option was $59,900, and the tri-motor AWD was set at $79,900. 
However, production has been delayed yet again, and although we’ve spotted some prototypes out driving around, we no longer have a grasp on what this EV behemoth will cost when it eventually arrives. Since last October, the pricing and specs of the Cybertruck are no longer listed on Tesla’s website.
The interest is still there however, since the last tally of reservations totaled over $80 billion (with a b) in value. 
The next iteration of the Roadster was unveiled by Tesla in 2017 as an updated homage to the EV that started it all. Originally scheduled to begin production in 2020, Tesla has continuously punted the SOP of the new Roadster to focus on its other EVs.
While we know very little about what the Cybertruck will truly be capable of, we know even less about the 2nd generation Roadster.
Per Tesla’s website, the new Roadster is still available for pre-order, and it only costs $200,000. Don’t worry though, you only have to pay a fraction of that to hold your spot in line… just $50,000. 
If that’s not enough, Tesla is offering what it calls its “Founder’s Series Roadster” which appears to be a limited production run costing $250,000. This version required the full amount down within ten days of making the reservation, and has since sold out. 
You may have noticed that the order page of any of Tesla’s current models lists both the “purchase price”  as well as the “(price) after potential savings.” This pricing is referring to is the original purchase price minus the potential savings of driving an electric vehicle. 
Tesla has compiled its own database of resources by state to help its customers calculate their potential savings before they even commit to buy. Additionally, you can tap or click the “customize” link on any Tesla model purchase page. 
This multi-faceted tool helps estimate what a potential owner would spend on gas over a six year period, then subtracts it from the total. This gives prospective Tesla customers a bit of texture as to what sort of bucks they may be saving in the future by cutting the gasoline cable.
Any state without listed tax incentives may still offer benefits. You will just need to check the list on Tesla’s dedicated incentives page, showcasing federal and state benefits with greater detail. 
It’s also important to note that all incentives mostly apply to purchases by cash or loan only. Incentives for customers leasing a Tesla are currently only available in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Tennessee. 
You’ve done the research, customized your dream Tesla model, and have ballpark pricing after calculating gas savings and tax incentives in your state. Nice work. 
Before you pull the trigger though, you might want to ask yourself if buying your Tesla or leasing it will be the better option. The answer varies by customer based off a multitude of different factors of which we compiled for you previously.
Picking up a Tesla isn’t going to be cheap no matter how you slice it, but there’s definitely a wide range of options available to you. 
From the bottom-end Model 3 at around $49k to the top-end Model X Plaid reaching $161k at its most, there’s something in this lineup for most any prospective Tesla customer.

2022/05/02,"Tesla’s own CCS adapter was spotted charging a Model Y at over 200 kW – a first for Tesla’s elusive adapter. Is it finally going to be available?
With the launch of the Model 3 and its Supercharger V3 in Europe, Tesla switched its main charging standard to CCS.
The automaker ended up launching a CCS adapter for Model S and Model X owners to be able to use the growing CCS charging station networks.
Tesla made the adapter – which is CCS to Type 2 (standard charge connector in Europe) – available in some markets, but it never released a CCS adapter for its own proprietary connector, which the automaker uses for its vehicles in North America and a few other markets.
This left Tesla owners in North America unable to take advantage of growing third-party charging networks using the CCS standard, like Electrify America.
In 2020, Tesla announced that such a CCS1 adapter is coming, but it only made it available in Korea for some reason.
There’s strong demand for the adapter in North America – enough that many Tesla owners started jumping through hoops to import the CCS1 adapter.
When launching the ~$250 adapter in Korea, Tesla said that it was rated for 150 kW, but now a Model Y owner who imported it managed to charge at 205 kW at an EVgo station with it (via Reddit):
As you can see, it charged at 205 kW at 19% state of charge, and it settled at just over 100 kW when passing 50% state of charge. It’s not clear how the adapter is doing better than its rated capacity when it was announced. It could be a software update after further testing.
Hopefully, it means that Tesla might finally be closer to launching the CCS1 adapter in North America.
In the meantime, it’s still possible to get it directly from Tesla in Korea. A Tesla owner put together a very useful guide about it.

2022/04/29,"Tesla has sent some Powerwalls to Ukraine in order to help power some “ambulant clinics” in Irpin and Borodyanka. Power has been unreliable since the Russian invasion – making battery packs like Powerwalls super useful.
Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine and minister of digital transformation, announced on Twitter:
“Tesla Powerwall tech will power up two ambulant clinics in Irpin and Borodyanka. New solar panels and integrated battery systems will not only use renewable energy, but also store it for backup protection. We are grateful to Tesla and Elon Musk for this continuous support.”
He shared a few images of the Ukrainian forces unloading the solar equipment:

The politician mentions “continuous support” because it’s not the first time Tesla and Musk get involved. Musk’s SpaceX has famously been supplying Starlink terminals to provide satellite-based internet in the war-torn region, but Tesla has also been helping.
The automaker started by offering free Supercharging at some stations around Ukraine for electric vehicle owners fleeing the country. It later expanded the program to all stations in Poland and Slovakia as more refugees started entering those countries.
When SpaceX started supplying Starlink terminals, Tesla helped with the effort with a team at Gigafactory Berlin by packaging the Starlink terminals sent to Ukraine and adding Powerwalls.
Tesla later produced a video showing how to use Powerwall as a mobile power station.
Powerwalls generally require an extensive installation when used for backup power in a home, but Tesla showed a way to power a few critical pieces of equipment with the large battery pack in just a few minutes of installation.
It can also be recharged through a quick daisy chain of solar panels – making the Powerwalls into a useful mobile power station.
Now it looks like it will specifically help power some medical units.

2022/04/29,"Tesla has issued another “over-the-air recall,” and this time it’s on more than 48,000 Model 3 Performance vehicles over a problem with “track mode.”
Lately, Tesla has had to issue a lot of recalls, but most of them were minor issues that were fixed by simple over-the-air software updates.
For example, the automaker issued a recall that was reported as a “massive” recall on over 800,000 vehicles due to “a seat belt issue,” which sounds pretty bad, but, in fact, it had to do with a reminder alert to buckle the seat belt that sometimes wouldn’t appear under very specific conditions.
It is creating a situation where the media sensationalizes major “recalls” when, in fact, a simple over-the-air software update is needed, and no owner actually needs to bring back the car to a dealership or service center, as is the case with traditional recalls.
It actually highlights one of Tesla’s biggest advantages over the rest of the industry: the high level of connectivity in its vehicles, and its lack of reliance on third-party dealers to service them.
We are starting to call those recalls “over-the-air recalls,” since this doesn’t have the same negative connotation of physically “recalling” the vehicle back.
Now Tesla is issuing a new over-the-air recall affecting 48,184 2018-2022 Model 3 Performance vehicles.
The automaker describes the issue in the recall notice:
Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2018-2022 Model 3 Performance vehicles. The unit of speed (mph or km/h) may fail to display on the speedometer while in Track Mode. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 101, “Control and Displays.”
The automaker originally launched Track Mode for Model 3 Performance back in 2018. The software fine-tuned the dynamic controls for better track performance.
In 2020, Tesla released a new version of track mode: Track Mode V2.
The new version of the software included a lot more customization features and even included maps of some racetracks with a full video game-like experience inside the car.
Tesla is going to send all owners a notice of recall by June 6, 2022.

2022/04/29,"Tesla has reduced prices on its two home chargers after removing the one included with new vehicles being delivered. The automaker also added the chargers to its online configurator to remind new buyers to get one.
Last week, we reported on Tesla removing the included mobile charger from new vehicle purchases.
Since its inception, Tesla had been including a mobile charger with every new car it delivered, but CEO Elon Musk claimed that Tesla had “usage statistics” showing that the use of the chargers was “super low.”
We did question that claim, and some data show that Tesla owners frequently use the included mobile charger. However, it looks like Tesla is going forward with the move regardless. To soften the blow, Musk had announced that Tesla would reduce the price of the mobile charger.
Tesla has now followed through with Musk’s announcement of reducing the price of the charging solutions:
The price of the mobile connector is now $200 and the Tesla Wall Connector is $400. 
Tesla already had some of the best prices in the industry when it came to home charging stations, but these prices are particularly impressive, especially the Wall Connector since anything 48-amp and with Wifi connectivity generally start at at least $600.
Along with the price update, Tesla also added the charging solutions to its vehicle online configurator:
This is important, since buyers will now need to make sure they have a home charging solution when buying as they can’t rely on one being included with the vehicle.
As we suspected when Tesla first announced this move, this might be a supply issue because the mobile charger is back ordered. Now, in the configurator, it even says that deliveries are expected between August and October.
Fortunately for Tesla, that’s also when most new orders are expected to be delivered, but it still looks like Tesla is having issues securing enough mobile chargers.

2022/04/29,"Elon Musk confirmed that he sold about $8 billion worth of Tesla (TSLA) shares over the last few days, which sent the automaker’s stock spiraling down, but now he says he is done selling Tesla stocks.
Yesterday, we reported that Tesla’s stock was down 16% since the announcement that Twitter has accepted Musk’s offer to be acquired for roughly $44 billion.
We speculated that was either due to confusion among Tesla investors about Musk’s plan to finance the acquisition by selling more Tesla stocks or even Musk already selling stocks, which could be putting pressure on the stock.
Now Musk revealed through SEC filings with Tesla that he has indeed been selling shares on April 26 and 27 for a total of 8.4 million or about $8 billion worth.
Update: another filing shows that Musk also sold shares on April 28 – bringing the total to about $8 billion.
In a tweet following the disclosure, the CEO said that he doesn’t plan to sell more Tesla shares at this moment:
No further TSLA sales planned after today.
The sale represented about 6% of Musk’s entire Tesla stake and it is expected to be used as part of the $21 billion equity part of the Twitter acquisition.
So far, the Twitter deal contributed to erasing about $100 billion worth of market capitalization for Tesla.
This is where Musk’s Twitter business intertwines with Tesla’s. The CEO used to say that he will be “the last one to sell Tesla shares.”
Now it’s pretty clear that he will be the “last one to sell Tesla shares unless the acquisition of a large social network is involved.” That removes a lot of value in the commitment of Tesla’s largest individual shareholder not to sell shares, which has helped Tesla a lot over the years.
In principle, I’m not against Musk buying Twitter, and I do like a lot of the changes that he has talked about implementing at the platform, but at this point, it is hard to see how it aligns with Tesla’s much more important mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy and why he is willing to negatively affect Tesla’s stock to pursue that.

2022/04/28,"Update: Musk reported selling 4.4M TSLA shares valued at close to $4B on Tuesday, driving the price down over 100 points and likely to purchase TWTR shares. Musk noted this evening that he wouldn’t sell any additional TSLA shares. 
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is currently taking a beating and losing over $150 billion in value amidst the confusion around Elon Musk’s Twitter(TWTR) acquisition. The main question on investors’ minds is: is Elon Musk selling Tesla stocks?
After a few weeks of back and forth, Twitter’s board of directors approved the acquisition on Monday, and Tesla’s stock has been in a freefall ever since. There are definitely other broader market factors at play, but the bulk of the drop appears to be related to uncertainty around the Twitter deal.
There’s a lot of confusion.
Tesla’s stock is down 16% since the announcement that Twitter accepted the deal, and there were large sales of stock as soon as it was announced:
Tesla erased over $150 billion in market valuation throughout the week, and it doesn’t look like it’s stopping. There seems to be some confusion around the Twitter deal and its impact on Musk and Tesla, if any. 
One of the main concerns is that Twitter is going to take time from Musk away from Tesla, which is inevitable, and the only question is …how much time? 
Musk himself recently valued the time he spends at Tesla as being worth north of $1 million a minute because of the kind of business Tesla is doing these days, and the impact he has on it.
The other big factor is that investors don’t know if Musk is going to sell more Tesla shares to cover the Twitter acquisition deal. Musk already pledged shares of Tesla against $12 billion in debt for the deal, but he also needs to come up with $21 billion in equity.
Musk has not indicated whether or not he plans to sell Tesla shares to cover the deal, but it is a likely possibility.
It might be already happening, which could explain part of the drop in price, and if so, Musk would have to disclose it in the coming days.


Chart provided by TradingView


I don’t know if Musk is selling. If he is, we should know in the next few days. What is interesting, though, is that he can’t afford Tesla’s shares to get too low or it will prevent him from securing the loans he needs for the deal, which are backed by the value of Tesla shares.
If Tesla’s stock drop below $750 per share, it will start to be a problem and some of the banks offering Musk the money might start to backtrack. 
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Also, Musk has often said that he would be the last one to sell Tesla stock, which if he is indeed selling would be a bad signal to investors. Of course, he did it last year, but that was mainly to pay taxes on stock options as part of his CEO compensation deal. His stock holdings actually went up. 
To do it to buy a social media platform which would limit his time with Tesla is a completely different thing.

2022/04/27,"A judge sided with Elon Musk in a court case brought by investors over Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity, which they claimed was pushed by Musk to bail out the solar installer.
The court found that Musk was more involved than he should have been in the acquisition considering his interest on both sides, but the judge ultimately determined that Tesla didn’t overpay for SolarCity.
In 2016, Tesla’s board and shareholders approved a $2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity with a strong majority, but not everyone was happy. Several Tesla shareholders ended up filing lawsuits against Tesla’s board and Musk specifically.
They claimed that Musk initiated the acquisition to bail out SolarCity, which he was heavily invested in and was having financial difficulties at the time.
Some investors were also concerned about potential conflicts of interest because of all the relationships between Musk, his family and friends, and the two companies. SolarCity was led by Musk’s cousins, and several board members had relationships with Musk through previous investments or family. 
When investors sued, Tesla’s board quickly settled, but Musk insisted on going to trial, and it has been going on for years.
The trial happened last July, but Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware’s Court of Chancery has only today released his ruling and sided mostly with Musk.
The judge wrote in his opinion:
The preponderance of the evidence reveals that Tesla paid a fair price — SolarCity was, at a minimum, worth what Tesla paid for it, and the acquisition otherwise was highly beneficial to Tesla
Tesla did benefit from the acquisition of SolarCity – primarily for the deployment of its energy storage systems, especially the Powerwall. 
While the judge determined that Musk didn’t push the deal to enrich himself, he did say that the CEO, who was supposed to recuse himself when Tesla’s board was discussing the deal, was more involved than he should have been.
Regardless, the decision could put an end to six years of legal drama unless the investors, mainly union pension funds and asset managers, decide to appeal.

2022/04/27,"Dallas County has authorized the purchase of three Tesla Model 3 vehicles to be used by the local police. It’s the latest example of electric vehicles gaining popularity with law enforcement.
Tesla vehicles have become the go-to EV for police departments around the world. Many have started adding Tesla Model 3s to their fleets, most recently the NYPD.
Last year, the Model Y started to gain momentum.
Fremont police and the Spokane Police Department both bought Model Ys to use as patrol vehicles, and Boulder’s police department also went with the electric SUV.
Any type of use that requires a lot of mileage is going to benefit greatly from the gas and maintenance savings of going electric. Police patrol vehicles fit that use case.
Last week the Dallas County Commissioners approved the purchase of three Tesla Model 3 Performance vehicles for use by the local police.
They want to use them as police vehicles, but they haven’t had the time to validate the Tesla Model 3 based on their requirements. For fear of the backlog becoming too long, they decided to purchase the vehicles right away and place them in their reserve unit (via NBC):
A briefing given to the County Commissioners states “as a result of the ongoing semiconductor microchip and supply chain issues, the length of time to determine if vehicles meet the replacement criteria guidelines could potentially result in ordering banks from the manufacturers to be closed. The recommendation is to purchase the three Tesla Model 3 Performance electric vehicles and have them placed as part of the ASC reserve unit.
Tesla has a growing backlog of orders for many vehicles and trims, but the Model 3 Performance is one of the few versions that you can still get pretty fast with a listed delivery timeline of June to August for new orders.

2022/04/27,"A judge shut down Elon Musk’s effort to cancel the part of his settlement with the SEC over his ‘funding secured’ tweet that basically gave the agency the right to act as a sort of ‘Twitter police.’
It happened all the way back in 2018, but it’s still in the news today for a bunch of different reasons, ranging from Musk buying Twitter, civil lawsuits over the matter, and Musk’s own effort to walk back part of the settlement.
Earlier this month, Musk brought up the whole situation in an interview at TED and insisted that he didn’t lie about the funding being secured, and that he was forced to settle with the SEC to save Tesla.
Musk’s lawyers have petitioned the court to cancel the ‘Twitter police’ part of the deal after claiming that the SEC has been using the power to “harass” Tesla and Musk and “impede on his first amendment rights.”
Now, U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan has released his opinion  on the matter and has shut down the effort (via Bloomberg):
Musk cannot now seek to retract the agreement he knowingly and willingly entered by simply bemoaning that he felt like he had to agree to it at the time but now — once the specter of the litigation is a distant memory and his company has become, in his estimation, all but invincible — wishes that he had not. 
The decision comes after several emails and text messages between Musk and a representative of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) around the time of the infamous tweet have been released.
The communications revealed what appeared obvious to people looking at the situation objectively, which is that Musk and PIF had early discussions about taking Tesla private without discussing the details, and Musk was a bit too early in claiming ‘funding secured’ in his aforementioned tweet.
I understand where Musk is coming from. Tesla was in a difficult situation at that time, and I am sure he felt a lot of pressure to settle the conflict with the SEC, and he probably wouldn’t have agreed to the ‘Twitter police’ nonsense otherwise.
However, he doesn’t accept any blame for the situation.
The text messages along with Musk’s own deposition revealing his own version of the meeting with the PIF all point toward him being too relaxed with his words when claiming ‘funding secured’. The discussions were still early.
The fact that he still insists that it was OK to tweet that makes me think that he might actually need a Twitter police – however ridiculous that sounds.

2022/04/27,"Tesla announced the expansion of its virtual power plant (VPP) powered by its Powerwall to several new states and regions in Australia.
Australia, and especially South Australia, has had a lot of power issues over the years as it retires aging infrastructure and tries to manage a high penetration of renewable energy, which destabilized energy markets due to the inconsistency of the power supply.
Tesla first got involved by supplying its Powerpack in a large energy storage project owned by Neoen that became known as the “Tesla Big Battery.”
While in the region during the launch of the big battery, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was interviewed and presented with the significant hardship that Australia’s high electricity prices are putting on low-income families.
The unstable grid and high electricity costs result in some families having to decide between keeping the lights on or going hungry.
Musk was visibly emotionally affected by the issue and vowed that Tesla would “work harder” to help solve the problem.
He wasn’t kidding because a few months later Tesla announced that it reached a deal with the South Australian government to install solar arrays and Powerwalls on up to 50,000 homes – many of them homes of low-income families.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been deploying more Powerwalls to grow the virtual power plant, which provides grid services to reduce cost and backup power in case of a power outage. In return, the home battery packs are subsidized and reduce energy costs for the households.
In 2020, Tesla had 1,000 Powerwalls on the network, and they were authorized for a new phase to add another 3,000 batteries.
A year later, the company expanded the program by launching what it calls the “Tesla Energy Plan on the Tesla Virtual Power Plant,” which is basically a time of use energy plan specifically made for Powerwall owners in South Australia.
Last year, Tesla announced that it is expanding its Tesla Energy Plan and Tesla Virtual Power Plant to Victoria.
Now Tesla is announcing another expansion of its virtual power plant to other neighboring states and regions around South Australia and Victoria:
Australia’s largest Virtual Power Plant has expanded to New South Wales, South-East Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory with the Tesla Energy Plan.
Existing Tesla Powerwall owners or new buyers in those regions can now decide to opt into the VPP.
This is one of the main ways in which Tesla’s energy division is slowly becoming a global decentralized energy provider, which is one of the stated goals of Tesla Energy according to CEO Elon Musk.

2022/04/26,"Prices of used Tesla vehicles are out of control, as some used vehicles with over 30,000 miles on the odometer are selling for higher prices than new ones.
The used car marketplace has been wild over the last two years.
With new car production and sales being down amidst supply chain issues, many people turned to the used car market, and it pushed prices higher across the industry. This has been especially true for electric vehicles, which are more rare on the used car market, and Tesla vehicles are the most popular in the US as the Texas-based automaker still owns about 75% of the new EV market in the country.
Over the last year, we even started seeing used prices creeping over new vehicle prices, but that started being less true as Tesla increased prices of new vehicles again over the last few months.
Now, used prices are up again, and we are seeing many vehicles listed for higher than brand new Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles.
There are many people testing the market with high prices on third-party websites, but Tesla owns a large part of the used market for its vehicles, and its prices are non-negotiable and therefore, list prices are the actual prices those vehicles are being sold for.
For example, this 2020 Model Y with over 30,000 miles on the odomoter is listed for $1,000 more than if you were to order the same configuration brand new:
The only benefit is that you can get it now versus waiting for 6-9 months for a new one.
What is most impressive is how the vehicle gain in value. Depending on when it was purchased in 2020, the vehicle is likely selling between $6,000 and $10,000 more than what it was purchased for brand new about two years ago.
We saw several other used Model Ys listed for more than an equivalent brand new Model Y, like this 2021 Model Y with 15,000 miles in Illinois listed for over $80,000:
We also found a few used Model 3 vehicles selling for more than the new version, including this one in Los Angeles:
One interesting thing to note is that Tesla appears to be adding the Full Self-Driving package to all used vehicles it is reselling, which is helping to push prices higher.
As we recently reported, Tesla recently changed its policy to now not let anyone buy their car after their lease is over. This is increasing the automaker’s supply of used vehicles to resell.

2022/04/26,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) tumbled by as much as 10% this morning amid a broader market setback. Tesla seems to be particularly affected after India shut down the idea of Tesla importing cars from Giga Shanghai and questions about Elon Musk buying Twitter.
India has the biggest auto market that Tesla has yet to enter.
For years, Elon Musk said that Tesla’s launch in India was imminent, but strong import tariffs have made it difficult. Nonetheless, the automaker has had some indications of preparing for a launch over the last year.
In 2021, Tesla officially incorporated an Indian company in Bengaluru, the capital of India’s southern Karnataka state. During the summer, Indian government officials said that they are considering Tesla’s proposal to greatly reduce import duties for electric cars, which has been the main hurdle for the company to enter the market.
The government has maintained high import duties on EVs to encourage local production, but so far, it has mainly resulted in preventing automakers to import popular EVs produced outside the country, including in China.
Tesla has expressed interest in building a factory in the country, but as it has done in every other market, the automaker prefers to first test the waters with imported vehicles.
More recently, Tesla vehicles have been spotted being tested on Indian roads and it got seven electric vehicle variants approved in the country, but four months later, it has yet to launch in the country. 
Now, the Indian government appears to shut down Tesla’s plan as transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced that Tesla is still welcome to build a factory in India, but it doesn’t want Tesla to import vehicles from China:
Making in China and selling here is not a good proposition.
With Gigafactory Shanghai being Tesla’s main export hub, the first Tesla vehicles in India would have likely been coming from China.
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) was down by more than 9% this morning – trading at around $900 a share. The stock is also affected by a broader market setback with the NASDAQ being down 3%.
Tesla investors have also questions about Musk buying Twitter, which was confirmed yesterday, and how much time that will take the CEO away from Tesla, and if he is going to have to sell Tesla shares to cover some of the $21 billion in equity he needs to come up with for the acquisition.

2022/04/26,"According to the latest registration data, Tesla still owns about 75% of the US’s electric car market so far this year with Model Y and Model 3 alone at the top.
For years now, Tesla has been dominating the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market, but for now, the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla’s production and deliveries.
For the entire year of 2020, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the US.
In 2021, the number went down to 69.95%, but that’s still impressive with EV delivery volumes significantly increasing throughout the year along with Tesla’s prices.
Now we get the first data for 2022 through registration data from Kelley Blue Book (KBB), and it shows that Tesla had 75% of the EV market in the US during the first quarter of 2022 (January through March).
According to KNN, here are the top 10 EVs sold in the US in Q1 2022:
The data shows that Tesla is still king in terms of volume deliveries of electric vehicles in the US.
Ford came in third with the Mustang Mach-E, but it’s a far third place with 6,734 Mach-E deliveries during the period to 46,707 units for the Model 3, which came in second place.
During the period, KBB also notes that electric vehicles represented 5% of the overall auto market for the first time in the US.
It’s sad to think what the US’s EV market would look like without Tesla. Even with Tesla, it only represents about 5% of the overall auto market.
An important reason for that is the US auto market’s love for pickup trucks and the fact that they are just starting to go electric.
2023 should be a very different year for EV adoption in the US. I think it will shock many people. I wouldn’t be surprised if EV market share more than doubles and lands near 12% toward the end of the year.
That will be thanks to several new EV models hitting the market, but primarily due to a ramp-up of electric pickup production, especially from Ford, Rivian, and GM, and also the start of production of Tesla Cybertruck – though volume for the latter is more likely to come in 2024.
I see over 150,000 deliveries of electric pickup trucks in 2023 and a massive shift in how new car buyers see electric vehicles in the US. I think there will be a rush to reserve new electric vehicles that will make today’s long backlogs look like a joke. 
The shift in perception will be similar to what we have seen happen in other countries in Europe, like Norway and the Netherlands, a few years ago.

2022/04/25,"Tesla has launched a new competition to design the Cyberquad’s battery pack as the automaker appears to literally be crowdsourcing R&D for the electric ATV, though it’s more likely a recruiting effort.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck in 2019, CEO Elon Musk had a little “one more thing” moment on stage when they brought out the Tesla Cyberquad, an electric ATV, to show the payload capacity of the Cybertruck’s bed. At the time, it wasn’t clear whether Tesla planned on making the electric ATV available, but Musk later confirmed that it would be an option for Cybertruck buyers.
We haven’t heard much about the vehicle program since then, but it is not overly surprising since it has been linked to the Cybertruck, which has been delayed to 2023.
But now with the Cybertruck coming next year, Tesla is going to have to start working on bringing the electric ATV to market. It looks like the automaker is now doing just that, but it is taking a very surprising approach.
Through its official Weibo account in China, Tesla announced the launch of “the 2022 World Power Battery Conference Power Battery Integration and Management Technology Challenge”:
Tesla is calling for teams to submit designs for a battery pack designed to fit in the Cyberquad and equipped with 2170 cells. The automaker insinuates that the best design could actually end up in the electric ATV, but it is also giving out prizes for the best designs – they are going to be giving out up to RMB 200,000 (~$30,000 USD) in prices.
Tesla is calling for submissions not just from student teams, but any “innovation and research teams” can submit their designs for the Cyberquard battery pack. The competition will end in July.
While the automaker obviously doesn’t outright say it, it does insinuate that the best designs could need up in the electric ATV. It looks like Tesla is literally crowdsourcing R&D for the Cyberquad, but I think it’s more about recruiting than anything else.
However, it does show that Tesla might be looking to develop the Cyberquad in China, which would be surprising since Musk recently said that it would be produced at Giga Texas along with Cybertruck.
That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if both the Cybertruck and Cyberquad end up also being produced in China at some point.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/04/25,"As part of a lawsuit between shareholders and Elon Musk regarding his “funding secured” tweet, new text messages and emails between Musk and people involved have been released. 
The communications pretty much confirmed how most people saw the situation: Elon Musk took a meeting with the head of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and had early discussions about taking Tesla private, which he took as enough to say that the “funding was secured”.
The whole ‘”funding secured” situation is coming back to light because Musk is trying to buy Twitter to take it private, and the Tesla CEO is still embroiled in lawsuits over the situation. For those who don’t remember the situation, back in 2018, Musk briefly considered trying to bring Tesla private and disclosed that to investors through a simple tweet.
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that Musk exaggerated and misled shareholders when saying that the funding was “secured” in the tweet:
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Musk went on a campaign against the SEC, calling them names and claiming that they were working for people shorting the electric automaker. But ultimately, Tesla and Musk ended up reaching a settlement with the SEC.
As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down from the role of chairman of the board, and Tesla and Musk had to each pay $20 million in fines. 
The CEO presumably didn’t want Tesla to have to pay for his issue with the SEC. While he couldn’t directly pay for Tesla’s part of the fine, he decided to buy $20 million worth of shares from Tesla. That way, he sort of indirectly ended up paying for Tesla’s fine – though he also ended up with ~71,000 additional Tesla shares in the process.
As we previously reported, Musk ended up actually making money from the settlement due to Tesla’s stock price surging.
Another part of the settlement was that Musk and Tesla had to agree for the former to have his tweets reviewed by the latter’s legal department if they are material to the company.
Earlier this month, Musk brought up the whole situation in an interview at TED and insisted that he didn’t lie about the funding being secured, and that he was forced to settle with the SEC to save Tesla.
However, the CEO never went into the details of that said funding. There were always rumors that the Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) was interested in investing and taking Tesla private.
The common-sense explanation that most people agreed on is that Musk met with PIF, and they showed strong interest in taking Tesla private, and Musk took the meeting seriously enough to claim that funding was secured.
The SEC obviously disagreed with the level of commitment.
Now new text messages between Musk, Musk’s associates, and Yasir bin Othman Al-Rumayyan – the head of PIF – and his own associates, show behind the scenes of that common-sense explanation.
Here, Musk complains about PIF telling the media that it didn’t commit funds for taking Tesla private, and PIF responds that they need to see financial information and have a “kickoff call” with their team:
Musk was really “upset” that PIF wasn’t confirming his interpretation of their meeting:
In one text, Musk asked PIF to confirm that they are in discussions with Tesla and threatened to “never speak again” if they don’t:
This is a major problem. It is extremely important that you confirm that you are in discussions with me regarding the take-private transaction. Noting more needs to be said. If this is not said, we will never speak again. Never.
When things fell through with Saudi Arabia, texts messages even show that Musk reached out to Larry Page to invest in the deal. A recurring problem with Musk making any deal actually work seemed to be how he misjudged Tesla’s ability to retain smaller investors in a take-private deal.
From the new texts and testimony being released, it’s pretty clear that it is as simple as Musk meeting PIF, them showing a strong interest in helping him take Tesla private, but nothing more came of it. They never went into the details, even according to Musk’s testimony, and PIF seemed to be waiting for more information.
This is pretty much how everyone saw the situation. 
The SEC, which clearly already had an issue with Musk sharing material information about a public company, Tesla, through Twitter, took offense and investigated. They determined that this was not enough to claim “funding secured”.
Musk obviously knows the difference, since he took a different route for the Twitter deal, in which he just indeed secured funding.
Personally, I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. He should have only tweeted that he is exploring the possibility of taking Tesla private and discussing funding with some parties, and not that “funding is secured.”
I understand that Musk was frustrated by how the deal with the SEC went down, but ultimately, it turned out great for him. He paid Tesla’s fine with stocks and made hundreds of millions out of it.

2022/04/22,"A Tesla vehicle was caught on video crashing into a $3.5M Cirrus Vision jet after being ‘summoned’ in a dangerous way by the owner.
Smart Summon builds on Tesla’s previous “Summon” feature, which was used by owners to move their cars autonomously for a few feet in their driveway or in tight parking situations. With the new version, owners are able to Summon their Tesla vehicles from further away, and the cars will navigate more complex parking environments.
CEO Elon Musk described Smart Summon as “Tesla’s most viral feature.”
A few weeks after the release,  it had already been used over 550,000 times and several Tesla owners posted videos of their vehicles being involved in crashes and near misses while testing the new Smart Summon feature.
It is primarily used to have your car drive back “autonomously” to you from where you parked it in a parking lot. In some ways, it was the first truly “self-driving” feature for Tesla, since it could be used without anyone in the car. 
But like any of Tesla’s Autopilot features or Full Self-Driving Beta, owners need to stay attentive at all times, and be ready to take control; we got an extreme example of why this is the case as Tesla vehicle crashed into a jet of all things.
At a Cirrus event at Spokane’s Felts Field airport, what appears to be a Tesla Model Y being summoned crashed in a Vision Jet. A Redditor shared a video of the incident from a security camera:
The video evidence would point to the owner not paying attention when summoning the vehicle since it looks like there was plenty of time to see that the vehicle was heading straight for the jet.
In order for Smart Summon to work, the owner has to keep their finger on a button in the app. As soon as they lift their finger, the car comes to a stop. In this case, it is particularly concerning that the Tesla vehicle kept moving forward after making contact with the plane.
In the past, Tesla vehicles on Autopilot have had difficulties detecting objects that are lifted off the ground, like a semi trailer, which can be similar to the back of an airplane.

2022/04/22,"Tesla’s gross margin and profits are soaring to record highs as it is raising prices, which the automaker has blamed on rising costs. The company felt the need to explain itself.
Over the last few years, one of the biggest storylines around the auto industry, and many other industries, has been price increases. 
Tesla has been no exception with almost a dozen price increases on its vehicles over the last two years. On several occasions, the automaker justified the price increases with increased costs due to inflation, raw material costs increasing, and logistical expenses rising fast.
However, there have been concerns that Tesla was increasing prices because it could – with a strong backlog of orders as interest in electric vehicles that is surging – that has been supported by Tesla’s automotive gross margin steadily increasing during the same period of time.
This has never been more apparent than this last quarter when Tesla reported a record automotive gross profit of 32.9%:
Tesla’s gross margin went up from 26.5%, which was already one of the highest gross margin in the auto industry, to almost 33% over the last year.
In a list of factors affecting profits, Tesla actually lists both increased average selling price (ASP) and decreased cost per vehicle (COGS) as contributing factors:
This quarter, the regulatory credits did have a bigger impact than usual with a gain of $679 million, but Tesla also made more money than ever without credits. With all these factors at play, Tesla had to explain the reasoning behind the price increase, which might appear greedy.
During the conference call following the release of Tesla’s Q1 2022 financial results, CEO Elon Musk felt the need to explain the situation. He said that Tesla increases prices based on expected costs rising in the future since new vehicles sold now at new, higher prices are delivered three to 12 months from now:
Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles given that we had record profitability this quarter. But the waitlist for our vehicles is quite long and some of the vehicles that people order, the waitlist extends into next year. So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware of and believe will happen over the next six to 12 months. So that’s why we have the price increases today because a car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year from now.
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn added that Tesla may “slightly” decrease prices if those expected cost increases don’t materialize in the future.
What Musk said is undeniably true, but you can make the argument that Tesla hasn’t been great at gauging and/or timing those increasing costs since it is reporting gross margins being positively affected by increasing prices and reducing cost per vehicle.
Also, Kirkhorn’s comment about potentially adjusting prices down wasn’t particularly encouraging:
If that growth in cost is not materialized, we actually may slightly reduce prices.
I am talking about the words “may” and “slightly” here. They indicate that Tesla will likely keep those higher prices even if the cost increases don’t happen, which I think gives weight to the argument that the main reason for the price increases is that Tesla has the demand for them.
In my opinion, as long as Tesla finds people to buy Tesla vehicles at those high prices, they will remain high. While this goes again Musk’s previously stated goal to reduce the cost of electric vehicles, it could still be aligned with Tesla’s broader mission to accelerate the shift to sustainable energy.
As long as Tesla uses those profits for large capital expenditure in growing production capacity, I think it makes sense.
",tesla
2022/04/22,"Tesla confirmed that nearly half of all its vehicles produced last quarter are already using cobalt-free iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries.
The information also gives us an interesting insight into Tesla’s mix of models, which is generally quite opaque.
Over the last few years, CEO Elon Musk has said multiple times that Tesla plans to shift more electric cars to LFP batteries in order to overcome nickel and cobalt supply concerns.
Iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which don’t use nickel or cobalt, are traditionally cheaper and safer, but they offer less energy density, which means less efficient and shorter range for electric vehicles.
However, they have improved enough recently that it now makes sense to use cobalt-free batteries in lower-end and shorter-range vehicles.
It also frees up the production of battery cells with other, more energy-dense chemistries to produce more longer-range vehicles.
Tesla already moved its Standard Range Model 3 and Model Y produced in China to LFP cells.
Last year, Tesla also announced it is “shifting to Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry globally” for “standard range vehicles.”
It confirmed that the automaker planned to switch the Model 3 Standard Range, also known as Model 3 Rear-Wheel-Drive, being produced in the Fremont factory to LFP cells, too.
Now with the release of Tesla’s Q1 2022 financial results, Tesla confirmed that nearly half of all vehicles produced are now using LFP batteries:
“Diversification of battery chemistries is critical for long-term capacity growth, to better optimize our products for their various use cases and expand our supplier base. This is why nearly half of Tesla vehicles produced in Q1 were equipped with a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery, containing no nickel or cobalt. Currently, LFP batteries are used in most of our standard range vehicle products, as well as commercial energy storage applications. As a result of our energy efficient motors, a Model 3 with an LFP battery pack can still achieve a 267-mile EPA range.”
This would mean that roughly half of Tesla’s volume comes from Model 3 Rear-Wheel-Drive,  the cheapest Tesla vehicle, and the Model Y Standard Range, which is only offered in China.
Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of engineering, was asked how quickly can Tesla switch chemistry to LFP:
“I’ll take the LFP question. Like it says so in our letter, but half of our products were LFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond. But honestly, it wasn’t because of a raw material shortage. It just seemed like the right thing to do. We could change our cathode chemistry. And there’s more to be done on the cathode side and we are actively pursuing it to give us substitution flexibility in response to market conditions between the other cathodes that are out there that can be competitive in our vehicle. There are many options.”
The engineering executive didn’t go into details about those other options, but Elon Musk recently said that Tesla is working on a new manganese-based cathode battery.

2022/04/21,"Tesla has started testing in-car wifi hotspot connectivity with several major internet providers in order to provide an alternative internet connection for its fleet.
Connectivity has been a flagship feature of Tesla’s offering in the auto industry. It enables several fun and useful features for customers and has also been used by Tesla to collect data from the fleet and improve features — mainly Autopilot.
Tesla always offered internet connectivity for free, but as its fleet grew, so did the internet connectivity requirement and cost. 
In 2018, Tesla started requiring a new paid “premium connectivity” package for a monthly fee to access some of the more data-heavy connectivity features. Since then, Tesla owners have had to decide if they want to pay $10 per month for the premium connectivity service or not.
More recently, the automaker launched a software update to allow owners to use their phones’ wifi hotspots while driving as an alternative to LTE connectivity.
Now Tesla is apparently working on another alternative involving using Wifi hotspots from internet providers. A Twitter user going by Analytic managed to activate the new feature in their vehicle:
New Upcoming #Tesla feature: Free access to public hotspots from, AT&T, Comcast, Orange, and more!Since late last year, there have been hints in the firmware that @Tesla was looking to support ""Public Hotspots"".I've been able to enable this feature, and confirm it works! 👇🧵 pic.twitter.com/L1jJMg24O6
Tesla appears to be working with several major internet providers in North America, Europe, and Asia to test the feature.
Tesla hacker “green” confirmed that the feature is the backend of Tesla’s software and the automaker is currently testing it:
While it looks like the upcoming feature, they seem to be in the testing phase now (measure hotspot speed).Nonetheless it's definitely done in collaboration with those operators as e.g. xfinity requires a 802.1x keys in order to join the hotspot https://t.co/jMM3zBTBLr
It’s impossible to get a timeline on when Tesla could bring the feature to customers through a software update.
The feature could prove useful to improve the connectivity of Tesla vehicles as data requirements are increasing with more internet-based entertainment features inside the vehicles and as Tesla is extracting more data from them.
When releasing an Autopilot update in 2017, Tesla asked owners for authorization to collect videos from the Autopilot cameras. After that, Tesla opened the floodgates of Autopilot data gathering, and the amount of data being collected has only increased since.

2022/04/21,"During Tesla’s Q1 2022 earnings call, Elon Musk was asked to share data that show progress with Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program. Instead of sharing this data, however, the CEO suggested that people wanting to assess the progress of Tesla FSD should just “join the Beta,” which requires buying the controversial $12,000 package.
A growing number of people have been calling for Tesla to start releasing data that help track the progress of the Full Self-Driving Beta program as the automaker keeps missing timelines for delivering on its long promise that all its vehicles built since 2016 will be able to achieve self-driving capability through software updates.
They are just asking for Tesla to share similar data as other companies developing self-driving technology, like the number of interventions or disengagement per mile, which could help track progress with the system.
Without the data, everyone has to rely on anecdotal evidence of how the system performs based on individual experiences from people in the FSD Beta.
During the conference call following the release of Tesla’s Q1 2022 financial results, Musk was directly asked to release more data about Tesla FSD:
Elon has historically provided FSD timelines with not optimal accuracy. We love the optimism for 2022 release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their own conclusions on progress being made, interventions per mile driven or any other data?
The CEO declined to share anything specific and instead suggested that people just try FSD Beta:
The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla Full Self-Driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in that program and we expect to broaden that significantly this year. So that’s my recommendation, join the Full Self-Driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate of improvement with every release. And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks. So — and you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward one step back, but overall the rate of improvement is incredibly quick. So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
That’s a surprising response considering the difficulties to get into the program. You need to buy the Tesla FSD, which costs $12,000 or $200 per month, and then you need to score high enough on Tesla’s driver safety score for Tesla to push you the FSD Beta update, and even then, not every owner is getting it.
As someone who has been calling for Tesla to release data about the FSD program for a long time, I was happy to see investors pushing the question and pleasantly surprised that Tesla took the question.
However, I was stunned by Musk’s response.
Not only did he not show any willingness to share data, but he also had the audacity to say “join the program and plot the progress yourself” instead. 
It is as if he can’t even comprehend that people would have doubts about the program to the point that they wouldn’t be willing to pay $12,000 to try it without seeing some concrete data showing progress.
At this point, it’s almost comical. Tesla could very simply share data from its millions of miles of FSD Beta and show how the disengagement or driver intervention per mile is doing. It would be an easy metric to track over time and in no way comparable to anecdotal evidence and even your own personal experience with the FSD Beta.
Tesla’s insistence on not sharing this information is starting to look suspiciously bad.
In the meantime, Musk is perfectly willing to make bold statements about Tesla achieving self-driving on unbelievably short timelines, which Tesla uses to sell more cars. 
Musk needs to get off Twitter where his legions of superfans are fawning over the FSD Beta and join reality where people have serious and reasonable doubts about Tesla’s progress toward achieving a real self-driving system.

2022/04/20,"Elon Musk released more details on Tesla’s upcoming dedicated robotaxi electric car that he announced at Cyber Rodeo earlier this month.
The vehicle will focus on cost per mile and Tesla is aiming to reach volume production of the new vehicle in 2024. Musk said that Tesla is going to provide “by far the lowest cost per that customers have ever experienced”.
At Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo event last month, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is working on a new vehicle: a dedicated robotaxi.
When talking about what is next for Tesla, the CEO said:
There’s going to be a dedicated robotaxi that is going to look quite futuristic-looking.
At the time, the CEO didn’t share any other detail about the new Tesla vehicle that he mentioned for the first time.
However, we did speculate that it will be vehicle designed from the ground up with autonomy in mind, which allows for more design freedom – for example without steering wheels or pedals.
Today, during the conference call following the release of Tesla’s Q1 2022 financial results, Musk elaborated on the vehicle:
“We are also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi. It is going to be highly optimized for autonomy – meaning it will not have steering wheel or pedals. There are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting, but it is fundamentally optimized to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or km when counting everything.”
Musk also confirmed that Tesla plans to reveal the vehicle likely in 2023 and it is aiming for volume production of the robotaxi in 2024.
The CEO believes that the vehicle is going to result in a cost per mile cheaper than a subsidized bus ticket. Ultimately, he believes that the unnamed robotaxi vehicle is going to be a major driver of Tesla’s growth.

2022/04/20,"Tesla has confirmed that its order rate surged following this year’s Super Bowl, which featured many electric vehicle ads. These numbers show that the long-standing idea of “Tesla killers” doesn’t work and that the automaker actually benefits greatly from other automakers investing in electric vehicles.
Over the last few years, several automakers started buying airtime during the Super Bowl, which is famous for its extravagant and expensive commercials, to promote their electric vehicles. This year’s Super Bowl was particularly popular for EV ads.
BMW had an ad about the X1. GM promoted its Ultium electric platform, which powers a series of new electric vehicles starting with the GMC Hummer EV. Kia featured its new EV6 electric car. Hyundai, Kia’s partner, also bought a Super Bowl ad to promote the Ioniq 5. Polestar had an ad during the game. And, EV charging station maker Wallbox also had an ad.
Several of those campaigns were successful in bringing attention to electric vehicles – and not just the ones featured in the ads.
In the release of its Q1 2022 financial results, Tesla disclosed that its order rate surged the day after the Super Bowl 2022:
The automaker didn’t release any actual metrics and only focused on the increased rate, which looks about twice as high as its average rate.
As Electrek revealed, Tesla’s order rate surged again just a few weeks later in March amid increasing gas prices.
Now several of Tesla’s models are listed as sold out until 2023.
This is fascinating because it shows what many Tesla detractors (and Tesla fans attacking the competition) have been missing for years, which is that EV competition is good for Tesla. And I don’t just mean good for the mission to accelerate EV adoption, but directly good for orders and Tesla financially.
Those ads simply pushed the idea of going electric to more people and now people are evaluating all their EV options. For some, likely many, Tesla proved to be the best option.
I think that this kills the idea that every other new EV is a “Tesla killer.”

2022/04/20,"Tesla (TSLA) has released its financial results and shareholders letter for the first quarter of 2022 after market close today.
We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders’ letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information.
Yesterday, we posted our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share.
The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter.
Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022.
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results.
Here’s Tesla’s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red):
The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter.
Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That’s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins.
Tesla finds itself with about $17.5 billion in cash at the end of the last quarter.
We will be posting our follow-up posts here about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts):
Here’s Tesla’s Q1 2022 shareholder presentation in full and conference call:

2022/04/20,"Tesla and Panasonic are rumored to be behind a new multibillion-dollar battery factory project in Oklahoma as the state pushes to approve $700 million in incentives to move the project forward.
Earlier this year, we reported on Panasonic looking for a site in the U.S. for a new large-scale battery factory to produce new 4680 battery cell for Tesla.
At the time, it was reported that Panasonic was zeroing in on Oklahoma or Kansas for the location of the factory. Now it looks like Oklahoma might be making moves to secure the project or something very similar to the Panasonic project.
Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt announced that the state is close to securing a “multibillion dollar investment.”
Oklahoma is at the one-yard-line of securing a multi-billion dollar investment that will make a generational impact for our state.Lets work together to push this thing across the goal line and get it done! pic.twitter.com/DNJrCeJizc
Stitt didn’t name the company involved in the project due to a nondisclosure agreement, but he confirmed that the company has ties to the electric vehicle (EV) industry.
The governor introduced a new bill to have the state legislature approve almost $700 million in rebates and incentives (via The Verge).
“Shortly after Stitt’s pitch to state lawmakers, the Oklahoma House Joint Committee on Appropriations and Budget advanced HB 4455 to the Senate, a bill that provides $698 million in rebates and incentives to companies that meet certain thresholds linked to job creation and capital expenditure.”
Due to the timing and the previous reports about Panasonic looking at locations in Oklahoma, the Japanese manufacturer is the top suspect to be behind this project.
The level of involvement of Tesla is still unknown. Panasonic did confirm that it was looking to establish a new manufacturing facility in the U.S. to build Tesla’s 4680 battery cells. However, it’s not clear if it will be a more traditional supplier/buyer relationship or if it will be a more involved deal, like what Tesla and Panasonic have at Gigafactory Nevada.
This is an interesting development. It sounds like it would be an extremely large-scale project comparable to Gigafactory Nevada.
When a new Panasonic factory for Tesla batteries comes up, there’s always the question of what’s happening with Gigafactory Nevada, which is still only 33% of the overall size it was supposed to be when first announced.
But there are certain advantages of designing new systems from the ground up with a new facility. It looks like the new factory would be specifically designed for Tesla’s new 4680 battery cell.
If Tesla is involved in the project, it would be interesting if it encourages the Oklahoma state legislature to abandon its attack on Tesla’s right to sell and service its vehicles directly to customers in the state.
Anyway, nothing is confirmed for now, but we expect to have more details soon.

2022/04/20,"Tesla bulls are rallying behind the automaker’s stock (TSLA) ahead of earnings with new record price targets from two analyst firms.
The company is set to release its earning result for Q1 2022 after market close later today.
Since the release of its Q1 2022 delivery results, several Wall Street analysts have been updating their price target on Tesla to adjust to the new record deliveries – both an all-time record and a strong record for the first quarter of the year.
Two firms are pushing this to another level with new record price targets.
Texas-based hedge fund Worm Capital believes that Tesla is about six years ahead of the competition (via Seeking Alpha):
Conventional Wall Street analysis consistently undervalues Tesla’s multiple business lines, its massive scale, its expanding margin profile, its leading revolution in complex manufacturing, its approach to real-world AI, its vertical integration, its software stack, and much more. Our multi-year research effort into Tesla’s manufacturing capabilities and supply chain integrations suggest that Tesla is more than 6 years ahead of any competitor. This lead is expanding.
The firm believes that Tesla’s stock could increase by a factor of 10 this decade:
We believe Tesla (TSLA) shares could offer a 10x return by 2030 – and potentially much more.
Worm Capital’s expectations are even higher than longtime Tesla uber-bull ARK Invest.
This week, the firm updated its price target on Tesla to $4,600 by 2026. The most aggressive target of all major firms.
Yet, they claim it to be conservative:
Although tuned to our expectations for 2026, we believe our Tesla model is methodologically conservative: we assume that Tesla’s stock will trade like a mature company rather than a high-growth one in 2026. Using the existing assumptions in our model and extending them to 2027 results in a materially higher price target and compounded annual rate of return.
Ark also has a $5,800 bull case price target.
While they claim the target to be conservative, it does rely on Tesla delivering on some longtime goals that have been delayed, like “full self-driving” and the Cybertruck.
At $5,000 a share, it would value Tesla at over $5 trillion.
Update: Tesla (TSLA) releases Q1 2022 results: beat both revenue and profit expectations in record quarter

2022/04/20,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed that the automaker has now more than 100,000 people in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program. 
Does it mean that we are going to start seeing an accelerated rate of improvement?
FSD Beta has been a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program.
Some updates brought significant noticeable improvements while others actually made the product worse. There were also long periods of time without updates when the program appeared to be stalling.
For most of the program (from October 2020 to October 2021), there were only a few thousand people in the FSD Beta and most of them were Tesla employees.
In Q4 2021, Tesla introduced its “safety test score“ and significantly ramped up the rollout of FSD Beta. It claimed to have almost 60,000 FSD Beta testers in its fleet by the end of the year.
The significant ramp-up in the number of beta testers in the program has given some people hope that the rate of improvement would accelerate as Tesla is able to collect a lot more data from the fleet.
This has yet to prove true with the number of FSD Beta updates being quite stagnant in early 2022.
But in an interview with TED last week, Musk revealed that Tesla has kept adding more people to the FSD Beta program, and now has more than 100,000 people onboarded:
The car currently drives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions – and we have over 100,000 people in our full self-driving beta program.
The CEO admitted that he has often been wrong about Tesla’s timeline to bring self-driving to market and almost comically added that he believes that “this year is the year.”
However, he has drastically reduced the goal for what happens this year from “1 million robotaxis on the road” to “FSD Beta being safer than the average human driver.”
The CEO is no longer talking about any timeline for the real goal that would lead to true self-driving vehicles without constant driver supervision, which is the case with the current version of FSD Beta.
With now over 100,000 people feeding Tesla with FSD Beta test driver data nearly every day, you would think that the automaker would have a lot of data to accelerate the rate of improvement.
For years, Tesla has been boasting about its data advantage when it comes to self-driving thanks to its large and fully connected customer fleet.
However, the automaker has exaggerated its capacity to use that data in the past. The data needs to be annotated before it can be useful in training the neural nets. The suspicion has been that Tesla expanded the program to more people because it was ready to take more data, but that has yet to be proven.
I am repeating myself, but what we (FSD buyers, TSLA shareholders, and just fans of safe driving) really need from Tesla is more data to see some improvements and hopefully for Musk to gain back some credibility when it comes to self-driving timelines. 
Tesla should be frequently releasing detailed disengagement reports from its FSD Beta fleet in order for us to see how good this thing really is at driving because the videos don’t cut it.

2022/04/19,"Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) package is being attacked as part of a new multi-million-dollar national ad campaign started by a billionaire who willingly admits his bizarre Senate run is all about attacking Elon Musk and Tesla’s self-driving system.
There are many different ways to approach self-driving and none of them is perfect, but Tesla’s approach is undoubtedly the most controversial one.
Detractors have issues with the fact that Tesla released a “Beta” product for customers to use on public roads and basically made those customers responsible for correcting mistakes that the “self-driving” system makes, which happens fairly often.
Many consider this approach to be dangerous, even though Tesla claims to have had no serious accidents in the FSD Beta program since it started over a year ago.
One of the Tesla’s detractors is Dan O’Dowd, a self-described billionaire and founder of Green Hills Software, a privately owned company that makes operating systems and programming tools. O’Dowd recently launched a Senate campaign in his home state of California, but the tech executive made it quite clear that he is making it a single-issue campaign. And, that issue is Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program.
O’Dowd confirmed his intentions in an interview with Politico:
In the interview, O’Dowd stressed that his would be a single-issue campaign. He vowed not to talk about anything except Tesla and more broadly how security of America’s power grids and water treatment plants are deeply vulnerable to cyber attacks.
The tech executive argues that Tesla’s FSD Beta is “unbelievably bad,” “fails all the time,” and should be “banned from America’s roads.”
He highlighted how he believed the system to be dangerous in his first campaign ad titled “Unsafe at Any Speed”:
The video consists of a compilation of clips from longer FSD Beta test drives from owners posted to Youtube. 
We previously reported on some of those clips.
O’Dowd is going to pay $2 million for playtime on this ad in 36 states, and he says that he put aside $7 million for his campaign. He also hired a team consisting of Democratic ad maker Mark Putnam, veteran party operative John Blair, and Tim Maltin, a high-powered public affairs executive in London.
The Santa Barbara man is already making the Democratic party nervous as they fear his campaign is going to negatively affect the state’s appointed junior senator, Alex Padilla.
If O’Dowd is not particularly interested in becoming a Senator and his campaign is primarily about preventing Tesla FSD Beta to be used on public roads, it is fair to ask why he doesn’t just pay for an anti-Tesla FSD ad campaign. But it is believed that making it a political ad could help him avoid issues with a higher degree of first amendment protection, especially since his first ad is using clips from videos mostly made by Tesla fans.
O’Dowd said that he is willing to step down if the legislature commits to banning Tesla from deploying its FSD beta on public roads.
While the tech executive argues that his effort, which he is backing with a lot of money, is focused on trying to remove what he believes to be a dangerous technology from public roads, it would be fair to mention that his company, Green Hills Software, is competing with Tesla.
It’s not something that the CEO often mentions when discussing Tesla in his “single-issue campaign,” but Green Hills Software has been developing a lot of automotive software, which it offers to OEMs.
Tesla has been changing the game when it comes to software in the auto industry. The company is building everything from scratch instead of relying on suppliers like most legacy automakers. The electric automaker has quickly built a massive lead on that front that other automakers are now trying to catch up with by developing their own software expertise instead of relying on third-party companies, like Green Hills Software.

2022/04/19,"Tesla recently announced that it won’t be including its mobile charging connector with every new car, which it had been doing for years. Elon Musk claimed that the reason behind the controversial move was that Tesla was seeing ‘super low usage’ from owners based on internal statistics.
However, convincing third-party data shows the exact opposite.
When reporting on the disappointing move this weekend, we questioned Musk’s claim that the reason was due to “usage statistics” being “super low.”
We only had anecdotal evidence, and while we wouldn’t have been shocked if the Tesla Mobile Connector accounted for only a minority of charging sessions by Tesla owners, we suspected that the charging solution was still used occasionally by most owners and that these occasions were critical enough to warrant including it with new car sales.
Now we get actual third-party data that show that not only is the Tesla Mobile Connector widely used, but it might even be the number one charging solution.
Teslascope, a service that collects data on Tesla vehicles to provide owners with services that the automaker doesn’t provide directly, has access to data on thousands of Tesla vehicles around the world.
Following Musk’s claim, the company shared the data of the sources of charging sessions in its customer fleet and revealed that 61% came from the Tesla Mobile Connector:
We're a bit perplexed by Elon's statement regarding the removal of the Mobile Connector cable with new vehicles.While our own data is, by far, not as detailed as Tesla's, it shows a different story. 📊61% of sessions were with the mobile connector.32% used the wall charger. pic.twitter.com/PoN91RYzsz
As noted, the service doesn’t have as much data as Tesla, but this is still based on hundreds of thousands of charging sessions and therefore fairly convincing data.
It would appear that Musk is exaggerating the “super low” usage of the mobile charging solution.
However, the CEO didn’t go into the details about his claim. It’s likely that the use rate has certainly gone down since Tesla stopped providing a NEMA 14-50 adapter with the mobile connector, even though it remains an important charging solution and the adapter can be purchased separately to improve its functionality.
Tesla appears to be sticking to its decision and will not deliver the mobile connector with new vehicles ordered after April 17. 
In response to the backlash, Musk said that Tesla would bring the price of the mobile connector down from $275 to $200.
As we noted in our original reporting about the situation, Tesla is listing the charger as “out of stock.”
I am a bit surprised by the data, but it does make sense. When Tesla was delivering the mobile connector with the 14-50 adapter, it was basically all you needed for a home charging solution, which generally accounts for over 80% of most EV owners’ charging needs.
All you needed is a 14-50 outlet in your garage or driveway and you had a more than decent home charging solution.
Many owners would decide to have a Tesla Wall Connector installed at home, but many of those owners would then keep the mobile connector in their vehicle for an “on the road” charging solution.
To me, it sounds more like another cost-cutting solution that Musk is trying to justify with some questionable data, which he could just show to prove us all wrong, but somehow I doubt that’s going to happen.

2022/04/19,"The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office has announced a conditional commitment to lend up to $107 million to Syrah Technologies for its Syrah Vidalia Facility in Vidalia, Louisiana. The facility produces a finished natural graphite-based active anode material (AAM), a critical material used in lithium-ion batteries. 
At the end of December, Tesla announced an offtake deal with Syrah Vidalia to secure graphite AAM for battery production.
As Electrek previously reported, Australia’s Syrah Resources Limited operates a graphite mine in Balama, Mozambique. The mine supplies the Vidalia facility, as the US currently produces no graphite.
A conditional commitment from the Loan Programs Office means that the borrower has to meet certain conditions before the loan is finalized, and the vast majority of conditional commitments issued by DOE have resulted in a loan guarantee.
Assuming conditions are met, the Syrah Vidalia project would be the first loan from the Loan Programs Office’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program in more than a decade. 
It would also be the first-ever ATVM loan to support a supply chain manufacturing project.
The Syrah Vidalia Facility will use the money to expand its existing 50,000-square-foot facility by 180,000 square feet. It’s expected to produce enough AAM for approximately 2.5 million EVs by 2040.
Construction is expected to begin immediately, and the completion and production target is the third quarter of 2023.
The expansion will create around 150 construction jobs and 98 well-paid, highly skilled operations jobs within the clean energy sector.
Jigar Shah, director of the Loan Programs Office at the Department of Energy, told Electrek via email:
Once completed, the Syrah Vidalia Facility could catalyze a domestic supply chain of critical minerals like graphite for US auto and EV battery manufacturers. The DOE Loan Programs Office is working to onshore EV manufacturing, battery manufacturing, and critical materials projects, and we urge interested applicants to reach out to us today to see how we might help to finance their project.
The Biden administration said that it would invest in domestic manufacturing and production to support the electric vehicle industry, and this conditional commitment from the DOE Loan Programs Office delivers on that promise.
Syrah Vidalia is expected to be the only vertically integrated, large-scale AAM producer outside of China and the first battery-grade natural graphite supplier in the US to support the growing electric vehicle industry. This is a great development for the US EV industry.

2022/04/19,"Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai has now officially restarted production with reportedly 8,000 employees, who will be living and sleeping at the factory in a closed-loop system as there are still a lot of restrictions.
A slow production ramp is to be expected.
Shanghai has seen a rise in COVID-19 infections over the last month, and in an attempt to curb the growth, the authorities implemented some drastic lockdown measures that have been in place for weeks now.
Those measures have been affecting many businesses, including Tesla’s critical Gigafactory in the giant Chinese city.
The automaker had to shut down the plant on March 28 due to difficulties securing workers and the supply of components from suppliers also affected by the measures.
Tesla was supposed to restart production the next weekend, but it couldn’t make it work.
The automaker was expected to once again attempt a restart of production during the week, but it couldn’t make it work again.
The second phase of the two-phase city lockdown was supposed to end on April 7, but the authorities have extended it indefinitely amid continued spread despite the measures in place.
Last week, we learned that Tesla was now aiming to reopen Gigafactory Shanghai on April 18 after a three-week shutdown.
Yesterday, we reported that the production restart was delayed to today April 19th.
Tesla confirmed the production restart in a TV interview today and said that 8,000 workers are returning to work:
Song Gang, senior director of manufacturing at Giga Shanghai, said in an interview that 8,000 employees have already returned to work. The battery and motor production lines are already producing at full speed. pic.twitter.com/5UIZKh2yEb
While the battery and motor production lines are apparently back at full speed, the overall vehicle production is expected to ramp up slowly over weeks and even months.
At a production capacity of around 2,000 vehicles per day, Tesla is expected to have missed out already on over 40,000 vehicles this quarter, and it could see production down by tens of thousands more during the ramp-up.
Like other companies in Shanghai, Tesla is adopting the ‘closed-loop’ system with employees sleeping at the factory to limit outside contact as Shanghai still has some strict restrictions to limit COVID-19 spread.
Tesla is going to supply sleeping bags, mattresses, and sleeping quarters as well as entertainment.

2022/04/19,"Tesla (TSLA) is set to announce its first-quarter 2022 financial results tomorrow, April 20, after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management is scheduled after the results.
Here we’ll take a look below at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.
As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q1 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drives the vast majority of the company’s revenue.
Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 310,000 electric vehicles during the first three months of the year.
That’s yet another all-time quarterly record for Tesla, the seventh in a row, and a massive result for a first quarter, which is generally weaker.
Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results
For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $17.659 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $17.866 billion.
An average between the two numbers would be roughly what Tesla generated last quarter (Q4 2021), but it would represent tremendous growth versus the same period last year (Q1 2021) when Tesla delivered roughly $10 billion in revenue.
Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years: Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus are in gray, actual results are in green:
Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful doing so over the last two years now.
For Q1 2022, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $2.26 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $2.542 per share.
The earnings are more of a hit-or-miss since it depends on how much Tesla is spending that quarter, and with supply chain issues and costs increasing at new factories being brought online, it could be not as profitable despite the real potential for another record when it comes to revenues.
Or not. It’s hard to tell, but Tesla has been consistently beating earnings-per-share expectations over the last few quarters.
Here are the earnings per share over the last two years: Estimize predictions in blue, Wall Street consensus in gray, actual results in green:
In the shareholder’s letter and the following conference call, Tesla generally shares additional details about not only financial results, but also other important metrics on how the company is doing.
Tesla doesn’t share traditional guidance for the year in its first-quarter call as the company instead insists on only saying that it will grow at a rate of roughly 50% per year for the foreseeable future.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk announced that he wouldn’t participate in all quarterly calls like he used to,  and like most CEOs of major public companies do. It’s not clear if he will be present at this one.
But Tesla is still expected to answer some shareholder and analyst questions.
Over the last few earnings calls, Tesla has been using the website Say to gather questions from retail investors and respond to the top-voted ones.
Some are direct and specific and some are more general in an attempt to get Tesla to talk about some subjects. Here are the top-voted ones right now:

2022/04/18,"Tesla Insurance, the automaker’s growing insurance division, has launched its real-time-driver-data insurance product in three more states: Colorado, Oregon, and Virginia. It is now available in seven states total. Tesla Insurance is available in California as well but without real-time driver safety data, due to regulations.
Tesla had already introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data or Tesla’s safety score, which had been the original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, Tesla wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes compared the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month to month depending on your score:
Since releasing the product, Tesla has integrated everything into its mobile app, from ordering insurance to using the safety score to paying and managing claims.
The company expanded the insurance product to Illinois in December and then to  Arizona and Ohio in January.
Today, Tesla updated its website to note that its real-time-data insurance product is now available in three more states: Colorado, Oregon, and Virginia.
The addition makes for a total of seven states with Tesla Insurance based on real-time driving data:
Tesla still hasn’t been able to get the full product adopted in California, but the automaker recently started to let people who get Tesla Insurance in California use the Driver Safety Score for “educational purposes.”
In October, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla Insurance is aiming to be “in most states” by the end of 2022. The regulatory landscape for insurance is complex and varies state by state. Therefore, Tesla has a lot of work to do to launch in any new state, but the effort appears to be paying off with six new states over the last five months.

2022/04/18,"PG&E announced that they have turned on their giant Tesla Megapack project with 730 MWh of capacity, and the electric grid company expects that it will “enhance the overall reliability of California’s ever-changing energy supply.”
We first learned of the project at PG&E’s Moss Landing substation when it submitted it to CPUC and the company was in talks with Tesla in 2017. It involves four separate energy storage projects, and two of them, including the one using Tesla Megapack, should become the world’s largest battery systems.
In 2018, we obtained Tesla’s proposal for the project, and it showed that the company plans to use “Megapack” instead of its usual Powerpack for large utility-scale projects. It was one of the first projects announced to use the new battery system, but the actual deployment took so much time that many more Megapack projects came online since.
In 2020, the project was officially approved, and Tesla started construction on the first phase of the project in July.
Last week, we shared a report from local news that stated that the project was deployed, but it has yet to be turned on, along with another 400 MW energy storage system operated by Vistra and also located in Moss Landing. The investigation that was reportedly keeping the projects turned off was actually only affecting the Vistra project, which is using LG batteries.
Today, PG&E announced that the Tesla Megapack project is now fully operational:
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) announced today the commissioning of its 182.5-megawatt (MW) Tesla Megapack battery energy storage system (BESS) – known as the Elkhorn Battery – located at its Moss Landing electric substation in Monterey County.
The project consists of 256 Tesla Megapack battery units on 33 concrete slabs:
PG&E Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Patti Poppe, commented on the project:
We are ushering in a new era of electric system reliability and delivering a vision into the future for our customers with the commissioning of the Tesla Megapack system in Moss Landing. We are committed to safely delivering reliable and clean energy in a way that achieves the greatest value for our customers, but we can’t go it alone into this clean energy future. Projects like this require innovative partners, such as Tesla, and PG&E will continue to seek out and work with the best and brightest to provide breakthrough clean energy solutions for our customers.
As reported last week, PG&E’s Tesla Megapack project has been approved for expansion by CPUC, and it is expected to grow to up to 1.1 GWh of capacity – making it one of the largest battery systems in the world.

2022/04/18,"A new report coming out of Germany is giving us some insights into the state of the production ramp-up at Tesla Gigafactory Berlin, which is apparently now producing 350 Model Y vehicles per week. 
The bulls like it and the bears say it’s bad. What do you think?
Tesla just started production at Gigafactory Berlin a month ago, but the start of production is not as important as the ramp-up to volume production.
At the opening of the factory, the automaker didn’t issue any guidance on the expected ramp-up.
Now a new report from Germany’s Automobilwoche claims to have sources sharing data from inside Gigafactory Berlin.
The publication claims that Tesla is currently producing 350 Model Y vehicles per week at the factory.
According to the same sources, Tesla is aiming to ramp up production to 1,000 units per week by the end of the month.
As Tesla confirmed when launching the factory, the Model Y vehicles currently being produced at Giga Berlin are equipped with the 2170 battery cells. CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla aimed to switch to its new structural battery pack architecture powered by its new 4680 battery cells “in a few months.”
Now the report states that this is going to happen closer to the end of the year, and it will require a factory shutdown that will last a few weeks.
It’s funny because you have Tesla bulls saying that these numbers are great news while the Tesla bears are saying that these numbers highlight serious issues in the production ramp.
Personally, I think it looks good, especially if they can indeed achieve 1,000 vehicles per week within the next two weeks. That’s already an annualized production capacity of 50,000 units.
I never expected significant volume from Giga Berlin until toward the end of the year.
However, I have some concerns about the change to 4680 cells. It is a significant change to the production and it is likely to affect the production capacity for a while.
It will be something to keep a close eye on this year.

2022/04/18,"Tesla workers are finally starting to return to Gigafactory Shanghai after three weeks of being shut down, but the production restart has again been delayed by a day.
The situation remains difficult amid a severe lockdown in Shanghai to attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Shanghai has seen a rise in COVID-19 infections over the last month, and in an attempt to curb the growth, the authorities implemented some drastic lockdown measures that have been in place for weeks now.
Those measures have been affecting many businesses, including Tesla’s critical Gigafactory in the giant Chinese city.
The automaker had to shut down the plant on March 28 due to difficulties securing workers and the supply of components from suppliers also affected by the measures.
Tesla was supposed to restart production the next weekend, but it couldn’t make it work. 
The automaker was expected to once again attempt a restart of production during the week, but it couldn’t make it work again.
The second phase of the two-phase city lockdown was supposed to end on April 7, but the authorities have extended it indefinitely amid continued spread despite the measures in place.
Last week, we learned that Tesla was now aiming to reopen Gigafactory Shanghai on April 18 after a three-week shutdown.
Today, the company indeed started to bring back workers to the plant, but Reuters reports that the plan to restart production has been delayed to tomorrow:
Tesla had hoped to start one production shift on Monday but was now looking to do so on Tuesday, sources said, with one citing a supplier’s logistical snag for the delay.
More difficulties are expected for Gigafactory Shanghai in the coming weeks as Tesla and suppliers slowly start to ramp up production – starting with just one shift in Tesla’s case.
As for the authorities, they are starting to talk about easing the lockdown measures amid major complaints about citizens running out of food and other suppliers.
At a production capacity of around 2,000 vehicles per day, Tesla is expected to have missed out already on over 40,000 vehicles this quarter, and it could see production down by tens of thousands more during the ramp-up.

2022/04/16,"Tesla changed its long-standing policy to deliver every vehicle with a mobile charging cable and instead, it started selling them separately for $400 for level 2 charging and $275 for level 1.
The move is reminiscent of Apple removing the included USB charging brick with the iPhone.
Update: Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Tesla will reduce the price by $75 of the currently out of stock mobile charger in response to the backlash. 
Update 2: According to Tesla’s chat, unless you’ve already taken delivery, Mobile chargers are now no longer included even though they were at time of purchase.
Update 3: Tesla internal communication now says that all deliveries “for the next several weeks” will come with the Mobile Connector included.
With charging being one of the biggest concerns for electric vehicle buyers, it made sense for Tesla to include a mobile charging cable with every vehicle sold.
The included charging kit evolved over the years.
Tesla used to include a charging cable with both a NEMA 14-50 (level 2) connector and a connector for a regular outlet (Level 1).
The automaker later decided to drop the NEMA 14-50 connector from the included bundle and only included the NEMA 5-15 adapter, which is for a regular outlet. You could buy the Level 2 connector separately. 
With a max power output of 1.3kW, the included connector enabled charging speeds between two and three miles of range per hour. It’s not much, but it is still better than nothing and suitable for overnight charging.
For anything better, Tesla owners would have to install a level 2 charging station at home.
Now Tesla has gone a step further and decided to not include any charging cable with its new vehicles.
CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla believes that the usage amongst owners was too low to justify supplying the cable with every new car delivery:
“Usage statistics were super low, so seemed wasteful. On the (minor) plus side, we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit.”
The move is reminiscent of Apple’s decision to stop supplying USB charging bricks with new iPhones a few years ago, and the company also cited wastefulness at the time. 
However, the similarities stopped there. Apple could rely on the fact that most customers already had several USB/Lightning bricks, but that’s much less likely to be the case for Tesla buyers, especially those new to EVs. 
Also, even if most users don’t use the mobile cables often, it might be extremely useful to keep in the car for a worst-case scenario or early in the ownership experience before you can get a home charging station installed. 
Compounding the concern is that both of Tesla’s mobile connectors are listed as “out of stock” on its website:
So for people taking delivery of new Tesla vehicles without included connector, they are going have to find an alternative somewhere else.
I’m not a fan of this move. I know everyone has a different situation, but I know a lot of owners who primarily use their included mobile charger – obviously more so when Tesla included the NEMA 14-50.
Personally, I did probably over 80% of my charging on my Tesla Model 3 with the included charger.
I think it just makes sense to sell an electric car with a charging device – even if it doesn’t end up being your primary charging product.
For what it is worth, Tesla isn’t the first company to do this. We learned earlier this year that Kia’s EV6 wouldn’t be coming with a charging cable and at the time we said:
The EV6 doesn’t come with a Level 1 or 2 charging cable, for better or worse. Talking to the team I think the thinking is, why add a $1,000 part and the complexity associated with it when people might already have a charging station at home, might not have a garage, and/or could probably pick one designed best for them for a cheaper price at an online retailer. For someone like me that has like five different EV chargers at the house already, that makes sense, but as a first-time EV buyer, it adds significant complexity to getting an EV. Throwing in a $200 charge cable would make a lot of sense
I know a lot of owners just like to carry the mobile connector in the car at all time in order to get a trickle charge somewhere if need be.
What do you think? Is Tesla being greedy here or is it a good move? Let us know what you think in the comment section below.

2022/04/16,"Tesla has unveiled its latest giant Megapack project consisting of 360 MWh of energy storage capacity used in concert with a solar farm to help power 60,000 homes.
Arevon is becoming one of Tesla’s biggest partners in the deployment of energy storage capacity.
Last year, Tesla and Arevon signed a deal for the former to supply a record amount of 2 GW/6 GWh of Megapack batteries to the latter for several new energy storage projects.
That’s more capacity than Tesla has deployed over the last two years combined.
They are already working on several projects together, and Tesla unveiled one of them in a new video today:
The project called ‘Townsite Solar and Storage Facility’ is located in Boulder City, Nevada, a few miles from Las Vegas, and it consists of over half a million solar panels.
For Tesla’s part, the company supplied 360 MWh of Megapacks to help take full advantage of that solar power.
Tesla writes about the project:
“Arevon’s Townsite Solar and Storage Facility generates 500,000 MWh annually, powering 60,000 homes and avoiding 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.”
It has become one of Tesla’s biggest Megapack projects in the world.
Megapack has rapidly become the go-to product for large-scale energy storage projects.
Tesla recently increased the price of the energy storage device as its backlog extends into the next year. In order to address the demand, Tesla is building a new Megafactory in California to ramp up production.
As we previously reported, CEO Elon Musk believes that Tesla Energy will become a distributed global utility, an endeavor that could even outgrow the company’s automotive business.
Update: Tesla has updated the Megapack with more energy capacity.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/04/15,"Tesla has changed its policy to now not allow anyone to buy their car after their lease is over as used car prices are skyrocketing to new records.
Back in 2019, Tesla announced that it wouldn’t let people who are leasing a Model 3 buy it from the company at the end of their lease, which is most often an option in car leasing.
At the time, Tesla claimed that it removed the option because it planned to use the vehicles in its upcoming autonomous ride-hailing network:
“Please note, customers who choose leasing over owning will not have the option to purchase their car at the end of the lease, because with full autonomy coming in the future via an over-the-air software update, we plan to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network. Customers can visit tesla.com/3 now to lease a Model 3.”
Three years later, this autonomous ride-hailing network has yet to happen, but the move was still extremely powerful for Tesla due to what happened to the used car market.
With long wait times and increased prices, many used Tesla vehicles are now being sold at higher prices than when they were new.
Tesla has been making a killing on those vehicles coming off of their leases, just like Tesla owners who are upgrading their vehicles.
Now Tesla is expanding its no lease buyout policy to all vehicles, according to an update to its website:
If you leased your vehicle before April 15, 2022, you may be eligible to purchase your leased Tesla. Review your lease agreement to see if you qualify.
Eligibility
– All Tesla vehicles delivered on or after April 15, 2022 are not eligible for purchase.
– Third-party dealerships and third-party individuals are not eligible to purchase leased vehicles.
The new language makes it that now no new vehicle on lease starting today is eligible to be purchased at the end of the lease.
What do you think? Tesla wants more vehicles in its nonexistent (but potentially upcoming) autonomous ride-hailing network or does it want more used cars to sell? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/04/15,"New documents show that Tesla has a major cost advantage when deploying fast-charging stations as its Superchargers cost just one-fifth of what the average competing charging networks are paying to deploy new stations.
Last year, we reported on the Texas Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Program (TxVEMP), which is a program that uses the settlement from the Dieselgate scandal to fund projects to help the air quality in Texas, including funding electric vehicle charging stations.
It was interesting because Tesla applied for grants through the program to help fund building what could become the first Superchargers that accept all-electric vehicles in the US, and not just Tesla vehicles.
Now the program has announced the distribution of the grants, and unfortunately for Tesla, it didn’t make the cut and it’s not clear why. Having just moved its headquarters and new factory to the state should have at least levelled the playing field. 
But regardless, there’s still some good news coming out of the program for the automaker, since it revealed that Tesla appears to have a massive advantage in the cost of deployment of new fast-charging stations.
Companies couldn’t apply for more than 70% of the cost of the chargers up to $150,000 per charger, and Forbes reports that Tesla was asking for only ~$30,000 per charger versus the full $150,000 for most applicants:
“A Texas program which gives grants to install fast EV chargers, as long as they support non-Tesla cars got applications by Tesla. This was a first for Tesla in the USA, as their stations normally only charge Tesla cars. Also interesting is the amounts of the grants, which can cover 70% of the cost of the chargers, to a maximum of $150,000 per charger. Tesla’s applications ask for as little as $30,000 per charger, while most other applications are claiming the maximum $150,000 and perhaps cost even more.”
It would mean that Tesla’s Superchargers cost no more than ~$43,000 per charger versus over $200,000 for the competition based on the documents in these applications to the TxVEMP program.
Some of the other applicants include big names in the charging industry like EVgo, Chargepoint, as well as many big gas station operators.
Powerful fast-charging stations, like Tesla Superchargers, which can charge at up to 250 kW, are extremely expensive to make due to the powerful electronics in them. 
We have seen sale prices of over $100,000 for some chargers, and it’s not unimaginable to see the cost doubling with installation depending on several factors.
It makes it all the more impressive that Tesla appears to be able to manage to keep the cost under $50,000 per charger.
Back in 2016, when Tesla was still sharing its asset value of the Supercharger network, the automaker was talking about a value of $285,300 per station or $49,000 per charger, but that was back when each charger had less than half the power capacity of current Superchargers.
Therefore, the cost appears to have come down over the years despite the capacity of the charging stations more than doubling.
Tesla has strong expertise in power electronics, not just for its charging stations but also for its electric vehicles and commercial power inverters.
The company produces Superchargers at Gigafactory New York, and more recently, Tesla opened a new Supercharger factory in Shanghai, which it aims to ramp up to 10,000 Supercharging stalls per year.

2022/04/15,"Tesla is now aiming to reopen Gigafactory Shanghai on Monday, April 18 after roughly three weeks of being shut down and missing out on the production of over 40,000 electric vehicles.
Shanghai has seen a notable rise in COVID-19 infections over the last month, and in an attempt to curb the growth, the authorities implemented some drastic lockdown measures that have been in place for weeks now.
It led Tesla to have to shut down Gigafactory Shanghai on March 28.
Tesla was supposed to restart production the next weekend, but it couldn’t make it work as it wasn’t able to secure enough workers and suppliers.
The automaker was expected to once again attempt a restart of production during the week, but it couldn’t make it work again.
The second phase of the two-phase city lockdown was supposed to end on April 7, but the authorities have extended it indefinitely amid continued spread despite the measures in place.
It led to a lot of uncertainty about when Tesla would be able to reopen its critical factory.
Now Reuters reports that Tesla has received the go-ahead from authorities to reopen on Monday, April 18:
“Tesla is preparing to resume production at its Shanghai plant on Monday following a three-week stoppage, having received the go-ahead from local authorities, two people familiar with the matter said.”
If it finally happens, it would mean that Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai would have been shut down for three weeks. At a production capacity of around 2,000 vehicles per day, Tesla will have missed out on over 40,000 vehicles.
Furthermore, Tesla is expected to restart production with only one shift and gradually ramp up production. Therefore, the factory shutdown could be felt throughout the rest of the month at least.
As we previously reported, this is undoubtedly going to significantly impact Tesla’s performance in Q2 2022 and likely even break the company’s streak of record deliveries for seven consecutive quarters.

2022/04/15,"Elon Musk opened up in a new interview yesterday about the SEC lawsuit regarding his attempt to take Tesla private back in 2018 and his infamous “funding secured” announcement.
The Tesla CEO now claims funding was indeed secured and that he was forced to settle with the SEC  because the company’s banks were telling him that he wouldn’t be able to secure additional funding if he kept fighting the lawsuit.
The whole situation stems from the SEC filing a lawsuit against Musk over his infamous “funding secured” comment regarding his failed attempt to take Tesla private back in 2018.
Back in 2018, Musk briefly considered trying to bring Tesla private and disclosed that to investors through a simple tweet.
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) judged that Musk exaggerated and misled shareholders when saying that the funding was “secured” in the tweet:
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Musk went on a campaign against the SEC, calling them names and claiming that they were working for people shorting the electric automaker. But ultimately, Tesla and Musk ended up reaching a settlement with the SEC.
SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s
As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down from the role of chairman of the board, and Tesla and Musk had to each pay $20 million in fines. 
The CEO presumably didn’t want Tesla to have to pay for his issue with the SEC. While he couldn’t directly pay for Tesla’s part of the fine, he decided to buy $20 million worth of shares from Tesla. That way, he sort of indirectly ended up paying for Tesla’s fine – though he also ended up with ~71,000 additional Tesla shares in the process.
As we previously reported, Musk ended up actually making money from the settlement due to Tesla’s stock price surging.
Another part of the settlement was that Musk and Tesla had to agree for the former to have his tweets reviewed by the latter’s legal department if they are material to the company. Despite the settlement, Musk didn’t change his use of his popular Twitter account with over 80 million followers, and he has remained defiant when it comes to the SEC.
Even though this happened four years ago, it is coming back to light because Musk has been trying to get the settlement changed as he believes that the SEC has abused the Twitter policing part of the settlement.
In February, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, sent a letter to the court to request an audience to discuss what he described as the SEC’s “harassment” of Tesla and Musk. He also claims that the SEC has yet to distribute the $40 million settlement money to shareholders.
The SEC quickly denied the allegations of harassment and claimed that a plan for distributing the money was going to be submitted to the court next month and the delay is due to the complexity.
The court ended up denying Musk’s request, but his lawyers later filed a new motion in court to recant the settlement and remove the SEC’s Twitter policing of Musk.
In the motion, Musk argued through his lawyers that he never lied to Tesla shareholders and he decided to take the settlement for “Tesla’s immediate survival” as he was being told that the ongoing battle with the SEC could prevent Tesla from raising money and that Tesla’s biggest shareholders could walk away.
However, in the filing, they don’t go into details about how the funding was indeed secured. This seems material to both SEC and the public at large, especially in light of his recent attempt at a hostile takeover of Twitter. 
Now in a new interview yesterday, Musk elaborated on the situation again insisting that he never lied to investors and that “funding was indeed secured”:
Funding was indeed secured. I should say I do not have respect for the SEC in that situation. I don’t mean to blame everyone at the SEC, but certainly the San Francisco office. The SEC knew that funding was secured. They pursued an active public investigation, nonetheless.
Again, he didn’t go into details about how the funding was secured. Back then, they were rumors of potential talks about Saudi Arabia and Volkswagen potentially being part of the deal, but those were never confirmed to be more than very early talks.
But in the new interview, Musk also insists that the SEC knew that the funding was “secured” and that Tesla was getting pressured by its banking partners to settle. He described the situation as “like having a gun to your child’s head” and the SEC “unlawfully” pressure the deal.
The SEC has yet to respond to the new comments.
These new revelations come as Musk is trying to take another public company private: Twitter. However, his financial situation has improved greatly over the last four years, and he could easily secured the money to fulfill his $41 billion offer. Though he might potentially have to sell some more Tesla shares.

2022/04/14,"Dredging up the past, Elon Musk said today that “starting Tesla” with the two original cofounders instead of just JB Straubel was the “worst decision” of his business career. The comment brings back to light Tesla’s controversial founding.
During a live interview at TED 2022 today, Musk was asked by a fan which one thing he would change if he could go back in time. The CEO’s response was interesting. He linked his answer to Tesla, saying he believes that the worst decision of his business career was to not start Tesla with just JB Straubel, cofounder and longtime CTO at the automaker.
At first, it sounded like Musk wouldn’t name the other cofounders, whom he sees as problematic, but he ended up dredging up the past a little more and mentioning Martin Eberhard, Tesla cofounder and the company’s first CEO.
During the interview, the CEO accused Eberhard of “dedicating his life” to pushing the idea that Musk was not a founder of Tesla. Musk has himself been accused in the past of trying to rewrite Tesla’s founding history, but as with almost with everything, it’s a complicated story with a lot of nuances.
Technically, the company was “founded,” or at least incorporated, in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning – and only them. 
While the idea behind Tesla has evolved over the years, it was already pretty close back then to what Tesla is mostly known for today – making electric vehicles that are more compelling than their gas-powered counterparts. More specifically, Eberhard and Tarpenning were looking to capitalize on advances in Li-ion battery technology to deliver an electric car with better performance.
Ian Wright was Tesla’s third employee and joined late in 2003.
Musk famously joined as chairman in early 2004 as part of the company’s series A investment round, which he led with $6.5 million of the $7.5 million round. He already had a longtime interest in electric vehicles and was convinced to invest in Tesla after meeting JB Straubel, who was already aware of the project from being around the EV community in the Bay Area.
Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as Chief Technology Officer, a position he held until leaving in 2019.
These are the main facts about the founding of Tesla that are harder to debate, but the importance and impact of all these people at Tesla have been challenged. 
These issues all came out in a series of lawsuits and counter lawsuits in 2008–2009 when Eberhard was ousted from the company after difficulties bringing the Roadster to the market and Musk took over the company.
A judge overseeing the cases actually came to the conclusion that all of them – Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and JB Straubel – should be considered cofounders of the company.
Honestly, I don’t think it’s worth dredging up this era of Tesla because I think the compromise that everyone is considered a founder is perfectly fine.
I don’t think anyone can argue that Musk didn’t have a disproportionate impact on Tesla, and it would not have survived without him. Even if he wasn’t there at the very beginning, he deserves a title of founder in my opinion.
As for Musk downplaying Eberhard’s own role at the company, it seems that most people at Tesla agree that he wasn’t a great business operator and didn’t handle the Roadster program properly. Nonetheless, I think he deserves credit for being an early advocate for electric vehicles and helping the latest electric revolution at its very beginning. 
Would Tesla be much different today if Musk and Straubel had been the only ones around in the beginning? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/04/14,"Tesla has managed to convince a judge to slash the historic $137 million award it was supposed to pay a former employee as part of a racial abuse lawsuit to $15 million.
Last year, a court ruled against Tesla in a case from plaintiff Owen Diaz, who worked at the company’s Fremont factory from June 2015 to May 2016 as a contract worker hired by a staffing company, about what was described as “racial abuse.”
The jury awarded $6.9 million in damages for emotional distress and $130 million in punitive damages.
Diaz claimed he worked in an environment where “daily racist epithets” were common, and he claims Tesla didn’t do enough to stop it.
Tesla defended itself against the claims and said that the $137 million award was not fair.
Now it managed to at least reverse the award back down to $15 million (via Silicon Valley Business Journal):
U.S. District Judge William Orrick ruled in a 43-page decision that the $137 million awarded to Owen Diaz, a former elevator operator at Tesla’s Fremont factory, would be reduced to about $15 million, calling parts of the former amount “excessive” and “unconstitutionally large.”
Though that’s not really what Tesla was aiming for, since the automaker’s lawyers were pushing to limit compensatory and punitive damages to $300,000 each.
But that might be the best Tesla can get as Diaz’s lawyers are planning to appeal the new judgment that slashed the award down to $15 million.
Though it’s not Tesla’s only issue with lawsuits related to claims of racism.
Earlier this year, Tesla released a blog post titled “The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit” in which it warned that the state agency was going to file a lawsuit alleging “systematic racial discrimination and harassment”. 
In the post, Tesla argued that the lawsuit was based on “alleged misconduct by production associates at the Fremont factory that took place between 2015 and 2019.“ The company also argued that NFEH didn’t try to solve the issue without a lawsuit and that in each of the individual cases, they didn’t find Tesla at fault.
However, a few days later, we got access to the full lawsuit and saw that the allegations were much more serious.
The automaker is expected to be embroiled in this lawsuit for a long time.

2022/04/13,"Tesla fans have propagated clearly fake news of the automaker supposedly acquiring a small lithium mining company that sent its stock up over 250%.
Over the last few years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has used his popular Twitter account to promote several accounts that have become influential in the Tesla community.
As we previously reported, several of these accounts have been known to spread misinformation in the past.
Now it’s becoming dangerous to a certain degree with a new example today. 
A newswire posted what they claim was a confirmation that Tesla is acquiring Lithium Corporation, a junior mining firm based in Nevada.
They wrote in the release:
“Tesla confirmed that it acquired Nevada-based litium mining company $LTUM Lithium Corporation.”
The release is very light on actual information and even referenced Elon Musk’s recent comments about Tesla possibly going into the lithium mining business, but no quote about the acquisition from either company.
We quickly realized that it was inaccurate as it states that Tesla “confirmed” the acquisition and the automaker has very few official channels to confirm any information these days, namely SEC filings, its blog, its official Twitter account, and Musk’s account – that’s about it.
A quick check of those channels shows that the automaker didn’t confirm the news nor did Lithium Corporation, the other party at play here.
We thought that was it, but the fake news was quickly shared as official by Sawyer Merritt, who operates a Twitter account popular amongst Tesla fans on the social platform and often promoted directly by Musk:
Within 30 minutes, the post was retweeted over 400 times, mainly by Merrit’s following of Tesla fans, before being taken down.
It helped the news go viral and sent Lithium Corporation’s stock up more than 250%:
Normally, only 200,000 shares of Lithium Corporation, which normally trades at around $0.30, change hands every day, but over 20 million shares moved today after the fake news started to spread.
Lithium Corporation issued an official statement confirming that the news is fake and that the company has no relation with Tesla:
“Lithium Corporation (OTCQB:LTUM) (“LTUM” or “the Company”), a North American company focused on energy metals for the growing energy storage sector and high-tech industries, wishes to inform shareholders that, contrary to a press release issued by unknown parties on the 12th of April and rumors circulating on social media, we have not received so much as an expression of interest from Tesla, Inc. and no employees have left Lithium Corporation to take up employment with Tesla. We would be happy to chat with Elon if he was inclined, but presently there is no relationship between the two companies.”
Merritt later recanted the tweet and said that he doesn’t own shares in Lithium Corporation.
Presumably, someone who owned shares paid the newswire service to publish the fake release hoping that people like Merritt would take it seriously and promote it, but it will be difficult to identify who.
The newswire release referenced public relations firm ‘5W Public Relations’ as being behind the release.
Electrek reached out to the firm and Ronn Torossian, Chairman and Founder of 5W, claimed that they had nothing to do with the release and it’s not clear why their name was associated with it.
This is a real problem with Tesla Twitter these days. We are seeing a rise in those “breaking news” accounts that are often not verifying information before posting it.
To be fair, it’s also the case with more traditional media. For example, just yesterday I went on a rant about how several media were mistakenly reporting that Tesla “reopen” Roadster reservations even though it never closed them:
This is wild. Look at all those publications posting this as news without verifying it. Working in media for a few years now really has me losing faith in media. https://t.co/ctCBOgKfo6 pic.twitter.com/1J0Cryz2ap
But this specific example today is interesting because it was something that was clearly fake and intended as fraud. Yet, it was promoted by a popular Twitter account that has been made popular in part by Musk on Twitter.
In the meantime, Musk insists on Tesla not communicating directly with actual reporters to clarify stories.
This was a good one lol. pic.twitter.com/kiDqsWlwa7
I’ve been saying this for a while now, but I don’t see how this is helping improve the quality of information around Tesla.

2022/04/13,"Tesla has applied for a trademark on the term ‘CYBERBACKPACK,’ which happens to be the name used by a Tesla fan who designed a Cybertruck inspired backpack.
Is it going to be the next overpriced Tesla accessory like the Cyberwhistle and Tesla belt buckle?
Last week, Tesla applied for a series of new trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Most of them were related to terms like ‘Giga Texas’ and ‘Cyber Rodeo’ and appear to be about securing trademarks for apparel that Tesla gave out at the Cyber Rodeo event last week.
But there’s one new trademark that stood out to me, CYBERBACKPACK, which didn’t seem directly related to anything that took place at last week’s event.
Tesla wrote in the trademarked application:
“CYBERBACKPACK™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of book bags; school bags.”
CYBERBACKPACK happens to be the term used by a Tesla fan named Riz who designed a Cybertruck-inspired backpack:
Riz designed the backpack to look like the Cybertruck, and it even features a battery pack to charge your device.
In a comment to Yanko design, Riz said that his dream was to sell the backpack on Tesla’s merch website:
“The Cyberbackpack is up for grabs on its website for $199, although that price is limited just to the first 300 buyers, after which it gets bumped up to $349 so Riz can actually end up making some money off the bag. His ultimate dream, however, is to have the Cyberbackpack listed on Tesla’s website as official merch, while splitting the profits with Tesla’s Technoking Elon himself!”
It looks like his dream might become true as his Cyberbackpack website is now down and Tesla is trademarking the term.
In recent years, Tesla has released several products on its merch website that have been somewhat controversial for being overpriced.
For example, its $50 Cyberwhistle and $150 belt buckle, which cannot cost more than a few bucks to produce. Some see the situation as Tesla taking advantage of its superfans to sell them some overpriced trinkets. 
Later, Tesla started only accepting Dogecoin to buy those products on its website.
Could the Tesla Cyberbackpack become the next product on that list? Let us know what you think in the comment section below.

2022/04/13,"Tesla has announced that it is changing the timeframe of its off-peak hours at Superchargers in California to encourage owners to charge their cars later.
The automaker is still trying to tune incentives to help with traffic and costs on its vast charging networks.
It was only a few years ago that Tesla owners didn’t have to pay anything to stop and charge at a Supercharger station.
In the early days of Tesla and electric vehicles, it made sense in order to create a seamless experience and encourage ease of travel as many were still on the fence about electric vehicles.
But now that they are taking over fast and Tesla’s own fleet is growing into millions of cars, the automaker needs to make the Supercharger network financially sustainable in order to grow it along with its customer fleet.
Tesla started charging for every charging session, but the automaker is still figuring out how its pricing model incentivizes owners and optimizes cost and traffic.
One of the best tools for the latter is a lower rate for off-peak hours.
This week, Tesla announced an important change to its off-peak hours in California, its biggest market:
Starting April 12, 2022, off-peak hours will change at California Supercharger locations. Charge for less at select Superchargers before 11 AM and after 9 PM. Tap the Supercharger map pin in your in-car touchscreen to view specific rates and eligible sites. Navigate to your destination using Trip Planner and your battery will automatically precondition before you arrive.
The company basically moved the window two hours later in the day as it used to start at 7 p.m.
Rates are different depending on the station, but they can often charge around $0.48 per kWh during peak hours versus $0.24 during off-peak hours. 
The new hours will encourage people who can charge later to wait and free up some traffic at the Supercharger stations during busier hours. It will also bring Tesla additional revenue, which it can use to increase Supercharger capacity where needed.
California is Tesla’s biggest market, and while it’s also where the Supercharger network is most extensive, owners are still often experiencing wait times at stations due to high traffic.

2022/04/12,"Automakers worldwide will spend more than a half trillion dollars to develop new electric cars and passenger trucks, and also on battery manufacturing, through 2030, according to the latest report by London-based sustainability consultancy firm ERM for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).
The report, the “Electric Vehicle Market Update,” is the fifth update to a report that tracks the current status and projected growth of the US EV industry. The original report was released in May 2019.
Here are some standout findings from the report:
And when it comes to medium and heavy-duty vehicles like freight trucks and buses, the report had a couple findings of note:
When it comes to electric vs. gas, car sales seem to be at an inflection point. A separate CleanTechnica report from yesterday found that US auto sales overall were down 18% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2019 (more than 684,000), down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2020 (more than 201,000), and down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2021 (more than 581,000). 
But here’s where it gets interesting: Tesla, which is way ahead in the electric vehicle manufacturing and delivery game, saw its sales up 256% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2019, and 47% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. It was only one of three auto brands (that’s both gas and electric) that got more sales year-over-year, along with MINI and BMW.
CleanTechnica notes that there are a number of theories why this is happening, but also writes, “The biggest losers seem to be old-school luxury auto brands with no electric presence, perhaps brands that would previously get sales from people now buying Teslas.”

2022/04/12,"Tesla is facing a second assault on its right to sell and service its cars directly in the state of Oklahoma as legislators moved anti-direct sale language to a new bill.
The company fears that the legislation will go as far as preventing it from pushing software updates over-the-air to its current fleet.
It wasn’t long ago that Oklahoma, and especially Tulsa, was trying to seduce Tesla to try to get the automaker to build a factory in the region.
Now the Oklahoma legislation has turned on Tesla as it tries to ban direct sales in the state, which would affect several automakers, but Tesla in particular since the automaker has already direct-to-consumer locations in the state.
Earlier this year, we reported on Tesla reaching out to its fans to try countering a new bill being considered in the state’s House Business and Commerce Committee.
At the time, Tesla argued that the bill (HB 3994) could even force the company to shut down its locations in the state:
If passed, this bill could force Tesla to close its existing locations in Oklahoma AND prevent Tesla from shipping cars to anyone in the state, which would force locals to travel out-of-state to service their cars or pick up their new Tesla vehicles. Oklahoma should focus on increasing revenue and jobs in the state, not stifling competition and limiting consumer choice.
Fortunately, the bill was defeated, but not for long. They have now used the same language and introduced it in a new Senate bill (SB 512).
Tesla has reached out to local owners and fans to let them know of the subterfuge:
“Just like HB 3994, SB 512 could be interpreted as forcing Tesla to close our service center and gallery locations in Oklahoma, as well as prohibiting Tesla from offering over the air software updates to your vehicle. Tesla locations bring jobs and revenue to the state, while serving the needs of our current and future Oklahoma vehicle owners.”
The automaker is encouraging local owners to reach out to their legislators to let them know that they are not OK with this initiative.
As we have previously reported, there are still some states that prevent Tesla and other automakers from selling directly to consumers.
This is because of old laws put in place to protect franchise dealerships against automakers trying to compete with the people who invested a lot of money into providing a sale and service workforce for them. It made a lot of sense.
But now, those same laws are being used to prevent Tesla and other new automakers who never had franchise dealerships from competing against dealers who sell vehicles from other automakers – it’s being used in an anti-competitive way.
Several states have changed those direct sale laws in order to avoid this misuse that gave a monopoly on car sales to third-party dealers, but there are still some misuses out there and efforts from dealers associations – which have a lot of power in state politics – to outlaw direct sales.

2022/04/12,"Tesla has launched the Model Y Standard Range AWD starting at $60,000, but it only made it available to employees for now.
It comes with a few upgrades.
At the Cyber Rodeo event last week, Tesla delivered its first made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles.
We noted that it was strange that Tesla didn’t reveal any details, like specs and pricing, about the new version of the electric SUV.
It is equipped with the new 4680 battery cells and structural battery pack technology, which is resulting in a significantly different car with different specs in the new Model Y trim.
Yet, Tesla never listed this new trim for sale and all we know about it was through an EPA filing that revealed it has 279 miles of range and an all-wheel-drive powertrain. It is billed as a ‘Model Y Standard Range AWD.’
We suspected that Tesla is only delivering the vehicle to employees for now through internal deals, which would explain why it never showed up on its website.
Now we can confirm that. 
Electrek confirmed with Tesla employees that the automaker communicated to them on April 9 that it is selling the new version of the Model Y internally for now and it will go for sale to regular customers in the coming weeks.
It is sold starting at $59,990, or $3,000 less than the Model Y Long Range AWD, which has 330 miles of estimate EPA range.
According to the employee communication obtained by Electrek, it has a 0-60 mph acceleration in five seconds, which is barely slower than the Model Y Long Range at 4.8 seconds.
Aside from changes to the powetrain, the new Model Y built in Texas also has a few new features, including a magnetic center console armrest and a parcel shelf.
Tesla delivered the first 20 Model Ys to employees at the event last week and it is expected to continue deliveries to employees who ordered the vehicle in the coming weeks before listing it on its online configurator along with the Long Range and Performance versions built in California.

2022/04/12,"Update: PG&E now says that the Tesla Megapacks are not part of the investigation. The project has now been turned on.
Tesla has deployed what many believe will become the world’s largest battery system for PG&E at the Moss Landing station in California. However, the Tesla Megapack system has been shut down for months due to a fire investigation. 
But the company is still planning to move forward with the expansion of the energy storage system this summer.
We first learned of the project at PG&E’s Moss Landing substation when it submitted it to CPUC and the company was in talks with Tesla in 2017.
It involves four separate energy storage projects, and two of them should become the world’s largest battery systems.
Dynegy is going to deploy a 300MW/1,200MWh project on PG&E’s grid while the Tesla project will be 182.5MW/730MWh, which could eventually go up to 1.1GWh.
In 2018, we obtained Tesla’s proposal for the project, and it shows that the company plans to use “Megapack” instead of its usual Powerpack for large utility-scale projects.
In 2020, the project was officially approved, and Tesla started construction on the first phase of the project in July.
Last year, Tesla deployed Megapacks with a capacity of 100 MW/ 300 MWh at the site, and Vistra Corp, the operator of the site for PG&E, started operating the system.
However, there were two incidents related to smoke and fire at the site in September 2021 and February 2022 that prompted a shutdown of the Tesla Megapack system for a full investigation.
Months later, there’s no clear timetable to power the system back on, but local newspaper Monterey County Weekly reports that the companies are aiming for this summer.
Both PG&E and Vistra appear confident that Tesla’s batteries were not related to the incidents:
Vistra spokesperson Meranda Cohn says the Sept. 4, 2021 and Feb. 13, 2022 incidents will not impact their push to move forward. PG&E spokesperson Paul Doherty says the same, adding the utility has “full confidence” in the project and that analysis so far has shown the batteries were not to blame for the two incidents.
At least one of the incidents reportedly was related to the Dynergy system, but not much information is currently available until the investigation is completed.
Even though the Megapacks remain shut down, the company plans to move ahead with the expansion of the energy storage systems with the next phase that aims to double it in size.
All parties involved expect the CPUC to approve the expansion.

2022/04/11,"Tesla is ramping up hiring for its Optimus robot project, also known as Tesla Bot, as it starts using its AI expertise to develop its “overall humanoid software architecture”.
As we previously reported, it feels like the Tesla Bot project went from a side project for the company to a top priority in a very period of time.
When Tesla announced the “Tesla Bot” project at its AI Day last year, Elon Musk presented it as something the company could do by leveraging existing work and parts from the development of self-driving technology, and if they don’t do it, someone else will.
At the time, it certainly didn’t sound like a priority for Tesla and many saw it mainly as a recruitment tool as the automaker is trying to boost its AI team to deliver its full self-driving system.
A few months later, the project’s priority level went up quite a bit.
Musk announced that Tesla is now prioritizing product development of Tesla Bot, which he now calls Optimus, in 2022 over some of its upcoming vehicles.
At the time, the company had yet to even unveil a working prototype of the humanoid robot.
Last week, Musk said that Tesla is aiming to start production of its Optimus humanoid robot in 2023 – much faster than anyone anticipated.
The company would be going from concept to production on what is arguably its most ambitious project yet – in about 28 months.
Tesla is going to have to significantly ramp up hiring for the project in order to make that happen, and it looks like that’s exactly what it is doing.
Over the last few weeks, Tesla has listed several more jobs related to the humanoid robot project. In the first few months of the project, Tesla listed several jobs, but they were related to developing actuators and the mechanics of the robot.
Now there are several really interesting positions related to the software behind the robot.
For example, Tesla listed a job called ‘Motion Planning & Navigation, Tesla Bot.’ The company wrote in the job description:
“Tesla is on a path to build humanoid bi-pedal robots at scale to automate repetitive and boring tasks for manufacturing/logistics. Core to the Tesla Bot, the motion planning stack presents a unique opportunity to work on state-of-the-art algorithms for motion planning and navigation culminating in their deployment to real world production applications. Our motion planning software engineers develop and own this stack from inception to deployment.”
Tesla says that the role is going to participate in the development of an “overall humanoid software architecture.”
Earlier this year,  Musk said that Tesla could play a role in making Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) a reality through the humanoid robot project.
The company has also listed several other interesting Tesla Bot jobs, including Deep Learning Engineer/Scientist, Tesla Bot, Electrical Engineer – Tesla Bot,  and Controls Engineer, Tesla Bot.

2022/04/11,"Tesla has briefly demonstrated the Cybertruck’s rear-wheel steering in a short video, but don’t blink because it’s barely noticeable.
Rear-wheel steering is quickly becoming a must-have feature for electric pickup trucks coming to market.
GMC started the dance by demonstrating “Crab Mode’ utilizing rear-wheel steering on the Hummer EV.
Several other automakers have since announced rear-wheel-steering and Tesla followed with the Cybertruck last year. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced last summer:
“We’re adding rear wheel steering, so it can do tight turns and maneuver with high agility.”
The CEO has been talking about Tesla bringing several upgrades to the Cybertruck for the production version after it was pushed to 2023.
The rear-wheel steering is one of them, but the truck is also expected to have a quad motor version and more.
A new prototype of the Cybertruck has been spotted over the last few months, and it showed a few of these upgrades like no door handles, but we never got to see the rear-wheel steering in action until now.
Tesla was spotted playing with the feature one of the Cybertrucks that they brought at the Cyber Rodeo at Gigafactory Texas last week:
You have to look carefully at the rear wheels here to see them angle in and out, but they clearly do – it’s just not noticeable unless you know what you are looking at.
Even just a slight 10-degree angle can have a big impact on maneuverability.
We expect that Tesla is going to demonstrate some more impressive tricks later on, like GM’s Crab Mode or Rivian’s Tank Turn.
Musk recently set a strong timeline to deliver the Cybertruck in 2023 after several delays.
However, the automaker has yet to give a concrete update on the electric pickup truck since removing specs and pricing from its website last year.
While the prototype at Gigafactory Texas last week had new features like the rear-wheel steering, it didn’t appear to be a near-production version, especially when it comes to the steel exoskeleton. The electric pickup truck appeared to have bent steel body panels.

2022/04/11,"Tesla has managed to deliver over 65,000 vehicles produced at Gigafactory Shanghai in March, an impressive output representing 100% year-over-year growth, despite the factory shutdown.
The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) announced today results for car registration in China in March.
They confirmed that Tesla China had an output of 65,814 vehicles with only 60 of them for exports.
That’s generally the case for the last month of the quarter as Tesla focuses on local deliveries.
It represents a 16% month-to-month increase compared to the 56,515-vehicle output in February, but the results are particularly impressive compared to the same period last year when Gigafactory Shanghai had half the output.
The results are even more impressive when you take into account that Tesla had not one but two factory shutdowns in March due to COVID-19 restrictions.
The factory had to shut down for two days in mid-March and again at the end of the month.
However, most of the impact is expected to be felt in April since the last factory shutdown has been extended to this week.
Based on the CPCA data, it means that 190,446 Tesla vehicles came from China during the first quarter – more than half of the 310,000 vehicles it delivered last quarter.
It shows just how important Gigafactory Shanghai has become for the automaker as it now surpasses Fremont factory in output and it has become its main export hub.
Gigafactory Berlin is expected to help Tesla rely less on Shanghai and supply the European market with Model Y vehicles.
However, the factory is believed to currently rely heavily on supply from Gigafactory Shanghai and it will take months before it can ramp up production to significant volumes.
Nonetheless, Tesla’s second quarter could be a really interesting one with the first production from Gigafactory Berlin and Texas counting toward Tesla’s global deliveries.

2022/04/11,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla “might actually have to get into the mining and refining” of lithium due to recent price increases to “insane levels”.
What is strange is that he previously announced two years ago that Tesla would get into the lithium mining business.
At Tesla’s Battery Day event in 2020, the automaker announced that it is getting into the mining business – starting with buying lithium claims on 10,000 acres in Nevada.
However, almost two years later, Tesla has yet to do anything with this claim or a new lithium mining technology announced at the same event.
In the meantime, the price of lithium has gone up by more than 400% during that time.
Now Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to announce that Tesla “might actually” follow through with its previous announcement of getting into lithium mining and refining.
He wrote:
“Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining and refining directly at scale, unless costs improve. There is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction/refinement is slow.”
This is a surprising statement for many since even though not much has happened since the announcement on Battery Day, many believed Tesla was still working toward its own lithium operations.
Now the CEO makes it sound like Tesla “might actually” pull the trigger on it due to the increase lithium prices.
Last year, Tesla applied for a patent for its lithium extraction technology.
The automaker described the process in the patent application:
“Processes for extracting lithium from a clay mineral and compositions thereof are described. The extraction process includes providing a clay mineral comprising lithium, mixing a cation source with the clay mineral, performing a high-energy mill of the clay mineral, and performing a liquid leach to obtain a lithium rich leach solution.“
Musk has claimed that the process would be environmentally-friendly and economical. 
Tesla’s needs for lithium supply are increasing fast as the company is expanding production with the new factories, like Gigafactory Texas and Berlin.

Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin, and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network shows a higher mix of renewable energy. Last summer, CEO Elon Musk said that he believes Tesla will resume taking Bitcoin payment as he sees improvements in the energy mix of Bitcoin mining. That has yet to happen, but Tesla is now directly involved in helping power Bitcoin mining with clean energy.
Blockstream and Blocks, formerly Square, have partnered on a green Bitcoind mining facility in Texas and now they have partnered with Tesla to provide a 3.8 MW solar farm and 12 MWh Megapack system to power the facility:
We’re excited to share the fully solar-powered, open-source Bitcoin mining facility Blockstream and Blocks, Inc. are collaborating on is set to be outfitted with a 3.8 Megawatt (MW) Tesla Solar PV array and 12 Megawatt-hour (MWh) Megapack. Construction has begun, and we’re eager to demonstrate the innovation we’ve packed into this unique facility.
The system is going to power 30 Petahashes per second with 100% solar power:
The combination of Tesla photovoltaics and Megapack battery equipment will drive the 30 Petahashes per second of mining hardware at the facility with 100% solar energy. Blockstream is providing the mining infrastructure and expertise to build and oversee the project, with the Bitcoin mining facility aiming to be completed later this year.
The companies announced that the project is already in construction. Once completed, they plan to regularly release reports on performance in order to show the economics of powering crypto mining with renewable energy.

2022/04/08,"After delaying virtually all new vehicle launches for the last few years, Elon Musk has now set a strong timeline for Tesla to bring Cybertruck, Roadster, and Tesla Semi to production in 2023.
Tesla has had the same lineup for a while now: Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y.
The automaker has unveiled many other vehicles over the years, but they have all been delayed.
Back in 2017, Tesla unveiled the Tesla Semi electric truck and next-generation Roadster. They were supposed to come to market in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
They still haven’t come to production.
In 2019, Tesla famously unveiled the Cybertruck and said it would come to market in 2020.
It was also delayed several times.
During a product roadmap update in January, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla will not launch a new product in 2022 as it focuses on scaling the production of current vehicles.
The Cybertruck was pushed to 2023 with a very tentative timeline – the same goes for the new Roadster.
At the Cyber Rodeo event yesterday, Musk released a more concrete timeline for the release of all those vehicles:
“Production of Cybertruck is coming next year. We will be in production with Roadster, and with Semi. That’s all coming. This year is all about scaling up and next year there’s going to be a massive wave of new products.”
This is a stronger timeline than Tesla has set for those products in years.
During the event, Musk also announced that Tesla is going to make a new futuristic-looking electric vehicle as a ‘dedicated robotaxi,’ but he didn’t share a timeline for it.
Aside from vehicles, the CEO even said that Tesla could start production of the Optimus humanoid robot next year – though he used more tentative language about that timeline.
Tesla also brought a Cybertruck prototype on stage at the event, but it was the same one that was spotted several times over the past few months and the company didn’t release new specs or pricing after removing those from its website last year.
Which of those upcoming Tesla vehicles are you most excited to see next year? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/04/08,"Tesla has officially delivered the first made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles, but it is still being vague about the new version of the electric SUV, especially regarding the specs and pricing.
The Cyber Rodeo event yesterday marked the opening of Gigafactory Texas, which was the real star of the show.
During a presentation at the event, CEO Elon Musk spent most of his time talking about the factory, which he believes will become “the highest-volume car factory in America” with the eventual production of over 1 million vehicles per year.
He said that Model Y will account for over 500,000 of those vehicles, and at the end of the event, he said that Tesla is officially delivering the first made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles that night – rolling some of them on stage as he announced it.
The CEO reiterated that those new Model Ys are “revolutionary” for being built with only three major pieces: a front and back giant single piece casting joined together by a structural battery pack enabled by Tesla’s new 4680 battery cell.
These important changes are expected to affect the specs of the electric SUV.
Musk noted the advantages of this new version of Model Y, like the simplicity of the manufacturing process, the weight reduction, which also translates into efficiency improvements, and the improved safety.
However, the CEO didn’t release any specific specs or pricing about the vehicle. 
That’s strange, to say the least, about a new vehicle that you claim to now be delivering to customers.
At the event, Electrek was able to confirm that the made-in-Texas Model Y vehicles on site were listed as Model Y Standard AWD, but Tesla is still not listing such a version of the vehicle on its online configurator:
The new Model Y Standard AWD is likely the new AWD 279-mile range Model Y that has recently been revealed through an EPA filing, but what is hard to understand is that it looks like Tesla delivered those without ever listing them on its website with the new specs or pricing.
We assume that Tesla is going to have to sell this new version at a lower price than the $63,000 Model Y Long Range AWD, which has a range of 330 miles, but nothing has been announced yet despite the first deliveries.
That’s certainly a strange situation. One explanation would be that Tesla only delivered the first vehicles to employees with whom it made specific deals about the cars.
However, it is still concerning that Tesla claims to have started production and deliveries of the new Model Y, and it’s not even listing the new version of its website for people to buy instead of the existing ones.
Considering that Tesla has a long backlog of Model Y orders, maybe the automaker is planning to reach out to some of them to offer them to upgrade (or technically downgrade range-wise and hopefully price-wise) to the made-in-Texas Model Y before taking new orders.
That would actually make sense, but we haven’t heard anything about that happening.
What do you think is happening with this new Model Y Standard AWD? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/04/07,"Elon Musk gave a timeline to production for the first time for the Tesla Optimus project, a humanoid robot capable of doing general tasks.
The CEO believes the company can bring the ambitious project to production as soon as next year. It’s an ultra-ambitious timeline even for him.
When Tesla announced the “Tesla Bot” project at its A Day last year, Elon Musk presented it as something the company could do by leveraging existing work and parts from the development of self-driving technology, and if they don’t do it, someone else will.
At the time, it certainly didn’t sound like a priority for Tesla and many saw it mainly as a recruitment tool as the automaker is trying to boost its AI team to deliver its full self-driving system.
A few months later, the project’s priority level went up fast.
Musk announced that Tesla is now prioritizing product development of Tesla Bot, which he now calls Optimus, in 2022 over some of its upcoming vehicles.
The CEO appeared a lot more excited about the project and its potential to impact labor shortage and eventually the broader economy.
When first announcing the project, Tesla was aiming to have a prototype of the humanoid robot ready by the end of 2022, but there was no talk of a production timeline just yet.
At the Tesla Cyber Rodeo event today, Musk offered a production timeline for the first time, and it is surprisingly aggressive even for him:
I think we have a shot at being in production for version 1 of Optimus hopefully next year.
Musk added about Tesla Optimus during the event:
It will upend our idea of what the economy is… it will be able to do basically anything humans don’t want to do. It will do it. It’s going to bring an age of abundance. It may be hard to imagine it, but as you see Optimus develop, and we will make sure it’s safe, no Terminator stuff, it will transform the world to a degree even greater than the cars.
This follows a ramp-up in excitement from the CEO about the project over the last few months.
In January, Musk said that Tesla could play a role in making Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) a reality through the humanoid robot project.
Then a few weeks later, we reported on Tesla’s AI director, Andrej Karpathy, stating he “believes ‘Tesla Bot’ is on track to become the most powerful AI development platform.”
It sounds like the project quickly graduated from something Tesla “might as well do” to a “world-changing endeavor” that is now a top priority at the company.

2022/04/07,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla is going to build a new futuristic-looking electric vehicle as a “dedicated robotaxi” – though there’s no clear timeline for the new vehicle.
At Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo event tonight, Gigafactory Texas was the real star of the show.
CEO Elon Musk made clear that Tesla’s focus in the short term and in 2022 specifically is to scale operations to increase production capacity, and Giga Texas is going to be critical to make that happen.
But the CEO still made sure to get people excited about upcoming new products and said that 2023 is going to be the year for new vehicles with the Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, and new Roadster all entering production next year.
Musk even announced a new vehicle at the event: a dedicated robotaxi.
When talking about what is next for Tesla, the CEO said:
There’s going to be a dedicated robotaxi that is going to look quite futuristic-looking.
He is talking about a new electric vehicle to join Tesla’s lineup and be strictly used for a taxi service.
This would be a departure from Tesla’s current self-driving plan as the company has been focused on achieving self-driving capability with the current hardware on its existing vehicles already on the road.
Now Musk is talking about Tesla building a new vehicle specifically for self-driving.
This has been a model adopted by other autonomous driving companies like Zoox. It allows more freedom in the design since the vehicle is never going to be driven by a human so a driver’s seat and controls are not required.
There also have been previous talks about Tesla building a self-driving vehicle to operate in The Boring Company’s tunnels. The company released the render seen above.
Musk didn’t offer a timeline on this new Tesla dedicated robotaxi, but it likely won’t be a priority until the automaker can fulfill its promise to the already tens of thousands of owners who bought its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package on existing vehicles.
At the event tonight, the CEO said that Tesla is aiming for everyone in North America who bought the FSD package to get access to the beta program.

2022/04/07,"Tesla is holding its Cyber Rodeo event at Gigafactory Texas today starting in a few hours, but the actual presentation is starting at 9:00 P.M. (central time – 10:00 P.M. eastern time).
Here you will find the livestream and our news hub with everything interesting that comes out of the event.
Today, Tesla is going to hold an event at Gigafactory Texas in Austin called ‘Cyber Rodeo‘. It is expected to be the giant factory’s grand opening, including the official launch of Model Y production at the plant.
Electrek is on-site for the event and we are going to bring you all the most important news from the presentation, which is expected to start at 10 PM ET, and from the whole day.
The doors open at 4 PM CT (5 PM ET) and attendees should have access to some activities before the actual presentation from CEO Elon Musk, which is going to be live-streamed here on Tesla’s Youtube channel:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz are also expected to attend the factory opening and potentially talk at the event.
We don’t know exactly what will take place during the event, but we have a few ideas.
For example, Tesla is expected to present an updated version of the Model Y produced at Gigafactory Texas with its new 4680 battery cell and structural battery pack design.
It could possibly be a new mid-range version of the Model Y that has recently been revealed through an EPA filing.
With the event being named ‘Cyber Rodeo’ and Gigafactory Texas being the future home of the Cybertruck, the electric pickup is also likely to make an appearance. Two Cybertruck prototypes were spotted ahead of the event yesterday.
Tesla Semi is also going to make an appearance since a prototype was spotted arriving at the plant earlier this week.
There could also be a few surprises.

2022/04/07,"Tesla is again in the headlines in China – the world’s biggest EV market – due to a recall of over 120,000 vehicles in China, but it’s another over-the-air software update fix.
Lately, Tesla has had to issue a lot of recalls, but most of them were minor issues that were fixed by simple over-the-air software updates.
For example, the automaker issued a recall that was reported as a “massive” recall on over 800,000 vehicles due to “a seat belt issue”, which sounds pretty bad, but in fact, it had to do with a reminder alert to buckle the seat belt that sometimes wouldn’t appear under very specific conditions.
It is creating a situation where the media sensationalizes major “recalls” when in fact, a simple over-the-air software update is needed, and no owner actually needs to bring back the car to a dealership or service center, as is the case with traditional recalls.
It actually highlights one of Tesla’s biggest advantages over the rest of the industry: the high level of connectivity in its vehicles, and its lack of reliance on third-party dealers to service them.
Last month, Tesla issued another of what we are now calling an “over-the-air recall,” over a delay to show the rearview image on some vehicles.
Now, Tesla is facing another such “over-the-air recall”. This time in China and for over 120,000 vehicles.
The South China Morning Post reports that the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced the recall affecting 127,785 Model 3s in China.
The issue is reportedly related to “semiconductor component”, but the details are unclear. Even it’s related to a component, SAMR said that it can be fixed via a software update over-the-air:
“The problem lies in the semiconductor component, which … may lead to potential collisions and pose a safety hazard in some extreme scenarios,” the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement. Tesla will upgrade a software for the recalled vehicles free of charge through over-the-air vehicle remote upgrade technology, SAMR said. Those who cannot access the upgrade remotely will have to contact sales centers.
This comes amidst Tesla being in a precarious situation in China with Gigafactory Shanghai because it shut down for over 10 days due to a COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/04/07,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk and several other auto industry leaders, like GM’s Mary Barra, met with the Biden administration regarding electric vehicle charging infrastructure, according to a new release from the Department of Transport.
Last year, Tesla and Musk weren’t invited to a meeting on the US auto industry at the white house regarding electrification.
Musk took it personally and made several comments about President Biden and his administration, including personal insults to the president. Biden wouldn’t even mention Tesla or Musk after that.
Things escalated when Biden made the undoubtedly ridiculous statement that gave GM CEO Mary Barra credit for “electrifying the entire auto industry” despite Tesla being responsible for about 80% of electric vehicles in the US.
 Finally, the situation appeared to have calmed down when Biden finally acknowledged Tesla as “America’s largest EV maker” in a speech earlier this year.
Both Musk and the administration have since made comments that indicated that they would be willing to meet.
It finally happened yesterday as the Department of Transport released a statement confirming that Musk attended a meeting on electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg led the meeting along with several other DOT officials, and most of the auto industry leadership in the US was present, including Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, and leaders of smaller EV startups like Lucid’s Peter Rawlinson.
It appears that they mostly discussed the government’s $7.5 billion investment in EV infrastructure and how the program is going to work.
According to a press release, “there was broad consensus that charging stations and vehicles need to be interoperable and provide a seamless user experience, no matter what car you drive or where you charge your EV.”
As we previously reported, the program already made clear that automaker benefiting from the financing will need to build charging stations that can be used by electric vehicles from more than one automaker.
This is not a problem for most automakers since they have almost all adopted the CCS standard in North America, except for Tesla, which uses its own proprietery plug for its Supercharger network.
However, Tesla has indicated that it plans to open up the network to other electric vehicles in the near future and it already started a pilot program to do that in Europe.

2022/04/07,"Tesla has implemented another price increase (its third in about a month), but this time it only affects Model 3 vehicles with nickel-based battery packs.
In 2021, all Tesla vehicles saw gradual price increases throughout the entire lineup, which CEO Elon Musk blamed on supply chain pressure – though it’s fair to note that Tesla’s gross margin also improved significantly during that time.
Tesla took a break with price increases early in 2022, but Musk announced on Twitter in early March that both Tesla and SpaceX were seeing significant inflation and indicated that price increases were likely coming.
The automaker started out with a $1,000 increase for all of the vehicles equipped with long-range battery packs, which use nickel-based chemistry and the price of nickel increased considerably amid the conflict in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, which is one of the world’s largest producer of nickel.
Tesla followed up with more significant price increases throughout the entire lineup in mid-March.
Now a few weeks later, Tesla again updated its online configurator to increase prices, but this time it is only affecting a few trims of the Model 3:
Tesla increased the price of the Model 3 Long Range from $54,490 to $55,990.
The automaker also increased the price of the Model 3 Performance version from $61,990 to $62,990.
The base version of the Model 3, the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive, stayed the same price at $46,990.
Tesla only increased the price of the Model 3 vehicles equipped with nickel-based batteries as the Model 3 Rear-Wheel-Drive is equipped with iron-based (LFP) battery cells.
As we previously reported, the price of nickel increased 62% in the first few months of the year.
The Model 3, unlike Tesla’s other models, is still available for order in the US with somewhat reasonable delivery timelines with still some openings for deliveries in June and July depending on the trim and options.

2022/04/06,"Tesla is about to hold its ‘Cyber Rodeo’ event for the opening of Gigafactory Texas tomorrow, and it might unveil a few surprises there with not one, but two Cybertruck prototypes spotted at the factory in addition to some unidentified vehicles.
Tomorrow, April 7, Tesla is going to hold an event at Gigafactory Texas in Austin called ‘Cyber Rodeo‘. It is expected to be the factory’s grand opening, including the official launch of Model Y production at the plant.
Elon Musk is expected to take the stage, much like he did last month at Gigafactory Berlin, and officiate the launch of the new factory in Texas. This time, it should be a bit different than Gigafactory Berlin, since Tesla is producing a new version of the Model Y at Giga Texas with its new 4680 battery cell and structural battery pack design.
This new version of the vehicle is expected to feature different specs due to the new battery pack, and Musk is likely to talk about the differences during the Cyber Rodeo event.
It could possibly be a new mid-range version of the Model Y that has recently been revealed through an EPA filing.
With the event being named ‘Cyber Rodeo’ and Gigafactory Texas being the future home of the Cybertruck, the electric pickup is also likely to make an appearance.
Last night, drone pilot Joe Tegtmeyer flew over the factory and spotted where Tesla appears to be hiding vehicles to be displayed at the event tomorrow:
6 April 2022 Giga Texas IMAGES! 1 day until “Cyber Rodeo”! Night flight around factory, lots of stages & setup W side, N transformation nearly complete & GeoPier work underway in the far NE … plus very special arrivals! See more in my YouTube Video (@JoeTegtmeyer) later today! pic.twitter.com/la1IQb2qQ1
We can see the Tesla Semi, which we reported on when it arrived at Gigafactory Texas earlier this week; we also note one but two Cybertruck prototypes. They are undercover, but they are easy to spot because of the unusual shape of the electric pickup truck.
It would be the first time that two Cybertruck prototypes would be displayed at the same place, and at least one of them is expected to be the latest version of the truck. Tesla has delayed the Cybertruck to next year and removed any mention of specs, trims, and pricing from its website.
The automaker said that the production version would feature several upgrades versus the version originally unveiled in 2019. It would be interesting to see if Tesla releases more details at the event tomorrow.
There are several other vehicles that Tesla is trying to hide there:
A few of them appear to be Model Ys, which would make sense since Tesla is expected to unveil the new version of the electric SUV produced at Gifacatory Berlin, but others are harder to identify – the one under a gray cover is extremely small, and could be the new (or old) Roadster.
The one in the front left also has a unrecognizable shape, but I think it could be a Model Y body without all panels – possibly for a display of the latest giga casting technology and structural battery pack.  As for the vehicle under the colorful sea-themed cover, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the original Model X prototype based on the size and the lack of side mirrors.
What do you think about all these vehicles under covers? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/04/06,"Tesla says that it now doesn’t expect to be able to restart production at Gigafactory Shanghai until at least Friday, and even that could be difficult amid a citywide lockdown that is extending longer than planned.
Last week, we reported on Tesla having to shut down Gigafactory Shanghai due to a citywide lockdown in the city to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases amid a surge in infections.
Tesla was supposed to restart production last weekend, but it couldn’t make it work as it wasn’t able to secure enough workers and suppliers.
The automaker was expected to attempt again a restart of production on Monday, but it couldn’t make it work again.
On Wednesday, the second phase of the two-phase city lockdown was supposed to end, but the authorities have extended it indefinitely amid continued spread despite the measures in place.
This is creating a difficult situation for Tesla, and it informed employees and suppliers that it now doesn’t expect to restart production until at least Friday, April 8.
But even then it could prove difficult if the citywide lockdown is still ongoing at that point.
It will make it 12 days of Gigafactory Shanghai not being operational – the longest shutdown since it started operations in 2019.
The automaker produces more than 2,000 vehicles per day at the factory, which would mean that it will have missed out on at least 24,000 electric vehicles by the end of the week.
Despite the shutdown, Tesla achieved record deliveries last quarter and kept its streak of record deliveries alive at seven consecutive quarters, but it could be harder to keep it going in Q2 2022 with its most productive factory already shut down for a week.
I wonder if we are going to start hearing from Musk about this situation. When Tesla had to shut down Fremont Factory in California, the CEO became very vocal and defiant when it came to the restrictions forcing Tesla to halt operations.
He even personally insulted a local health authority manager working for Alameda County, where Tesla Fremont Factory is located.
Somehow, I doubt Musk is going to be as defiant against the Chinese government, but we will have to wait and see.

2022/04/06,"Norway is again breaking electric vehicle adoption records with 82% of new vehicles sold last quarter being battery-electric.
Tesla Model Y is leading the charge with a lot of deliveries last month.
Norway has been the leading market for electric vehicles in terms of adoption per capita.
As many markets are introducing plans to “ban” gas-powered cars by 2030, 2035, and even later, Norway is aiming for each new car on the road to be all-electric by 2025, and it’s on pace to achieve that early.
64.5% of all cars sold in Norway in 2021 were all-electric – up 10 points from the previous year.
Now the world’s leading EV market is off to a great start in 2022 and just announced that it broke a new record in the first quarter.
Norway’s Road Traffic Information Council (OFV) announced that 82.9% of all new cars registered in between January and March 2022 were all-electric:
“Most people want an electric car, and this year the trend is clearer than ever. In total, the number of first-time registered new passenger cars in the first quarter decreased by 10.9 per cent compared with 2021. Of 32,342 new passenger cars in the first quarter, 26,800 are electric cars. This is a record high share of 82.9 percent.”
That’s an important increase compared to Q1 2021 when 52% of new cars sales were all-electric:
As you can see, sales of internal combustion engine vehicles are crashing to just about 2,000 vehicles over the first quarter.
They are on pace to be near zero within the next three years.
In March alone, electric vehicle market shares went up to 86% led by Tesla with a 30% market share:
Some more recent newcomers are starting to climb the rankings like the BMW iX, but the availability of some of those models is still an issue that is limiting growth.
With just a few more electric models hitting the market and more availabilities of some of the most popular models as supply chain issues slow down, Norway is expected to beat its goal of going 100% electric by 2025.

2022/04/05,"We have seen many automakers benchmark and reverse-engineer Tesla vehicles, but rarely the other way around. Tesla was spotted testing a Lucid Air – which has over 500 miles of range – on its test track at Fremont factory.
Lucid and Tesla have a long, tumultuous history. 
The company was founded by Bernard Tse, a former Tesla Vice President and board member. At the time, it was called Atieva, and it was focused on building electric powertrains for other companies. It later became Lucid Motors and transitioned to building its own vehicles starting with a luxury sedan called the Lucid Air. In order to help achieve that, Lucid hired Peter Rawlinson, Tesla VP and Model S Chief Engineer, back in 2016.
Rawlinson later became CEO of the company and delivered the Lucid Air last year to great reviews. It became the first all-electric vehicle with over 500 miles of range.
But Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who often welcomes new EVs on the market, hasn’t been impressed by the company based on previous comments. He tried to diminish Rawlinson’s contribution to the Model S program ,and he said that a 500-mile range is not actually useful. 
Earlier this year, Musk said that Tesla could have made a 600-mile-range electric car a year ago, before Lucid, but it “would’ve made the product worse” in his opinion.
While talking poorly about Lucid, Musk seems to have taken the startup as competition when he lowered the price of the Model S back in 2020, after Lucid announced the base price of the Air.
Now almost two years later, Lucid is slowly ramping up deliveries of its electric sedan, and apparently, Tesla is getting curious. A drone flyover of Tesla’s Fremont factory yesterday spotted what appears to be a Lucid Air being driven on the automaker’s test track:
Tesla was seen doing a few laps and launches from a standstill with the electric sedan.
It’s not rare for automakers to benchmark new vehicles on the market. As we previously reported, Tesla vehicles are very popular amongst automakers ramping up their electrification efforts.
Just last week, GM was spotted benchmarking a Tesla Model S Plaid and a Model 3 at its facilities in Michigan. However, Tesla has rarely been seen playing with electric vehicles from other automakers.
There are a few technologies that could be of interest to Tesla in the Lucid Air. While it’s true that Tesla could have made a Model S with over 500 miles of range, Lucid did achieve an impressive efficiency in the Air, and the size of its electric drivetrain is especially impressive.

2022/04/04,"A new drone flyover of Tesla Gigafactory Texas shows a lot of activity, including a Tesla Semi, a lot more Model Y vehicles, and even some potential new colors. The new activity comes ahead of the Cyber Rodeo event.
On April 7th, Tesla is going to hold an event at Gigafactory Texas in Austin called ‘Cyber Rodeo‘. It is expected to be the factory’s grand opening, including the official launch of Model Y production at the plant.
We expect that Tesla might also bring a few surprises to the event, and a new drone flyover by Joe Tegtmeyer is starting to reveal some surprises. The drone pilot flew over the Gigafactory Texas today and spotted Tesla unloading a new Tesla Semi truck at the plant:
Tesla Semi arrives at Giga Texas … here are a few more photos as it arrived and gets set up! Can't wait to see this in person during Cyber Rodeo! See a lot more around the site today (4 April 2022) in my video out later today! @JoeTegtmeyer pic.twitter.com/J9s5lNoBet
Tesla is currently building the electric truck in low volume at a factory in Nevada, but it is expected to bring it to volume production at Gigafactory Texas in the future. However, this particular unit is most likely to be there in order to be displayed at the Cyber Rodeo event later this week.
Tegtmeyer also spotted many more Model Y vehicles at the plant as Tesla is ramping up production; he noted that one had a rear package shelf, but it might have just been retrofitted as a work vehicle:
Model Y from Giga Texas appears to have rear package shelf. Check out these photos and see for yourself! So much around the site today, 4 April 2022, so see more in my video out later today! @JoeTegtmeyer pic.twitter.com/FYTmRpsGGm
Interestingly, the colors on some of those new Model Ys coming out of Gigafactory Texas appear to be different. It might be the camera or the lighting, but the black paint looks less glossy, and the red is much darker:
As we previously reported, Tesla has talked about releasing new colors – including a new red – but it has been mostly linked to Tesla’s new paint shop at Gigafactory Berlin. It’s unclear if the automaker has deployed a similar paint shop that is going to enable new colors as well.
More information is expected to be released during the Cyber Rodeo event later this week, including more details about a possible new mid-range version of the Model Y that has been revealed through an EPA filing.
Speaking of Cyber Rodeo, if anyone has an extra ticket or plus one for the event, please hit me up at fred@electrek.co, Twitter: @fredericlambert, I’d love to go and it would be appreciated.

2022/04/04,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is up in pre-market trading on Monday after releasing new record delivery numbers this weekend, despite investors learning that Gigafactory Shanghai is unable to restart production today.
As we reported on Saturday, Tesla released its Q1 2022 delivery and production results and beat its all-time delivery record with 310,000 EVs despite a difficult quarter.
One of the main difficulties has been two shutdowns of Gigafactory Shanghai, including one at the end of the quarter that is still extending into Q2 2022.
The latest shutdown is due to citywide lockdowns in Shanghai to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases amid a surge in infections.
Tesla was supposed to restart production this weekend, but it couldn’t make it work as it wasn’t able to secure enough workers and suppliers.
The automaker was expected to attempt again a restart of production on Monday, but Reuters reports that it has been delayed again:
Tesla has notified workers and suppliers that production at its Shanghai factory will not resume on Monday as it had hoped, according to an internal notice shared with Reuters.
Tesla has now missed a full week of production at Gigafactory Shanghai, its most productive factory in the world.
The automaker produces more than 2,000 vehicles per day at the factory, which would mean that it missed out on at least 14,000 electric vehicles so far.
It wasn’t clear how investors would react today between the report of record deliveries in Q1 2022 versus Tesla’s biggest factory remaining inactive, but Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is up more than 1% in pre-market trading – showing that the former outweighs the latter in the eyes of investors.
With the second stage of the Shanghai lockdown lifting later this week, Tesla is expected to be able to reopen the factory, but it could take a while to ramp back up to full production.
It is likely to have a decent impact on Q2 2022 production numbers. One would think that the production ramps at Giga Berlin and Texas would compensate for the slow start of Shanghai in Q2, but I think the Giga Berlin still relies on Giga Shanghai and other Chinese suppliers.
This situation is likely going to have a bigger impact than investors might think.

2022/04/02,"Tesla released its Q1 2022 delivery and production results today and confirmed just over 310,000 deliveries, which is a new all-time delivery record despite a difficult quarter for several reasons.
Due to supply chain issues and 2 separate shutdowns at Gigafactory Shanghai, many believed that Tesla would finally break its impressive streak of quarterly delivery records.
We estimated that Tesla would easily beat its Q1 delivery record, but it would be extremely hard to beat its all-time delivery record of 308,000 vehicles achieved last quarter (Q4 2021).
However, the automaker surprised today by releasing its results and announcing deliveries of over 310,000 vehicles in Q1 2022:
“In the first quarter, we produced over 305,000 vehicles and delivered over 310,000 vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.”
Production is slightly down from last quarter’s all-time high of 305,840, but Tesla had enough inventory to manage to still beat its all-time delivery record.
Here’s Tesla’s breakdown of production and delivery results for Q1 2022:
The results are most impressive if we compare them to the same period last year (Q1 2021) when Tesla produced 180,338 vehicles and delivered 184,800 vehicles.
It represents a year-over-year increase in production of 69% while most other automakers saw a reduction in production capacity over the last year due to supply chain issues.
Tesla would have also done better if it didn’t have to shut down Gigafactory Shanghai on two occasions last month due to COVID-19 restrictions. We estimate that Tesla would have likely produced about 10,000 additional vehicles if it wasn’t the case.
These are impressive results for Tesla within the context of the current supply chain issues and factory shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions in China.
Unfortunately, those are expected to continue in Q2 2022.
Otherwise, Tesla would be well-positioned to grow significantly during the current quarter as it ramps up Gigafactory Berlin and Texas. 
Another problem is that the former also rely on supply from Gigafactory Shanghai and other suppliers in China, who could also suffer from the ongoing restrictions due to the surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.
It should be another interesting quarter for the biggest EV automaker.

2022/04/01,"In Tesla’s latest video, a drone tours the company’s latest Gigafactory in Berlin, Germany. High-speed drone videos are nothing new, but the video the skilled pilot captured (in tandem with equally adept video editing) is impressive and gives us a look at the robots and tools the company uses to produce its electric vehicles.
We’ve taken a look at skilled FPV piloting before over on DroneDJ, everything from homes and rings of fire to baseball stadiums. Many of those videos feature long shots with no cuts, but Tesla’s video takes a bit of a different style. 
Tesla’s video utilized speed ramps, cuts, and numerous other edits in post in addition to the skills of the drone pilot to show off the technology used to produce cars at Giga Berlin.
The company just began deliveries from the factory, and Elon Musk himself delivered the very first made-in-Germany Tesla Model Y.
The new factory, in addition to allowing the company to produce more vehicles in general, will reduce the amount of transportation necessary for Tesla vehicles to reach customers in Europe. European customers can now get Teslas made in Europe rather than relying on imported vehicles.
Tesla’s latest video opens with a view outside the factory, showing off many of the Model Y vehicles the factory has already produced. From there, the drone enters the factory and begins to show off different parts of Tesla’s assembly line.
KUKA and Schuler robotic arms work in tandem with presses to shape and cut flat pieces of metal into Model Y body panels, and we later get a look at one of the Giga-presses in action.
The video continues, following the production line to the completed Model Y vehicles.
The video was shot by Ferdinand Wolf, a commercial drone pilot at Skynamic. He used cinewhoop style and five-inch drones specifically designed to get smooth video in a small, fast, and nimble package. Take a look at the video for yourself:

2022/04/01,"Tesla has opened its “longest Supercharger station in the world” through a growing partnership with a French supermarket company.
There are larger, bigger Supercharger stations in the world, but apparently, there are none longer.
Tesla is currently growing its Supercharger network at an impressive rate.
The automaker went from 23,277 Superchargers at 2,564 stations at the end of 2020 to 31,498 Superchargers at 3,476 stations at the end of 2021. That’s growing at a 35% year-over-year pace.
However, it is lagging behind vehicle deliveries, which grew 87% during the same period of time – on top of now gradually starting to allow non-Tesla EV owners to use the network.
It also lags behind Tesla’s own goal to triple the Supercharger network in two years.
But the automaker is nonetheless deploying new and larger stations at an impressive rate.
Most stations are similar in characteristics, but we try to track some of the most interesting ones and a new one opening in France this week is notable for being the “longest Tesla Supercharger in the world”.
Tesla launched a partnership with E.Leclerc, a supermarket in France, to open Supercharger stations at their location.
Over the last month, it launched a 16-stall V3 Supercharger at the E.Leclerc Montauban location and a  eight-stall V3 Supercharger at the E.Leclerc Saint-Gaudens location.
This week, Tesla opened a new V3 Supercharger at E.Leclerc Beaune and it’s a 28-stall station, which is a big station, but nowhere near enough stalls to make it one of the biggest in the world.
However, it is configured in a way that makes it the longest Supercharger in the world, according to Quentin Vannier, Tesla’s regional manager for charging infrastructure in France (via LinkedIn).
With all 28 stalls side-by-side, it does look to be particularly long in pictures:
The station is also one of a few in France that is open to not just Tesla owners but all EV owners as part of Tesla’s pilot program to open access to the Supercharger network.
We expect that Tesla is going to continue accelerating its Supercharger station deployment in the coming months, especially with its new pre-fab method that can deploy a new station in days.

2022/04/01,"Tesla Insurance has enabled its controversial driver safety score, which tracks driving data in real time, in California, its biggest market, but it is only for “educational purposes” and won’t affect premiums… for now.
Tesla had already introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data and Tesla’s safety score, which had been its original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, the company wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes comparing the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month-to-month, depending on your score:
In December, the company expanded the insurance product to Illinois.
Earlier this year, Tesla Insurance expanded to Arizona and Ohio – making it now available in five states – not including California – which still doesn’t have the full product with real-time driving data.
However, today, Tesla enabled its driver safety score system to Tesla Insurance customers in California, but it says that it won’t affect premiums in the announcement:
Safety Score (Beta) is now available for California Tesla Insurance customers. For educational purposes and will not have an impact on your insurance availability or premium. You can opt-out at anytime.
Tesla previously voiced frustration about having issues getting California insurance regulators to approve its use of real-time driving data on its insurance product.
It’s not clear what its goal is with enabling it without affecting premiums, but it could encourage those who opt-in to drive safer and the fact that it’s not actually affecting the insurance product enables Tesla to use its technology without approval from insurance regulators.

2022/03/31,"A recent 2022 report by Zutobi has ranked the top 20 most affordable EVs to operate around the world based on a number of factors. This includes considerations such as battery size, cost to charge, and miles driven per given dollar amounts. Tesla takes the top spot this year, but there are plenty of other viable options currently available to consumers.
As the EV market continues to make its voice heard in the overall global market, more and more consumers are being exposed to the imminent paradigm shift and are starting to ask genuine questions about the possibility of actually owning an EV. Welcome to the green side my friends, we’re glad you’re here.
In the past, we’ve outlined some of the most expensive EVs on the market, as well as some of the most affordable (a 2022 revamp is long overdue, bear with us). That being said, those numbers are based on MSRPs. Still vitally important to you consumers as it’s a huge purchase, but what about afterward? Not all EVs are created equal.
Terms like kWh (kilowatt-hours) and TCO (total cost of ownership) take over after the initial EV purchase, as you learn when and where to charge your EV for the best price, how much range you need on an average basis, and how much range your battery will actually get you based off your EVs battery capacity (remember kWh?) and driving habits. 
As part of its 2022 EV Miles report, Zutobi has compiled the top 20 most affordable EVs based off a bunch of these factors rather than MSRP. Lucky for our EU readers, some of the EVs on this list are exclusive to your territory, so everyone can play!
Below are the results based on criteria gathered by Zutobi below. Just for fun, we also included the starting MSRP’s of the 20 EVs listed, so you have an additional lens to analyze and compare. Let’s dig in!
To gather its data, Zutobi took its 2021 EV Miles report and updated it with the most recent data. The pricing data was taken from the US Energy Information Administration and the data for the real range and usable battery capacity was taken from Electric Vehicle Database.
While the top 20 will definitely give you a detailed look at how some of the most affordable EVs in 2022 compare side by side, we think the data could have been a bit more specific on which exact models were chosen in the study. 
Nonetheless, you will certainly be able to gather which EVs offer the largest battery capacity (generally equating to better range) plus the lowest cost to charge. Lastly, there is a clear column outlining how far each EV will get you on $100 miles of that precious EV juice (that’s electricity for you newbs out there). 
Alright, we’ve shared a little background on the study and cited the sources, so let’s break down the results. It should come as no surprise that the Tesla Model 3 takes the crown is this study – it is the bestselling EV of all time for a reason. That being said, there are other reasons that might divert you away from a brand new Model 3, despite its low operational cost (scroll down a bit).
As if that weren’t impressive enough, the Long Range and RWD versions of the Model 3 take gold and silver respectively, and the Performance trim makes a cameo in slot #16. Rounding out the top three is the Hyundai IONIQ Electric which sadly saw its last model year in 2021. However, the new IONIQ 5 carries on the marque in its honor, and that’s one hell of an EV if you ask us. 
The Nissan LEAF placed in the top ten at #7, but Zutobi didn’t specify which model it was. The LEAFs have been using 36 kWh battery packs consistently for years now, so it’s not a huge deal, but still. For the MSRP pricing below, we went with the most affordable 2022 model of the veteran EV.
Just for comparison, we thought you’d might want to see how each of these EV’s stack up in terms of starting price. Above, we learned what EVs are the most affordable to operate, but let’s also see which are most affordable based off their 2022 MSRPs. 
From here, we hope you can compare both lists and see which option might be the best for you based off upfront cost, as well as additional operational costs.
Note: MSRP’s do not include any taxes or destination fees, nor do they include any federal or state tax credits. Some of the EVs are only available in the EU market, and the prices have been rounded to the closest hundred in USD. 
The original study was also vague on some specific models, so we used the 2022 pricing wherever possible. MSRPs for older models were gathered from EV-Database. 
As you can see, the Tesla Model 3 may save you a lot of money in the long run as you charge and drive it, but you’ll be paying a much higher upfront cost compared to most of the other EVs on this list. That could vary by country, however, so be sure to check how your homeland stacks up. 
That isn’t to say it isn’t worth it, that’s entirely up to you. Hopefully both tables above can help you in your EV purchase, or at the very least get you thinking about the specific factors that go into an EV purchase, whether its the initial buy or the charging costs afterward.

2022/03/31,"Kyte, an on-demand rental company, announced that it is acquiring a fleet of Tesla Model 3 vehicles to offer a new monthly subscription service across the US starting at $995.
The concept of “subscribing” to a car instead of outright buying it or leasing it has gained traction in recent years. Several automakers and third-party companies have started such services, which have the main advantage of being simpler and requiring less commitment than leases – Tesla vehicles are starting to become a popular option for those services.
Earlier this year, Autonomy, a new startup, announced that it purchased a fleet of 100 Model 3 vehicles to offer a subscription service, and it aims to grow the fleet to 10,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of the year.
Now Kyte, better known as an on-demand car rental service, announced that it is jumping into the car subscription business also with a fleet of Tesla Model 3 vehicles:
This rollout of Kyte’s latest offering is the next milestone in a series of impressive successes by the California-based company and will eventually be available in all of Kyte’s current 14 markets. As part of this new subscription service, Tesla Model 3s will be available and will include maintenance, insurance, registration, and roadside assistance. For those looking for the experience of a Tesla, without the hassles of ownership and the long term commitment, Kyte’s offering will allow customers to reap all the benefits while avoiding the challenges – no maintenance and no lock-in. What’s more, for those that come to love the performance of their Tesla, Kyte provides the option to extend subscriptions flexibly at any time.
The company didn’t reveal how many Tesla vehicles it secured for the service, but it recently secured $200 million asset-backed credit financing to expand its offering.
The service is all-inclusive with registration, insurance, and more:
They are using the Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD, and the website specifically mentions the Pearl White color, which is the base color.
It starts at $995 per month with a 12-month commitment, but you can subscribe to the car for just three months:
In comparison, Autonomy starts at $490 per month, but it requires a steep $4,900 “start fee.” The company revised those prices down just earlier this week, as Kyte announced its own service.
Erik Zahnlecker, Director of Product at Kyte, commented on the announcement:
Being able to expand our fleet and amplify EV adoption is mission-critical. We don’t want to only be innovators in how we give people access to cars, but we want to be a catalyst for the rapid change going on in the transportation industry as a whole. This rollout is pivotal to our growth strategy and core to our electrified, autonomous, and shared vision.
The company is going to start deliveries of the Model 3 vehicles on April 15.

2022/03/31,"Tesla is extending its production shutdown at Gigafactory Shanghai, its most productive factory, as it is having issues securing its workforce amid lockdowns throughout the city to limit the spread of COVID-19.
As we reported earlier this week, Tesla had to halt production at Gigafactory Shanghai as the city is shutting down due to a surge in COVID-19 cases.
The automaker had planned to restart production on Friday, but those plans have now been delayed.
Reuters says it obtained an internal memo confirming that the production restart is delayed:
“Tesla has cancelled plans to resume production at its Shanghai factory on Friday and Saturday, an internal notice seen by Reuters showed, further delaying reopening of the manufacturing hub for its Model 3 and Model Y cars.”
The lockdown on the side of the city where the factory is located is lifting tomorrow morning, but a lockdown on the other side is starting at the same time.
Tesla thought that it could restart production at that point, but now it believes that it won’t have enough workers to successfully relaunch production as some of them will be affected by the second stage of the lockdown.
Based on the estimated production rate at Gigafactory Shanghai, Tesla could be missing out on about 2,000 vehicles per day that the factory is shut down. 
It comes during the last days of the quarter, and Tesla is expected to release its Q1 2022 delivery and production numbers during the weekend.
Last quarter, Tesla announced record production and deliveries of over 305,000 vehicles.
The first quarter of the year is traditionally slower, especially since Gigafactory Shanghai has become Tesla’s most productive factory and the Chinese New Year break starts during the quarter.
But this quarter could be particularly lower due to not one but two factory shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions.
We should have a better idea of the impact in the next few days as Tesla releases its Q1 2022 results.

2022/03/31,"Tesla has paused solar roof installations due to issues with getting its solar roof tiles. Now some clients will be left without a roof for months.
Supply chain issues are affecting virtually every industry in the world at this point.
When it comes to its auto business, Tesla was not without supply chain challenges, but it has fared a lot better than its peers and managed to double its production last year.
Its solar business also grew over the last year, but it also started to be affected by supply chain issues late last year when we reported on early signs that supply chain issues are affecting Tesla’s solar panel business.
In December, we released a report on how Tesla was starting to delay some solar rooftop projects. At the time, Tesla’s solar roof installations weren’t affected by the same issues, but things changed in February when Tesla started to have concerns about solar tile supply.
At the time, Tesla informed customers who were about to get installations about potential delays.
Now a month later, the situation has worsened and Tesla has virtually paused solar roof installations.
Electrek obtained an internal communication from Tesla’s solar scheduling team saying to focus on solar panel rooftop retrofits as solar tile supply is low. In the communication, the team committed to not schedule new installations.
The supply issue is leaving some customers in precarious situations.
For example, Ryan Prijic, a Tesla solar roof customer in the Los Angeles area, had Tesla start his solar roof installation in January by removing his existing roof and build the “dry-in” – a waterproof state of the roof with protective film that goes over the plywood before installing the actual roofing material, which in this case are solar tiles.
Here’s what it looks like:
At the time, Prijic was told that the solar tile installation would happen within the next eight weeks and that the dry-in’s waterproof capacity would last for about six months so it wouldn’t be a problem.
Now in March, more than eight weeks after the removal of the roof, there’s still no solar tile installation in sight, and Prijic is understandably starting to worry.
When contacting his Tesla Roof advisor, which wasn’t an easy task, he was told of the solar tile shortage and warned that his installation might not happen before the end of the year – way past the waterproof period of the dry-in.
In fact, the roof has already leaked on two occasions, and Tesla had to come and fix it. One of the crew members who came to fix the leak told the owner that a big shipment of solar tiles was stuck at the LA port, but this couldn’t be confirmed.
If an ongoing installation like this one is being paused in the middle of it for months, we can imagine that there will be significant delays for other planned solar roof installations.
Prijic is not alone in his situation. Many buyers with planned installations are reporting that their timeline has been pushed and there’s little communication from Tesla.
Tesla is producing solar tiles at its New York Gigafactory, and it had a goal to produce enough tiles for 1,000 solar roof installations per week, but it looks like it is nowhere near that goal as getting hands on solar cells is difficult throughout the whole industry.

2022/03/30,"Tesla is “within weeks or months” to open its Supercharger network to all electric vehicle owners in the United Kingdom instead of just Tesla owners, according to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers.
In November 2021, we saw Tesla take the first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
In January, the automaker announced that the program is expanding to more stations in Norway and France.
Last month, Tesla expands access to the Supercharger network to all electric cars at all stations in the Netherlands – not just a few ones.
Things have stayed stagnant over the last month as Tesla is gathering more data on how adding more users to the network is affecting it, but more markets are expected to be added soon.
Now Trudy Harrison, UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, says that Tesla is going to open its Supercharger network in the UK soon.
She said in an interview with Electrifying.com:
Speaking to Founder and CEO of Electrifying.com Ginny Buckley earlier this week, Transport Minister Trudy Harrison confirmed the move, stating: “Tesla recognise that they are part of the solution here” and that the move could come “within weeks and months rather than years”.
The government official didn’t say how she know about the timing, but it’s possible that Tesla has contacted the government about the expansion of the program.
The same thing happened with the Ministry of Transport in Norway before Tesla opened Supercharger stations to other EV owners in the country.
The UK has seen a surge in electric vehicle sales over the last year with Tesla leading the pack.
Tesla said that it plans to use revenue from other EV owners using the network to expand it with more stations.

2022/03/30,"A new report says that Tesla is avoiding the current nickel crisis through “secret deals” with suppliers, including Vale.
The price of nickel has more than doubled over the last 12 months.
Nickel is a critical resource when it comes to transitioning the world to electric transport and clean energy.
High-energy-density batteries, which are required for long-range electric vehicles, all use a significant amount of nickel in the cathode of the battery cell.
By volume and cost, it accounts for a significant part of an electric vehicle’s battery pack, which in turn is the most costly part of an EV.
Of course, nickel is also used for plenty of applications other than batteries for electric vehicles.
Actually, only about 5% of the world’s nickel supply is currently used for batteries going into electric vehicles, but that number is going up fast.
Even with conservative estimates of electric vehicle adoption, it is expected that EV nickel demand would jump from 5% to 59% of the overall nickel supply within this decade.
That means a giant squeeze in the nickel supply is going to happen if there’s not a major ramp-up of production soon.
In 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk urged nickel miners to increase production as he saw the problem coming, but things have escalated quicker than he could have imagined because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent restrictions on trades with Russia, which is the world’s third-largest producer of nickel.
The conflict sent the price of nickel up to over $40,000 a ton before settling down to $33,000:
Now Bloomberg reports that Tesla was able to avoid some of the madness through “secret deals” including one with Vale:
That includes a multiyear supply deal with mining giant Vale SA. The agreement, which hasn’t been announced, covers nickel from Canada, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing private details.
The report didn’t state any specifics about the deal, and it’s not clear what is “secret” around it. Vale was already known to be Tesla’s main nickel supplier.
The company also has recently done a big deal to secure nickel supply from New Caledonia from a mine previously operated by Vale.
Tesla has been looking to secure more nickel from North American sources through deals with upcoming mines, like Talon Metals, which is looking to build a nickel mine in Minnesota.

2022/03/30,"The state of Queensland and publicly owned generator CS Energy announced a giant new 100 MW/200 MWh energy storage project, and it selected Tesla’s Megapack to power it.
Australia has proven to be a very important market for Tesla’s energy storage business.
Its flagship Tesla Big Battery project in South Australia became the first of its kind and provided important services to help stabilize the local grid, which has been known for brownouts.
The project influenced dozens of other large utility-scale energy storage projects using Li-ion batteries.
Tesla won many of those projects, especially since the launch of the Megapack, which is geared toward larger-scale energy storage projects.
Now the company is adding another to the list as Queensland announced that it will build a new 100 MW/200MWh energy storage system in Chinchilla, a town a few hours outside of Brisbane, and it selected Tesla Megapack for the project:
The Western Downs role as a pivotal part of Queensland’s renewable energy revolution has taken another important step forward. Publicly-owned generator CS Energy will install a grid-scale battery near Chinchilla to deliver cleaner, cheaper and reliable energy to Queenslanders. The 100-megawatt/200 megawatt hour battery will be made up of Tesla Megapacks and form part of CS Energy’s energy hub at Kogan Creek. Treasurer and Minister for Trade and Investment Cameron Dick said the $150 million project was expected to create up to 80 jobs during construction and up to 10 jobs when operational.
The new battery system is expected to enable the state to better use its renewable energy and stabilize the grid.
Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenn commented on the announcement:
This battery represents further diversification of energy and modernisation of Queensland publicly owned power companies.  Queenslanders want clean energy, but they also want reliable energy, so the inclusion of batteries into the CS Energy portfolio will support further expansion of their variable (renewable) energy assets alongside existing traditional generation. The Palaszczuk Government is moving quickly to invest in storage solutions that enable the continued uptake of renewables, especially rooftop solar, so more Queenslanders can enjoy the savings.
The Megapacks are expected to be installed and operational by the end of next year.
This new project follows Tesla securing 300 MWh of Megapack orders for three other energy storage projects in the neighboring state of New South Wales just last week.

2022/03/29,"GM has been spotted benchmarking a Tesla Model S Plaid and Model 3. The latter appeared to be in order to test Tesla’s Summon feature.
Tesla has had a lead in electric vehicles for a long time, which made its vehicles popular for other automakers to benchmark as they develop their own EV programs. Benchmarking involves acquiring a Tesla vehicle and either dismantling it to inspect and learn from its sub-system or testing it on the road to benchmark the performance.
Porsche was often spotted benchmarking Tesla’s vehicles. Mercedes-Benz famously benchmarked and dismantled a Tesla Model X in the weirdest way ahead of launching its own electric SUV.
Tesla vehicles have also made their way to Michigan to be tested by “the big 3,” or what used to be known as “the big 3.” In 2016, Ford paid a $55,000 premium to buy one of the first Tesla Model Xs and benchmark it. GM hasn’t been spotted benchmarking Tesla vehicles as much, but it has certainly been involved in similar tactics.
Back in 2019, Steve Carlisle, who at the time was the head of the Cadillac brand and now is in charge of the North American market for GM, said that the company was ‘obsessively’ benchmarking Tesla.
Now in the space of just a few days, GM has been spotted benchmarking both the Tesla Model S Plaid and the Model 3 – via GM Authority. Both Tesla vehicles were spotted near GM testing facilities in Michigan.
In the case of the Model 3, GM Authority reports that it was spotted testing the Smart Summon feature:
These photos were captured near a GM testing facility. The Tesla Model 3 sedan is finished in white and includes a GM vehicle inventory barcode on the rear bumper, as well as Michigan manufacturer license plates. Critically, the Tesla sedan did not have a driver onboard when these photos were taken. In fact, the sedan was driving by itself to another person nearby.
GM has its SuperCruise suite of advanced driver-assist features, and it might be looking to add to it with some features similar to what you can find in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving package, like Smart Summon.
GM is going to rapidly expand its EV lineup in the coming years, starting with the Cadillac Lyriq in the coming months.

2022/03/29,"A court in Germany has ordered Tesla to buy back a Model 3 vehicle from a customer who filed a complaint over how disappointed he was with the Full Self-Driving package – which includes Autopilot features – that he felt it was driving like “a drunk first-time driver”.
Tesla is starting to see increasing pushback against its Full Self-Driving package.
Since 2016, the automaker has been claiming that all of its vehicles are sold with the hardware needed to enable full self-driving with future software updates that you can get, if you buy the now $12,000 Full Self-Driving package. 
Six years later, that has yet to happen.
Tesla tried to sweeten the deal by adding some other features to the Full Self-Driving package that are also associated with Autopilot, like Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, Autopark, and Summon. In Europe, things are more complicated since some of these features are nerfed due to local regulations.
Now, some Tesla owners are going to court to get reimbursed for the package after it didn’t live up to expectations. The automaker just lost a case in Darmstadt Regional Court, which ordered Tesla to buy back the plaintiff’s Model 3.
Spiegel reports on the case:
As a result, assistance functions such as automatically overtaking slower vehicles on the freeway did not work. The steering behavior at entrances and exits or motorway junctions is spongy and resembles that of a “drunk novice driver.” Traffic lights and stop signs are not recognized.
Tesla said that there’s no defect with the car and insists that the features would be delivered in the future through software updates, but it can’t say when:
With regard to the process, the US group states that it is not aware of any software or hardware malfunctions on the vehicle that could not have been remedied by a repair. According to Tesla, the necessary upgrade to the latest hardware would have been free of charge. Systems and features worked as intended and in accordance with the current regulations for autonomous driving in Germany.
The automaker has appealed the court’s verdict.
CEO Elon Musk recently said that he believes Tesla’s FSD Beta is going to launch in Europe later this year, but it depends on regulatory approval.

2022/03/29,"London announced that it is providing funding to deploy a fleet of Tesla Model 3 vehicles through a vehicle subscription service to be available for private hire drivers such as Uber.
Startup Breathe operates in the rapidly growing space of “vehicle-as-a-service” by providing an all-in-one car subscription that includes the car, insurance, service, maintenance, and repair.
In practice, they finance the purchase of Tesla Model 3 vehicles for Uber drivers to operate them for a weekly cost without having to worry about any additional cost to do their job other than their Breathe payments.
They offer different subscriptions, including one that leads to ownership, starting at £324.00 ($425 USD) per week:
Today, the company announced that it received funding from the Mayor of London’s Energy Efficiency Fund (MEEF) to offer a fleet of 100 Tesla Model 3 vehicles to drivers in London:
The Mayor of London’s Energy Efficiency Fund (MEEF) is providing capital to Vehicle-as-a-Service provider Breathe, supported by fintech Zeti’s pay per mile platform ZERO, for the deployment of Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles to private hire drivers, including Uber, in London.
London is suffering from poor air quality and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been pushing hard to decarbonize transport in the city.
Uber has actually been an important partner in the effort. 
Back in 2017, the ride-hailing company launched a scheme to incentivize drivers to switch to electric vehicles in London with a goal to have 40,000 Uber drivers drive electric in the city.
Uber introduced a “clean air fee” that adds three pence (four cents) to every mile of a passenger trip in the London area. They use that money for EV incentives.
Deployment has been a bit slow with about 4,000 Uber drivers going electric as of the end of last year.
But things are now accelerating with the ride-hailing giant adding Tesla vehicles to the scheme in November, which should help since Tesla vehicles are by far the most popular EVs in the UK.
Now Uber drivers have also the option to opt for these Model 3s under Breathe subscription service.
Jeff Davis, director of Breathe, commented on the announcement:
At Breathe our mission is to provide large scale Electric-Vehicles-as-a-Service offerings and we are excited to be starting with sustainable, flexible and affordable vehicle subscription options for London’s private hire market. We are seeing huge demand for electric private hire vehicles and MEEF’s funding allows us to expand our operations and help more drivers step into their first EV.
Pete Radford, director of MEEF, added: 
We are delighted that MEEF is supporting Breathe EV to offer a fully managed VaaS product to London’s private hire drivers, and in doing so, helping to accelerate the shift from conventional to electric vehicles in the Capital.
This new fleet of 100 Tesla vehicles to be deployed by Breathe in London is expected to save 338 tonnes of CO2 being released into the atmosphere per year and will also achieve an annual average reduction in CO2 emissions equivalent to £5,137 in cost per tonne of CO2.

2022/03/28,"JB Straubel, Tesla’s longtime Chief Technology Officer, has given some insight into how long he believes electric vehicle batteries should last — about 15 years. This is critical for Straubel’s new business.
One of the most popular questions when it comes to electric vehicles is, “How long does the battery last?” And, I am not talking about the range here. How long, how many miles or years, will a battery pack last in an electric vehicle before you need to replace it?
The truth is that we don’t have a lot of data to answer this question simply because this latest wave of electric vehicles is still quite recent, and the last generation of EVs are still on the road.
Aside from packs that had defects, most battery packs that have been replaced were in EVs that had an excessive amount of mileage. For example, I had a Model X with over 400,000 miles, and it had a battery replacement at about 325,000 miles. But, for most EV owners who use their cars normally, we have to estimate the longevity of battery packs based on battery degradation, which is fairly minimal for the most part.
Now, in a new interview, Tesla co-founder and former CTO JB Straubel says that he believes EV batteries should last 15 years, depending on utilization: 
It’s a subjective thing depending on what people’s goal is for the car, but I think it’s going to easily be 15 years in most cases. I think battery life will probably track the life of the vehicle life. Personally, I think it’s less likely that people will place a new battery in an old car.
Straubel should have good insight into this he was responsible for Tesla’s battery development until 2019 and has been part of the largest deployment of battery capacity ever through Tesla’s vehicle fleet.
The engineer is tracking the end-of-life of EV batteries closely since it is critical to his new company, Redwood Materials.
Redwood is developing new processes to recycle materials with a focus on electric car batteries. The company also recently announced that it is also getting into cathode and anode production with a 100 GWh battery material factory in the United States.
Redwood, Straubel says at 13:00 in, is currently recycling 8-10GWh year which is “Enough for hundreds of thousands of cars”. And, the materials keep getting purer the more times they are recycled. 
The longer an EV battery pack lasts, the better. And, even old batteries may have a second life as stationary storage.  But, one of the main advantages of EVs over gas-powered cars is that once depleted, the battery pack is still extremely valuable due to the base metals in it. 
Straubel’s new company is already working with Ford and Volvo to recycle packs at their end-of-life, but it’s only the beginning. Right now, only a few tens to hundreds of thousands of electric cars are coming to their end-of-life every year, but that number will go up into the millions within 15 years if we are to believe Straubel’s timeline.
Here’s the full interview:

2022/03/28,"According to new local flings, Tesla is planning a big Megapack project at Gigafactory Texas in order to complement its planned giant solar system and to try and mitigate problems that come with the state’s unreliable electric grid.
Tesla is preparing to launch Gigafactory Texas with its Cyber Rodeo event next week.
While production is just starting, the plant is still growing and more features are being added to it. Drone flyovers in recent weeks have revealed that Tesla has started building a large solar array on the rooftop of the factory; the solar panels are expected to spell out ‘Tesla’ from the sky.
Now, we learn that Tesla is looking to add energy storage to its renewable energy solution at Gigafactory Texas. According to a new filing with the city of Austin, Tesla is applying for a new project at Giga Texas called: “GIGA TEXAS LCRA PERMANENT SWITCHYARD & BESS”:
BESS stands for ‘Battery Energy Storage System’. 
The application doesn’t reference any type of planned capacity, but it does cover a very large building area of 53 acres, which would be enough for a significant number of Megapacks. The Megapack project would enable Tesla to get to better use its upcoming rooftop solar panel system and provide some protection against Texas’ notoriously unreliable grid – the last few winters have been rough on the Texas grid, and the state experienced several blackouts and brownouts.
Those issues have led many homeowners to turn to products like Tesla Powerwalls, and it only makes sense for Tesla to do the same for Gigafactory Texas, but on a larger scale.
Earlier this year, Tesla unveiled a giant Megapack project in Texas for an electric utility. This new project at Gigafactory Texas could potentially be larger, but we won’t know until Tesla releases all the details.
There’s no completion timeline for the solar rooftop or battery project.
As we previously reported, Tesla has been approved to be an energy distributor in the state of Texas. The move is part of CEO Elon Musk’s vision for Tesla Energy to become a distributed global utility, an endeavor that could even outgrow the company’s automotive business.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/03/28,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla’s head of AI, Andrej Karpathy, is on a four-month sabbatical, and people are worried since other Tesla execs have left after going on sabbatical.
It comes as Tesla expands its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta to Canada.
While Tesla has built a strong AI team, Karpathy is still seen as critical part of the automaker’s effort to achieve full self-driving.
That’s why many were worried to have not heard from him, and now CEO Elon Musk revealed on Twitter that the AI expert is on a four-month sabbatical.
After Musk made the announcement on Twitter, Karpathy took to the social media himself to comment on his sabbatical:
Taking some time off to rest and travel after almost 5 years at Tesla. Especially excited to get focused time to re-sharpen my technical edge and train some neural nets! Though I already miss all the robots and GPU/Dojo clusters and looking forward to having them at my fingertips again.
This is nonetheless making some Tesla fans and investors worried because that’s how it started for other Tesla executives in the past.
For example, Doug Field, Tesla’s former senior VP of engineering, took a leave of absense to “recharge and spend time with his family” back in 2018. At the time, Tesla reassured everyone that Field hadn’t left the company.
A few months later, it was revealed the Field wouldn’t be returning from his leave of absence.
It was revealed that after almost five years at Tesla, Field return to Apple. More recently, he joined Ford.
While there’s always a risk of a similar situation with Karpathy, who leads Tesla’s main AI programs, I think things are looking better for him at Tesla.
I think the fact that Musk announced it and Karpathy himself decided to elaborate on Twitter is a good sign.
However, the timing is not great as Musk is talking about Tesla aiming for FSD to become safer than human drivers by the end of the year. It is a giant task to do and likely harder without your head of AI.
But health comes first, and if Karpathy needed it, I am glad he had an opportunity to take some time off.

2022/03/28,"Tesla (TSLA) announced today that it is planning a new stock split, and it is going to put it to a shareholder vote later this year.
Back in 2020, Tesla announced a five for one stock split.
At the time, Tesla’s stock was trading at around $1,300 a share, but the stock split announcement sent its stock price surging to a record high of $2,000 a share.
The split resulted in the price per share being reset at around $460 billion or $430 billion market capitalization.
There have been ups and downs since, but Tesla’s stock is now up 63% over the last 12 months, and it is now trading at over $1,000 a share again and at over $1 trillion in market cap.
Today, the automaker announced another stock split – pending shareholder approval.
Tesla wrote in a new SEC filing today:
On March 28, 2022, Tesla, Inc. (the “Company” or “Tesla”) announced its plan to request stockholder approval at the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock through an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Tesla’s Board of Directors (“Board”) has approved the management proposal, but the stock dividend will be contingent on final Board approval.
The filing didn’t include details about the proposed split, but more should be released with materials for the shareholder’s meeting, which is generally held in June.  
Tesla also tweeted about the planned stock split:
Tesla will ask shareholders to vote at this year’s annual meeting to authorize additional shares in order to enable a stock split.
The announcement today sent Tesla’s stock price up 5% in pre-market trading – or about $1,060 a share.
Traditionally, companies have announced stock splits to make their price per share more reasonable after their stock price has risen considerably. It makes the stock more accessible to smaller individual investors.
However, the practice has become less useful in recent years as most individual investors have moved to apps like Robinhood (US) and WealthSimple (Canada), which allow the purchase of fractional shares on big stocks like Tesla’s.

2022/03/28,"Tesla is reportedly halting production for four days at Gigafactory Shanghai as the city is going into a lockdown due to a surge in COVID-19 cases.
It’s the second time that Tesla’s production at its biggest factory is shutting down this quarter.
China is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, and Shanghai appears to be at its center as most new cases nationwide came from the city.
On Sunday, the city of 26 million people reported 3,500 new cases, which they detect through mass testing as 3,450 of those cases are listed as asymptomatic. 
In order to try to limit the spread, the Shanghai government announced a two-stage lockdown of the city today. Firms and factories are expected to shut down throughout the city.
Tesla operates the largest electric vehicle factory in the world in Shanghai, and it is also expected to be affected.
Reuters reports that Tesla is shutting Gigafactory Shanghai down for four days:
US automaker Tesla is suspending production at its Shanghai factory for four days after the financial hub said on Sunday it would lock down in two stages to carry out mass testing for COVID 19, two people familiar with the matter said.
According to the report, Tesla tried to create a “closed-loop” with employees that were there on Sunday, but they had to let them go back home after realizing that they “did not have enough provisions for them.”
Gigafactory Shanghai is located in the part of the city that is affected by the first stage of the lockdown, which starts now and lasts until Friday.
Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai was already affected by a brief shutdown earlier this month due to COVID-19 restrictions.
It’s hard to determine how exactly it will affect Tesla’s performance.
At the end of the quarter, the factory produces cars for local deliveries, and just a few days of the plant being shut down could result in thousands of deliveries being delayed.

2022/03/26,"Tesla has started to send out invites to an event called ‘Cyber Rodeo,’ which is going to be the grand opening of Gigafactory Texas in Austin – a big moment for the company and its manufacturing expansion in the US.
Just a few days after launching GIgafactory Berlin with the first deliveries of European-made Tesla vehicles, the automaker is now inviting people to the opening of another factory: Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla has been simultaneously building two extremely large-scale factories to produce electric vehicles and batteries.
Due to some regulatory delays with Gigafactory Berlin, Gigafactory Texas is launching production around the same time.
As it is tradition for the automaker, Tesla is throwing a party to celebrate the start of production.
CEO Elon Musk unveiled the invite for the event to be held on April 7 and the company is calling it ‘Cyber Rodeo’:
pic.twitter.com/SXKc1jJwmw
‘Cyber’ might just be about the aesthetic of the party – something Musk said he is a fan of before.
But people are already speculating about the latest version of the Cybertruck making an appearance.
Last year, Tesla removed Cybertruck specs and pricing from its website and the automaker is expected to update the electric pickup truck with the production version.
Either way, the focus is likely to be the new Model Y produced at Gigafactory Texas, which unlike the new Model Y produced at Giga Berlin, features Tesla’s new structural battery pack design and 4680 battery cell.
The new version is expected to feature different specs and it has been linked to a new mid-range AWD Model Y listed on the EPA website earlier this month.
Along with the start of Model Y deliveries, Tesla is expected to give an update on battery cell production at the new factory, which is going to be critical to enable the production ramp-up.
What else do you expect from Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo at Gigafactory Texas? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/03/25,"Tesla has had to issue another “recall” that is actually just another over-the-air software update on a small number of cars in the US.
Lately, Tesla has had to issue a lot of recalls, but most of them were minor issues that were fixed by simple over-the-air software updates.
For example, the automaker issued a recall that was reported as a “massive” recall on over 800,000 vehicles due to “a seat belt issue”, which sounds pretty bad, but in fact, it had to do with a reminder alert to buckle the seat belt that sometimes wouldn’t appear under very specific conditions.
This week, Tesla has issued another of what we are now calling an “over-the-air recall” over a delay to show the rearview image on some vehicles. According to a filing with NHTSA:
Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2018-2019 Model S, Model X, and 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles equipped with Autopilot Computer 2.5 and operating certain firmware releases. The rearview image may not immediately display when the vehicle begins to reverse. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 111, “Rear Visibility.”
As mentioned above, it only affects some Tesla vehicles with the Autopilot 2.5 computer. Tesla believes that only 947 vehicles are affected.
The “remedy” is mentioned in the filing:
Tesla will perform an over-the-air (OTA) software update, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 17, 2022. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752. Tesla’s number for this recall is SB-22-00-004.
Interestingly, the delay between the recall notice and the owner notification is quite significant, but the software update fix is likely to come sooner – if it’s not already done.

2022/03/25,"Tesla updated its delivery timelines on new vehicle orders and it showed that many models, especially the Model Y, are sold out for the year in the US – even after the price increase.
There’s currently a rush to order electric vehicles as the technology gains in momentum naturally and through the gas price increase.
For Tesla, we previously reported that it has resulted in a significant increase in its order rate in several regions of the US.
The best way we have to track the backlog of orders is to look at Tesla’s delivery timelines on new orders on its online configurator.
Today, Tesla updated all of the delivery timelines across the lineup and it is showing a strong backlog of orders, especially for the Model Y.
The base version of the Model Y, which now sells for $63,000 after recent price increases, is now being delivered between January 2023 and April 2023, according to the online configurator:
As we previously reported, Tesla enables faster delivery if you order more options, like bigger wheels, the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Package, or the Performance Version.
But a new order with any of those options will still push the order to the second half of the year.
Electrek Tip: If you want the car faster and are not willing to pay $12,000 for FSD, your best option is to order the Model Y Performance. After the latest price increases, it’s actually just $3,000 more expensive than the Model Y Long Range with the 20″ wheels, which is basically the same car but with a little faster acceleration in the Performance version.
The Model 3 also got delivery timeline updates, but it is actually a lot more reasonable than the Model Y.
The base version of the Model 3, which is Tesla’s cheapest vehicle starting at $47,000, is still getting a delivery in 2022 for new orders: July–September 2022.
You can get the Model 3 one month faster by adding the 19″ wheels, which are $1,500 more expensive.
You can also gain a month if you want to upgrade to the Model 3 Long Range: June–August 2022.
The Performance version is listed as being delivered in June–July 2023.
Electrek Tip: Model 3 seems to be sold out for about three months in the US, which is not too bad compared to Model Y. But if you want a Tesla very fast, the quickest timeline is ordering a base Model 3 and adding the FSD package, which can surprisingly make you get the car as soon as April. Tesla really wants that $12,000 for the FSD.
The Model S also got an update and Tesla also has a significant backlog of orders on its flagship sedan – though that’s not necessarily because of a surge in order but the fact that Tesla is still catching up to a backlog after the vehicle was out of production for half of last year.
New orders for the base version, which now starts at $100,000 after a recent price increase, are now being delivered in “November 2022–January 2023”:
You can get the car a bit faster by adding options, like with the other models, but don’t expect the car until later in the second half of the year.
The situation is even worse for the Model X, which was out of production for even longer than Model S last year.
The very base version of the Model X with a five-seat configuration is not getting delivered until the second quarter of 2023:
If you choose a six or seven-seat configuration, you can get it sooner, but you are still going to have to wait until at least December 2022.
Model X Plaid has a quicker delivery timeline of “Aug – Oct 2022,” but it is only available in a six-seat configuration.
Adding the $12,000 FSD package doesn’t affect the timeline of the Model S or Model X like it does for Model 3 and Model Y.

2022/03/24,"A new report shows that Tesla is spending more in research and development (R&D) per car than any other automaker by a wide margin, and it is spending the least in advertising per car sold.
Tesla is now the biggest automaker in the world by market capitalization, despite selling only a fraction of the number of cars that other big automakers are selling. The electric automaker is growing fast, with a capacity to deliver over a million vehicles per year.
In order to keep growing, Tesla aims to maintain its EV technology lead and is investing heavily to do so. A new report from StockApps.com compared R&D spent per car sold from all the biggest automakers and found Tesla to be in the lead:
In fact, Tesla spends more on research and development(R&D) than any other automaker.  According to data presented by StockApps.com, the firm spends $2984 on R&D per car produced. That’s thrice the industry average of roughly $1,000 per car and higher than the collective R&D budgets of Ford, GM, and Chrysler per car.
Additionally, Tesla’s entire R&D spent goes into improving technology for electric vehicles and not split with an internal combustion engine business:
On the other hand, Tesla doesn’t spend any money on advertising and rely entirely on organic growth and some marketing. Marketing costs also went down significantly last year after Tesla ended its owner referral program for vehicles.
Now, the automaker relies almost entirely on word-of-mouth and its strong brand, which doesn’t seem to be a problem in the current market situation as its delivery timelines for new orders extend into next year for some versions of its vehicles.
On top of R&D investments, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been claiming that the automaker is also broadly investing more than double what GM and Ford are investing combined:
Tesla has created over 50,000 US jobs building electric vehicles & is investing more than double GM + Ford combined[fyi to person controlling this twitter]
It looks like Musk is talking about Tesla’s current investments in manufacturing, like Gigafactory Texas in Austin.

2022/03/23,"Hertz has decided to add Tesla Model Y to its growing electric vehicle fleet after announcing a deal to buy 100,000 Model 3 vehicles last year.
Last year, Hertz announced an important effort to electrify its fleet of rental cars, led by a massive purchase of 100,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles.
The news sent Tesla’s stock to record highs despite some confusion around the agreement. Tesla didn’t offer any deal to Hertz, and the rental company has to order the electric vehicles like any other customer.
The biggest question has been the timeline. Hertz said that it was planning to take deliveries of the 100,000 Model 3s by the end of 2022. Tesla wasn’t so sure that it would be possible, but Hertz has already been taking a lot of deliveries and the automaker is still guiding deliveries of new Model 3 orders by the end of the year.
Now the rental car company is also adding Model Y vehicles to its fleet of electric vehicles.
Hertz was previously only listing the Model 3 on its website, but it added the Model Y electric SUV this week.
The company had previously only specifically mentioned the Model 3 as part of its order of 100,000 vehicles.
It’s not clear whether the Model Ys will be part of the goal to add 100,000 EVs or if they’re in addition to the Model 3 order. Based on Hertz’s communications from last year, the latter would make more sense.
We contacted Hertz to clarify and will update if we get a clearer answer.
On top of adding Tesla vehicles to its rental fleet, Hertz also made a deal with Uber to offer its drivers access to the Tesla vehicles. 50,000 Tesla vehicles will be offered to Uber drivers, and the company has an option for more if the program is successful.
Hertz also has been promoting its growing Tesla vehicle fleet through a new ad campaign featuring Tom Brady.

2022/03/23,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla is going to make two new paint colors available through its new “world’s most advanced paint shop” at Gigafactory Berlin.
Back in the early days of the Model S, Tesla used to offer a variety of colors, but the automaker decided to streamline options, and it now offers only a handful of color options that have remained the same for the last few years.
CEO Elon Musk has been talking about Tesla finally releasing new colors, but it has been linked to a new “most-advanced paint shop” at Gigafactory Berlin.
The CEO talked about new multi-layered paints:
Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature.
Late last year, three new colors appeared in the Tesla app – hinting at potential new color options:
Now that Tesla officially started production at Gigafactory Berlin, we are hoping to see the new colors soon. During an event for the start of Model Y deliveries at Gigafactory Berlin, Musk was asked about these upcoming new colors that have been talked for a while now.
He responded: 
With respect to colors and which colors are going to be available from this factory, colors are always a challenge because when you think about colors, you don’t only need to manufacture it, but you also need service it and fix it for 20 years. We got to think, ‘What are we going to put the service team through?’
Despite this limitation, Musk reiterated that Tesla is going to be make new colors out of Gigafactory Berlin – starting with two:
We have to be careful with the total number of colors, but we are going to make some special colors here, and it’s about more than the color itself, but the layers of paint in order to get the dimensionality. We are going to make a very special red, which probably a lot of a people have seen. It’s like 13 layers of paint. And we will also have a silver with maybe eight layers. It’s also going to be special – kind of a liquid silver.
Those appear to be two of the three new colors that leaked through the app – though nothing was mentioned about the Abyss Blue.
The CEO said that people have seen the red already because it has been rumored to be the color of his own personal Model S, which has been spotted before. Musk said that the new colors should be coming to the Model Y in the next few months.
Last month, we got a glimpse at the Gigafactory Berlin paint shop that is enabling these new multi-layered colors.

2022/03/23,"Elon Musk made a new comment about the Tesla Cybertruck, which recently took a backseat, and said that the automaker aims to complete Cybertruck development this year for production in 2023.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022.
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
During Tesla’s last earnings report in January, Musk gave an update confirming that Tesla wouldn’t launch the Cybertruck or any new vehicle in 2022.
The CEO remained vague when it comes to the electric pickup truck and only said that it would “hopefully come next year” – meaning in 2023.
Since then, there have been rumors that Tesla is planning to start production of the Cybertruck in early 2023.
During an event for the start of Model Y deliveries at Gigafactory Berlin, Musk was asked by an employee about Tesla’s short-term goals. Musk reiterated that Tesla’s focus this year is to ramp up production of current vehicle programs, especially Model Y and Model 3, but he also offered a rare comment on Cybertruck.
Musk said that Tesla aims to complete the development of the Cybertruck this year for production in 2023:
“We want to complete the development of Cybertruck this year and be ready for production next year.”
While the comment doesn’t confirm it, it works with the rumored timeline of a start of production in early 2023.
The CEO also said that Tesla is aiming to complete engineering on the new Roadster this year and hopes to get enough batteries to be able to produce more Tesla Semi trucks.
Those comments come after Musk surprisingly said that Tesla is shifting its product development priority to its Optimus humanoid robot in 2022.

2022/03/22,"Tesla has secured another large battery contract in Australia as its Megapack was selected to power a giant new 300 MWh energy storage project to help renewable energy in New South Wales.
Edify Energy is behind the project called “Riverina and Darlington Point Energy Storage Systems,” which will consist of three clusters of battery packs located in the Murrumbidgee Shire, the Riverina region of New South Wales.
The company already worked with Tesla on a 25MW / 50MWh project back in 2018, but they were still using the Powerpack for utility-scale projects like this one back then.
This time, Edify announced that it has selected the Tesla Megapack for the bigger project:
Located in the Murrumbidgee Shire, the Riverina and Darlington Point Energy Storage Systems will make up three independent projects totaling a combined 150MW / 300MWh of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries that will connect into Transgrid’s network at the Darlington Point Substation. These Megapack systems will serve to add more flexible, dispatchable capacity to the NSW market and will complement the significant presence of renewable generation in the region.
According to Tesla’s Megapack configurator, a 300 MWh project would cost around $125 million:
The new battery systems are going to be used to support network stability and help manage the transition to a 100% renewable energy generation network as the New South Wales grid is seeing a lot of renewable energy being added.
Edify’s chief executive, John Cole, commented on the announcement:
One of the key drivers in our business is innovation and the strong belief that most roadblocks to a greener energy system can be overcome with the advancement in technology.  The advantages of large-scale batteries in our growing world of renewables are well documented and supported.  Energy storage is rapidly becoming a valued capacity solution for the National Electricity Market, given its fast and precise response and technical capability.  The pace of advancement in this growing technology class is exciting and with it a breaking of the barriers to acceptance from market and network participants.  We are proud to be leading the expansion of batteries to shore up the renewable energy market and to increase the availability of clean, green, low-cost, dispatchable electricity.
Edify has signed an EPC contract with Tesla Motors Australia to deliver these batteries – though they haven’t released a timeline.
As we reported yesterday, Tesla has recently increased the price of the Megapack and still has an important backlog of orders as it is guiding new orders for delivery in 2023.
",tesla
2022/03/21,"Tesla is significantly increasing the price of the Megapack – its utility-scale battery pack – as the backlog of new orders extends into 2023.
Back in 2019, Tesla launched the Megapack; it was Tesla’s third stationary energy storage product after the Powerwall and Powerpack. 
A single Megapack unit is a container-sized 3 MWh battery system with integrated modules, inverters, and thermal systems. With the bigger size and integrated power electronics, Tesla claims that the Megapack is 60% more energy-dense than its Powerpack. It also comes on-site ready to install and can ship in containers.
While exact pricing for the Megapack hasn’t been publicly released, we know that Tesla has priced it competitively because the product has become extremely popular with electric utilities.
We reported on massive-scale projects using the Tesla Megapack, like a battery project replacing a gas peaker in Ventura County and a huge 1 GWh project in Northern California.
Last summer, Tesla quietly launched a new online configurator for the Megapack and revealed a starting price of  $1.2 million for a single Megapack:
Today, the price is much higher, starting at $1,537,910 for a single Megapack – though Tesla also apparently increased the energy capacity of the battery pack by about 1 MWh:
Now, most projects that utilize the Megapack don’t use just a single pack, and Tesla offers volume discount, but that seems to have gone down significantly as well.
Last year, Tesla listed a price of $9,999,290 for 10 Megapacks or $327.87 per kWh, whereas 10 Megapacks will run you $16,048,230 or $412, 37 per kWh. The annual maintenance cost remains the same, starting at $6,570, but it escalates at 2% per year.
The utility-scale battery pack is likely under cost pressures from inflation and supply chain issues like most other Tesla products.
Tesla is also enjoying a significant backlog of orders for the Megapack, since its delivery timeline for new orders doesn’t start until first quarter of 2023.

2022/03/21,"The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is looking for the driver of a Tesla Model S who performed a dangerous stunt that resulted in hit and run.
The police are even offering a reward to find the culprit.
Tesla has had a problem with social media influencers using its vehicles in dangerous fashions lately.
It mainly had to do with its suite of driver assist features, like the TikToker who put a dog alone behind the wheel of a moving Tesla vehicle in Texas last year.
Now in Los Angeles, the LAPD is offering a reward to find the driver of a Tesla Model S behind a hit-and-run incident, and it looks like another social media influencer could be behind the stunt.
The LAPD wrote in a press release:
“On March 20, 2022, at 12:10 a.m., the rental driver of a black Tesla S-BLM decided to perform a dangerous stunt, at Baxer Street and Alvarado Street, where he colidded with several trash cans and two parked vehicles. The stunt was recoded by several spectators who posted it on several social media accounts. There is currently no description of driver, and the Tesla was abandoned at scene. A misdemeanor hit-and-run was completed, and detectives will be following up with the renter.”
Here’s footage of the stunt in question that resulted in the accident:
A post shared by Electrek (@electrek.co)
It doesn’t look like it’s going to be hard for the police to find the person behind the accident.
Dominykas Zeglaitis, a social media “content creator” better known for being part of the YouTube group Vlog Squad headed by famous Youtuber David Dobrik, has posted behind the scene footage of the accident on his Tik Tok.
He even claimed that it was his stunt in a video in which he appears to be giving the finger to the police for looking for him:
Another YouTuber associated with David Dobrik, Alex Choi, also posted video of the accident on his YouTube channel in which he claimed they “totalled a brand new $150,000 Model S.”
A misdemeanor hit-and-run in California can lead to up to six months in the county jail as well as a fine up to $1,000.00 dollars.
So just to recap, these social media influencers rented a Model S, did a dangerous stunt with it likely totalling the vehicle and damaging two more vehicles, left the car at the scene, and fled.
Then they decided to proudly post evidence of their crime on social media.

2022/03/21,"Elon Musk revealed what is going to be the main subject of Tesla’s “Master Plan Part 3”: It’s going to be about scaling the company to an “extreme size.”
As we reported last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he is working on “Master Plan Part 3.”
Master Plan Parts 1 and 2 were very important pieces of literature in Tesla’s history that laid out its plan to achieve its mission through a rough product roadmap and technologies to focus on.
While not without stumbling, Tesla has progressed through those plans quite nicely, and it is now arriving toward the end of “Part 2” – hence why Musk announced the upcoming release of “Part 3.”
Since the announcement, Tesla fans have been speculating about what could be included in the next part of the Master Plan.
Now Musk took to Twitter this morning to announce that the main subject is going to be scaling Tesla to “extreme size”:
Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI.
The fact that Musk is aiming for Tesla to achieve an “extreme size” is not exactly new considering Tesla has made public its goal to achieve an annual production capacity of about 20 million vehicles by 2030.
In comparison, the world’s biggest automotive groups, like Volkswagen and Toyota, produce about 10 million cars per year.
But Musk’s new plan is likely going to go into more details about how to scale manufacturing and supply chain to these levels, especially amid extremely difficult global supply issues.
Interestingly, Musk also added that the “Master Plan Part 3” will include sections about SpaceX and The Boring Company along with Tesla:
But I will also Include sections about SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company.
Historically, the Master Plan blog posts had been about Tesla and posted to Tesla’s website. Part 1 included mentions of SolarCity, and Part 2 had a part about Tesla’s acquisition and integration of SolarCity, but never anything outright about another separate Musk company.
This is starting again rumors about the “X” umbrella company, which would consist of all of Musk’s companies under one roof. It’s an idea that Musk floated in the past, but it would be quite complex to achieve.
Mentions of SpaceX and The Boring Company could also simply be more collaborations between the companies, which we have seen in the past, or the mentions could also be completely unrelated to Tesla and only be about Musk’s greater plan and how all those companies fit into it.
What do you think is going to be in Elon Musk’s Master Plan Part 3? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/03/17,"New registration data show that Tesla is still dominating the US electric car market, and it’s not even close. Something is going to have to break for EV adoption to accelerate in the country.
For years now, Tesla has been dominating the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market, but for now, the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla.
For the entire year of 2020, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the US.
Now new data has come out for 2021 as part of a new report based on registration data from Experian, and Tesla is a bit down, as expected. But, the company still holds a strong majority of EV market shares in the United States.
According to the report, Tesla still holds 69.95% EV market share in the United States with Nissan coming in at a distant second place with 8.51%:
Tesla is leading EV sales in every state except in Alaska, where the automaker has yet to open a service center, but it recently launched its first Supercharger in the state.
As you can see, all other automakers have a lot of catching up to do.
Fortunately, several of them have new EVs launching in the United States this year, and we expect to see several companies, especially Ford and VW, grow their EV market shares in in 2022.
The US is going to need those other automakers to ramp things up because, as you can see above, the EV adoption rate is still awful in most of the country.
But Tesla is also not going to slow down either. The automaker is expanding production at Fremont factory and starting production at Gigafactory Texas. While some of the additional production is going to be exported, Tesla is expected to still grow in the United States.
As we reported earlier this month, Tesla is seeing its order rate surge in many parts of the United States following the significant increase in gas prices.
According to Tesla’s delivery timelines for new orders, the automaker is still enjoying some large backlogs for almost every version of each model.

2022/03/17,"The price of Tesla vehicles are going through the roof, but the automaker has managed to reduce the price of one of its most popular products, the Wall Connector.
Tesla’s Wall Connector – which is used as a home charging station and for the automaker’s Destination Charging network – is a very popular charging station, due to its price and power capacity. For the longest time, it was sold for just $500, which made it one of the cheapest home charging options on the market with a significant capacity of up to 11.5 kW / 48 amp.
Like most Tesla products, especially its vehicles, the price of Wall Connector went up to $550. Tesla, like the rest of the auto industry, has been under supply chain pressure that has been affecting pricing – $550 still wasn’t a bad price, but it made a difference.
Now, Tesla is surprisingly dropping the price back down to $495 in an update to its online shop:
At that price, the only other competitive chargers price-wise are home stations like the Grizzl-E Level 2 EV Charger.
As the number one solution for home charging for Tesla buyers, the Tesla Wall Connector is extremely popular. There are hundreds of thousands of units deployed around the world.
In order to offer some different looks, Tesla released new charger faceplates that match its car colors last year.

2022/03/17,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he is working on releasing the third part to Tesla’s “Master Plan.”
Part One and Two have been important pieces of literature at Tesla that, in many ways, laid the path to the company’s success.
On August 2, 2006, Musk published a blog post titled “The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me).”
The post is worth a read, but it ends in a summary with the core principle being laid out in four steps:
It didn’t happen smoothly, but Tesla managed that for the most part with the Roadster, Model S, and then Model 3.
In 2016, Musk followed up with the “Tesla Master Plan Part 2.”
Part 2 came as Tesla was delivering the Model 3 and acquiring Solar City, which are basically the last two steps of the original plans.
In Part 2, Musk emphasized the integration of energy storage with renewable energy generation under the new “Tesla Energy” division. The creation of the solar roof was also announced in the plan.
The updated plan was also focused on self-driving capabilities, which became a priority at Tesla.
Musk summarized the Master Plan Part 2 at the end:
Among the other segments mentioned in the plan, Musk mentioned “a new kind of pickup,” which ended up being the Cybertruck; a compact SUV, the Model Y; a “heavy-duty truck, which became the Tesla Semi; and finally “high passenger-density urban transport.”
Every vehicle announced in the plan was unveiled, though they now need to be brought to production, except for the “high passenger-density urban transport.” It was rumored through a partnership with The Boring Company, but we have never seen anything official from Tesla.
Now last night, Musk has announced that he is working on publishing Tesla’s “Master Plan Part 3”:
Working on Master Plan Part 3
While all or even a majority of the goals of the Part 2 haven’t been achieved yet, they will be within the next 12 months if you believe Musk’s timelines which is a stretch – especially the one for “Full Self-Driving,” which the CEO perennially insists is going to happen by the end of the year.
The original master plan released in 2006 is important to me. I was still in high school and it was my early days of looking into electric vehicles. I just had started having a grasp on what was holding electrification back, but I couldn’t see a clear path for electric vehicles to become popular until I read that post.
After reading it, I became convinced that Tesla would be the company to make electric vehicles mainstream, and it started me on my EV journey.
Now it’s exciting to get a Part 3 because, for all his faults, Musk has been very good at staying mostly true to those plans.
What do you think is going to be in Elon Musk’s Tesla Master Plan Part 3? Let us know in the comments section below.
As for me, I have a feeling that Tesla Bot is going to be a big part of it since it’s definitely something that wasn’t in the previous plans and now it appears to be a priority at Tesla.

2022/03/16,"Tesla is now starting to account for wind, air density, and more when doing range calculations in an attempt to be more accurate.
Range calculations are difficult regardless of the type of powertrain, electric or internal combustion engine.
There are just so many factors that can affect the efficiency of a vehicle on a road that it is hard to determine how far it can go on a full battery pack or tank of gas.
But it is important. I’d argue that accurate range prediction is better at curbing range anxiety than longer range.
Tesla has been a leader in efficiency and long-range electric vehicles for a long time, but despite that, it still has issues predicting the energy consumption of a trip.
In 2018, Tesla added more environmental factors (elevation changes, weather, etc.) in the calculation. It helped, but it is still far from accurate. You put a destination in the system and Tesla’s trip advisor tells you how much energy you will have left by the time you get there, but it’s not rare to see the amount of energy go down fast as you drive.
Now Tesla is making new improvements to its energy consumption calculations.
The automaker has started pushing a new software update (2022.8.2) that includes a few UI changes, better charging calculations, and a preconditioning update. 
That’s according to the release notes, but Tesla hacker Green found a few more changes under the hood.
It includes accounting for crosswinds and headwinds, air density, and humidity in the energy consumption calculation when the data is available:
The interior cabin radar finally starts to get signs of life so might come live relatively soon? (on s/x cars)Trip energy accounting now takes into account cross/headwinds, air density and humidity when available (possibly China only for now?)
While these factors could only account for a few percentage points of difference, it can be a big deal for some trips. Every percentage point counts when doing efficiency and range calculations.
Green did note that this feature might only be available in China for now, which is often the case with new Tesla features.

2022/03/16,"A Tesla employee who has been posting videos of his experience with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has been fired. His firing came right after sharing a video of the first confirmed crash (albeit a small one) on FSD Beta.
Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta) is an early version of its self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.“
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name, but Tesla hopes to eventually remove the driver as a supervisor through future software updates.
In following the progress made with the Beta program, we often viewed and shared videos of early beta testers, like AI Addict on YouTube, who often posted driving experiences on FSD Beta.
What we didn’t know is that AI Addict, now known to be John Bernal, was a Tesla employee when making those videos.
Now we learn that Bernal was fired by Tesla late last month (via CNBC):
“Tesla has fired a former Autopilot employee named John Bernal after he shared candid video reviews on his YouTube channel, AI Addict, showing how the company’s Full Self Driving Beta system worked in different locations around Silicon Valley.”
While Tesla didn’t disclose the reason for his firing, Bernal was warned about his YouTube channel prior to the firing and a manager suggested that he doesn’t share things that show the system in bad light.
The timing of the firing is also interesting since Bernal has been posting FSD Beta videos for over a year and had disclosed the channel to Tesla, but he was fired just weeks after posting a video that showed Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta runing into a pole, in what could be the first FSD accident caught on video.
Electrek and several other outlets shared the video, and it gathered almost 200,000 views – 10 times more than most of his previous videos.
Bernal was terminated shortly after. He spent over a year as a data annotation specialist at Tesla before recently being moved to a role as an “advanced driver assistance systems test operator,” which is basically what he was doing on his Youtube channel – a possible conflict of interest.
The former Tesla employee said that he never shared anything about FSD beta or Tesla that wasn’t already public and in the hands of customers.
Interestingly, Tesla also rescinded Bernal’s access to FSD Beta on his personal Model 3. Previously, Tesla had only done that to people who received “safety strikes,” but Bernal had none – even after the accident last month. 
It’s unclear if Tesla is within its rights to do so, but one thing complicating the situation is that Bernal bought his Model 3 as a Tesla employee when the automaker was running a promotion giving the FSD package, which at the time was worth $8,000, to employees willing to test the beta for free.
Tesla has been under scrutiny before for encouraging FSD Beta testers to not share things that might be used against the company in an NDA.
CEO Elon Musk, who calls himself a “free speech absolutist,” said that Tesla shouldn’t have NDAs as part of the FSD Beta program and testers are “not following them” anyway.
However, it was question of employees sharing the videos of FSD Beta on social media at the time.
This is a strange situation because common sense would tell me that the guy was asking for it, for lack of better words. As a general rule, you don’t start a whole YouTube channel posting dozens of videos about your experience with a product made by your employer.
It just doesn’t sound like a good idea.
On the other hand, what’s so wrong about it? It sounds like a bad idea because of the optics, but it wasn’t done with ill intentions as far as I can tell.
And now the optics are bad for Tesla since it fired the man right after he posted a video of what could be the first crash on FSD Beta.
But of course, we only get one part of the story here since Tesla isn’t commenting on the situation.

2022/03/16,"Tesla is shutting down production at Gigafactory Shanghai for two days this week amid a surge in COVID-19 cases in China – though the company didn’t confirm this was the reason.
China has strict containment plans that include mass testing and isolation, which served the country well last year in limiting the spread of the virus.
But less than three months in 2022, the country already has more cases than it did during the whole of last year.
The number of new daily cases is now hitting highs not seen since the first wave of the virus in 2020
It has triggered lockdowns in some regions and mass testing in order to try to limit the spread.
Amid this context, Tesla announced to employees and suppliers that it would be shutting down production on Wednesday and Thursday at Gigafactory Shanghai(via Reuters):
“Electric vehicle giant Tesla is suspending production at its Shanghai factory for two days, according to a notice sent internally and to suppliers, as China tightens COVID restrictions to curb the country’s latest outbreak.
The Shanghai factory runs around the clock and suppliers and Tesla staff were told on Wednesday in the notice, reviewed by Reuters, that production would be suspended for Wednesday and Thursday.”
Gigafactory Shanghai is critical to Tesla’s operations with the factory becoming its largest by volume last year and exporting many Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to European markets.
Tesla didn’t confirm that the shutdown was due to the surge in COVID-19 cases or the increased restrictions being put in place to curb it, but we have seen several similar factory shutdowns in the last few days.
Both Toyota and Volkswagen had to recently announce similar shutdowns due to the pandemic.
Supply chain constraints could have also been behind the shutdown, as has been in the case recently.
Recently, Tesla has been producing close to 60,000 vehicles per month at Gigafactory Shanghai or about 2,000 per day. So even just two days of no production could significantly affect the output and create even longer delivery timelines.

2022/03/15,"Tesla Insurance is about to expand in two more states, Oregon and Virginia, and the company will underwrite the policies itself for the first time.
Tesla had already introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data and Tesla’s safety score, which had been its original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, the company wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real-time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes compared the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month-to -month, depending on your score:
In December, the company expanded the insurance product to Illinois.
Earlier this year, Tesla Insurance expanded to Arizona and Ohio – making it now available in five states – not including California – which won’t have the full product with real-time driving data.
Expanding an insurance product in the US is difficult, because it is on a state-by-state basis.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk set an ambitious goal by saying that Tesla Insurance is aiming to be “in most states” by the end of 2022.
This is going to be hard, but we have seen things moving with a few more states already this year and now, Forbes reports that Tesla is about to expand in Oregon and Virginia based on the filings:
Austin, Texas-based Tesla currently offers auto insurance in Arizona, California, Illinois, Ohio and Texas. According to state insurance filings reviewed by Forbes Advisor, Tesla is looking to start selling auto insurance in Oregon and Virginia next. In these new states, the policies will be underwritten by Tesla General Insurance for the first time, as opposed to partner companies in other states.
Another interesting thing in the report is that Tesla plans to go through third parties to underwrite the policies and instead do it itself through a ‘Tesla General insurance’ entity.
This marks another important step in Tesla expanding its insurance business, which is going to be critical to the company’s plan to deploy self-driving technology.

2022/03/14,"After achieving the best prices in the solar industry, Tesla has significantly increased solar panel installation prices as supply chain costs are causing pressure on the whole solar industry.
Last year, solar rooftop installations saw their first increase in price since 2014. While deployment increased, Solar Energy Industries Association said that supply chain constraints pushed solar prices 18% higher in the US.
Tesla had recently achieved the lowest prices in the industry in 2020 with several updates to its solar panel business, including a new price match policy. At the time, the company was claiming a price of just $1.96 per watt.
The prices have crept up over the last year, but several potential buyers have notified us of a big price increase that appears to have been adopted by Tesla over the last week.
Pricing a system in Southern California, right now, results in a price of $2.31 per watt:
When I priced the same system for the same location last year, I got a price per watt of $1.98 per watt, which is consistent with the rest of the industry having to raise prices, too.
In 2021, Tesla’s solar deployment grew significantly (68%) for the first time in years; the company deployed 345 MW last year. This number includes both solar panel installations and solar roofs, which also saw an important increase in price last year.
Tesla had big plans to significantly accelerate solar deployment, and while it increased last year, the magnitude that Tesla has been trying to achieve hasn’t materialized yet. CEO Elon Musk said that he expects Tesla’s energy business to grow as big or bigger than its automotive business.
Aside from the price increase, the supply chain issues are also affecting the actual availability of materials. We previously reported that Tesla has started to delay solar installations because of supply issues.
While Tesla ended its referral program for cars last year, the program remained for its solar roof and even increased its referral award to $500 – showing that the company is actively trying to secure more solar customers.

2022/03/14,"Tesla has started releasing a big new Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software update with a lot of improvements.
The automaker might widen access to the beta if this update “performs well,” according to CEO Elon Musk.
Since October 2020, Tesla has been slowly rolling out what it is calling “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta), which is an early version of its self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.“
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
The last significant update was FSD Beta 10.10 in early February.
As of Q4 2021, the automaker said that it almost had 60,000 owners in the FSD Beta program.
Now Tesla has started pushing a new FSD Beta 10.11 update to its Early Access Program, and it is a significant one based on the release notes.
Here are the release notes:
CEO Elon Musk says that if this update “performs well,” Tesla will “probably” lower the access to drivers who scored ’95’ on the driver safety score. This should give a lot more FSD buyers access to the beta.
As for Canada, Tesla owners who bought FSD have had access to the driver safety score for more than a week now. The automaker is expected to soon start releasing the beta to those with top scores.

2022/03/13,"According to a new filing with the EPA, Tesla is preparing to launch a new version of the Model Y with a puzzling range of 279 miles and an AWD powertrain.
Could it be the new Model Y with 4680 cells and battery pack built at Gigafactory Texas?
The EPA has released a rating on a new version of the Model Y.
Officially, Tesla currently only sells two versions of the electric SUV:
The EPA lists another version, the Model Y Standard Range RWD, which Tesla briefly offered last year before discontinuing it after CEO Elon Musk said he wasn’t satisfied with the range.
Now the EPA added another version of the Tesla Model Y to the list of 2022 models, and it’s an interesting one, especially with the imminent launch of the Model Y made at Gigafactory Texas.
The new Model Y is listed as a ‘2022 Tesla Model Y AWD’ on the EPA’s website:
As you can see, it is listed with an EPA-rated range of 279 miles on a single charge – significantly less than the current Model Y Long Range AWD at 330 miles of range.
Therefore, it appears to be a dual motor powertrain Model Y with a smaller and slightly more efficient battery pack.
While it can not be confirmed right now, the leading theory, due to the timing, is that this could be the new Model Y that Tesla is starting to produce at Gigafactory Berlin.
This new version of the electric SUV is going to be equipped with Tesla’s own 4680 battery cell and a new structural battery pack. These changes are expected to affect the specs, so either Tesla tries to match them to existing versions or offers a different one, which could be the case with this new Model Y AWD.
We are expected to get more details once Tesla starts deliveries from Gigafactory Texas, which is expected to happen by the end of the month.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/03/11,"The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has officially changed a long-standing rule that is now creating a path for automakers to deliver self-driving vehicles without steering wheels or pedals.
Safety regulations have forced automakers to deliver every passenger vehicle with several safety features – including steering wheels and pedals – in order to make them street legal. That sounds like a simple and obvious regulation, but it is becoming less so with the advent of driverless vehicles.
A steering column extending into the passenger compartment is taking up space, and it’s not actually needed if the vehicle can drive itself.
With more and more driverless transport services being approved on US roads, including Waymo in Arizona and California, and Cruise in California, some tweaks to those regulations have become needed.
Several companies, including GM and Tesla, have made clear that they intend to produce vehicles without steering wheels, and now, they are going to be able to do it in the US.
NHTSA has officially changed the rule (via Reuters):
U.S. regulators on Thursday issued final rules eliminating the need for automated vehicle manufacturers to equip fully autonomous vehicles with manual driving controls to meet crash standards.
The rule applies to vehicles built to be self-driving from the ground up. 
This should enable Cruise and Waymo to build new vehicles with better design interiors for being driverless, instead of retrofitting vehicles like the Bolt EV, Jaguar I-Pace, and Pacifica minivan.
In 2018, GM unveiled a Bolt EV without a steering wheel with the hope to use deploy them with Cruise Automation’s technology.
Tesla also unveiled a Model 3 without a steering wheel in 2019, but the company’s approach to self-driving could mean that we won’t see that on the road for a while.
Cruise and Waymo have self-driving services approved for commercial operations in some geo-fenced sections of cities, while Tesla is taking a wider approach and aims to deliver a self-driving system that could take you almost anywhere in the world. It also claims all its vehicles being delivered today already have all the hardware necessary to achieve that with future software updates.
In the meantime, those vehicles are driven – or at least supervised – by human drivers who need steering wheels and pedals.

2022/03/11,"Tesla appears to have produced a very interesting video showing how to use a Powerwall as a mobile power station after sending a load of them to Ukraine.
As we recently reported, Tesla has taken a few steps to help Ukraine, which is currently under attack from a Russian invasion. 
The automaker started by offering free Supercharging at some stations around Ukraine for electric vehicle owners fleeing the country.
It later expanded the program to all stations in Poland and Slovakia as more refugees started entering those countries.
Another Elon Musk company, SpaceX, also quickly helped the situation by activating its Starlink satellite internet service in the country as Russia targeted Ukraine’s infrastructures.
We later learned that Tesla helped in this effort with a team at Gigafactory Berlin packaging the Starlink terminals sent to Ukraine and adding Powerwalls:
“On top of this the Energy team supplemented the Starlink roll out with a fleet Powerwalls. The system included PV inverters given by our Certified installer network, pre-made DC cables given by one of our Supercharger Installation Partners and AC cables made out out of scrap from Giga Berlin. All of it assembled by a team of (40+) volunteers from across the EMEA organization, committed to doing what they can to support.“
The Starlink satellite internet constellation is not much used if you are not able to power the ground terminals – hence the Powerwalls.
Now we have been sent a video that appears to have been produced by Tesla to show Ukrainians receiving these Powerwalls how to deploy them as mobile power stations:
The Tesla Powerwall is meant to be used as a home battery pack connected to the grid and/or a rooftop solar panel installation in order to provide backup power. But that’s not really useful to a country under attack.
As described above, Tesla shipped those Powerwalls with basically plug and play connectors in order for them to work out of the skids they are being shipped on.
A Tesla Powerwall has almost 14 kWh of energy capacity, which should power a Starlink terminal for days, but as demonstrated in the video, you can also connect it to an inverter and a string of solar panels to keep it going for longer.

2022/03/10,"A recent update to Tesla’s website configurator reveals that it is prioritizing reservations that include the $12,000 full self-driving (FSD) option, at least for the Model Y and Model 3. For reservations of the Tesla Model Y in particular, delivery estimates change from six months from today (September), to two months (May), simply by choosing the FSD add-on. 
Having first begun deliveries two years ago, the Tesla Model Y remains the American automaker’s most recent model to reach production. Since then, it has become a pivotal EV in helping the company gain an even larger global market share, especially now that it has debuted in additional markets like the UK. 
With recent environmental approvals at the new Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla is sure to increase its EV output tenfold, already promising deliveries of German-built Model Ys in less than two weeks. Such a high rate of production to keep up with an ever-soaring demand does come at a cost, however. A cost that continues to increase given constraints to supply chains and battery materials like nickel. 
Just last week, we saw some of the repercussions for consumers as a result of these global economic hindrances, when Tesla raised prices of the long-range versions of its Model Y and Model 3 EVs. 
Most recently, those same EVs are seeing another interesting change to their reservation configurator – Tesla is prioritizing delivery times for Model Y and Model 3 if their respective customers spring for the $12,000 FSD add-on.
As you can see from the configurator comparisons above, Tesla is currently incentivizing consumers to throw an extra $12k at their Model Y or Model 3 purchase by expediting their delivery. 
Model 3 customers currently only see a month’s advantage on delivery times buying FSD vs. not. However, Model Y customers might be more motivated to add the FSD option if they have the money and don’t want to wait until September to drive their new EV. By spending $12,000 more, the Model Y delivery window jumps up to May, just two months from now.
Currently, delivery times for the Tesla Model X and Model S are not affected by the choice to add FSD capabilities or not. Despite some of these recent changes, the demand for Tesla vehicles is still sky high, especially with soaring prices for gasoline and diesel fuels. 
For those consumers who were planning to give FSD a shot on their new Model Y anyway, this may come as welcomed news. For others, however, it may not be worth the money to jump the delivery line by a few months. There’s always the pre-owned market too!
Naturally, Tesla cannot be reached for any explanation, but it’s a fair guess that it’s a strategic move to maximize income from sales as the prices to produce these EVs continue to rise, given current global circumstances and Tesla.
There are of course other contributing factors to delivery delays too. For instance, Gemini Wheels will send your Model Y delivery estimate all the way to December. That being said, those are tangible hardware items whose availability is directly linked to supply chain issues, versus a simply FSD unlock via software update. 
Critics of Tesla’s FSD, including ourselves, can also point out that the $12,000 add-on is a bold bet based upon a promise that CEO Elon Musk has been “next year-ing” for at least half a decade now. Furthermore, the true prospect of full-self driving feels as equally distant from fruition as it was before Musk’s last public punt and the one before. For that reason, this isn’t a sound pricing package, even if it means an earlier delivery.

2022/03/10,"Tesla is seeing its order rate surging in the US, according to sources familiar with the matter, as the record gas prices are turning more people toward electric vehicles.
However, it won’t significantly affect its deliveries since the automaker is still production-constrained.
Amid the crisis in Ukraine and sanctions to put pressure on Russia to end its invasion, oil and gas prices have increased significantly.
Crude oil is now at over $100 per barrel, and the average gas price at the pump in the US was at $4.25 a gallon – with some regions seeing $5 a gallon.
This is going to affect virtually every industry, but it is also an important enough increase that many people are having to change their budget for gas.
Every time they go to the gas station, they are reminded that a geopolitical situation is costing several more dollars just to get to work.
Now many of them who are in a position to buy a new car are turning toward electric vehicles. Some out of frustration, others because they are making the cost of ownership calculation and realize that it is actually cheaper than a gas-powered car.
Tesla is the biggest EV brand in the US by a long shot. About 80% of all electric cars in the country are Tesla vehicles, and unsurprisingly the company is starting to feel an increase in orders from gas price pressure.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is seeing surges in orders in several parts of the US this week.
A source familiar with Tesla’s order rate said that the automaker saw it increase 100% this week compared to last in parts of the country particularly affected by gas prices.
However, this surge in orders is not going to affect Tesla’s performance in the short term as the automaker already has a significant backlog of orders and is production-constrained.
In the US, Tesla is guiding a July 2022 delivery for new orders of the base Model 3 and September 2022 for the popular Model Y.
The start of production and deliveries at Gigafactory Texas could help later this year, but delivery timelines are expected to increase for now.
Other automakers are also expected to see increased demand for their EVs, like Hyundai for the Ioniq 5 and VW with the ID.4, but those vehicles also have limited supply and long wait lists.

2022/03/09,"Tesla has updated its pricing for the Model 3 and Model Y,  raising the prices of the long-range versions by $1,000.
It comes as nickel prices are surging.
In 2021, Tesla made so many price increases that we have lost count.
The automaker blamed the increases on being under pressure from supply chain constraints following the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is also fair to note that Tesla’s gross margins went up throughout the year.
Things have calmed down on that front over the last few months with Tesla’s last price increase in November.
But now Tesla is back with a new update to the Model 3 and Model Y configurations, and it is again an increase in price.
The price of the Model 3 Long Range increases by $1,000 from $50,990 to $51,990:
The price of the Model 3 Long Range has increased by about $4,000 over the last year as it was selling for $48,000 in March 2021.
As for the Model Y, Tesla increased the price of both the Long Range and Performance versions by $1,000:
Model Y Long Range has seen its price surge by $10,000 over the last 12 months.
Those new price increases today come just as the price of nickel is surging due to the crisis in Ukraine leading to embargoes and sanctions on Russia, the world’s third-biggest producer of nickel – a material critical to high-energy density battery cells found in some electric vehicles.
We can’t confirm that the two are related, but interestingly, Tesla has only increased the price of vehicles with nickel in their batteries.
The automaker didn’t increase the price of the base Model 3, which is equipped with an iron-phosphate battery cell that doesn’t require nickel.
Morgan Stanley has warned that the recent 100% surge in nickel price would have roughly $1,000 to electric vehicles like Tesla’s.
The price increase was strong that both the London Meta Exchange the Shanghai Exchange stopped trading certain contracts related to nickel.

2022/03/09,"Tesla has expanded its program to give free Supercharging to EV owners trying to escape Ukraine. The company also told its Ukrainian employees that they will have three months of pay if they have to go back to fight.
Tesla also sent Powerwall battery units to Ukraine.
When regions of the world are hit by natural disasters, Tesla has been known to offer free Supercharging in those regions to give one less thing for people to think about when traveling away from danger.
For example, Tesla offered free Supercharging to owners on several occasions during hurricanes in the south of the US.
Last month, Tesla did it again, but this time it was due to the conflict in Ukraine. The automaker made some Supercharger stations in Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary free for all EV owners in order to give them one less thing to worry about if they were escaping the conflict.
This week, the automaker decided to expand the program to all Supercharger stations in Poland and Slovakia:
We are temporarily enabling free Supercharger in areas impacted by the recent situation in Ukraine.
Starting today, you can access free Supercharging at all Superchargers across Poland and Slovakia.
We hope that this helps give you the peace of mind to get to a safe location. As always, tap any site on your car’s touchscreen to see current pricing.
Safe travels,The Tesla Team
Tesla doesn’t currently have Superchargers in Ukraine, but many electric car and Tesla owners in the country could use the stations in neighboring countries to get refuge in other European countries. 
Even though Tesla doesn’t officially operate and sell cars in Ukraine yet, it is believed that there are more than 5,000 Tesla owners in the country who imported their vehicles themselves.
It’s not the only thing that Tesla announced this week regarding the conflict in Ukraine.
CNBC also reported that Tesla told Ukrainian employees in an email that the company would keep paying them for up to three months if they have to go back to their home country to fight:
“Ukrainian Tesla employees who are asked to return to defend their country will receive pay for at least three months, according to an e-mail the company sent on Monday to employees in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. It wasn’t clear from the email whether this benefit would be extended to employees in North America and elsewhere.”
After the three months, Tesla plans to reevaluate the situation.
In an email to employees, the automaker also thanked the team that helped SpaceX deploy Starlink satellite internet in Ukraine in record time.
The Tesla Energy team also donated Powerwalls to Ukraine.
Here’s the full email Tesla sent to employees today:
Date: March 7, 2022 [Time redacted]Subject: Conflict SupportTo: DL-EU-NO-AllFrom: Axel Tangen
Hi Team,
Sharing this message from Joe Ward and Mariam Khalifa: 
As you know, Tesla is committed to do the right thing. Whilst the situation in Ukraine is evolving, we wanted to share with you what actions are being taken to support those impacted by the conflict.
Many folks have reached to understand how they can contribute, which is awesome. It’s important we show them how we as a company are helping, what resources we have in place, and how they can also proactively support themselves. Big thanks to all of the teams that have contributed to these efforts so far – true Tesla spirit on display.
 *As a priority HR EMEA team members have been connecting with employees impacted as well as their managers to ensure we check in. We will continue to ensure we provide meaningful and targeted support for our employees.
For any Tesla employees who is a Ukrainian national and has been asked to return to Ukraine for active duty as a reservist, we will maintain their employment and salary for 3 months, with a view to assessing after this period as needed.
*Tesla has opened free Supercharging at stations bordering Ukraine to support those impacted by the recent invasion. Within hours of implementation, Tesla emailed local owners announcing that several Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by Tesla and non-Tesla electric vehicles, free of charge. Although Tesla does not officially operates within Ukraine, any of the country’s estimated 5,000 Tesla owners can access free Supercharging at select stations in Poland, Hungary Slovakia.
*Tesla teamed up with SpaceX to provide coverage expansion for its Starlink services to help provide an alternative internet infrastructure.
*Volunteers across the Giga Berlin and Germany Service team responded quickly on Sunday to test, configure, pack and ship several hundred Starlink units which have already been gratefully received by Ukraine’s Digital Transformation Minister. In true Tesla fashion, the solution has been put together in less than 3 days.
*On top of this the Energy team supplemented the Starlink roll out with a fleet Powerwalls. The system included PV inverters given by our Certified installer network, pre-made DC cables given by one of our Supercharger Installation Partners and AC cables made out out of scrap from Giga Berlin. All of it assembled by a team of (40+) volunteers from across the EMEA organization, committed to doing what they can to support.
*In addition, we have reinforced Tesla EMEA Employee Assistance Programme. The Programme offers counseling and numerous resources and support for employees. 
Lastly, employees can of course support by making cash donations to reputable relief organizations responding in Ukraine, this is not an exhaustive list and you can of course make donation to an organisation of your choice.

2022/03/09,"Tesla has confirmed that deliveries of Model Y vehicles built at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany are starting on March 22.
Last week, after months of delays, Tesla finally received its official building permit following the environmental approval of its Gigafactory Berlin project.
It was believed to be the last regulatory step needed for Tesla to officially start production at Gigafactory Berlin.
However, the approval was conditional on about 400 different conditions that the automaker needed to confirm. Surprisingly, German officials said at the time that they expected Tesla to fulfill all those conditions within the next two weeks.
It would put the start of production and deliveries (since production actually already unofficially started with hundreds of Model Y vehicles spotted coming out of the plant) at the end of March.
Tesla has now confirmed and started sending out invitations for a delivery event on March 22:
As we previously reported, Gigafactory Berlin is critical for Tesla’s plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency throughout its entire operations.
Once fully ramped up, the factory is expected to greatly reduce Tesla’s need to import cars from factories in the US and China.
In turn, that would enable more capacity for those markets and keep vehicle production closer to the end customers.
The new factory is also expected to greatly help Tesla’s financials by reducing transit times. Since Tesla owns its vehicles until they are handed over to the final customer, vehicles in transit for a long time, like on boats across the ocean, are a big financial strain on the company.
March 22 will mark an important step for Tesla by starting deliveries of European-made vehicles and putting it on a path of better logistical efficiency.

2022/03/08,"Elon Musk recently made a call for the world to drill for more oil as prices are surging amid anticipated shortages due to the situation between Russia and Ukraine.
It’s surprising coming from someone who is trying to get the world off oil. But on top of it, he and Tesla should worry more about nickel prices, which are skyrocketing right now.
Nickel is a critical resource when it comes to transitioning the world to electric transport and clean energy.
High energy density batteries, which are required for long-range electric vehicles, all use a significant amount of nickel in the cathode of the battery cell.
By volume and cost, it accounts for a significant part of an electric vehicle’s battery pack, which in turn is the most costly part of an EV.
Of course, nickel is also used for plenty of applications other than batteries for electric vehicles.
Actually, only about 5% of the world’s nickel supply is currently used for batteries going into electric vehicles, but that number is going up fast.
Even with conservative estimates of electric vehicle adoption, it is expected that EV nickel demand would jump from 5% to 59% of the overall nickel supply within this decade.
That means a giant squeeze of nickel supply is going to happen if there’s not a major ramp-up of production soon.
In 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk urged nickel miners to increase production as he saw the problem coming, but neither he nor most people saw the conflict in Ukraine coming, and it’s increasing the price of several commodities.
The most obvious one is oil. Russia is a big producer of oil and gas, and several countries and petroleum companies have been implementing and/or discussing embargoes on Russian oil, which has sent the price of the barrel to record highs not seen in 14 years as the supply is expected to be limited.
It pushed Musk to call for the world to drill for more oil and gas last week:
Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.
This angered many of his followers, who saw it as an anti-clean energy call despite Musk explaining that his comment comes from a concern that civilization is currently mostly powered by oil and gas.
The counter-argument is that the situation is actually putting a focus on alternatives to oil and gas and could accelerate the shift to clean energy, which is the sole mission of Musk’s company, Tesla.
And now Musk could shift his concern to another resource that is being affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and that is nickel, which he has been concerned about in the past.
Russia is the world’s third-largest producer of nickel, and with fear of its imports being limited in an already difficult nickel market, it sent prices through the roof:
The price per ton of nickel already more than doubled over the last year, prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but it has gone up over 80% in the past month, with a significant jump yesterday.
The massive surge is believed to have been triggered by short-sellers trying to cover their short nickel positions following fear that Russia’s supply would be cut off from the rest of the world.
Morgan Stanley believes that the new price alone could add an a average of $1,000 to electric cars, like Tesla’s.
Tesla has taken steps to encourage new production of nickel, like singing an off-take agreement with Talon Metal for an upcoming new nickel mine in the US.
These off-take agreement helps junior mining companies raise money to bring those new mines to production, which is a capital intensive process.
Many more of those deals and new mines are going to need to happen in order to support demand from the electric transition regardless of the situation with Russian nickel.

2022/03/08,"Tesla’s February numbers in China are out and it confirms that Gigafactory Shanghai is maintaining an incredible output of more than 600,000 electric vehicles per year. 
With upcoming improvements, Tesla could soon push production to over 1 million units per year and possibly 2 million units with a rumored second factory in Shanghai.
The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released its numbers early on Tuesday and showed that Tesla sold 56,515 domestically-made vehicles in China in February.
33,315 of those vehicles were exported to other markets.
Gigafactory Shanghai has become Tesla’s exportation hub, and early in the quarter – in this case, October and November – the automaker produces vehicles for international markets, especially Europe and Asia, and focuses on producing vehicles for the Chinese market later in the quarter.
Tesla’s total output in February is down month-to-month by about 5%, but that’s to be expected as the Chinese New Year generally affects performance through February.
Year-over-year, Tesla is up more than 200% in China.
At over 56,000 units, it shows that Tesla is holding to an annualized production rate of over 600,000 vehicles at Gigafactory Shanghai.
Tesla has previously talked about eventually achieving an output of 1 million vehicles at the factory.
But on top of that, a new report came out last week claiming that Tesla is starting work on a new factory adjacent to Gigafactory Shanghai in order to double production capacity to two million cars annually.
While still only a rumor, Tesla China hasn’t commented on the news despite shutting down other reports of upcoming new factories in China.
Demand for electric cars is skyrocketing in China and many other markets – resulting in a race to deploy EV production rather than focusing on sales.
In China, passenger vehicle sales rose 4.7% year-over-year in February to 1.27 million units, and electric vehicles, or new-energy vehicles (NEVs) as they call them in China, are responsible for the increase.
NEV deliveries increased by 180% to 272,000 units. Tesla’s 200% increase helped, but in terms of overall volume, BYD led with shipping 87,473 vehicles last month – though that number includes both hybrid and all-electric vehicles.

2022/03/07,"A Tesla owner in China was surprised with a ~$600,000 bill after a stop at a Supercharger station.
The automaker says it was a bug.
For years, Tesla never charged anything for its customers to charge at Supercharger stations.
It was part of the owner’s experience and included in the price of its vehicles.
This has changed over the last few years as Tesla moved to a paying model in order to accelerate the deployment of Supercharger stations across the world.
The automaker had to build a payment system that doesn’t affect the seamless experience of using Supercharger stations.
It has succeeded, for the most part, but we have heard of some issues every now and again. None as big as this one though.
A Tesla Model 3 owner in China got a very bad surprise after he was charged 3,846,306 yuan, the equivalent of over $600,000 USD, after a relatively short session at a Supercharger station.
Filter Crusher reported on the incident:
“Some netizens reported that when they were driving a Tesla Model 3, they charged for 20 minutes on February 27. Today, the vehicle was suddenly banned from Supercharging, and received an app prompt to pay a supercharging fee of 3,846,306 yuan. Filter Crusher called Tesla customer service, and the customer service responded that there was an error in the background system of some vehicles, and the technicians are repairing it. Not yet resolved.”
It’s not clear what the bug was, but it was quite strange since it involved several aspects of the Supercharger app.
In screenshots of the Supercharger tab in the owner’s Tesla app, it shows that the owner had free Supercharging miles from the previous Tesla referral program, but the last 2,286 km (1,420 miles) were all used in the last charging session even though there’s no way that Tesla could have delivered that:
After exhausting the miles, the owner’s car was blocked from the Supercharger, but since it was still plugged in, it started to incur idle fees at an exceptional pace.
Idle fees occur when people stay parked at a Supercharger station when they are not charging. They are there to incentivize people to quickly remove their cars from the station after being done with charging.
But in this case, a bug made them go out of control and faced the owner with a giant $600,000 bill.
If anything, it serves as a reminder to keep an eye on your Supercharger bills, because a lot of people have been conditioned not to pay too much attention to them.

2022/03/04,"Tesla has officially received environmental approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin – which was expected as we reported earlier this week – but also as expected, there are a few caveats that will prevent Tesla from officially starting production.
The battle is not over. 
After months of delays, German reports stated earlier this week that Tesla was expected to finally receive final environmental approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin later this week. The environmental approval for the giant factory faced a lot of opposition with concerns ranging from deforestation to water supply and more.
There were several setbacks for Tesla that prevented the company from securing the approval, which has been believed to be the last regulatory step needed to start production.
Yesterday, we shared that a German newspaper reported that Tesla already secured the approval and that a press conference with more details would come on Friday – they also warned that it might not allow Tesla to start production as previously believed.
Today, the details have been released along with a 536-page conditional building permit, but the word “conditional” is important here – there are about 400 conditions that Tesla needs to fulfill in order to start production.
The automaker said that it plans to cover all of them within the next two weeks; however, there are some things that appear to be on a different timeline, like another notice of public objection, which is going to be published for two weeks and then comments will be accepted for a month:
The approval notice will shortly be published in the official gazette for the state of Brandenburg, in the local daily newspapers and on the internet. The notice of approval is available for two weeks from the day of publication in the municipality of Grünheide (Mark), the town of Erkner, the office of Spreenhagen and at the administrative headquarters of the Oder-Spree district in Beeskow, as well as in the State Office for the Environment in Frankfurt (Oder). inspection off. The period of one month during which objections to the approval can be raised begins with the end of the exhibition . At the same time, the approval notice is published on the Internet on the EIA portal of the state of Brandenburg, where it can be viewed until the end of the objection period.
However, Tesla and German officials don’t seem to think this should delay the start of production.
The documents reveal that Tesla is approved to produce 500,000 electric vehicles per year at Gigafactory Berlin, along with several other production processes approved, including battery cell production. They also reveal that Tesla has already hired about 3,000 workers at the plant.
While the battle to start production at Gigafactory Berlin is not over, it looks like Tesla is in the home stretch.
To put in perspective just how mammoth an endeavor this is, German officials disclose that the application documents – expert opinions and statements – comprise more than 23,700 pages in 66 files.

The UK is one of those markets, as EVs reached 11.6% market share in the country last year.
Part of that was because of gasoline car sales going down following the pandemic and the subsequent supply chain problems, but nonetheless, electric vehicles are making progress that they likely won’t give back.
Now the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) released the February 2022 numbers, and it shows yet another increase as EVs are taking a 17.7% market share:
The big difference maker was the Tesla Model Y even though it launched in the UK only during the last week of the month.
It still took fourth place on the bestseller list for the month of February:
March should result in an even bigger increase with Tesla delivering Model Y for the full period.
The UK is certainly not quite at “Norway numbers” when it comes to electric vehicle adoption, but it is gaining speed and will continue to do it as more EV models hit the market in the coming months and years.

2022/03/03,"Panasonic is reportedly planning to build a large battery cell factory in the United States to supply Tesla, according to a new report from Japan.
Tesla and Panasonic already built a factory together in the US: Gigafactory Nevada.
While the facility hasn’t grown to the size that the companies originally planned, it was a great part of Tesla’s growth in the past few years, and it helped Panasonic become a major player supplying battery cells in the automotive sector.
Now it looks like the two companies are planning to replicate this success on an even larger scale.
Japan’s NHK reports that Panasonic is currently in the process of purchasing land in the United States to build a “mega-factory” to build battery cells for Tesla (via Reuters):
Japan’s Panasonic Corp is looking to purchase land in the United States for a mega-factory to make a new type of electric vehicle (EV) battery for Tesla Inc, public broadcaster NHK reported on Friday.
The report also states that Panasonic is zeroing in on “Oklahoma or Kansas” for the location of the factory:
Panasonic is looking at building the factory, to cost several billion dollars, in either Oklahoma or Kansas for their proximity to Texas, where Tesla is preparing a new EV plant, NHK reported. NHK gave no timeline for Panasonic’s U.S. project.
Panasonic recently confirmed plans to start production of Tesla’s 4680 battery cell by March 2024, but that will happen at a factory in Japan.
If accurate, these unconfirmed plans would mean a brand new factory built from the ground up to support Tesla’s rapidly growing production in the United States – specifically in Texas where Tesla just started production of the Model Y.
The automaker is currently using 4680 battery cells that the company is building itself at a pilot production plant in California and deploying its own battery cell production capacity at Gigafactory Texas.
However, Tesla has made it clear that it would buy any cell it could get its hands on from suppliers for the foreseeable future.
The company is expected to have exceptional demand for battery cells at Gigafactory Texas once it starts production of Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which are vehicle programs that require more battery cells per unit.

2022/03/03,"A small mountain town in China is becoming known as the “Tesla village” after a single Tesla owner convinced dozens of people to buy Model Y electric SUVs to use for their businesses.
Tesla has had a lot of success in China’s megacities for years, but it is now rapidly expanding to other more remotes regions. There are some great success stories that Tesla is now starting to share.
This week Tesla shared the story of Cai Run from the village of Panzhiga in China’s Yunnan province on its official Weibo account. Cai worked in big Chinese cities for years, but he recently returned to his hometown after a new bridge connected it to a major roadways – bringing a lot of tourism to the quaint little town.
It gave him the opportunity to open a small hotel, but he also returned with his Tesla Model Y.
Cai ended up convincing several of his neighbors to also buy Tesla vehicles, and now the small village boasts a fleet of 30 Model Ys. Some of the villagers who followed Cai’s recommendations love using their Model Ys as part of their local businesses, even selling their products out of their electric SUVs:
Tourism picked up enough in the region that Cai’s own hotel and other small places that opened up are not enough to supply the demand, and now some Model Y owners are even offering their cars as a place to stay for the night:
Tesla is known for having a “camp mode” that enables the use of the vehicle’s systems for camping when parked. Many owners have been known to use the feature on road trips.
Here’s a video about Cai’s, and other villagers’, experience with Tesla that the company released on Weibo:

2022/03/03,"2021 was a record-breaking year for investment in and deployment of clean energy, battery storage, and EVs in the US, according to the “2022 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook” published today by BloombergNEF (BNEF) and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE).

According to the study, growth was fueled by strong consumer demand; unprecedented injection of new capital into companies, technologies, and projects; and a wave of supportive new government policies.
Ethan Zindler, BloombergNEF’s head of Americas, said:
Last year really was a year of firsts. We saw record volumes of new capital deployed to support the transition to a lower-carbon economy, a record number of electric vehicles sold, and record contributions to the power grid from zero-carbon renewable sources of power. Still, there are plenty of open questions about future demand that clearer signals from Washington could resolve.
Here are three standout things that happened in 2021 for EVs, clean energy, and battery storage:
US electric vehicle sales doubled in 2021, but the US still lags globally. Thanks to lower battery costs, growing consumer acceptance, and the rollout of new models, EV sales saw 657,000 units sold in the US in 2021, which is more than double the 325,000 cars sold in 2020. 
Tesla continued to account for the largest share of EV sales in 2021, at 50%. While the overall market expanded 34%, the market for non-Tesla electric cars grew 83%. 
However, EVs made up just 4.4% of total US passenger vehicle sales in 2021. The US EV market is one-third the size of the European Union’s and one-fifth of China’s. The US market is not yet growing fast enough to satisfy either US climate ambitions, or to establish the US as an industrial leader in the EV sector.
In order for the US to meet its 2030 nationally determined contribution on emissions, EVs must make up at least 30% of vehicles on the road by that year. There’s still a very long way to go to meet that target.

Private investment in clean energy in the US is accelerating. Investment of $105 billion in new private capital in the US energy transition in 2021 is an 11% year-on-year increase, and a 70% increase over the past five years. The 2021 total included $47 billion in clean energy (45%), $35 billion in electrified transport (34%), and a doubling of hydrogen investments to $200 million in 2021.
Large corporations continued to drive clean energy demand in the US, signing contracts to procure a record 17 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy in 2021. 351 companies pledged to procure 100% clean energy.
Further, private sector investment will be leveraged by the US federal government’s unprecedented $80 billion pledge to support the energy transition with the enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
And private investment in renewables is on an upward trajectory. For example, just today, Schenectady, New York-based clean energy company DSD Renewables announced it has secured a $200 million preferred equity investment from alternative investment manager Ares Management Corporation.

Clean energy and battery storage grew, but natural gas is still the leader for electricity generation. More than 45 GW of new power generation capacity was commissioned in 2021 – the largest capacity in nearly two decades. Clean energy dominated, adding 37 GW. Solar had its largest build year ever at 24.2 GW of new capacity, and wind followed at 13 GW, its third best year to date.
Further, close to 4.2 GW of battery capacity was added to the US grid in 2021, more than in all preceding years combined. This was due to the growing need for batteries created by the growth of clean energy, particularly solar, in certain markets, particularly California.
Overall, natural gas, at 38% is the largest source of US electricity generation. However, natural gas contributed 3.1% less than in 2020, due primarily to higher gas prices.
Clean energy provided 21%, with wind and solar representing 14% of this. Nuclear provided 19%, and coal provided 22%. Coal is down nearly 40% from a decade ago due to weak demand, coal plant retirements, and competition from cleaner sources. While coal use rose in 2021 for the first time since 2014, that is widely believed to be a temporary surge.

2022/03/03,"Tesla fears having to shut down its stores and service centers in Oklahoma as a new bill banning direct sales and service from automaker has passed a House committee unanimously, and it’s heading to a vote.
To this day, there are still some states that prevent Tesla and other automakers from selling directly to consumers.
This is because of old laws put in place to protect franchise dealerships against automakers trying to compete with the people who invested a lot of money into providing a sale and service workforce for them. It made a lot of sense.
But now, those same laws are being used to prevent Tesla and other new automakers who never had franchise dealerships from competing against dealers who sell vehicles from other automakers – it’s being used in an anti-competitive way.
Several states have changed those direct sale laws in order to avoid this misuse that gave a monopoly on car sales to third-party dealers, but there are still some misuses out there and efforts from dealers associations – which have a lot of power in state politics – to outlaw direct sales.
In Oklahoma, there’s a new effort that Tesla fears will prevent them from operating its current business in the state.
Last month, we reported on the automaker reaching out to its fans to try countering a new bill being considered in the state’s House Business and Commerce Committee.
At the time, Tesla argued that the bill could even force the company to shut down its locations in the state:
If passed, this bill could force Tesla to close its existing locations in Oklahoma AND prevent Tesla from shipping cars to anyone in the state, which would force locals to travel out-of-state to service their cars or pick up their new Tesla vehicles. Oklahoma should focus on increasing revenue and jobs in the state, not stifling competition and limiting consumer choice.
Now, the bill has officially passed the House Business and Commerce Committee, and surprisingly, it did it unanimously:
It is headed to the house for a possible vote by the end of the month. The sponsor of the bill, representative Mike Dobrinski, has been in the car dealership business for decades along with his family – the automaker is asking fans to contact their representative to let them know that they oppose the bill.
If the bill does go through the legislation, Tesla could have to shut down its locations in the state, but it could have another solution.
In New Mexico, Tesla found a loophole to the state’s direct sale ban by building a location on tribal land. Oklahoma also has a lot of tribal land where Tesla could potentially make a similar arrangement.
This new effort to ban direct sales comes just after Oklahoma pulled out the red carpet for Tesla in trying to convince the automaker to build a factory in the state, but the company ultimately decided to go to Texas instead.
However, the state has since convinced Canoo, another EV maker, to come to the state-approved millions in incentive to secure a factory in Oklahoma.
Canoo has also indicated that it plans to use the direct sale model and could be affected by this bill.
Not that it would necessarily stop it to build a manufacturing facility in the state, though. Tesla went with Texas, even though the state also has direct sale regulations banning automakers from selling directly to customers.

2022/03/03,"Reports in Germany state that Tesla has received its final environmental approval at Gigafactory Berlin, but there’s apparently something else that might prevent production.
A press conference is expected to explain everything on Friday.
After months of delays, German reports stated earlier this week that Tesla was expected to finally receive final environmental approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin later this week.
The environmental approval for the giant factory faced a lot of opposition with concerns ranging from deforestation to water supply and more.
There were several setbacks for Tesla that prevented the company from securing the approval, which has been believed to be the last regulatory step needed to start production.
Now German newspaper Handelsblatt reports that the Potsdam State Office for the Environment (LfU) has given Tesla the final approval:
A good two years after the start of construction, the environmental approval process for the electric car factory of the US company Tesla in Grünheide near Berlin has been completed . The Potsdam State Office for the Environment (LfU) gives the final approval for the new “Gigafactory.
The paper reports that a press conference to discuss the approval is being held by the authorities on Friday.
However, the publication also says that there’s a catch.
It reports that the approval won’t actually give Tesla the capacity to immediately start production:
The decision does not mean that Tesla can then immediately start car production. The State Ministry for the Environment recently said that the project developer had to meet other requirements and provide evidence before the plant could be put into operation.
It’s unclear what additional “evidence” is going to be required.
As we previously reported, Gigafactory Berlin is critical for Tesla’s plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency throughout its entire operations.
Once fully ramped up, the factory is expected to greatly reduce Tesla’s need to import cars from factories in the US and China.
In turn, that would enable more capacity for those markets and keep vehicle production closer to the end customers.
The new factory is also expected to greatly help Tesla’s financials by reducing transit times. Since Tesla owns its vehicles until they are handed over to the final customer, vehicles in transit for a long time, like on boats across the ocean, are a big financial strain on the company.

2022/03/02,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk invited the United Auto Workers to hold a union vote at the Tesla factory, stating that Tesla “will do nothing to stop” the voting process.
It’s the latest in a years-long saga between the UAW and Tesla, in which Tesla has been found to violate labor law in unfairly cracking down on union organization.
Tesla’s workforce is non-union, unlike the “Big Three” American automakers – GM, Ford, and Chrysler (now part of Stellantis). But Tesla’s main plant in Fremont, California, was previously the “NUMMI” plant, a joint venture between GM and Toyota, which used UAW union labor.
The UAW has wanted to unionize Tesla for some time now, particularly given the plant’s union past. There was a significant push from UAW in 2017-2018, but union efforts have not gotten particularly far as of yet.
Today’s invitation from Musk seems like a change in tune, but he has made similar invitations before. In 2018, he said that Tesla employees could “vote union tomorrow if they wanted,” but that this would result in them needing to give up stock options and pay union dues for “nothing.”
This communication was found to violate US labor law, and the National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to delete it. They also ordered Tesla to offer compensation for lost wages to a union organizer, Richard Ortiz, who the company illegally fired. A federal judge noted 12 company actions that violated US labor law.
More recently, Tesla has come under fire from California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing for alleged systemic mistreatment of factory employees, and last year was ordered to pay a $137 million judgment to an ex-worker due to a pattern of racial abuse he experienced when working there. In each of these cases, management was found unreceptive to concerns by the individual employees in question – whereas a union representative might have offered a second chance for those concerns to be heard.
Musk suggested today that the real reason unionization efforts have not gotten far is due to high levels of employee compensation by Tesla – a natural outgrowth of the hot job market in the San Francisco Bay Area:
Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment, so if we don’t treat and compensate our (awesome) people well, they have many other offers and will just leave!
I’d like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them.
Musk also claimed that “Tesla factory compensation is the highest in the industry.” His source for this statement is an Andrew Sorkin interview with GM CEO Mary Barra, where Sorkin states, “It appears by my math that, on average, Tesla employees, who are non-unionized… on an hourly basis may be making more money than unionized workers at GM.” Barra disagreed with this analysis, saying, “[M]y last look at that, that was not the case.”
Tesla’s high pay largely comes from their stock compensation program, which offers stock options to most employees, as is common in Silicon Valley. The rise of TSLA stock has made those options very valuable, which means total compensation for Tesla workers will be buoyed by a high TSLA stock price – which is relevant to the aforementioned threat to remove options from union employees.
Unionization efforts are ongoing at Tesla facilities outside of the US as well. IG Metall, the largest union in Germany, is trying to organize workers at Tesla’s Gigafactory Berlin. Germany has relatively high labor organization rate, with about half of the total workforce covered by some sort of collective bargaining agreement. In the US, only about a tenth of workers work under a collective bargaining agreement.

2022/03/02,"Elon Musk said that Tesla could have made a Model S with 600 miles of range a year ago, but the CEO says that it would have made the electric car worse. It doesn’t look like Tesla plans to make cars with more than 400 miles of range.
When Tesla first unveiled the new Model S last year, the company introduced a new Model S Plaid+, which replaced the previous Plaid as the new top performance version. The Model S Plaid+ was advertised as having over 520 miles of range on a single charge and 0–60 mph acceleration in less than 1.99 seconds.
As for the Model S Plaid, it replaced the Model S Performance, and Tesla said it would get 390 miles of range and 0–60 mph acceleration in 1.99 seconds.
However, Tesla ended up canceling the Model S Plaid+ as Musk said that people don’t really need more than 400 miles of range. 
This gave Lucid the opportunity to be the only automaker with an electric car with over 500 miles of range. While Lucid is having issues ramping up the Lucid Air, the company is delivering the vehicle with over 500 miles of range.
This week, a Tesla superfan acknowledged that Lucid was first to market with a 500-mile EV, but he added that Tesla “would be the first to mass produce one.” But interestingly, CEO Elon Musk responded to the tweet to indicate that Tesla doesn’t plan to make a car with more than 400 miles of range, even though he said that it could have made one a while ago:
We could’ve made a 600 mile Model S 12 months ago, but that would’ve made the product worse in my opinion, as 99.9% of time you’d be carrying unneeded battery mass, which makes acceleration, handling and efficiency worse. Even our 400+ mile range car is more than almost anyone will use.
In a comment to Electrek last year, Musk clarified how Tesla is looking at long-range electric cars now:
What we are seeing is that once you have a range above 400 miles, more range doesn’t really matter. There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom, food, coffee, etc. anyway.
The CEO never said how this would affect the new Roadster, which Tesla has been advertising at over 600 miles of range.
You can see those results first hand with Lucid Air vs. Model S Plaid. The Lucid has more horsepower but because of the heavier battery pack and car structure needed to hold them, it is slower off the line than the Plaid. 
Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen recently said that the production version of the new Roadster would be better than what Tesla originally unveiled, but he didn’t comment on the range which was originally over 600 miles.
With Musk’s recent rhetoric about long-range EVs, it looks like Tesla might focus on other aspects of the car instead of the range.

2022/03/02,"Tesla has been ramping up deals to secure future supply of critical battery metals at upcoming mines lately, and it’s now adding another lithium contract with a new mine in Australia.
With the rise in popularity of electric vehicles, several critical materials to battery production, like nickel, lithium, and cobalt, are becoming bottlenecks in growing the overall EV production capacity.
In order to encourage new production to come online, battery manufacturers and automakers are starting to sign contracts and off-take agreements with junior mining projects that are not in production yet.
This helps these projects secure financing to bring the mines to production, which is an extremely capital-intensive process.
In January, Tesla signed such a deal to secure nickel from a new mine in the US.
At the time, we noted to expect more of these types of deals from Tesla in the near future as the race to secure critical battery metals is ramping up.
Tesla ended up adding another deal with an upcoming lithium mine in Australia developed by Liontown.
Now the automaker is again going back to Australia to secure lithium – this time for a new lithium mine in the Northern Territory developed by Core Lithium.
The Australian company announced the deal today:
“Australia’s next lithium producer, Core Lithium Ltd (ASX: CXO) (Core or Company), is pleased to announce that it has entered into a legally binding Term Sheet with Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) for the supply of up to 110,000 tonnes of Li2O spodumene concentrate from the Finniss Lithium Project over a term of 4 years, with pricing referenced to the market price for spodumene concentrate, subject to a price floor and ceiling (Term Sheet).”
This secures Tesla a significant supply of lithium, and while it comes with risk since it’s from an upcoming mine, the risk is limited since the project is fully-funded and fairly advanced.
Core Lithium says that production is expected to start in Q4 2022:
“This follows the Company’s recent announcement (see ASX announcement dated 30 September 2021) that the Board has taken a Final Investment Decision to commence development of the Company’s wholly owned Finniss Project, located near Darwin in the Northern Territory. The Company is fully funded to deliver the Finniss Project, which has started construction, through to first lithium concentrate production scheduled for Q4 2022.”
However, the deal with Tesla would only start in the second half of 2023.
Again, we should expect Tesla and other companies to keep doing more of those agreements in the near future to help encourage more new projects in an attempt to avoid major supply chain issues when it comes to raw battery materials during the second half of the decade.

2022/03/01,"Tesla has now deployed and unveiled a big 37-Megapack project in Alaska that will help replace gas turbines with a more sustainable solution.
Homer Electric, a member-owned electric utility cooperative based in Alaska, announced the project based in Kenai Peninsula back in 2019 – shortly after Tesla first unveiled the Megapack. 
The Megapack is Tesla’s latest and biggest energy storage product, following the Powerpack and the Powerwall. It is meant as an even bigger option targeting electric utility projects.
According to Tesla, a single Megapack has up to 3 MWh of storage capacity and a 1.5 MW inverter.
With a capacity of 93 MWh, the project in Kenai Peninsula was one of the biggest announced at the time, but Tesla has since delivered bigger 1 GWh Megapack systems.
Homer Electric said that the project would replace gas turbines and enable better deployment of renewable energy:
The BESS also provides a great side benefit of opening the door to renewable intermittent energy projects that would have otherwise stretched current thermal generation assets.
The project has now been deployed, and Tesla wrote about it:
Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula has historically relied on gas turbines to distribute power to the community up to four months out of the year. To reduce the community’s reliance on fossil fuels to power the turbines, Homer Electric installed 37 Tesla Megapacks, providing grid stability even in freezing temperatures.
Tesla also released a new video about the project:
It’s going to be an interesting project to test Megapack’s performance in extreme cold.
Megapack has enabled Tesla to greatly accelerate energy storage deployment toward CEO Elon Musk’s vision for Tesla Energy to become a distributed global utility, an endeavor that could even outgrow the company’s automotive business.
Tesla has also been building a new factory to build up to 40 GWh of Megapacks per year.

2022/03/01,"Tesla has released footage unveiling its pre-fabricated system to deploy new Supercharger stations in record time.
This new one in Florida was built in just over a week.
Tesla is currently growing its Supercharger network at an impressive rate. 
The automaker went from 23,277 Superchargers at 2,564 stations at the end of 2020 to 31,498 Superchargers at 3,476 stations at the end of 2021. That’s growing at a 35% year-over-year pace.
However, it is lagging behind vehicle deliveries, which grew 87% during the same period of time – on top of now gradually starting to allow non-Tesla EV owners to use the network.
It also lags behind Tesla’s own goal to triple the Supercharger network in two years.
It’s not necessary due to a lack of effort from Tesla, but mostly due to the complexity of deploying a single charging station.
Once Tesla knows it wants, or needs, to open a new Supercharger in a specific area, it needs to find a property to build it on and get the property owners to agree to a contract.
Then the automaker needs to design the project, get it approved by the municipality and the local electric utility. Then it needs to schedule a local contractor to do the installation and work with the local utility to get it activated.
If Tesla runs into an issue with just one of those steps, a project can see a significant delay.
But it wasn’t the case for this new Supercharger project Brooksville, Florida, which Tesla put together in just 8 days:
12 Superchargers deployed in 8 days at Brooksville (FL) site pic.twitter.com/ZXvkUBWlYp
Of course, that’s just the construction phase, but still, it is an impressive deployment of a significant 12-stall Supercharger station in just over a week.
Tesla was able to achieve that thanks to a new pre-fabricated Supercharger system.
You can see the company delivering the stalls already assembled on a truck:
This greatly simplifies the construction phase and likely reduces the cost while also resulting in less disruption in the parking lot, which is often used by nearby businesses.
Tesla already used the method for a few stations deployed over the last few months, and it will be interesting to see if it becomes the norm.

2022/02/28,"A new Tesla Cybertruck prototype has been spotted at Tesla’s Fremont factory, and it featured a bed cover – something that was missing in other recently spotted prototypes.
We expected to get an update about the Cybertruck as part of a product roadmap CEO Elon Musk had said he would release as part of the company’s Q4 2021 earnings. However, the CEO only announced that the Cybertruck had been delayed to “hopefully 2023” due to supply chain constraints.
Nonetheless, a new prototype of the electric pickup truck has been spotted around California and Texas over the last few months. In December, Tesla was spotted testing a new prototype of the Cybertruck on its test track at Fremont factory.
A few weeks later, Tesla brought a new prototype of the Cybertruck to Gigafactory Texas. Several pictures and even a video of the updated version of the electric pickup truck have leaked.
Earlier this month, another Cyvertruck prototype was spotted at Fremont factory when a drone got dangerously close to it.
Now the same drone pilot spotted another Cybertruck prototype at Fremont factory, but this time he stayed farther away:
There are a few interesting things about this particular sighting of the highly-anticipated electric pickup truck.
First off, it features a bed cover – something that was missing on most previous recent sightings.
It appears to have some strange and inconvenient dirt accumulation at the top of the bed cover.
As we previously reported, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the automaker plans to offer an option with embedded solar cells in the retractable cover, and a patent for the technology developed to enable such an option was released last year.
The footage also shows the Cybertruck prototype next to a Model S, which gives a good size comparison.
The Cybertruck looks much longer, but the perspective might be misleading as the electric pickup truck looks extremely long from this angle.
What do you think of this new Tesla Cybertruck sighting? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/02/28,"Panasonic announced today that it greenlighted a new investment to start production of Tesla’s 4680 battery cell by the end of the fiscal year ending March 2024.
The Japanese manufacturing giant is one of several battery makers looking to produce 4680 cells for Tesla.
Tesla is preparing to start deliveries of its first vehicle using its 4680 battery cell, a new tab-less battery cell in a bigger format with new chemistry unveiled in 2020.
For the first time, the automaker plans to produce its own cells to support its electric vehicle production.
The Model Y produced at Gigafactory Texas is going to be the first vehicle to feature the new cell, which also enables Tesla’s structural battery pack architecture.
However, Tesla is going to need so many cells that it is also partnering with current battery suppliers to deploy their own production of the new 4680 cell.
Panasonic, Tesla’s oldest battery partner, has tentatively announced that it would be deploying a prototype production line for the new battery cell.
Later, Panasonic’s new CEO, Yuki Kusumi, said that it is prepared to make a “large investment” in producing Tesla’s new battery cell if test production proves successful.
In October 2021, the Japanese manufacturer unveiled its own 4680 cell developed with Tesla.
One month ago, it was rumored that Panasonic has greenlighted a $700 million investment to produce the 4680 cell in Japan.
Today, the company has confirmed the announcement without specifying an amount to be invested.
Panasonic wrote in a press release:
“Panasonic Corporation today announced that its Energy Company will establish a production facility at its Wakayama Factory in western Japan to manufacture new, “4680” lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in order to expand its business globally.”
The company confirmed previous reports that the “production facility” will consist of two new production lines:
“To contribute to the rapid adoption of EVs, Panasonic has been working to enhance its line-up of automotive lithium-ion batteries. Currently, Panasonic is developing a new high-capacity lithium-ion battery, the “4680”, in multiple locations within Japan. The company will progressively develop production capabilities in preparation for the full rollout. Along with structural improvements, two additional production lines as well as utility facilities will be established at the Wakayama Factory, and productivity verification and mass production are set to begin in the fiscal year ending in March 2024.”
Panasonic uses fiscal years ending in March and therefore, the production could start anywhere between March 2023 and March 2024.
Tesla recently reported that it doesn’t plan to be constrained by the limited supply of 4680 cells this year as the chip shortage remains the main bottleneck.
However, the automaker said that next year it expects cell supply to be its biggest growth-limiting factor again.
Ramping up its own production and securing supply from other manufacturers, like Panasonic, is going to be critical.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/02/28,"Tesla is reportedly finally going to receive final approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin this week after months of delays.
Gigafactory Berlin, a critical new factory for Tesla’s plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency, has been in limbo for months.
The automaker has yet to secure the needed environmental permit to start producing vehicles for customer deliveries.
Last month, Tesla confirmed that it built the first few Model Ys at Gigafactory Berlin at the end of 2021.
The automaker also received approval to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin ahead of the final approval by the state of Brandenburg.
Tesla said it needed to conduct more tests of its production process, and it hasn’t been approved to deliver those vehicles.
However, it looks like the factory is up and running with hundreds of new Model Y vehicles spotted coming out of the factory last week.
Despite this important development, there was no news on Tesla receiving its environmental approval with still more talks of concerns over water supply at the plant.
Now a week later, it looks like things are moving ahead.
German newspaper Tagesspiegel reports that Brandenburg Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke met with a special task force for the Tesla project last week and that the team managed to agree on the environmental approval of the project.
The approval is expected by the end of the week – likely Thursday or Friday.
This approval will enable Tesla to start producing Model Y vehicles for customer deliveries, which are now expected to happen by the end of March.
The same report also states that Tesla is planning a “grand opening” ceremony, likely on March 22 or 23, to deliver the first vehicles built at Gigafactory Berlin.
Interestingly, it looks like the start of deliveries at Gigafactory Berlin will coincide with the start of deliveries from Gigafactory Texas, which is also expected to have its first new Model Y in customer’s hands by the end of March.
However, the new Model Ys from Texas are expected to feature Tesla’s new 4680 battery cells while the new Model Ys from Germany are going to be equipped with the 2170 cell format.
Tesla has yet to update the specs of the new vehicles about to be delivered.

2022/02/28,"Tesla has started to offer free Supercharging in several countries around Ukraine for people fleeing the country following the Russian invasion.
When regions of the world are hit by natural disasters, Tesla has been known to offer free Supercharging in those regions to give one less thing for people to think about when traveling away from danger.
For example, Tesla offered free Supercharging to owners on several occasions during hurricanes in the south of the US.
Now for the first time, Tesla is doing it for not a natural disaster, but a human-made disaster –Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a “military operation” last week that is now amounting to a large-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
Ukrainian forces have been fighting back its much bigger neighbor, but the Russian military has advanced into several parts of the country.
Many have decided to flee to other neighboring countries, like Poland and Slovakia, for safety.
In an email to local owners, Tesla has announced that it is making several Supercharger stations near the Ukrainian borders with those countries free to use for both Tesla and non-Tesla electric vehicles:
Charge for free in parts of Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.
Beginning Monday, we are temporarily enabling free Supercharging for both Tesla and Non-Tesla vehicles at sites in areas impacted by the recent situation in Ukraine. Starting with:
We hope that this helps give you the peace of mind to get to a safe location. As always tap any site on your ca’s touchscreen to see current pricing. Safe travels.
This initiative from Tesla also marks Tesla’s first time activating free Supercharging for non-Tesla vehicles as well.
As we have previously reported, Tesla has started a pilot program in Europe to test opening Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles.
Tesla doesn’t officially operate in Ukraine, but it has been rumored to enter the market soon and even added planned locations for Supercharger stations in the country earlier this year:
Despite not officially selling its cars in the country, there are many Tesla owners in Ukraine who decided to import Tesla vehicles themselves.
A few years ago, they even made a plea to Elon Musk to have Tesla enter the market and deploy a service network and charging stations:
The CEO has been promising an expansion into Eastern Europe for years, but it has been slow to materialize.

2022/02/26,"Tesla has officially started rolling out its Full Self-Driving Beta in Canada – marking the first official international expansion of the driver-assist system that Tesla taunts as an early version of a true self-driving system.
Since October 2020, Tesla has been slowly rolling out what it is calling “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta), which is an early version of its self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.”
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
As of Q4 2021, the automaker said that it almost had 60,000 owners in the FSD Beta program – all in the US.
CEO Elon Musk has been promising an expansion of FSD Beta in Canada for a while now and it is finally coming.
Last night, Tesla started pushing a new software update (2022.4.5.4) to some vehicles in Canada and it enables those vehicles to “Request Full Self-Driving Beta”:
Once “requested,” you start the approval process, which consists of giving your day-to-day driving a “safety score”.
If it’s high enough, Tesla might push you the actual FSD Beta software.
Musk recently said that Tesla has been internally testing FSD Beta in Canada with about 60 vehicles. This expansion to regular owners who bought the FSD package is expected to greatly increase the number of test vehicles.
Even though it wasn’t officially released in Canada yet, I tested FSD Beta in Montreal last year.
I can’t go into the details of how that happened, but I can say that I wasn’t impressed by the performance of the system in the city.
On more residential suburban roads, it did fine, but in the city, it was super stressful. 
The perception aspect is truly impressive. The car appears to be able to detect its environment very well on FSD Beta, but the decision-making is the problem. 
While it appears to be following the rules of the road perfectly at times, it often decides to make stupid and dangerous decisions.
If you decide to try FSD Beta, it’s important to stay vigilant at all times and be ready to take control.

2022/02/25,"An original Tesla Roadster sold for over $250,000, in a new record, as Tesla’s very first car is gaining in value as a collector item.
That’s more than Tesla plans on selling the next-generation Roadster for.
The Tesla Roadster was the now-famously Texas-based automaker’s first car: a small two-seat sports car based on the Lotus Elise.
It was far from a successful vehicle program by most conventional standards. It was late, had a difficult rollout with many production problems that led to changes, and only roughly 2,400 units were delivered during its ~four-year production run between 2008 and 2012.
But it was successful for Tesla because it achieved its main objectives. The Roadster changed people’s perception of what electric cars can be, and it helped launch or accelerate several more electric vehicle programs. 
With an EPA range of 393 kilometers (244 miles) with the first Li-ion battery pack in a production car, a 0 to 60 mph acceleration in 3.7 seconds, and a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), it redefined electric vehicles as more than a glorified golf cart.
In the future, when all new cars are electric, we will likely look back at the Tesla Roadster as the vehicle that sparked the automotive industry’s electric revolution. 
Due to its place in EV history, some people in the industry have speculated that the original Tesla Roadster could become a popular collector’s car and increase in value.
In 2020, we reported on some people testing the market with a Tesla Roadster going to sell for $1.5 million.
However, we also reported at the time that the original Roadster didn’t appear to be gaining in value based on listings, which were showing a price range of $50,000 to $70,000 – about half the original price of the car.
Last year, we were starting to see a change in Roadster prices with Gruber Motor Company, an EV shop specializing in Tesla Roadsters, reporting some vehicles selling at auctions for $120,000 to $182,000.
It seems to indicate that the original Roadster is gaining value.
The value seems to increase as the EV revolution is taking hold and more people realize the Roadster’s place in it.
It is also increasing as the vehicle is becoming more scarce. As previously reported, Tesla only produced about 2,400 of them, but there are far fewer on the road today.
Of course, several were lost to crashes, but Tesla also bought back several cars for parts to service other vehicles.
Gruber themselves unintentionally contributed to the scarcity as the company was the victim of two fires that destroyed many Roadsters.
A fire in 2017 destroyed at least five Roadsters and another more recent incident in October 2021 resulted in the loss of 31 Roadsters.
It’s hard to determine how many Tesla Roadsters are left out there, but it wouldn’t be surprising if it’s fewer than 2,000 units.
Electrek talked to Pete Gruber of Gruber Motor Company this week and he said that Roadster sales are picking up.
The company has a portal to list Roadsters for sale and he says that they sold six in the last three months alone.
The prices are also going up.
Gruber said that one Roadster went for $190,000 recently, a new record, but the record didn’t last long.
Someone ended up listing a very early 2008 Roadster VIN013 with extremely low mileage on the odometer, at just 840 miles.
Gruber suspected that the combination of low mileage and low VIN would bring a lot of interest and suggested to the owner to put a high “fishing price” on it.
The owner settled for $250,000.
Within days of posting the vehicle listing on Gruber’s portal, the owner received several offers over the asking price and he ended up selling for well over $250,000 – though the owner didn’t want to confirm the final price.
The company released a video about the new record sale:
As Gruber noted, this is not only a record value for a sale of the original Roadster, but it’s actually more money than Tesla is asking for the new next-generation Roadster.
Electrek‘s own Jamie Dow is also currently listing his original Roadster on Gruber’s portal – though he is asking for a lower price as he put a lot more miles on his.

2022/02/25,"A new survey shows that Tesla is gaining steam as a brand with Republicans after being a darling of the Democrats for years.
In general, Tesla buyers, and electric car buyers, have always been more likely to be Democrat than Republican.
Left-leaning individuals are generally more environmentally cautious, though climate change concerns have been gradually gaining ground on the right in the last few years. 
But EV buyers tending to be more Democrat than Republican is also due to the market incentives.
That’s due to blue states like California implementing stronger EV incentives to encourage buying electric vehicles than red states.
California is still Tesla’s biggest market in the US, but since the automaker moved its headquarters to Texas, the automaker is making progress with Republicans.
A new survey shows an important three-point increase in Republicans considering a Tesla as their next car over just a month (via CNN):
Surveys by research firm Morning Consult show that in January about 22% of Democrats were considering buying a Tesla, while 17% of Republicans were looking to purchase one. And that gap has been closing — Republican consideration of buying a Tesla has risen about 3 percentage points just since December’s survey. 
That’s when it comes to jumping into action and actually planning to buy a car, but even more surprising, Republicans are now more trusting of Tesla as a brand than Democrats:
And Republicans are slightly more likely to trust the Tesla brand, 27% compared to 25% among Democrats.
This comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been ramping up his criticism of the Biden administration over the last few months.
Over the years, Musk was mostly staying away from politics, and while he did have some criticism of the government during Trump’s administration, it doesn’t compare to his current comments on Biden, who he even called “a damp sock puppet in human form.”
This rhetoric is making him increasingly popular in conservative circles and alienating some long-time progressive supporters – many of whom now report supporting Tesla and not Musk.
The thing is that buying an electric vehicle makes sense regardless of your political views. 
EVs are simply a better transport solution than vehicles with an internal combustion engine.
It just looks like if your political views were creating some hurdles to buying EVs, it’s becoming easier for you to jump over those.
However, on the other hand, I’m definitely hearing more and more left-leaning people saying that they wouldn’t buy a Tesla because of how Musk is conducting himself these days. That’s certainly a consequence of how polarizing political discourse has become over the last few years. There’s this constant aura of “if you are not on my team, you are the enemy.”
That’s their choice, and fortunately, there are plenty of electric vehicles for them to choose from.

2022/02/24,"The Wall Street Journal is out with a new report that Elon Musk’s lawyer warned about and reveals that the SEC probe into Musk and Tesla is reportedly about a suspected insider trading violation involving Musk’s brother.
As we reported yesterday, things are escalating quickly between Musk and the SEC since a lawyer for the former sent a letter to the court accusing the latter of harassing Musk and Tesla.
It came after Tesla revealed that it was subpoenaed by the SEC late last year without revealing what the investigation was about.
The SEC quickly denied the allegations of harassment, but then Musk’s lawyer came back with another letter, this time accusing the SEC of leaking information about their investigation.
It wasn’t clear on what the lawyer was basing this allegation, but now the Wall Street Journal is out with a report revealing what the probe is about: 
“The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether recent stock sales by Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk and his brother violated insider trading rules, according to people familiar with the matter.”
Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, made a $100 million Tesla share sale the day before his brother announced that he would sell billions worth of Tesla stocks if Twitter votes for it:
“The SEC’s investigation began last year after Mr. Musk’s brother sold shares of Tesla valued at $108 million, one day before Mr. Musk polled Twitter users asking whether he should unload 10% of his stake in Tesla and pledging to abide by the vote’s results. Mr. Musk framed the potential sale as a way to cover any taxes he would need to pay if lawmakers imposed new taxes on unrealized capital gains. Mr. Musk began selling billions of dollars worth of stock a few days after his tweet.”
The sale of shares wasn’t part of a pre-approved plan like some of his previous sales.
The SEC is reportedly investigating whether or not Musk told his brother about his plan and if it constitutes an insider trading violation.
As we reported yesterday, Musk said about the situation with the SEC: “I didn’t start the fight, but I will finish it”. He said that he has been “building a case” against the agency.
Oh boy. What are we talking about here? Is this really what this situation is about? Insider trading?
Call me naive, but I have a hard time believing that the richest man in the world would bother to tell his brother about an upcoming tweet that could possibly affect his hundreds of millions of dollars stake in Tesla by a few million.
On the other hand, why is Musk making such a big deal about the SEC looking into it? If he has nothing to hide about it, let them investigate and move on instead of raising a big stink about it.
I doubt that it’s about any possible insider trading to do with Kimbal.
If anything, I think it might be more about how Musk framed his own sale of Tesla shares – making it look like it was about the Twitter poll regarding rich people paying taxes, when most of the sales were actually planned months before as part of his stock option plan.
He might not want this investigation to reveal more about how this all came about and was framed.
What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below.

2022/02/24,"Tesla Model Y has convinced another police department, Sykesville Police, to go electric and the maintenance cost was the difference-maker.
Tesla vehicles have become the go-to EV for police departments around the world. Many have started adding Tesla Model 3s to their fleets, like the NYPD most recently, and now, the Model Y is starting to gaining momentum.
Last year, Fremont police and the Spokane Police Department both bought Model Ys to use as patrol vehicles and Boulder’s police department also went with the electric SUV.
Any type of use that requires a lot of mileage is going to benefit greatly from going electric with important gas and maintenance savings.
Police patrol vehicles fit that use case.
After a year of investigating, the Sykesville Police Department said that it decided to go with the Model Y because it fit its requirements as a patrol vehicle:
The Town of Sykesville has purchased a Tesla Model Y as our next addition to the Sykesville Police patrol fleet. The decision was made after a year of investigation into the reliability, cost, and effectiveness of fully electric vehicles being incorporated into police operations in other jurisdictions. The Model Y was selected due to it meeting internal space requirements that would accommodate a police officer, patrol equipment, and the potential transport of detainees.
But the difference-maker over other options was the cost of ownership over time.
It was between Tesla Model Y and Dodge Durango. The former is about $13,000 more expensive than the latter, but the police department is expecting massive cost of ownership savings:
With those savings, the Model Y will make more sense financially within just three years:
Though the upfront cost is higher, by year three the Tesla Model Y will have already offset the difference in the increased initial purchase and will begin saving the Town more money over the useful life in the patrol fleet which is estimated to be between 10-12 years. Upfitting costs for the vehicles for lights, sirens, and radios are not listed as they are similar totals. However, most of the. equipment to upfit the Model Y was generously donated by Major Police Supply (based out of New Jersey), whose national sales manager is a Sykesville resident, thus providing additional savings to the Town.
This logic is consistent with what several other police departments have found and recently – Tesla has even posted its own findings from its Model 3 test program as a police patrol car in the UK.

2022/02/24,"Ford’s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Farley, recently spoke during a virtual auto tech conference held by Wolfe Research, in which he spoke about Ford’s plans for the future. During the webcast, the Ford CEO specifically named Tesla and NIO as its biggest competitors, vowing to beat them. He also denied previously reported rumors about Ford’s plans for spinoffs to increase value.
Ford Motor Company remains a global household name in autos, having helping start a paradigm shift in transportation back in 1908 with the famed Model T. As one of the leaders in automotive manufacturing, the company has made hardened efforts in recent years to transition its production practices to support the inevitable EV revolution already transpiring.
Ford has found early success with its Mustang Mach-E and has over 200,000 reservations for its upcoming F-150 Lightning pickup. In addition to a slew of new EVs on the way, Ford is building out EV support for commercial customers, as well as energy management solutions for consumers at home, similar technology to Tesla’s Powerwall.
Ford wasn’t always so gung-ho about EV adoption, and Tesla certainly helped spark the fire under its American competitor’s seat. If Ford is a parent in the global automotive house, Tesla is the angsty teenager that kicked the door in with its new ways of thinking about EVs over combustion. A decade and a half of innovation has skyrocketed the company to a title as the largest automaker by market cap, delivering vehicles all over the globe including Europe and China.
One of Tesla’s largest competitors in China is not Ford (although it does sell EVs there), but NIO – one of the leading EV automakers in the country, which has now begun its expansion to other markets in Europe. 
This includes Norway and Germany to begin, although the automaker has shared intentions to provide services in 25 countries and regions by 2025, including Western Europe, Australia, and the United States. NIO recently expanded its US headquarters, although it is still denying any immediate plans to enter the market to compete with Ford and Tesla on its own turf.
As both EV-specific automakers continue to find success around the globe, Ford is taking note – and its CEO has already recognized them as the two competitors to beat.
Ford’s CEO specifically mentioned both Tesla and NIO during a webcast of the Wolfe Research Virtual Global Auto, Auto Tech, and Mobility Conference. Here were his exact words:
We know our competition is NIO and Tesla, and we have to beat them, not match them.
That would be all Farley would comment about Ford’s two competitors, but as CnEVPost points out, this is Ford’s CEO second mention of both Tesla and NIO in the past two months. Farley complimented both automakers during an appearance on Yahoo Finance Live in January:
Well, the companies that I think about that I admire because of their commitment — and frankly, the hard work they did to earn their reputation — are companies like NIO and Tesla. They’ve been at this a long time. They engineer their vehicles differently. I’m most respectful of Tesla’s profitability. They’re now making more than $10,000 a vehicle in their second quarter earnings.
“Kill your idols,” as they say, because while Ford clearly respects the progress Tesla and NIO are making in the EV world, it certainly looks to surpass them. There’s more evidence of this from Ford’s Q4 earnings call earlier this month, in which Farley stated that if Ford were able to produce as many F-150 Lightning pickups as Tesla is producing Model Ys, it would, “rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the US market.”
In addition to sharing thoughts on Tesla and NIO, Farley also settled previously reported rumors from Bloomberg last week, claiming Ford is considering spinning out its EV and combustion businesses to garner Tesla-like value. 
Farley denied any plans for Ford to spin off any of its businesses, but instead talked about how Ford can still find success in ICE sales by increasing vehicle quality and lowering prices through decreased complexity. The Ford CEO again cited Tesla’s margins as a goal, stating it will need hire more people with expertise in advanced electrical architectures and the digital customer experiences.
Ford’s stock has recently seen a twenty-year high and the company has reached a market cap over $100 billion.

2022/02/24,"A new report claims that Tesla is starting work on building a new factory adjacent to Gigafactory Shanghai in order to double production capacity to two million cars annually.
Tesla currently operates two main factories, Tesla Fremont and Gigafactory Shanghai, and it has Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin slowly starting to ramp up production.
Those four projects alone should push Tesla’s production capacity beyond three million vehicles annually by the end of next year, but the automaker has much greater ambitions for this decade that will require several more factories. The company recently confirmed that it plans to announce a new location for a factory by the end of this year.
Last week, it was revealed that Tesla was receiving bids from different Chinese regions for a new factory in the country.
Now, Reuters reports that Tesla actually plans to stick to what it knows and build another factory adjacent to its existing one in Shanghai free trade zone:
Tesla Inc plans to start work on a new plant in Shanghai as soon as next month as part of a plan to more than double production capacity in China to meet growing demand for its cars in the country and export markets, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
As we reported yesterday, Tesla is also making additional investments into its existing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to increase production to one million units per year.
Now, the new factory  would bring Tesla’s overall capacity in Shanghai to two million, according to the report:
Once the new plant is fully operational, Tesla will have the capacity to produce up to two million cars per year at its expanded Shanghai facility, the company’s main export hub, according to the people, who asked not to be identified in discussing still-private plans.
Tesla has had a lot of success in Shanghai with the factory starting production within a year of breaking ground and volume production came soon after. CATL, the world’s largest battery cell manufacturer and a Tesla supplier, is also building a giant factory in Shanghai, which is likely going to support this expansion.
Tesla China has yet to comment on the report.
While the report is still unconfirmed, it would make a lot of sense. Everything went so well in Shanghai the first time – it would make sense to try to replicate that success.
I assume the main problem is going to be hiring. Going to another region would have given easier access to another talent pool, and now, Tesla has to dip back into the Shanghai talent pool or convince more people to move to the region.
Either way, if it turns out to be true, I think it was likely the safest decision in order to increase production capacity as fast as possible.

2022/02/24,"When Tesla introduced the controversial yoke steering wheel, CEO Elon Musk surprised many when he said that the automaker didn’t even plan to offer the option for a regular round steering wheel.
According to an update in the latest software, it looks like Tesla might be changing its mind on that front.
When Tesla unveiled the new Model S with the “yoke” butterfly steering wheel, it was controversial. Some were worried about the actual shape of the wheel being problematic, while others were concerned about the lack of drive stalk to choose the drive mode.
As for the former, we thought that the automaker wouldn’t risk bringing the controversial yoke steering wheel to market without a nonlinear steering curve enabled by a steer-by-wire system – especially knowing that Tesla has been developing a steer-by-wire system.
However, as Tesla started deliveries of the new Model S Plaid last year, we were surprised to see that the wheel had a normal 14.0:1 steering ratio, and it is proving to be impractical at lower speeds. 
As someone who has been driving on icy roads all of my life (Quebec born and bred), I can see it be a real problem for some maneuvers to regain controls in some slips. pic.twitter.com/ybJ5DOKRjJ
There are even some driving scenarios where the butterfly not only becomes impractical but potentially dangerous.
For example, if you lose control on an icy road, it could be harder to do some quick maneuvers to regain control.
CEO Elon Musk later confirmed that Tesla is indeed working on progressive steering, but it’s still years away. 
As for the lack of stalks, Tesla replaced all their functions with force touch buttons on the wheel, even for things like turn signals and the horn. Musk’s logic is that “all input is an error,” and that the car should automatically perform all the functions that were on the stalks (now on the force touch buttons).
However, the capability is not quite there yet, especially when it comes to the horn, and Tesla has been quite stubborn when it comes to the yoke steering wheel. Despite several Model S Plaid prototypes spotted with regular steering wheels, the automaker has refused to offer it as an option.
But over the last few weeks, we have seen signs of Tesla starting to crack on the yoke steering wheel.
First off, a Model S prototype with a regular horn was spotted last month.
And now, Tesla hacker “green” spotted in an update to Tesla’s service tools a mention of a steering wheel swap with the option for “Yoke” or ‘”Round”:
pic.twitter.com/AuYv55iayJ
While the service is not available yet, it looks like a good indicator that Tesla is planning to offer Model S and Model X owners to swap for a regular round wheel.
However, it doesn’t look like the stalks are coming back as Musk is still betting on “all input is an error.“

2022/02/23,"Elon Musk is ramping up his fight with the SEC saying that he has been “building a case” against the agency and that he “didn’t start the fight,” but he “will finish it.”
Tesla is stuck in the crossfire.
The situation between the SEC, Elon Musk, and Tesla appears to be escalating after a lawyer for Musk reached out to the court with some serious allegations about some kind of vendetta that they claim the Security and Exchange Commission has against them. 
Musk and the SEC have had a few run-ins with each other, rarely with a good outcome. Most famously, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk over his infamous “funding secured” comment regarding his failed attempt to take Tesla private back in 2018. 
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) judged that Musk exaggerated when saying that the funding was “secured”:
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Musk went on a campaign against the SEC, calling them names and claiming that they were working for people shorting the electric automaker. But ultimately, Tesla and Musk ended up reaching a settlement with the SEC.
As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down from the role of chairman of the board, and both Tesla and Musk had to each pay $20 million in fines. 
The CEO presumably didn’t want Tesla to have to pay for his issue with the SEC. While he couldn’t directly pay for Tesla’s part of the fine, he decided to buy $20 million worth of shares from Tesla. That way, he sort of indirectly ended up paying for Tesla’s fine – though he also ended up with ~71,000 additional Tesla shares in the process.
As we previously reported, Musk ended up actually making money from the settlement due to Tesla’s stock price surging.
Another part of the settlement was that Musk and Tesla had to agree for the former to have his tweets reviewed by the latter’s legal department if they are material to the company. Despite the settlement, Musk didn’t change his use of his popular Twitter account with over 74 million followers and has remained defiant when it comes to the SEC.
As for the SEC, it reportedly sent several inquiries to Tesla about Musk’s use of Twitter when it relates to potentially material information.
Last week, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, sent a letter to the court to request an audience to discuss what he described as the SEC’s “harassment” of Tesla and Musk. He also claims that the SEC has yet to distribute the $40 million settlement money to shareholders.
The SEC quickly denied the allegations of harassment and claimed that a plan for distributing the money was going to be submitted to the court next month and the delay is due to the complexity.
But then Spiro claimed this week that the SEC leaked information about an ongoing investigation in reprisal to him contacting the court.
Now Musk himself has commented on the back and forth and he is not mincing his words.
The CEO says that he has been building a case against the agency:
Building a case is exactly what I’ve been doing
Then he ramped it up a notch and said that he “didn’t start the fight,” but he plans on “finishing it”:
I didn’t start the fight, but I will finish it.
He didn’t elaborate on how he plans on finishing the fight, but the back and forth between Musk’s lawyer and the SEC are expected to lead to a new audience with the court.

2022/02/23,"Early Tesla vehicles still equipped with 3G modems are starting to lose connectivity as 3G networks are shutting down, but there are still ways around it.
From the start, Tesla has made sure that its vehicles all come with an internet connection.
It was important for Tesla to deliver some connectivity features, but it was also essential for the automaker to collect data from its fleet, which proved super useful for the progress of its Autopilot system and now its Full Self-Driving Capability package.
That’s why Tesla included internet connectivity on all vehicles since the release of the Model S in 2012.
However, early Model S vehicles (pre-June 2015) were equipped with a 3G modem, and now 3G networks are starting to come offline as some cellular companies only support LTE during the move to 5G.
In a letter to affected owners, Tesla warns about the change, which is starting to affect owners:
As of February 22, 2022, your Model S will lose cellular connectivity when AT&T discontinues its 3G network. To maintain certain mobile and in-car capabilities that require data usage, upgrade to an LTE-capable modem. Without an upgraded modem, you will not be able to:
To schedule your modem upgrade for $200 USD plus tax, select Schedule Service > Upgrades & Accessories > LTE Upgrade from your Tesla app.
The $200 upgrade might sound like a lot, but those vehicles are included on Tesla’s Premium Connectivity service for life, so it’s definitely worth the upgrade.
However, if you don’t want to, you can always use your phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot.
Last year, Tesla pushed a software update that allows users to keep the Wi-Fi connectivity on when in drive, which enabled the use of your phone’s Wi-Fi hot spot.
This can be a solution, but it won’t enable remote control of the vehicle, since you want to use that when you (and your phone) or not with the car.
I have a 2012 Model S that is still awesome. I haven’t had the LTE upgrade yet because the 3G networks in Canada are supposed to still be around for a few more years.
However, Tesla still sent me that warning.
Hopefully, the contracts with the networks in Canada are still going, but I think I’ll pay for the upgrade. With Premium Connectivity included, I think it’s worth it.

2022/02/23,"Tesla announced a new investment to expand production at Gigafactory Shanghai on the road to achieving a production capacity of 1 million electric cars per year at the factory.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk disclosed that Gigafactory Shanghai has now surpassed Fremont Factory in production capacity, and Tesla has made the Chinese factory its new main export hub.
When Tesla first announced plans for Gigafactory Shanghai, the automaker made it clear that it doesn’t plan to export cars out of China, but the plan changed earlier this year after production ramped up.
Shanghai went from beginning construction in December 2018 to starting production in December 2019.
Within just two years of starting production, it is now the biggest/most productive electric vehicle factory in the world by a wide margin.
It finished 2021 with an annualized production rate of over 800,000 vehicles, and it appears to still be growing.
This week, Tesla filed with the local city government new documents for an expansion of its parts production that will involve growing its workforce and adding a shift on some equipment (via Reuters):
Tesla Inc plans to expand parts production at its Shanghai factory to meet growing demand for exports, according to a document it filed with the city government. The automaker will add production workshops, increase the number of workers and lengthen the time equipment is operational, the document.
The actual production numbers and number of new hires were redacted from the documents filed with the city this week.
This new investment in expanding production at the factory comes after another $200 million investment in November.
At the time, Tesla was talking about having 15,000 employees at Gigafactory Shanghai and planning to hire 4,000 more.
Musk has previously said that he sees a potential for the factory to produce over 1 million vehicles per year.
CATL, Tesla’s main battery cell supplier in China, is building a battery factory near Gigafactory Shanghai, which is expected to help accelerate production.

2022/02/22,"Elon Musk said that Tesla is working to make Steam’s library of video games work on its onboard vehicle computer.
Tesla has been working to expand its presence in the video game space.
As we previously reported, Tesla has a team of software engineers working on video games in Seattle, and they recently started building a similar team in Austin.
The automaker has been building a video game platform called Tesla Arcade inside its vehicles, and it has been working with video game studios to port games to it.
Right now, it is mainly to create some added value to its ownership experience, but Tesla might have bigger plans for gaming inside its vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been indicating recently that he believes “entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves,” which he thinks Tesla can achieve later this year.
In preparation for that, the automaker has been releasing more video games in its Tesla Arcade, and it has indicated that it might turn it into a business.
We have seen indications that Tesla plans to offer paid packages of different video games inside its vehicles, which would start to get into the same business as Valve’s Steam, the Playstation Store, or the Xbox Live store.
Now Musk announced on Twitter today that Tesla is working to make Steam’s library of games work directly on Tesla’s software instead of porting specific games:
We’re working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles. Former is obviously where we should be long-term.
In the Twitter thread, Musk reiterated his goal to make Cyberpunk, a demanding game graphic-wise, work on the upcoming Cybertruck.
Tesla has recently deployed a new entertainment computer in the Model S and Model X that is geared toward video games.
With the unveiling of new Model S and Model X, Tesla has announced a new gaming computer inside the vehicles:
Up to 10 teraflops of processing power enables in-car gaming on-par with today’s newest consoles via Tesla Arcade. Wireless controller compatibility allows gaming from any seat.
A known chip leaker, Patrick Schur posted a diagram of Tesla’s new gaming computer powered by the AMD Navi 23 GPU:
The system is integrated and connects directly to two touchscreens inside the Model S and Model X to play games, watch entertainment, and perform some other functions:
CEO Elon Musk also revealed that the new computer has more storage space to be able to handle more games on the platform at the same time.
The website videocardz compared the specs with existing consoles from the latest generation – showing that it does indeed match up well based on the specs available:
Tesla is expected to leverage this new hardware to expand its in-car video gaming experience.

2022/02/22,"Today, Tesla was granted a patent for a new automatic tire inflation system enabling to adjust tire pressure in real-time in the upcoming Tesla Semi electric truck.
We reported on Tesla applying for a patent on the technology back in 2018 – shortly after the automaker unveiled the Tesla Semi electric truck. While Tesla didn’t specify if it will be designed for cars or trucks in the patent application, the inventor listed on the filing, John Furtado, has been working on the Tesla Semi program for Tesla.
He was specifically working on “brakes, brake controls, pneumatics, wheel ends, wheels and tires” for the Tesla Semi. The engineer left Tesla soon after submitting this patent to go work for his former employer Daimler Trucks, but he more recently came back to Tesla.
Many military vehicles and heavy workhorse trucks use Automatic Tire Inflation Systems (ATIS) in order to manage tire pressure and optimize driving on different surfaces.
Here’s a video of the Mercedes Unimog’s ATIS system:
However, Tesla describes “shortcomings” of existing systems in the original patent application:
These prior solutions had a number of shortcomings. With some prior art techniques, air was fed through hollow drive axles to a fitting located on the end thereof. The fitting was then coupled to the air inlets of the tires. To couple the air into the hollow drive axles, a rotatingly attached fitting coupled air from an air storage to the inside of the hollow axles. This fitting was subject to leakage of contaminants. These contaminants interfered with the operation of the ATIS and eventually caused the ATIS to fail.
In order to overcome those shortcomings, Tesla instead describes a more intelligent system with valves, bearings, and a rotary air seal.
The automaker wrote in the patent application:
An Automatic Tire Inflation System (ATIS) for use with a vehicle according to a first described embodiment includes a controller, valves controlled by the controller, the valves having an air supply inlet, and a plurality of air outlets. Further the ATIS includes, for at least one drive axle having inner bearings and outer bearings, a channel formed in a spindle, first hosing coupling a valve of the valves controlled by the controller to the channel formed in the spindle, a channel formed in a hub, a rotary air seal residing between the inner bearings and the outer bearings and coupling the channel formed in the spindle to the channel formed in the hub, and second hosing coupling the channel formed in the hub to at least one wheel.
Thus, as compared to the prior ATIS systems, the ATIS of the first embodiment, significantly reduces contamination in the ATIS air stream. Reduction in contamination extends the life of the ATIS, extends spindle life, extends hub life, and extends serviced wheel/tire lives and extends maintenance intervals.
Here are a few drawings from the full patent application:
Today, the United States Patent and Trademark Office officially granted Tesla a patent for its version of an ATIS system.
It’s important to note that not all technologies that companies seek to secure with patents end up in commercial products.
Tesla has yet to fully unveil the production version of the Tesla Semi, but it did recently release images of four new trucks.

2022/02/22,"Tesla has launched the Model Y in the United Kingdom and several other right-hand-drive markets as the electric SUV is solidifying its position as the most popular EV in the world.
Originally, the Model Y was only supposed to launch in Europe after Tesla started production at Gigafactory Berlin.
However, Tesla changed its plan and started importing Model Y vehicles from Gigafactory Shanghai to some European markets, but not yet to the UK and a few other right-hand-drive markets in Europe.
In October, Tesla started to take orders for the Model Y in the UK starting at £54,990 for the Long Range All-Wheel-Drive for deliveries in “early 2022.”
Tim Findlay, Tesla’s market leader for the UK and Ireland, announced that deliveries of the Model Y have started in the UK, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland (via LinkedIn):
The UK has become an important market for Tesla over the years.
Tesla had record sales in the United Kingdom in 2021, and the new car registration data shows that it helped the country reach a new electric market share milestone: over 10% of the auto market for the first time.
The automaker delivered over 34,000 Model 3 vehicles in the country – almost three times as many as the second best-selling EV in the market.
The Model Y is likely going to be as popular or even more popular than the Model 3 in the UK, as has been the case in other markets.
It is going to be interesting to see how many Model Y vehicles Tesla can deliver in the coming months – though the real volume is expected to come with the start of deliveries from Gigafactory Berlin, which is still an uncertainty, as we reported today.
Interestingly, Tesla has used the ‘Tesla Bot,’ or now known as ‘Optimus,’ as part of the marketing of the launch of the Model Y in the UK:
Elon Musk recently said ‘Tesla is prioritizing the product development of the Optimus humanoid robot in 2022‘ over other products, including its new vehicles.

",tesla
2022/02/22,"Tesla has been spotted gathering hundreds of Model Y vehicles outside of Gigafactory Berlin – indicating that production is advancing.
However, the regulatory approval to officially start production for customer deliveries is still uncertain.
Gigafactory Berlin, a critical new factory for Tesla’s plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency, has been in limbo for months.
The automaker has yet to secure the needed environmental permit to start producing vehicles for customer deliveries.
Last month, Tesla confirmed that it built the first few Model Ys at Gigafactory Berlin at the end of 2021.
The automaker also received approval to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin ahead of the final approval by the state of Brandenburg.
Tesla said it needed to conduct more tests of its production process.
Those tests seem to be working as Tesla has now been spotted rolling out hundreds of Model Y vehicles from Gigafactory Berlin in a new drone flyover of the plant:
It looks like Tesla is now achieving significant production of the new Model Y in Germany, which is both positive and negative.
When, or if, Tesla receives approval, it will be able to achieve higher production volumes faster, but in the meantime, having this kind of operation at Gigafactory Berlin without creating any revenue is quite costly.
Tesla is investing hundreds of millions in producing those vehicles, and it’s not getting anything out of them now.
If it continues that way without approval, it will start to be a big strain on its income statement.
On the other side, it’s also making Germany look bad for businesses as Tesla’s experience is going to serve as a warning about the country’s bureaucracy, which is becoming a real issue for the new factory project.
Right now, one of the main holdups in the environmental approval appears to be related to water supply.
Tesla had to revise several times its water supply plan as the region is suffering from failing groundwater.
However, Brandenburg Economy Minister Joerg Steinbach said that the situation is manageable for the first phase (Model Y production) of the factory:
The current water supply is sufficient for the first stage of the factory. Once Tesla expands the site, we’ll need more.
Tesla currently plans to use 1.4 million cubic meters of water annually – or the equivalent of the demand for a town of around 40,000 people.
The region is expected to dig more wells to try to compensate for the reduction in groundwater.
In the meantime, it’s still not clear when Tesla could receive its environmental approval for the state to officially start production and deliveries from Gigafactory Berlin.

2022/02/21,"Tesla is using its community platform to ask fans in Oklahoma and Mississippi to help defeat new bills that could be used to ban direct sales of electric cars.
To this day, there are still some states that prevent Tesla and other automakers from selling directly to consumers.
This is because of old laws put in place to protect franchise dealerships against automakers trying to compete with the people who invested a lot of money into providing a sale and service workforce for them. It made a lot of sense.
But now, those same laws are being used to prevent Tesla and other new automakers who never had franchise dealerships from competing against dealers who sell vehicles from other automakers.
It is being used in an anti-competitive way.
Several states have changed those direct sale laws in order to avoid this misuse that gave a monopoly on car sales to third-party dealers, but they are still some misuses out there and efforts from dealers associations, which have a lot of power in state politics, to outlaw direct sales.
Through its new ‘Tesla Engage‘ social platform, Tesla is asking its fanbase to fight to bills in Oklahoma and Mississippi that could block direct sales of electric vehicles.
In Oklahoma, the state’s House Business and Commerce Committee is considering House Bill 3994, which would prevent any automaker from operating service or deliveries of cars regardless of if they never had franchise dealers before.
Tesla argues that the bill could even force Tesla to shut down its locations in the state:
If passed, this bill could force Tesla to close its existing locations in Oklahoma AND prevent Tesla from shipping cars to anyone in the state, which would force locals to travel out-of-state to service their cars or pick up their new Tesla vehicles. Oklahoma should focus on increasing revenue and jobs in the state, not stifling competition and limiting consumer choice.
The automaker is asking fans to contact their representative to let them know that they oppose the bill. 
This effort comes just after Oklahoma pulled out the red carpet for Tesla in trying to convince the automaker to build a factory in the state.
In Mississippi, where Tesla only operates one store, the automaker faced a similar effort with Senate Bill 2836 last month and asked fans to oppose it.
For now, it looks like the bill is not surviving the Senate Finance Committee.

2022/02/21,"Reports in Germany state that regulators are investigating Tesla Autopilot’s auto lane change feature, which may be considered illegal in Europe.
Over the years, Tesla owners in Europe have had a less extensive version of Autopilot than owners in other markets because regulators have been limiting it.
Auto Lane Change was one of the features included in Autopilot for a long time until Tesla moved it to its more expensive ‘Full Self-Driving’ package.
It enables Tesla vehicles to automatically change lanes on highways when Autopilot is activated.
Now the feature is apparently drawing attention from regulators in Europe.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) told Bild am Sonntag via (Stern):
The KBA has initiated an investigation into an electronic lane change function in the Tesla autopilot. This function, which the US automaker offers as an accessory in some of its models, “may not be permitted in Europe,” said a KBA spokesman for “Bild am Sonntag”.
It is not entirely clear what is their issue with the feature specifically beyond claiming that it “might not be legal in Europe.
The german road authority said that it is both in contact with Tesla and the Dutch vehicle registration authority RDW, which is in charge of the broader regulatory approval of Tesla vehicles in Europe.
This is only the latest in a series of crackdowns on Autopilot in Germany.
In 2020, Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving claims were judged ‘misleading’ by a German court.
But in this case, it sounds like the German authorities are seeking to get the RDW involves, which could affect all Autopilot users in Europe.

2022/02/21,"Elon Musk says that Tesla is moving its plan to build a “diner and drive-in theater” at a Supercharger station in Santa Monica, California, to a new, undisclosed location in Hollywood.
It’s also not going to be a “retro-looking” one but a “futuristic” diner apparently.
In 2018, Elon Musk said that Tesla plans to open an “old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in Los Angeles.” It was yet another, “Is he joking?” kind of Elon Musk idea, but he apparently wasn’t kidding.
A few months later, Tesla actually applied for building permits for “a restaurant and Supercharger station” at a location in Santa Monica. However, the project has since stalled, apparently due to local regulations.
Nevertheless, Tesla still moved forward with a Supercharger at the location, as this part of Los Angeles really needs more Supercharger stations.
Last year, we reported on construction plans revealing that Tesla was planning a large, 62-stall Supercharger V3 station at the location. 
When the project was approved in April 2021, Musk again said that Tesla still was aiming to build a 1950s diner at the location even though it wasn’t in the actual construction plans.
Tesla started construction in January 2022, and now the first phase is already in operation.
An Electrek reader sent us a few pictures:
There’s no diner at the location – though Tesla let a food truck park in the lot.
There’s also another bigger lot on the other side of the Supercharger station that Tesla has acquired.
It will feature more chargers and a small building with amenities.
Here’s what it looks like right now:
Again, the “old school diner” with drive-in movie theater announced by Musk is not in the construction plans of that section either.
But when commenting on the opening of the new Santa Monica station, Musk announced that the plan has now moved to the “Hollywood area”:
And futuristic diner / drive-in theater planned for Hollywood area!
Tesla currently only has one Supercharger station planned for Hollywood, and the map says that it is targeting an opening in Q2 2022:
The pin is currently on Santa Monica Boulevard between Kings Road and Flores Street where there’s a small parking lot and a few businesses:
However, those pins don’t always indicate the exact locations of Supercharger stations but only that Tesla is planning one in the general area.
Musk also changed the adjectives around the project from “retro-looking” to now “futuristic.”
The CEO also said that Tesla would accept Dogecoin for payment at the new diner.
Tesla recently started accepting Dogecoin for payment on some items in its Merch store.

2022/02/18,"We got our Tesla Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive, estimated range of 267 miles, in June 2021. Last autumn, we took it on its first long voyage – 10 hours round trip to Florida. It did great, so when it came time to head cross country with our two cats from Florida to New Hampshire over three days, we decided to give it a go. Here’s how it went!
We undertook this mammoth drive because we’ve moved to New England. (Yes, we know it’s cold. No, we don’t care. We like it here.) Movers took the bulk of our stuff, and we pared our car gear down to the essentials. We put valuables – jewelry, important documents, and a fragile Victorian skeleton clock – in our frunk and shared a large suitcase that we put in the trunk, along with winter coats and boots, and cat paraphernalia. Like babies, cats travel with a lot of stuff. 
Driving with two cats was initially a bit of a quandary, as the Model 3’s backseat isn’t big enough for larger animal carriers, and cats can’t sit in small enclosed carriers for three days. So we put our cats in their beds, buckled them in using retractable car seatbelts that clipped to their harnesses, and hoped for the best.
To our relief, our cat-transport strategy worked great. We have white seats in our Model 3. Seth Weintraub, Electrek‘s publisher, told me when I was about to order our Model 3 that white Tesla seats wipe clean like a charm. He knows because he’s got kids and a big dog and cats as well. So we chose white, and he was right. Just to make sure, we put wipe-clean mats on the seats, and they came out unscathed. We also have rubber floor mats, which were handy for when the cats needed to use the litter box (when they gotta go, they gotta go). Here’s what our cats looked like in the backseat:
They didn’t love being in the car, but they weren’t distressed, either. They slept 95% of the time, and we breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the trip that there were no feline disasters.
What I learned: The Tesla Model 3 is a bit tight space-wise for a big road trip like this, but it’s doable. The seats are comfortable, and it’s animal-transport friendly. A big win. You don’t need an SUV to do this big East Coast drive comfortably.
Tesla’s in-car Trip Planner makes any road trip easy. On the first day, we mapped from Clearwater, Florida, to Smithfield, North Carolina, where we stayed overnight in a hotel. (Next to the Supercharger. And a Dunkin Donuts. Because coffee.)
On day two, we drove from Smithfield to Chester County, Pennsylvania, where we stayed overnight with family. The car did a great job directing us through Washington, DC, traffic on a Friday afternoon. If you’ve ever driven in DC traffic, then you know that it’s not for the faint hearted. But all we had to do was look at our screen and listen carefully to voice directions. We didn’t miss a single turn or exit, even right in the heart of the city and heavy traffic.
On day three, we took a slightly different approach. Tesla wanted to take us straight through Manhattan. I lived in New York City for six years, and despite it being familiar territory, that was not my preferred route. So instead, we navigated to Tarrytown, New York, thus bypassing Manhattan, crossing the George Washington Bridge and skipping the Bronx. That’s not much fun, either, but it was better than Manhattan. So we kind of forced it to reroute us, and that worked fine. Once we left Tarrytown, we reset the route planner to Hanover, New Hampshire, and it was a straight, uncomplicated shot to New England.
What I learned: Your car, for the most part, will get you from point A to B efficiently. Like with the Manhattan rerouting experience, sometimes you have to route from stop to stop, rather than to your final destination, to force a route you want, but it was easy. 
Performance-wise, everything in the car worked fine, bar about five minutes where the screen froze and then rebooted itself while we were driving through South Carolina in the dark. It was a bit unnerving, but we knew what was happening. We also knew how to manually reboot the computer if necessary – hold down both scroll buttons on the steering wheel until it reboots – and knew it could be done while driving.
(We didn’t use Autopilot. Don’t shout at me in the comments. We prefer to drive the car ourselves. We also don’t have Full-Self-Driving.)
The overall Supercharging experience is great, period. People ask whether it’s annoying to have to stop for anywhere from 15 minutes to a half hour, and it’s not. It’s better to be able to walk, stretch, go to the bathroom, and get food and drinks. Plus, charging never held us up; it just encouraged us to do what we should do anyway. We never had to wait for charging to finish.
My Favorite Supercharger Award goes to Mount Laurel, right on the New Jersey Turnpike. It had clean bathrooms, Starbucks, a variety of food choices, was easily spotted from the road, and featured plenty of bays with no wait. (In fact, we never had to wait our turn to charge the entire trip.)
The Most Eccentric Tesla Supercharger Award goes to Summerton, South Carolina. It was easily spotted from the ramp, thanks to the red glow of the chargers since it was nighttime, but they sat next to a Stuckey’s that looked (and smelled) like it hadn’t been updated since 1956. We sat in the car eating snacks, listening to frogs, and watching stray cats run around the parking lot. It did the job, as it had a bathroom and drinks, but it was a little weird.
Cost-wise, the drive was free for us, because we had referral miles. Gas prices were all over $3.50 a gallon, so our trip, even if we’d paid for charging, still would have cost less than if we’d been driving a gas car.
What I learned: Tesla Supercharging is a seamless, easy experience that doesn’t delay your road trip. We got great range overall, never got anywhere near running out of charge, and set the speed limit to 80 mph so we didn’t get pulled over for speeding. (The car dinged us for coming close to 80 mph about 50 times, so clearly we needed that limit.)
However, there are two things that I’d really like to see Tesla do, going forward.
One, I’d love to see Tesla Superchargers under solar canopies. Then, you’d know you were charging with clean energy, and they’d also be easier to spot.
Which leads me to the only thing that we found annoying: the lack of signage directing Tesla drivers to Superchargers. Sure, your car directs you to the Superchargers. But more often than not, we had to play Easter egg hunt, because the car doesn’t tell you exactly where they are, and it’s not always intuitive to find them. 
If Tesla would install signage at the interstate exit, and then more signs with arrows directing you to the actual Supercharger, that would make a huge difference. They’re almost always tucked way in the back of wherever, and more than once we ended up bickering and driving in circles because we couldn’t find them. I had to do Google Image searches to discover that, “Oh, they’re behind the Hardee’s, not the barbecue joint, like the Tesla website wrongly says.” 
Flag Superchargers with big signs, Tesla, and it’ll boost the brand and the visibility, and thus confidence in the Tesla-curious yet range anxious, that there really are places to charge. The red glow helps, but if Superchargers were coupled with signs, it would make a huge difference. If McDonald’s can get the attention of motorists with giant telescopic signs hundreds of feet in the air, then Tesla can install some signs, too.

2022/02/18,"Tesla has announced that it has produced 1 million of its next-generation 4680 battery cell at its pilot factory in California.
The announcement comes as Tesla is expected to start deliveries of its new Model Y equipped with its 4680 cell and structural battery pack.
In 2020, Tesla unveiled its new 4680 battery cell, a new tabless cylindrical cell in a much bigger format that the company claimed produces six times the power and five times the energy capacity while significantly reducing the cost.
Since the unveiling, Tesla has been producing the 4680 cells at a “pilot production facility” in Fremont and deploying large-scale production at other factories, including Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
While Tesla is calling it a “pilot factory,” the automaker had announced a goal to produce 10 GWh of battery cells at the plant, which is more than many other full-scale battery cell factories.
Last month, Tesla’s SVP of engineering, Drew Baglino, said that Tesla was making “meaningful progress” in ramping production at the pilot plant, but he didn’t confirm the production capacity.
Now Tesla has announced that it has produced its one-millionth 4680 cell at the Kato road facility in January:
Celebrating our one millionth 4680 cell in January pic.twitter.com/d19IPFu18u
It’s not exactly clear from the phrasing, but it sounds like, as of January, Tesla has produced 1 million 4680 cells.
Unfortunately, that doesn’t give us much information, since the current production rate is the most important metric to know what kind of vehicle production Tesla can achieve from the capacity coming from the pilot plant.
At roughly 1,000 cells per car, 1 million cells is enough for about 1,000 Model Y vehicles to be produced at Gigafactory Texas.
That’s not enough, but if Tesla is able to produce 100,000 4680 cells per week, it would enable the production of 100 Model Y vehicles per week, which would be a good start as the 4680 cells ramps up parallel to Model Y production at the new factory.
Last month, Baglino also said that Tesla doesn’t expect 4680 cells to be a bottleneck for Model Y production ramp at Gigafactory Texas, and he said the company was also making progress in deploying larger scale 4680 cell production at the new factory.

2022/02/18,"Elon Musk’s Boring Company has submitted a proposal for a new 6-mile long Loop tunnel project in Miami. If approved, it would be the second of such full-scale commercial deployment of transportation system.
A Boring Company Loop system consists of tunnels in which Tesla electric vehicles travel at high speeds between stations to transport people within a city. The first deployment has been the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, which consists a 1.5-mile long tunnel with three stops at the city’s large convention center.
Recently, Las Vegas approved an expansion of the Loop to connect the entire strip and the airport. The Boring Company already completed the first part of the expansion to the first casino.
Once completed, it will become the first Loop to cover an entire city center. Now, the Boring Company is already working on its next Loop project and it’s in Miami.
The city has revealed talks with the company last year, but they have moved forward with an official proposal.
Insider reported on the new proposal for a 6.2-mile long Loop:
The North Miami Beach Loop would ferry Tesla vehicles between seven stations along State Road 826, between the Golden Glades Transit Center and Sunny Isles Beach at Newport Pier, according to the proposal, seen by Insider.
Here’s a map of the proposal with several potential extensions:
The cost of the project is estimated to be between $185 million and $220 million, which is a fraction of the cost of any other similar transportation system, like a subway.
North Miami Beach commissioner Michael Joseph commented on the proposal:
We have a lot of traffic congestion and this would be a way of alleviating a great deal of that traffic. 
The Boring Company says that it can complete the project in just three years, but that’s if the regulatory and permitting process is expedited. The city appears willing to move forward, but it is currently looking for funding from regional, state, and federal governments.
I think tunnels are an interesting solution to traffic issues, but I am still not convinced that the Boring Company’s Loop is the best way to implement a tunnel-based solution. Musk has been promising a full-scale simulation of how it would alleviate traffic for a long time, but he has yet to deliver it.
As for the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, we recently tested it at CES, the first big use case for it, and it was underwhelming. 
Obviously, a full city-wide implementation would be more useful, but I would have liked to have seen a simulation of one before a city moves forward with it.

2022/02/17,"Tesla has updated its smartphone app to version 4.6 adding some useful new features including actionable notifications and charging stats, and data-miners have found plans for an upcoming cheaper annual subscription to their Full Self-Driving and Premium Connectivity services.
But even with this upcoming cheaper subscription scheme, Tesla has so far shown no interest in ending its practice of charging owners $1k for hardware they already paid for.
Tesla recently added a new “Charge Stats” feature to the app, which allows owners to see how much they’re spending to fuel their car, and figure out how much they’ve saved compared to buying gasoline.
This new app update will also allow Tesla Insurance policyholders to submit claims from within the Tesla app.
The new update makes notifications actionable, allowing interaction without needing to open the app.
These notifications include climate control and charging notifications. For example, when you preheat or cool your car, it will notify you when it gets to the desired temperature, and you can turn the climate control off directly from the notification, without having to open the Tesla app. Same for charging, if you plug in and the car starts charging but you don’t want it to, you can tell it to stop from the notification. Here’s what it looks like:
(We encountered a few bugs when testing this feature for this article; we’re sure they’ll get worked out soon enough) 
Speaking of climate, Tesla also added some code to the app to allow remote activation of the formerly in-car-only “Climate Keeper” function. This allows long-term use of the car’s climate control systems, for example if you’re car camping and want to keep the car warm overnight. Remote activation isn’t active yet, but it looks like it should show up soon.
This feature was noticed by data miners and isn’t yet active in the app itself.
Currently Tesla charges $10 a month for “Premium Connectivity,” access to various in-car features like traffic visualization, satellite-view maps, and various other internet features. Without this subscription cars get navigation, but miss out on some other in-car features. Tesla also offers a monthly subscription to its “Full Self-Driving” software at a price of $199 a month.
In the 4.6 update, new code showed up suggesting these will be available as annual subscriptions soon. The new code clearly suggests that it will be possible to switch between monthly and annual subscriptions and states that there will be some sort of discount, though we don’t yet know how much that discount will be, or when the subscriptions will become available.
– Monthly and Annual plan strings– Ability to search shop – Subscriptions will be cheaper by the year And that's about it folks as always we'll update the thread if we find anything else! We are on track to hit 5k followers with this update, and we couldn't be more thankful. pic.twitter.com/es3P8ORXWq
As of yet, though, Tesla continues its policy of charging owners whose cars do not have the FSD Computer installed – cars built between late 2016 and mid 2019 – for hardware that they were told they already have.
When these cars were built, customers were promised that they had all the hardware for self-driving – a promise that’s still up on Tesla’s website to this day. But when Tesla started offering monthly subscriptions, the company told these owners that they need to pay an upgrade fee for new hardware, despite Tesla selling those cars with the promise that they wouldn’t need any additional hardware for self-driving.
We covered this controversy when annual subscriptions first came out, and Tesla responded – but not really. Originally the company was charging $1,500 for the upgrade, and it lowered the price to $1,000 after our story. However, the only acceptable price in this circumstance remains zero, given Tesla’s years of assurances that the hardware was already in the car at purchase time.
We suggested at the time that if Tesla – the largest automaker in the world by market cap which boasts an incredibly high automotive gross margin – really needed to pinch pennies on giving owners equipment they already bought, they could have required a minimum subscription time for the upgrade. This would stop people from trying out FSD for a month and canceling their plans, resulting in a mostly-unnecessary upgrade process for Tesla (which they promised wasn’t needed anyway).
So there’s an opportunity here. Now that Tesla is planning to offer annual subscriptions, perhaps they could waive the $1,000 upgrade charge for owners who buy into an annual subscription, which would at least partially fulfill the promise that it made to those customers over the course of three years.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/02/17,"Alex Spiro, Elon Musk’s lawyer, sent a letter to the SEC on behalf of Musk and Tesla arguing that the agency is “harassing” them and failed to transfer money to Tesla shareholders.
Musk and the SEC have had a few run-ins with each other, rarely with a good outcome. Most famously, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk over his infamous “funding secured” comment regarding his failed attempt to take Tesla private back in 2018. 
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) judged that Musk exaggerated when saying that the funding was “secured”:
Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Musk went on a campaign against the SEC, calling them names and claiming that they were working for people shorting the electric automaker. But ultimately, Tesla and Musk ended up reaching a settlement with the SEC.
As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down from the role of chairman of the board, and both Tesla and Musk had to each pay $20 million in fines. 
The CEO presumably didn’t want Tesla to have to pay for his issue with the SEC. While he couldn’t directly pay for Tesla’s part of the fine, he decided to buy $20 million worth of shares from Tesla. That way, he sort of indirectly ended up paying for Tesla’s fine – though he also ended up with ~71,000 additional Tesla shares in the process.
As we previously reported, Musk ended up actually making money from the settlement due to Tesla’s stock price surging.
Another part of the settlement was that Musk and Tesla had to agree for the former to have his tweets reviewed by the latter’s legal department if they are material to the company. Despite the settlement, Musk didn’t change his use of his popular Twitter account with over 74 million followers and has remained defiant when it comes to the SEC.
As for the SEC, it reportedly sent several inquiries to Tesla about Musk’s use of Twitter when it relates to potentially material information.
Now Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, sent a letter to the court to request an audience to discuss what he describes as the SEC’s “harassment” of Tesla and Musk. He also claims that the SEC has yet to distribute the $40 million settlement money to shareholders.
Spiro wrote in the letter:
We write to alert the Court to a pattern of conduct by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that has gone beyond the pale. Simply stated, the SEC has failed to comply with its promise to pay Tesla’s shareholders the $40 million it collected as part of the settlement in these cases and that it purports to be holding for them. Instead, it has been devoting its formidable resources to endless, unfounded investigations into Mr. Musk and Tesla. We are respectfully requesting that the Court schedule a conference to address why the SEC has failed to distribute these funds to shareholders but has chosen to spend its energy and resources investigating Mr. Musk’s and Tesla’s compliance with the consent decree by issuing subpoenas unilaterally, without Court approval.”
Musk and co. argue through Spiro that the agency has gone “wrong” when it comes to implementing the policing of Musk’s Twitter:
Despite the SEC’s inattention and dereliction when it comes to paying Tesla’s shareholders, it has been more than energetic in going after Mr. Musk and Tesla, largely to police Mr.Musk’s public pronouncements via Twitter. Mr.Musk and Tesla respectfully seek a course correction. The SEC has not once come before Your Honor to seek discovery concerning compliance under the consent decree. Instead, it has gone rogue and unilaterally opened its own investigations. The SEC has conducted these investigations wholly outside of this Court’s supervision. But this Court’s consent decree, by design and by its terms, regulates Mr.Musk and Tesla’s compliance, and they never agreed to a settlement that allows the SEC to issue subpoenas absent oversight and approval from this Court. If the SEC truly perceives non-compliance and can identify a good-faith basis, it must proceed before Your Honor. It is unsurprising that, despite he SEC’s serial investigations—some of which involved one investigation being closed only for another to be opened at the same time—there has been no finding of any wrongdoing.
Here’s the full letter:
[scribd id=559608902 key=key-OewY3eaSAdLLvcfAsJ3a mode=scroll]
That Alex Spiro is good. If you are a fan of a well-crafted argument, do yourself a favor and read that letter. He tears the SEC a new one in it. But as to whether or not he is in the right, I don’t know. We are too much in the legal weeds for me.
As for my personal opinion, for what’s it’s worth, I think the original problem that led to this settlement was a nothing burger. I seriously doubt that Musk was trying to mislead investors. He certainly jumped the gun and botched his disclosure of the early discussions about taking Tesla private, but that’s about it.
However, now years later, I think Musk’s use of Twitter has become more problematic, not less. I believe Musk should seriously rethink his use of the platform. But, do I think the SEC is the right entity to police his use of Twitter. Certainly not.

2022/02/17,"Dozens of new Tesla Model Y vehicles have been spotted apparently being prepped for deliveries at Gigafactory Texas. It looks like the deliveries of Tesla’s first structural battery pack vehicles are imminent.
Tesla recently confirmed that the first ‘builds’ of new Model Y vehicles were produced at the factory late last year. We also recently reported that Tesla is aiming to deliver those first new Model Ys produced at the plant by the end of the quarter, likely in March.
We have seen several hints that deliveries are indeed imminent in the last few weeks. Yesterday, we reported on videos from Tesla employees and contractors at Gigafactory Texas, showing the production lines and several Model Y vehicles in a prep area.
Now ,Jeff Roberts, who often flies his drone over Gigafactory Texas, spotted dozens of Model Y vehicles seemingly being lined up for transportation:
Production Model Ys ready for transport at Giga Texas! #Tesla #GigaTexas #ModelY pic.twitter.com/jEJSZs5fTi
It looks like almost 100 Model Y vehicles are ready for transport and more coming out of the factory.
At the end of last month, Tesla had yet to receive regulatory approval to start deliveries of those vehicles, but approval is believed to be imminent. As we previously reported, the start of Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas is not only critical to the company’s growth, but it also marks the launch of a new version of the electric SUV featuring Tesla’s new structural battery pack and 4680 battery cells.
The idea is to produce large cylindrical cells and package them into a single module battery pack that also acts as the structural platform on which you install the vehicle’s body. CEO Elon Musk has touted the technology as a “manufacturing revolution” in the auto industry.
Tesla has yet to reveal how the new architecture is going to affect the specs of the new version of the Model Y, but the details are expected to come out soon after the EPA and NHTSA approve the new version for deliveries to customers.

2022/02/17,"Tesla has launched a new automatic electric trunk for Model 3 as an aftermarket offered directly at service centers. The product is currently only available in China, but like most things Tesla these days, it starts in China and then it is expected to expand to other markets.
Before 2021, all Tesla vehicles had automatic trunk liftgates except for the Model 3. You had to use your own elbow grease power to open the trunk of the Model 3. I know, right? How dare they!
This has led to some Tesla owners going for aftermarket third-party products to have an automatic electric trunk, but these products need to be installed by the owner or a third-party shop, which is not ideal.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk actually said that the automaker was working to have service centers install power liftgates on Model 3s for people with disabilities. This was the first indication that Tesla actually planned to offer the service.
Now, Tesla is launching it as a product offered by its official service centers in China.
The automaker announced through its official Weibo account:
Tesla electric tailgate upgrade service official service, genuine parts, professional technician installation. The long-awaited electric tailgate upgrade for old car owners is here. Your voice, we are all listening carefully.  What after-sales upgrade services you hope Tesla will make available? Welcome to leave your suggestion.
Tesla also released a video about the process of getting the upgrade:
It costs the equivalent of $650 USD, and it can be ordered through the app like all other services. The upgrade is a bit more expensive than third-party products, but it does include installation.
It is currently only available in China, but like many new Tesla products and services, the company is often launching them first in China and later expanding the offer to other countries.

2022/02/17,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed that it opened an investigation into Tesla’s ‘phantom braking’ problem under Autopilot.
It’s an issue that owners have complained about for almost a year.
Back in November, Electrek released a report called ‘Tesla has a serious phantom braking problem in Autopilot.‘
It highlighted a significant increase in Tesla owners reporting dangerous phantom braking events on Autopilot.
Phantom braking is a term used to describe when an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) or a self-driving system applies the brakes for no good reason.
The system can be falsely detecting an object on the road or anticipating a collision that won’t actually happen and apply the brake to try to avoid it.
Obviously, phantom braking is something you want to avoid since it can create accidents if someone is following too closely behind you.
This issue is not new in Tesla’s Autopilot, but our report focused on Tesla drivers noticing an obvious increase in instances based on anecdotal evidence, but it was also backed by a clear increase in complaints to the NHTSA.
Our report made the rounds in a few other outlets, but it didn’t really go mainstream until now.
However, the Washington Post ended up picking the story up with a very similar report earlier this month that was more widely distributed.
At the time, NHTSA commented on the report saying that they were looking into the issue and talking to Tesla about it.
Today, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) confirmed that it opened an investigation into the matter.
NHTSA wrote in the investigation notice:
“The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has received 354 complaints alleging unexpected brake activation in 2021-2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Received over the past nine months, the reports have often been characterized as “phantom braking” by consumers. Tesla describes the subject vehicles as equipped with a suite of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features referred to as Autopilot which Tesla states will allow the vehicle to brake and steer automatically within its lanes.
The complaints allege that while utilizing the ADAS features including adaptive cruise control, the vehicle unexpectedly applies its brakes while driving at highway speeds. Complainants report that the rapid deceleration can occur without warning, at random, and often repeatedly in a single drive cycle.”
Interestingly, the agency says that the investigation focuses on 2021-2022 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
However, owners of older Model 3 and Model Y vehicles have also been reporting an increased number of phantom braking events, especially after the software update to vision-only Autopilot in May 2021.

2022/02/16,"Solar EV startup Aptera Motors posted a video that puts the beta version of its upcoming SEV against an alpha version, a Tesla Model 3, and an Audi R8 GT Spyder in a desert drag race. While it’s a very close race (for the Audi at least), the Aptera appears to just barely edge out the competition in a quarter-mile sprint. 
Aptera Motors is a San Diego-based startup that specializes in solar electric vehicles (SEVs). As the second iteration of the Aptera name, the company is continuously working to bring its flagship SEV donning the same nomenclature to market, updating the public every step of the way.
It has paid off so far too. After unveiling the Aptera SEV in late 2020, the company has gained a growing list of fans and reservation holders, many of whom claim both roles. 
Since its initial debut, the public has seen three different alpha versions of the Aptera complete with black, white, and metallic silver exteriors. Since announcing its entry into the beta phase, the company is been gearing up a move to a new 80,000 sq. foot facility slightly north in Carlsbad, California where the upcoming SEVs will be built.
In late January, the startup shared test track footage of the beta version SEV alongside word that Aptera production and deliveries were still on track to begin later this year. Some delivery windows have since been pushed, but Aptera has reiterated it remains on schedule for the start of production.
To further wet the beaks of those Aptera enthusiasts out there (we see you), the SEV automaker has shared its latest beta track footage, and this time it’s a drag race. That’s right, it’s Aptera versus Tesla, versus Audi. 
Aptera Motors recently shared its latest YouTube video, titled “drag race” which features a four-vehicle drag race complete with a photo finish. Contestants include: An Aptera Noir (alpha version), a Tesla Model 3, an Aptera beta, and an Audi R8 which appears to be the GT Spyder judging by its rear.
Let’s nip this in the bud before any Audi or Tesla diehards light the fuses of their comment cannons. Aptera provides zero details of the Tesla and Audi vehicles it is going up against. Judging by the chrome on the Model 3, it’s a model between 2017 and the 2020 refresh and might be a standard range with bricks in the trunk for all we know. 
The Audi is definitely an R8 because… first of all, it says it on the vanity plate, but it also has a unique back end that, despite the long quick shots, seems to relay it as a GT Spyder. If that is true, that would give the vehicle a 5.2 liter V10 engine (it just feels wrong typing those words on this site). 
Regardless of the exact trims we are looking at, the video footage tells us viewers Aptera means business with its beta SEV, followed by a desert dust chaser (you can almost hear the Tesla driver coughing it up). We will leave the video for you below to make your own judgment on who gets the checkered flag, but it sure seems like the Aptera beta, no? Have a closer look.
It’s tough to tell because the Audi is black and backlit, creating a longer shadow to decipher, but that Aggro Crag green sure sticks out… and it looks like it’s sticking out further than that R8, doesn’t it?
And imagine how many inches further along the Aptera would have been with its signature low drag frame on. A fully clothed Aptera is going to win any coefficient of drag race (sorry). 
Sure, this story could have a different ending under more controlled conditions complete with a Christmas tree and fully-automatic timing, but still… look at the beta go. It’s all for fun, and it’s fun to see. So give it a watch and see for yourself. 
If you’re impressed with Aptera, you can still reserve your own for $70 down.

2022/02/16,"We’ve heard for a while now that Tesla would be implementing an app store system to allow third parties to build functionality into the TeslaOS. Today we were tipped to an impressive rendering of what such an app store would look like, and it almost seems real.
The rendering comes via Twitter account @Deleetdesign, who tipped us to the app store concept. The man behind the account, Hans van de Bruggen, is a design author and has been building Tesla UX prototypes that are getting some notoriety. Check out his Youtube site for more Tesla concepts. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been hinting at an App Store since at least 2014 and most recently spoke about it in 2019 saying:
In order for it to be worthwhile for somebody to write an app, there has to be enough of an install base to warrant the effort. Even if you are going to port something, it’s still got to be worth the effort. As our number of vehicles grow, it starts to potentially makes more sense to develop games and other applications for Tesla. We just need a lot of cars.
What if Tesla had an app store? I put together this prototype to see what it might be like. What apps would you want to see?cc/ @tesla @elonmusk @Teslarati @ElectrekCo @InsideEVs pic.twitter.com/gPCD05JIvO
That install base certainly exists now with over 1 million “seats.” The latest software update V11 made a ton of important things harder to do, but it certainly looks like it could make an App Store easier.
While 1 million cars isn’t a huge base compared to iOS or Android, each of those machines is tied to someone with a great deal of buying power. Likewise, spending $20 on an iOS game might seem expensive, but if you are adding it to your car, it might make more sense. 
Then, if people are buying things on their car and investing in the Tesla ecosystem, maybe it starts to make sense to make a tablet for Tesla owners to take their apps into their homes. At the very least, TeslaOS makes Tesla a stickier platform (again like iOS or Android). Who wants to buy a Porsche and lose all of your Tesla games/apps.

2022/02/16,"The global spend on electric vehicle charging at home will exceed $16 billion in 2026, up from $3.4 billion in 2021, according to a new report by UK-based digital technology research firm Juniper Research.
UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.
This projected growth would be more than 390% over the next five years. It’s being driven by the lower cost (compared to public chargers) and convenience of home charging for EVs, according to researchers. 
They recommend in their study, “EV Charging: Key Opportunities, Challenges & Market Forecasts 2021-2026,” that charging vendors and auto manufacturers partner up to make home charging a central part of future EV adoption.
The report states that by 2026, over 21 million households globally will charge using a home wallbox, which would be a huge increase from just 2 million in 2021. Further, global hardware revenue from wallboxes will reach $5.5 billion in 2026, up from just $1.8 billion in 2021.
Researchers specifically suggest that auto retailers bundle wallboxes with vehicle purchases and EV charger manufacturers form partnerships with car manufacturers to accelerate EV and home charging adoption.
Research author Nick Maynard said: 
Wallboxes are convenient and lower cost than alternatives, with the onus being on both car manufacturers and governments to support home charging rollouts to secure the future of electric mobility.

To state the obvious, home EV charging is great if you have the means to do it. People who live in apartments or park on the street might not have access, and hopefully the charging industry can figure out a workaround. I suspect they will. 
Also, gas car drivers can’t fill up at home. This is yet another clear advantage EVs have over ICE cars. Even using a regular 120v outlet at home is a great perk of electric car ownership, despite its slowness. It worked for my family until I could sort out a faster solution with an electrician.

2022/02/16,"The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) announced that they are weighing potential penalties on Tesla for allegedly “overstating the range” of its electric vehicles. However, the reason for it is questionable, to say the least.
This week, the KFTC confirmed that it sent a report to Tesla claiming that the automaker exaggerated the range of some of its models, including Model 3, which it believes to be a violation of the “Act on Fair Labeling and Advertising.”
A KFTC official told Reuters:
We plan to hold a general meeting to review and determine the extent to which the automaker has violated the law and decide the level of sanctions.
Interestingly, the problem appears to be the drop in range in freezing temperature:
Tesla, on its website, says its Model 3 can travel 528 km (328 miles) on a single charge. The KFTC says however that the range may fall short of that should the temperature drop below freezing.
This is strange because all vehicles experience different efficiency and therefore range based on different conditions – hence the origin of the term “your mileage may vary” even though it has taken a wider use now. 
There’s no perfect way to advertise the range of an electric car – countries use different test cycles based on different standards to get an idea of the range and efficiency of specific models.
In the case of South Korea, it uses the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). That’s what is being used as the advertised range by Tesla and all other automakers.
This doesn’t sound like a Tesla problem, and I hope that they are sending similar reports to other automakers because they all have the same issues. To different degrees, sure, but it’s a problem for all vehicles out there.
Tesla has been doing well in Korea in the last few years, especially since the launch of the Model Y. The Korean EV market would look very different if Tesla wasn’t around, but now several domestic automakers are starting to release more EVs, especially the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6.
Could it have something to do with this situation Tesla finds itself in with the KFTC? I don’t know.

2022/02/16,"Tesla (TSLA) has signed a contract to secure lithium supply from an upcoming mine in Australia developed by Liontown.
The critical material to battery production is expected to start flowing in 2024.
With the rise in popularity of electric vehicles, several critical materials to battery production, like nickel, lithium, and cobalt, are becoming bottlenecks in growing the overall EV production capacity.
In order to encourage new production to come online, battery manufacturers and automakers are starting to sign contracts and off-take agreements with junior mining projects that are not in production yet.
This helps these projects secure financing to bring the mines to production, which is an extremely capital-intensive process.
Last month, Tesla signed such a deal to secure nickel from a new mine in the US.
At the time, we noted to expect more of these types of deals from Tesla in the near future as the race to secure critical battery metals is ramping up.
Sure enough, Tesla and Liontown have now announced another similar agreement, but this time it is for lithium from a new mine in Australia:
“Australian-based battery materials company Liontown Resources Limited (ASX: LTR) (“Liontown” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a legally binding sales and purchase term sheet with electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla for the supply of spodumene concentrate.”
The project, called ‘Kathleen Valley,’ is located 680 km north-east of Perth in Western Australia.
Major construction work at the mine is expected to start toward the end of the year for a start of production in 2024-25.
Therefore, Tesla is early in backing the project – though battery producer LG Energy also already has an off-take agreement with the company.
Tesla has agreed to buy 150,000 metric tonnes of lithium spodumene concentrate from the project per year:
“The Agreement is for the supply of up to 150,000 dry metric tonnes (“DMT”) per annum of spodumene concentrate to be produced at Liontown’s Kathleen Valley Lithium Project in Western Australia (“Kathleen Valley”) and is expected to commence in 2024, representing approximately one-third of the Project’s start-up SC6.0 production capacity of ~500ktpa.”
Liontown has now secured off-take agreements for more than half of the Kathleen Valley project’s capacity for the first five years of production despite production being a few years away.
That should help the company secure all the investments it needs to bring the project to construction.
Again, we should expect Tesla and other companies to keep doing more of those agreements in the near future to help encourage more new projects in an attempt to avoid major supply chain issues when it comes to raw battery materials during the second half of the decade.

2022/02/15,"Elon Musk might have actually followed through with the supposedly “world hunger-ending donation” that he questioned last year as Tesla reveals he has donated billions of dollars worth of shares over the last few months.
Though the recipient of the giant donation worth almost $6 billion hasn’t been revealed, the number and timing might give us a clue.
Last year, Musk took to Twitter to say that he would sell 10% of his stake in Tesla if a Twitter poll would agree, which it unsurprisingly did.
The CEO framed the situation as an idea that came from pressure from the media and politicians about the rich not paying taxes on unrealized gains and him being at the center of it as the world’s richest man.
However, Musk wasn’t as vocal about the fact that he was facing a giant tax bill regardless of his sale of shares, due to a large number of stock options he needs to exercise over the next year.
The new stock options he was receiving would have forced him to sell several billions in Tesla stock to cover his tax bill regardless of the Twitter poll situation.
As a matter of fact, Musk held the Twitter poll in November 2021 after already having agreed to a plan to exercise his stock options and sell roughly half of those new shares with the board in September.
The CEO ended up following through and selling close to 10% of his stake in Tesla by the end of the year.
Around the same time that this was happening, Musk made a controversial statement on Twitter about a headline that was going around claiming that 2% of his wealth could “end world hunger”:
If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.
The media was click-baiting using a comment made by David Muldrow, the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme.
Musk was criticized for questioning the comment and asking for a plan on the specific Twitter thread even though the World Food Programme already had detailed the plan on its website.
But the WFP actually followed through and reframed the plan into a Twitter thread:
This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable. @elonmusk, you asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you – and anyone else – who is serious about saving lives. The ask is $6.6B to avert famine in 2022: https://t.co/eJLmfcMVqE
The plan includes spending about half of the money to directly deliver food to the most vulnerable in specific regions hit by famine, and the rest would be used to set up a voucher program for people to purchase food locally and improve the local food economy.
Now a few months later, Tesla has released a new SEC filing on Valentine’s Day revealing that Musk donated just over 5 million shares worth close to $6 billion at the end of November.
The filing doesn’t reveal the recipient of the money, but the WFP is suspected to be the recipient due to the amount and the timing. The NYTimes posits it might also be a tax dodge and might be to his own foundation which Musk controls. 
The gift came as Musk sold many more billions in stock. He sold more than $16 billion worth of shares in November and December, much of which was meant to cover tax obligations after exercising stock options. At the time, Musk tweeted that he would be likely to pay over $11 billion in taxes, one of the biggest individual bills in U.S. history. The stock donation could be useful in defraying that bill.
Neither Musk or the WFP have commented on the situation.
Did Musk follow through on the potentially “world hunger-ending” donation? We will have to wait to find out.

2022/02/14,"Tesla announced that it is expanding access to the Supercharger network for non-Tesla electric cars to all stations in the Netherlands.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers.
In November 2021, we saw Tesla take the first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
Last month, the automaker announced that the program is expanding to more stations in Norway and France. 
It looks like the program is going well because Tesla announced today that it is expanding the program to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands:
Non-Tesla vehicles can now charge at all Superchargers in the Netherlands via the Tesla app.  Learn more at https://t.co/hjybH0ROdl pic.twitter.com/zjomySylf9
Tesla operates 36 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands covering the whole country.
This might automatically turn Tesla into one of the biggest fast-charging EV network operators in the country.
As we previously reported, Tesla is gradually opening more sites to test how other EVs are affecting the overall experience and increasing traffic at the stations.
Now that non-Tesla EV drivers have access to all stations in the Netherlands and are not restricted to a select few, it should give Tesla a better idea of how welcoming those EV drivers will have a larger-scale impact on a country-wide network.
EV drivers simply need to download the Tesla app and have a vehicle with a CCS connector to use those select Supercharger stations.
Tesla is expected to eventually give EV drivers access to more if not all stations in Europe and use the new revenue to accelerate the expansion of the network.
The automaker is expected to also do the same in North America, but it is going to be more complicated in the market since Tesla uses its own proprietary plug instead of the CCS standard.
Non-Tesla EV drivers are going to need an adapter the use the existing Supercharger stations.
We previously noted that being used by EVs from more than one automaker is a requirement to get access to the $7.5 billion that the US government recently announced to be investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure as part of its broader infrastructure bill that passed last year.

2022/02/14,"Tesla (TSLA) is receiving competing bids for a second Gigafactory in China, according to new documents released by a Chinese province. The automaker said that it expects to announce a new factory location this year.
Tesla currently operates two main factories, Tesla Fremont and Gigafactory Shanghai, and it has Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin slowly starting to ramp up production.
Those four projects alone should push Tesla’s production capacity beyond 3 million vehicles annually by the end of next year, but the automaker has much greater ambitions for this decade that will require several more factories.
During Tesla’s latest earnings call last month, CEO Elon Musk said that we can expect announcements later this year about new factory locations:
2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
Another factory in Europe and yet another in China have been rumored over the last year.
New information now points to Tesla actively looking for a new location in China and having provinces and municipalities compete against each other as they did before the automaker chose Shanghai.
Car News China reports on a new document released by the Liaoning Province that references a Tesla vehicle factory project:
On February 11, Liaoning Province’s official Wechat account, “Liaoning Release,” published an article titled “Five Grasps of Dadong District of Shenyang City, Striving to be the Pioneer in Revitalization Development.” The report stated that Shenyang City is actively preparing to implement Tesla’s vehicle project.
However, it’s not a done deal. The statement apparently translate to something more aspirational as if the government is bidding for the project.
When asked about the statement, Tesla China’s PR department said that they have no plan for a factory in Shanyang, but they didn’t deny being on the hunt for a new factory location in the country. Shenyang is the largest city in Northeastern China, and it is the capital of Liaoning Province.
The report also mentions several other regions competing for the next Tesla factory in China, including “Qingdao, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Hefei, Zhengzhou, Shenzhen, and Jinan.” As it looks for a new location for a second factory, Tesla is not necessarily looking for financial incentives like tax breaks, but rather less restrictions in terms of ownership of production capacity.
Tesla was able to get the first wholly foreign-owned car factory in China by building its Shanghai factory in a free-trade zone.
The automaker is likely going to look for a similar deal for a second factory in China and replicate the success of Gigafactory Shanghai, which is now Tesla’s biggest factory by production volume, and its main export hub.

2022/02/14,"Elon Musk put its support behind the notion that Tesla’s current legal and regulatory troubles with several government agencies are due to the company’s disruptiveness in several industries, lack of paying for ads, and lack of political contributions.
The comment dismisses some serious accusations as just repercussions for Tesla angering the wrong people.
Over the last few months, some Tesla fans have complained about what they see as a ramp-up of regulatory oversight on Tesla.
As we discussed on the podcast last week, Tesla has been hit with four NHTSA recalls in just three weeks.
They were all fixed with over-the-air software updates, and some Tesla fans that Musk promotes on Twitter have been pushing the idea that it is suspicious that the agency has been “so focused” on Tesla lately.
Then Tesla recently revealed that it was again subpoenaed by the SEC over tweets by Musk.
And most recently, Tesla was hit by a lawsuit by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) alleging “systematic racial discrimination and harassment.”
Now Musk backed on Twitter the growing conspiracy that this increased government oversight of Tesla is due to the company stepping on toes:
Exactly
While simply a one-word reply to a Twitter comment, this response from the CEO dismisses Tesla’s current troubles with the listed government agencies as some kind of backlash for “upsetting” people within the industries it operates in and not buying ads, which Musk has linked to Tesla’s treatment in the media before, and lack of contribution to politicians.
It’s also Musk’s first comment, albeit indirect, on the DFEH’s lawsuit against Tesla, which includes serious allegations from 50 former Tesla employees about a serious problem about how Black employees are treated at Fremont factory.
I am not going to sit here and say that Tesla has never ruffled any feathers that attracted unnecessary government attention before, but I think it’s dangerous to bundle all of Tesla’s current issues into this conspiratorial agenda.
First off, it’s upsetting that Musk’s first comment on the DFEH lawsuit, which as we previously reported has been grossly downplayed by Tesla, is through this poorly thought-out theory. He needs to address this upfront. Those allegations are sickening to read and they are being corroborated by a lot of people who worked at Tesla.
I don’t think it’s okay for Musk to stay quiet on the issue beyond this comment. 
Secondly, the whole conspiracy theory falls apart pretty quickly when you look at the details.
Let’s take the four NHTSA recalls for example. Yes, those are a lot of recalls in a short period of time, but does that mean that they were not valid and only exist because NHTSA has a bone to pick with Tesla?
No. The biggest one regarding the seatbelt chime was actually initiated by a South Korean agency, and the same problem was found in all Tesla cars so the recall extended to the US.
How about the one with the heat pump? Transport Canada was involved and it was a very real issue that resulted in many owners losing heat in extreme cold in a bunch of different countries, including the US. 
I agree that the two other “recalls” were more questionable since they were related to a technicality with the pedestrian warning sound regulation and a driving behavior of FSD Beta that was a driving violation but common and optional to drivers. 
But now you actually have two very real and needed recalls, which weren’t even initiated by NHTSA, and two recalls, which were based on technicalities more than anything but still valid if you go by the book.
Yes, we might need a better word for a “recall” when it only requires an over-the-air software update, but is that really NHTSA going hard on Tesla or just weird timing?
As for the other agencies mentioned in the tweet, the SEC is only trying to make sure Tesla and Musk respect the terms of its agreed settlement, and as for the California DMV, I don’t even know what Tesla would have to complain about.
If anything, they are getting preferential treatment from the agency by not having to report the FSD Beta program as self-driving test mileage to the agency.
The only thing that happened recently is that the agency considered changing its definition of self-driving test milage to force Tesla to report more data about the program, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen, even though the end result would only be a little more visibility into the progress of the program.
Would that be a bad thing?
Yes, competition is competition and unions don’t like Tesla, but if I were Musk, I wouldn’t encourage this conspiracy theory as it dismisses some potentially very real problems that need to be addressed.

2022/02/11,"The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) has now officially filed the lawsuit that Tesla warned about in a blog post earlier this week, and it’s a lot more serious than the automaker made it sound. 
Earlier this week, Tesla released a blog post titled “The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit”  in which it warned that the state agency was going to file a lawsuit alleging “systematic racial discrimination and harassment”.
In the post, Tesla argued that the lawsuit was based on “alleged misconduct by production associates at the Fremont factory that took place between 2015 and 2019“. The company also argued that NFEH didn’t try to solve the issue without a lawsuit, and that in each of the individual cases, they didn’t find Tesla at fault.
However, now that we have access to the full lawsuit, we can see the allegations are much more serious. 
DFEH has 50 former Tesla employees complainants who claim they were subject to racist comments from not only colleagues, but also supervisors and managers. They also alleged that black employees were less likely to be promoted and are not represented well represented in managerial roles.
Here’s one example of the claims in the lawsuit:
Throughout the day, every day, Black and/or African American workers heard Defendants’ workers, leads, supervisors, and managers make racial slurs and comments about Black workers. Examples of the racist language include the n-word, “porch monkey,” “monkey toes,” “boy,” “hood rats,” and “horse hair.” Defendants’ workers, including production leads and supervisors, made references to Black and/or African Americans in racist comments and racist jokes such as “N[ ] word out of the hood,” “from the ghetto,” “Tesla [was] hiring lazy coons,” and “go back to Africa.”
Another example:
Because the factory was racially segregated, Defendants’ workers referred to the areas where many Black and/or African Americans worked as the “porch monkey station.” Defendants’ workers with tattoos of the Confederate flag made their racially incendiary tattoos visible to intimidate Black and/or African American workers. Racial slurs were also dispensed in Spanish and included “mayate” and “negrita.” Additionally, Defendants’ workers referred to the Tesla factory as the “slaveship” or “the plantation,” where Defendants’ production leads “crack[ed] the whip.” Many Black and/or African American workers understood these terms to be references to how Defendants treated its Black and/or African American workers. One Black worker heard these racial slurs as often as 50-100 times a day.
As for Tesla’s claim that the DFEH went straight to a lawsuit, the agency denies it and said that it brought the complainants and the company to mediation.
It also claims to have tried to address the claims of systematic harassment dnd discrimination with Tesla, but it apparently didn’t go well:
After approximately three years of investigation, receiving hundreds of complaints from workers and serving many to Tesla, DFEH issued a cause finding on January 3, 2022. In the course of DFEH’s investigation, DFEH found evidence that Defendants subjected its Black and/or African American workers to racial harassment and discriminated against them in the terms and conditions of employment, including assignment, discipline, promotion, termination, and constructive discharge. DFEH’s investigation also found that Defendants retaliated against its Black and/or African American workers when they complained or reported the harassment or discrimination. Further, DFEH’s investigation found that Defendants failed to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. DFEH’s investigation also found that Defendants paid Black and/or African American workers less than workers of another race or ethnicity for substantially similar work. DFEH’s investigation also found that Defendants required Black and/or African American workers to waive rights, forums, and/or procedures as a condition of employment, continued employment, or the receipt of any employment related benefit. Lastly, DFEH’s investigation uncovered record-keeping violations. These claims are alleged and/or reasonably related to and like the claims originally alleged in the Director’s Complaint.
Here’s the lawsuit in full:
[scribd id=558274224 key=key-atR7YtlhtKmlhzxTOmEJ mode=scroll]
Regardless of how true the claims in the lawsuit are, the blog post from Tesla completely misrepresented the nature of it.
These are extremely serious allegations, and if even only half of the claims are true, it looks like Tesla has a real problem at Fremont factory that needs to be addressed more forcefully than the company claims to have done in the past.

2022/02/11,"Tesla is planning to build its new design center in Beijing later this year, according to a new document released by the Chinese government.
Shortly after announcing Gigafactory Shanghai, Tesla made it clear that it not only wants to tap into China’s incredible capacity in manufacturing, but it also wants to take advantage of the country’s incredible engineering and design talent.
In early 2020, Tesla announced plans to establish a new R&D center and a new design center in China to build “a Chinese-style” electric car.
Tesla started taking design submissions for its Chinese-made small electric car that summer and started hiring for the program shortly after.
Late last year, the automaker announced that it opened its new R&D center in Shanghai next to the factory.
It was expected that the design studio might also land in Shanghai, but now it appears that Tesla selected Beijing.
According to Reuters, the government of China’s sprawling capital released a new report listing new projects coming to the city in 2022, and it included Tesla’s new design center. 
The first project for Tesla’s new design studio is expected to be the “$25,000” electric car, but CEO Elon Musk recently said that Tesla is currently not working on the new model.
Tesla’s Beijing Design Center would become Tesla’s second design center after the one in Los Angeles, which houses most of the company’s designers and some engineering teams.
In 2020, Musk also announced plans for the automaker to open a European design center in Germany.
There’s been a rumored location in the heart of Berlin, but nothing else has come out about this project in almost two years.

2022/02/10,"Tesla is delaying more Model X orders as Elon Musk admits that Tesla made a mistake in shutting down production of the previous version as the production ramp of the new version is having problems.
The automaker didn’t produce the Model X for about eight months as it refreshed both the Model S and Model X programs and focused on Model S production first. During those eight months, the automaker kept taking orders for the new Model X, also known as Palladium, after the refreshed version was unveiled in January 2021.
But Tesla already had a backlog of orders for the Model X before the refresh was unveiled. The result is many people who placed Model X orders over a year ago are still months away from getting their cars and are often facing further delays. 
A few months ago, we reported on Tesla giving Model X buyers some more clarity with better delivery windows. However, many buyers are now reporting that Tesla has issued a new vague explanation of delays on many of these delivery windows. Several buyers who are a year into their Model X orders told Electrek today that Tesla updated delivery windows into Q2 2022.
In a series of tweets this week, CEO Elon Musk admitted that Tesla is having issues with the Model X production ramp and that the automaker shouldn’t have stopped production of the old version:
We dropped the ball badly regarding new Model X production ramp and still haven’t fully recovered. It was idiotic to stop production of old Model X in Dec 2020 when there was still plenty of demand!
The CEO added that the current bottleneck is with the interior trim:
Model X is an extremely difficult car to build. Most complex passenger car ever. Limiting factor is interior trim.
For new orders being placed now, Tesla expects delivery of the Plaid tri-motor version of the Model X in October 2022 and the dual-motor version in January 2023  — meaning the electric SUV is basically sold out for the year.

2022/02/10,"Tesla has lost its executive in charge of new vehicle programs who has been in charge of several important engineering programs, and now, he is going to work on Ford’s electric vehicles.
Alan Clarke has been at Tesla for over a decade.
He started out as a senior design engineer in 2009 and worked on several projects, including the Model S’ iconic door handles.
He listed some of the projects on his LinkedIn page:
Clarke was quickly promoted to director of new program engineering – a role he has been holding at Tesla for the last four years.
In this role, he led several important programs for Tesla including “Chief Engineer for the Tesla Roadster Prototype”, leading vehicle architecture for Model 3 and Model Y, as well as engineering on the Cybertruck prototype.
We previously reported that he was named as one of the inventors on a patent for the Cyebrtruck’s retractable solar bed cover.
After over a decade at Tesla, he announced this week that he has accepted a role in Ford’s Advanced EV development group. He is going to join Doug Field, who also held a top engineering role at Tesla for years before going back to Ford after a stint at Apple.
It looks like a big loss for Tesla, but they will survive. 
I like seeing this kind of employee movement to legacy automakers because I think ultimately, it will help accelerate EV programs for them, which will accelerate EV adoption in the long run. Ford has now quite a few former top Tesla engineers who have experience bringing new EV programs to mass production. This will be helpful as the company is just now moving in that direction after years of only making EVs as compliance cars.
Just earlier this week, we reported on how Ford CEO Jim Farley hilariously said that “Ford would rival Tesla in EV demand right now if it was producing enough electric vehicles“.
It’s time for Ford to move to volume production of electric vehicles.

2022/02/10,"Tesla was hit by yet another recall today as NHTSA asked the automaker to disable its Boombox feature, which allows drivers to play sounds through their cars’ external speakers when in drive, as the agency believes it is a safety risk.
The Boombox feature is more than a year old at this point since it was introduced in Tesla’s 2020 holiday update.
Using the external speakers meant for the pedestrian warning sound, the Boombox feature enables Tesla drivers to play pre-selected sounds through those speakers.
However, it sounds like NHTSA was never a big fan of the feature, and it has been discussing it with Tesla over the last year.
A new timeline released by NHTSA today showed that Tesla tried hard to defend the feature, but it ultimately agreed to disable it when the vehicle is moving:
Interestingly, in the safety recall notice, NHTSA admits that the feature results in making the car even more noticeable, which is the goal of the pedestrian warning sound (PWS), but it still deemed it a “safety risk” for non-compliance to the PWS regulation:
“While Boombox can enhance the conspicuity of the vehicle to pedestrians, a vehicle that uses Boombox when in motion may cause the PWS to be noncompliant with FMVSS 141, which could increase the risk of a collision. Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to this condition.”
The safety recall affects over half a million cars, every Tesla vehicle in the US with the Boombox feature.
This is Tesla’s fourth NHTSA recall in just a few weeks, but they all only required an over-the-air software update.

2022/02/10,"Tesla has released a quick sneak peek of the paint shop inside Gigafactory Berlin, which the automaker has been taunting as “its most advanced paint shop” yet – and it should enable new colors.
It’s literally has been years since Tesla has launched a new vehicle paint color.
Back in the early days of the Model S, Tesla used to offer a variety of colors, but the automaker decided to streamline options, and it now offers only a handful of color options that have remained the same for the last few years.
CEO Elon Musk has been talking about Tesla finally releasing new colors, but it has been linked to a new “most-advanced paint shop” at Gigafactory Berlin.
The CEO talked about new multi-layered paints:
“Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature.“
Now Tesla has released a new sneak peek inside its paint shop at Gigafactory Berlin:
The automaker released the video as part of a recruitment effort as it started listing several new positions inside the paint shop.
While Musk described it as “Tesla’s most advanced paint shop,” a new paint shop with similar capacity is also expected to be deployed at Gigafactory Texas. It’s just that at the time of the comment, the company likely expected Gigafactory Berlin to be in operation first.
Delays in obtaining regulatory approval to start production at the new plant have allowed the Gigafactory Texas project to catch up.
Nonetheless, we might soon be finally seeing the new colors that this new paint shop will allow.
Late last year, three new colors appeared in the Tesla app – hinting at potential new color options:
The first one, Deep Crimson, is something that Musk already announced, and he has been spotted driving a Model S with the new color.

2022/02/09,"Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen gave a rare update on the often delayed Tesla Roadster. The designer says that Tesla is still “feverishly” working on the electric hypercar that will be an “exciting flying machine.”
The new generation of the Roadster has been one of the most delayed programs at Tesla. When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, CEO Elon Musk said that it would come to market in 2020.
Tesla started taking reservations at the unveiling event for the impressive electric supercar that goes zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds with over 600 miles of range. People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.
The vehicle program was later delayed, and the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.
In 2020, Musk hinted at the Tesla Roadster being delayed until 2022 as the automaker focuses on the Cybertruck.
Last year, the CEO confirmed that the new vehicle will indeed not come to market until 2022.
We haven’t heard much about the new Tesla Roadster all year and suspected that it might have been delayed again. The automaker had a tough year due to the chip shortage, and the Cybertruck itself, which is clearly the priority, has been delayed as well.
When asked about the Roadster’s timeline last September, Musk confirmed that it is now delayed until at least 2023. Furthermore, the CEO said that its arrival will depend on how much “drama” Tesla goes through in 2022.
Now Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen has given a rare update on the Roadster program on the Spike Car Radio podcast:
We are working on the Roadster. I wish we were working faster, but I also wanted to say that, in the time we have been developing it, we have also been learning a lot. Plaid is a great learning platform. All those experiences will, you know, make their way back into a much better Roadster than had we launched right after we debuted it.
By “Plaid,” von Holzhausen is referring to the new tri-motor powertrain launched in the updated version of the Model S and Model X last year. The Roadster was originally supposed to also have a tri-motor powertrain.
Now Tesla is expected to take it to a new level, according to von Holzhausen:
So yeah, continuous improvements on that. It will be an amazing, exciting flying machine with the SpaceX package.
Musk has previously announced that Tesla plans to offer a “SpaceX package” with cold air thrusters around the vehicle to boost performance. He said that the package could push the Tesla Roadster’s 0–60 mph time to just 1.1 seconds.
The CEO recently said that Tesla would be focusing its development efforts on the Tesla Bot this year and that the project might even take priority over some vehicle programs, which causes some doubts about the Roadster even coming in 2023.

But, on the new podcast, Tesla’s chief designer said that Tesla is still “working on it feverishly.”

2022/02/09,"Tesla is dominating car sales in California with impressive growth in 2021 that has resulted in having 2 of the top 5 best-selling cars in the state.
California might not be Tesla’s home market anymore, now that the company has officially moved its headquarters to Texas, but the state is still its biggest market in the US.
The company has been growing steadily in the state with the introduction of the Model Y, which had a breakout year in 2021.
New data from the California New Car Dealer Association (CNCDA) shows that the Model Y is the best-selling compact SUV in the state and it took the second overall best-selling car position – almost beating the much cheaper Toyota Camry.
Here were the top five best-selling cars in California in 2021:
As you can see, the Model 3 also did well – finishing in the top five and making it two electric vehicles in the top five best-selling cars in the state in 2021.
Tesla grew 69% in the state in 2021 – more than any other automaker except for Genesis, but the latter had extremely low volumes in 2020 that artificially boosted its growth percentage in 2021.
With more than half of all BEV sales in California in 2021, Tesla helped the state achieve a 9.5% BEV market share:
This is strong consistent growth that is expected to accelerate with more availability of compelling EVs at higher volumes in the next few years, especially electric pickup trucks.
In every segment where there is a compelling high volume EV available, the EV dominates the segment.
Model 3 and Model Y own 47% and 44% of their respective segments in California:
Model S and Model X didn’t do as well due to not having any deliveries for the first half of the year with the design refresh, but they likely would have had similar results in their own segments based on their performance during the second half of the year.
For example, Model S still had 10% market share in its segment in 2021 despite deliveries only starting in June:
Interestingly, even GM’s Chevy Bolt EV, which had a tough year due to a battery recall and sales being halted for most of the second half of the year, dominated the subcompact segment:
With about a dozen new EV models launching this year, we can expect an even better picture for the EV market in California in 2022.

2022/02/09,"Tesla announced that it is expecting the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) to file a  lawsuit alleging “systematic racial discrimination and harassment” at Tesla.
The company preemptively defended itself calling it “unfair and counterproductive.”
The lawsuit hasn’t been filed yet, but Tesla warned about it in its 10k SEC filing, and now it has shared a blog post explaining its side of the situation.
In the post titled ‘The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit,’ Tesla alleged that the lawsuit is coming after three years of investigation from the DFEH that never found a case where Tesla was at fault.
Instead, the company claims that the lawsuit is based on alleged misconduct from some production associates at the Fremont factory from years ago:
“The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) intends to file a lawsuit against Tesla alleging systematic racial discrimination and harassment. This follows a three-year investigation during which the DFEH—whose mission is supposedly to protect workers—has never once raised any concern about current workplace practices at Tesla. Rather, the lawsuit appears focused on alleged misconduct by production associates at the Fremont factory that took place between 2015 and 2019.”
Tesla claimed that in all individual cases by the DFEH, the agency never found the automaker to have been responsible for misconduct:
“Over the past five years, the DFEH has been asked on almost 50 occasions by individuals who believe they were discriminated against or harassed to investigate Tesla. On every single occasion, once concluded the DFEH has closed its investigation without a finding of misconduct against Tesla. It therefore strains credibility for the agency to now allege, after a three-year investigation, that systematic racial discrimination and harassment somehow existed at Tesla. A narrative spun by the DFEH and a handful of plaintiff firms to generate publicity is not factual proof.”
The company also claims that the DFEH never tried to work with Tesla and instead, it is moving right away to a lawsuit, which it finds “unfair and counterproductive.”
Tesla has made clear that it will fight the lawsuit once it is filed.
We reported last year that Tesla was recently facing mounting lawsuits for allegedly ‘fostering a culture of sexual harassment and racism.’
A series of new lawsuits came after a former Tesla employee was awarded a $137 million judgment by the court in October over a complaint of racism at Tesla’s Fremont factory.
Tesla is also fighting this judgment.
We will update once the DFEH files its lawsuit and releases more details about the actual complaints.

2022/02/09,"The problem with the heat pump leading Tesla owners to lose heat in extreme cold and the subsequent software fix that Tesla issued has now been revealed in more detail in the new NHTSA recall.
Last month, Electrek reported on Tesla owners losing heat in extreme cold as some heat pumps were failing.
As we explained, it’s a problem that first emerged last winter with Tesla vehicles equipped with the automaker’s new heat pump system, first introduced in the Model Y and added to an updated version of Model 3.
It was the first full winter for both vehicles.
At the time, Tesla said that it fixed the issue with a software update, but it is now resurfacing a year later in a big way as extreme cold waves are hitting several parts of the world.
Many Tesla owners complained that they are losing heat in extreme cold and several owners who brought their cars to the service center had their whole heat pump system replaced.
A week later, CEO Elon Musk said that a software update to recalibrate a valve in the heat pump system is being released and should fix the issue.
The update appears to have reduced the problem, but there are still some reports of Tesla owners suddenly losing heat.
Now the software update mentioned by Musk is explained in more detail through a safety recall, since the NHTSA determined that the issue was a safety risk due to reduced windshield defrosting:
“Windshield defrost performance that does not fully comply with FMVSS 103 may cause reduced windshield visibility in certain conditions, which may increase the risk of a collision. Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to this condition.”
NHTSA explains the problem in detail in the new recall notice:
“In vehicles built with heat pump, the Electronic Expansion Valve (EXV) may experience controller communication interruptions, after which the EXV driver may attempt to realign the EXV rotor by rotating it in a small increment toward the open direction. When heat pump vehicles delivered with firmware release 2021.44 through 2021.44.30.6 experience such interruptions, the vehicle software does not close the valve, and the accumulation of interruptions and subsequent realignments over extended periods where the vehicle is awake may result in an unintended valve opening event. This, in turn, may trap refrigerant inside the evaporator and may deplete the refrigerant from the active components in the system. The depletion may result in fail-safe compressor stoppage, and cause loss of cabin heating, particularly in temperatures –10 C or colder. While the windshield defrost system continues to operate with the condition present, defrost performance may not fully comply with FMVSS 103.”
The problem apparently only affects more recent vehicles with the heat pump that were delivered with specific versions of the software:
“The recall population includes certain new Model Year (“MY”) 2021-22 Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles built with heat pump and running firmware release 2021.44 through 2021.44.30.6 at the time of customer delivery.”
As previously discussed, Tesla has already started pushing the software fix.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/02/08,"In new comments about US manufacturing, President Biden finally acknowledged Tesla as “America’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer,” calming Elon Musk fans who have been raising a big stink for months about the administration overlooking Tesla.
The tension between the Biden administration and Musk and his fans has been growing for months now. The first major blow seems to have been the ceremony where President Biden signed a new executive order for 50% of new cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2030.
Tesla wasn’t invited, and both Musk and many Tesla fans took offense. However, the event was about US automakers, like Ford and GM, committing to go 50% electric by 2030. Tesla is already all electric.
But then the Biden administration, influenced by the United Auto Worker union, pushed for reform of the electric vehicle tax credit to include an additional $4,500 credit per electric vehicle produced at a unionized factory.
Some Tesla fans saw this as an attack on Tesla since the company is the biggest US producer of electric vehicles, and its workforce is not unionized. Musk later called out Biden for “being controlled by unions.”
Things started to escalate from there when President Biden made the undoubtedly ridiculous statement that gave GM CEO Mary Barra credit for ‘electrifying the entire auto industry.’ Biden and his administration have since made several similar claims and appeared to have an issue even mentioning Tesla when it came to electric vehicles, despite the company being the biggest electric vehicle producer in the country and a big part of the administration’s plans to lower emissions.
Last week, the building tension culminated in Musk tweeting at POTUS to mention Tesla and his fans then pilling on with a petition and even an ad in Times Square to pressure the president into acknowledging Tesla.
It looks like the effort worked.
In new remarks today about US manufacturing, including an announcement of new factories coming to the nation, President Biden mentioned Tesla and said that the company is “our nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer”:
Since 2021, companies have announced investments totaling more than $200 billion in domestic manufacturing here in America, from iconic companies like GM and Ford building out new electric vehicle production; to Tesla, our nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer; to innovative younger companies like Rivian, building electric trucks, or Proterra, building electric buses, which I saw at a virtual tour last year when I met with the CEO virtually.  And they really impressed me.
Here’s the video:
Hopefully, this statement puts the issue to rest. It was always silly on both sides. 
One side, yes, Tesla is by far the most important company in the United States and the world when it comes to accelerating the electric transition. Therefore, it’s dumb not to mention them when talking about the US effort to electrify transport.
However, you know what else is dumb? Politics. And that’s what this has been all about.
Elon Musk is a controversial character, and he opposed the Biden administration’s biggest legislative effort, the Build Back Better act. So, of course, the administration would have issues associating with him. Also, Ford and GM are employing union workers, who are backing Biden’s administration, and Tesla is opposing the additional incentives for EVs coming from union factories.
It’s all about politics. Not sure that Biden mentioning Tesla in a speech will make a big difference, but good for them. They got it done.

2022/02/08,"Ford CEO Jim Farley made an interesting comment that highlighted just how the perception of Tesla has massively shifted in the automotive industry over the last few years.
It was just a few years ago that the consensus about Tesla amongst leaders at legacy automakers was that the company is great at making a few expensive electric vehicles and it is going to stay that way.
Not a lot of people believed that Tesla could become a major automaker and achieve an annualized production rate of over one million vehicles, but that’s exactly what it achieved last quarter.
Now no one is better at producing electric vehicles in volume than Tesla, and it’s the traditional automakers who are trying to catch up.
This has become even more evident in the last year with the serious supply chain issues affecting the auto industry.
Tesla was able to grow significantly while most automakers struggled. 
GM delivered only a couple of BEVs last quarter while Ford just had to shut down production lines for its Mustang Mach E, its only consumer all-electric vehicle right now, due to supply chain issues.
But Ford is still confident in its goal to quickly ramp up BEV production to 600,000 units by the end of next year.
During its Q4 earnings report, CEO Jim Farley made an interesting statement that highlighted Tesla’s lead in BEV manufacturing:
“This is in addition to our battery sourcing in China and Europe. We are well on our way to achieve at least a 40% mix of BEVs by 2030, with strong margins and equal to our higher market share in the key high-profit, high-volume segments we compete. For example, the F-150 Lightning, if we had full production today to meet our current demand, we would rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the U.S. market.”
The CEO says that if Ford was able to produce as many F-150 Lightning pickups as Tesla is producing Model Ys, it would be able to sell as many.
This is in contrast to a few years ago when legacy automakers didn’t believe in demand for electric vehicles and didn’t think that the issue would actually be the ability to manufacture them in high enough volume. 
This is kind of wild for people who have been following closely for a long time. Here Ford is basically saying “we would be selling as many EVs as Tesla if we were producing as many”.
I would also be a billionaire if I had a billion dollars.
But I think he is probably right. Ford could sell as many F-150 Lightning pickups as Tesla sells Model Ys in the US right now. And we are not talking about competing vehicles here since one is a small SUV and the other a pickup truck, but we are talking about popular BEVs.
However, Tesla is still growing Model Y in the US. While Ford is establishing production of the F-150 Lightning for a start later this year, Tesla is starting production of the Model Y at Gigafactory Texas.
I like Ford’s acceleration of its EV production plan and going from just some Mustang Mach-Es right now to 600,000 electric vehicles next year would be impressive.
But I still think that Ford is wrong in aiming for a 40% BEV mix in 2030. 
I think the company will have a hard time finding people to buy the other 60% of its vehicles.

2022/02/07,"Tesla was spotted working on a new Cybertruck prototype at Fremont factory. While it’s nice to see more footage of the highly-anticipated new electric pickup truck, the footage makes us a bit uncomfortable with how close the drones get to the prototype and Tesla employees.
We were expecting to get an update about the Cybertruck during Tesla’s product roadmap update that CEO Elon Musk said he would release as part of the company’s Q4 2021 earnings, however, the CEO only announced that the Cybertruck has been delayed to “hopefully 2023” due to supply chain constraints.
Nonetheless, a new prototype of the electric pickup truck has been spotted around California and Texas over the last month. In December, Tesla was spotted testing a new prototype of the Cybertruck on its test track at Fremont factory.
A few weeks later, Tesla brought a new prototype of the Cybertruck to Gigafactory Texas. Several pictures and even a video of the updated version of the electric pickup truck have leaked.
Now it looks like the prototype is back in Fremont and Tesla is working on it as it was spotted in a new drone flyover:
Tesla appears to be installing equipment, likely sensors on the prototype. Part of the trims around the bed and wheel wells are also covered. 
The drone video with people around gives a good idea of the size of the latest version of the truck, which has been rumored to be smaller after the latest pictures came out. From this video, it looks to be of similar size as the original prototype unveiled in 2019. 
The large single windshield wiper that has been a controversial addition to the latest prototype is not visible in this video.
We are happy to get a another close look at the vehicle, however, we can’t condone this kind of drone flying. In the video, the drone appears to get dangerously close to the vehicle and Tesla employees – to the point that you can see them being concerned and sort of chasing it away.
While I get that people are excited to see the electric pickup, let’s try to keep it respecful.

2022/02/07,"Tesla was the victim of a theft that resulted in having to shut down a brand new Supercharger station, as all the cables on the eight stalls were cut off. 
The automaker is currently working to triple the size of its Supercharger network over the next two years.
It is currently growing at a record pace.
Tesla went from 23,277 Superchargers at 2,564 stations at the end of 2020 to 31,498 Superchargers at 3,476 stations at the end of 2021.
We are seeing Tesla open several new stations every day.
One of those new stations is a new eight-stall V3 Supercharger station in Oakhurst, California.
However, when members of the Tesla Motors Club forum wanted to go check out the new station, they found that all stalls were missing their charging cables.
A closer examination shows that they were completely cut off (picture via Randy Spencer on TMC):
Tesla Supercharger stations have been subject to vandalism in the past.
A Supercharger station in Utah had to be shut down a few years ago after people intentionally damaged it.
This new instance in California could be vandalism, but the goal was most likely to steal the cable for the copper inside.
They manage to cut all of them clean off undetected, which could point toward criminals who knew what they were doing.
This can be a problem with charging stations, as they are often unattended, and in this case, it was a brand new station that Tesla owners didn’t even know about just yet.
It looks like charging station operators are unfortunately going to have to take vandalism and theft into account for their operations to keep the stations online as much as possible.
If this continues to be an issue, investing in some surveillance equipment is also not going to be a luxury.

2022/02/07,"While the Tesla Cybertruck has recently been delayed again, the hype is so strong around the electric pickup truck that some people are already working on thrid-party accessories for the vehicle.
Now, we see the most ambitious project yet, a kit that transform the Tesla Cybertruck into an electric boat.
When it comes to ambitious Cybertruck accessories, I thought that nothing could beat the Cyberlandr, which is trying to fit a full camper into the electric pickup’s bed. But I was wrong.
I believe the newly announced Cybercat Catamaran is an even more ambitious new product designed for the Cybertruck. The project was launched by Anthony Diamond, a Phd in material science from Berkeley and a serial entrepreneur.
On a new website for the concept, they explain what prompt them to develop the Cybercat:
As an early Cybertruck reservation holder and a Model 3 owner, Anthony was excited about tweets from Elon that indicated the Cybertruck should be able to serve as a boat for short periods. However, this capability would ultimately be limited by the speed at which wheel rotation could propel the vehicle and it would never go fast enough to be compelling.
The concept consists of an easy-to-assemble kit that can attach to the Cybertruck to turn it into a catamaran:
It is equipped with 1 to 5 50 kW outboard motors, which they aim to have powered by the Cybertruck’s battery pack.
Combined with the Cybertruck’s adaptive air suspension, the concept could potentially make the Cybercat amphibious:
The adaptive ride height of the Cybertruck and the folding inflatable pontoons of the Cybercat provide 12” of ground clearance. Once in the water, the electric outboard motors, pontoons, and hydrofoils fold down, and the wheels retract out of the water for quick takeoff. In shallow water or around docks, Cybercat can precisely maneuver propelled by the wheel rotation of the Cybertruck.
While there’s no working prototype yet, they are anticipating a top speed of over 25 mph (22+ knots) and a range of 50 to 115 miles depending on cruising speed – this is based on a Cybertruck with a range of over 500 miles on land.‍The company is aiming for a price of $22,900 to $32,900, depending on the number of outboard motors.
The company is also planing to do a hydrofoil version of the kit for higher speed and efficiency:
The Cybercat Foiler takes this one step further by adding hydrofoils to maximize efficiency on the water and unleashing industry leading performance for all-electric watercraft.‍
It would increase the price of the package by about $10,000.
The whole concept is still in the early stages of development and unlike the Cyberlandr, they are not taking reservations just yet, but they are talking about it as they test the market.
It is risky to start such an ambitious project based on a truck that has been delayed several times already. Last month, Tesla confirmed that the timeline for the Cybertruck has been pushed to at least 2023.

2022/02/07,"A new study out of the UK has detailed the countries around the world where EVs are the cheapest and most expensive to purchase – in this particular case, a Tesla Model 3. While this particular data set pertains to one specific EV, it can offer a broader perspective on how the costs of EVs vary depending on which country you live in.
As the most affordable EV in the Tesla’s current lineup, the Model 3 has become the best-selling electric vehicle in the world to date and has helped make its creator the company to beat to the EV market around the globe.
For these reasons, its no wonder the study’s authors chose to review and compare prices for the Model 3 in countries around the world.
The study outlining EV prices by country, sorted from cheapest to most expensive, was conducted by Confused.com out of the UK. In addition to EVs, the study also compares global prices of SUVs, hatchbacks, and sports cars.That being said, we’re only going to focus on the EV aspect of the study because … well, this is Electrek after all. 
If you’re curious however, you can check out the full detailed study from Consused.com.
For each category, Confused.com chose a vehicle that is widely available for sale around the world. The team then sourced list prices for that model by visiting the manufacturer’s (Tesla) local website for each country it is sold in. You can view the study’s full list of sources here.  
For the Tesla Model 3, the study focused on the cheapest available model and used the list price as shown on Tesla’s website for each country. 
*Note – These prices include taxes and any potential grants per that country’s policies. They are up to date at the time of the study but as many of us know, Tesla’s EV prices fluctuate quite often, as do exchange rates between the US, EU, and UK, but you should be able to get the picture. Here are the results.
Topping the list of countries where it’s cheapest to purchase a Tesla Model 3 is Macau on the southern coast of China. Renowned for its giant casinos, Macau is the global spot to hit the jackpot on the cheapest Tesla Model 3 price in the world. 
Macau is followed by its neighbor China in second place, and Romania just a couple hundred US dollars more in third place. The United States and its unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico round out the top 10, running about $46,500 for a brand new Model 3.
You’ve seen the cheapest countries to visit for a Tesla purchase, now here are the countries that will require you to dig the deepest into your pockets for a Model 3.
Number one by a huge margin is Singapore. At nearly $83,500 for the cheapest version of the Tesla Model 3, Singapore consumers are paying more than double what their Macau neighbors to the north are. Singapore might be able to get a better deal on a Vinfast EV, considering the Vietnam manufacturer is closer.
Israel comes in as the country selling the second most expensive Tesla EVs, followed by Sweden whose consumers may soon be shifting their focus on Tesla to other EV automakers like NIO. Sweden is also interesting to see in the top 10 most expensive along with Denmark in the number five spot, because its neighbor Norway’s Model 3s are currently the sixth cheapest. 
Any Scandinavians down for an EV purchase roadtrip if it saves you $20,000?
There you have it – you can see how your country stacks up in terms of Tesla Model 3 prices and use the list as a loose litmus test to see what you and your fellow citizens might be paying for an EV compared to folks in your neighboring countries.

2022/02/07,"Tesla (TSLA) gave an update on its Bitcoin holding in a new SEC filing – confirming that it now holds $1.99 billion in the cryptocurrency.
Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin.
Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network shows a higher mix of renewable energy. 
Last summer, CEO Elon Musk said that he believes Tesla will resume taking Bitcoin payment as he sees improvements in the energy mix of Bitcoin mining.
That has yet to happen, but Tesla is holding the crypto currency and gave an update in its latest 10K SEC filing released today.
The automaker confirmed that at current value and after selling part of its stake as a test of liquidity, it now holds about $2 billion in Bitcoin:
“During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased and received $1.50 billion of bitcoin. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $101 million of impairment losses on such digital assets. We also realized gains of $128 million in connection with selling a portion of our holdings in March 2021. Such gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our digital assets held was $1.26 billion, which reflects cumulative impairments of $101 million. The fair market value of such digital assets held as of December 31, 2021 was $1.99 billion.”
Last year, Tesla was briefly up by over $1 billion in Bitcoin during a surge in price.
Bitcion, along with the broader crypto market, have since crashed, but prices are going up again over the last few weeks – with Bitcoin being up 15% in the last week alone.
If you are interested in getting into crypto, my two favorite ways are Coinbase and crypto.com. With the latter, you can even spend your crypto through a regular Visa debit card. You can use my referral code (44sqxfg7zh) at crypto.com, and we each get $50 worth of crypto.

2022/02/04,"A Tesla vehicle using Full Self-Driving Beta has been caught on video running into a pole in what could be the first accident on the FSD Beta.
Last month, Elon Musk was claiming that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta had yet to have an accident, over a year into the program.
That’s despite a Model Y owner in the FSD Beta claiming in a complaint to NHTSA that the system caused a crash, but the complaint couldn’t be confirmed.
Now we get an actual example of an accident on the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta.
An FSD Beta driver going by AI Addict on Youtube posted a new video where the car ran into a pole that protects the bike lane:
It was a small accident that only caused a little paint damage, but it technically crashed into an object.
It’s important to note that Tesla doesn’t take any responsibility with the “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta). It’s considered an early version of Tesla’s self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.“
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver remains responsible for the vehicle and needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times. 
The video was filmed in Downtown San Jose with Tesla’s latest software release: Full Self Driving Beta 10.10 version (2021.44.30.15).
The comments of the video are already full of Tesla fans saying that the driver shouldn’t have let that happen.
This is actually an example where the driver appeared to be paying attention, but he also appeared to trust the car too much in this situation.
You can see him trying to correct the trajectory, but it was a little too late.
But the accident was actually not even the worst driving maneuver in the video. At various points, you can see it run a red light, drive into a tram lane, and do a lot of other dangerous maneuvers.
Tesla is going to have to greatly accelerate the rate of improvements, otherwise, I know someone who will be shocked at the end of this year.

2022/02/04,"According to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the top-ranked Wall Street analysts, Tesla’s (TSLA) revenue should grow larger than GM and Ford combined within the next 5 years.
Tesla’s stock performance has been incredible for a long time – it has long been more valuable than companies like GM, and it became the most valuable automaker almost two years ago.
However, the argument has been that it is not selling nearly as many vehicles as those other automakers and not bringing as much revenue. This is starting to change fast, and Morgan Stanley predicts that Tesla’s revenue will become industry-leading within the next five years.
Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley analyst covering Tesla, wrote in a new note to clients this week:
Most auto investors we speak still struggle with the idea that Tesla could ever be bigger than either GM or Ford. We expect Tesla revenues to be larger than GM + Ford (combined by 2027). The zero-sum game is hard to see today… should become obvious over the next 24 months.
Jonas is right that many people still can’t believe that it’s next to impossible, but those are often the same investors who thought Tesla would always only be a niche automaker, which is now producing electric vehicles at an annual rate of over one million units.
The analyst believes that Tesla’s revenue lead will also come from a much higher than average transaction price:
We estimate the typical Tesla sold commands an average transaction price (ATP) of approximately $60k or roughly 20% above the US average ATP, implying an adjusted ‘wallet share’ of 4.6%.
Here’s how the firm predicts Tesla’s shares of revenue growth in the next few years compared to GM’s:
Morgan Stanley has a $1,300 share price target on Tesla’s stock. Adam Jonas is ranked No. 645 out of 7,779 analysts on TipRanks, with a success rate of 53%, and an average return of 11.8%.

2022/02/03,"Tesla has applied to build a giant new facility, seemingly to produce cathode materials for battery manufacturing, next to “Gigafactory Texas” in Austin.
In 2020, Electrek first revealed that Tesla is going to build its next Gigafactory in Austin. Later, it was confirmed that Tesla acquired over 2,000 acres of land around the Colorado River east of the city. Two years later, Tesla has now built a giant building for the main factory at what is now called “Gigafactory Texas”.
Last month, it was confirmed that production of the Model Y has started at the new factory, and the automaker also deployed part of a battery cell production in the building. But with over 2,000 acres, Tesla has been expected to deploy several new projects around the main factory.
Last year, it was revealed that Tesla was working on a new “Project Bobcat” on around 97 acres at the site. Now, Tesla has applied for another project, codename ‘Project Cathode’, on 32 acres at the site.
In the building application obtained by Electrek (hat tip to Vinod), it says that it is going to be used as an “Industrial Use Facility”:
The applicant is proposing an Industrial Use facility along with associated improvements.
Tesla is not directly named on the application, but Michael Loftis of engineering firm Kimley-Horn is named as the applicant, which he and the firm also were named as for previous construction permits at the Gigafactory Texas project. The project is also listed as being on a parcel of land next to the Colorado River where Gigafactory Texas is located.
In the green below, you can see all the land acquired by Tesla and the orange dot is where the main building is located:
From the name of the new project, it is fairly clear that it is going to be for a cathode production factory. Tesla originally announced plans to build its own “cathode facility” during its “Battery Day” presentation in 2020.
Drew Baglino, Senior Vice President of Engineering, said at the time:
We’re gonna go and start building our own cathode facility in North America and leveraging all of the North American resources that exist for nickel and lithium, and just doing that, just localizing our cathode supply chain and production, we can reduce miles traveled by all the materials that end up in the cathode by 80%.
Tesla has since made moved to secure lithium and nickel supply from North American sources, including deals with Piedmont Lithium and Talon Metals. Several additional similar deals are expected in the coming years to accelerate the production of critical battery metals in North America.
At Battery Day, Tesla unveiled a new cathode chemistry that allows for a much more simple and cheaper production.
It was later revealed that Tesla acquired the technology from a Canadian startup.
In an update on its progress in producing its new 4680 battery cell last month, Tesla confirmed that it has already deployed battery manufacturing equipment at Gigafactory Texas and some are already in operation. A cathode manufacturing facility next to the factory would localize more of the battery cell production and could help achieve greater volume.
Tesla has previously talked about producing over 100 GWh of battery cells at Gigafactory Texas.

2022/02/03,"Tesla has released an updated version of its Supercharger map with many new upcoming stations added and updated timelines for expected completion.
The automaker aims to triple the size of its Supercharger network.
Every year, Tesla releases an updated version of its Supercharger map on its ‘find us‘ page.
With those updates, the automaker adds newly planned stations to the map and updates the timeline of the previously planned stations as those often slip behind schedule.
It can be very difficult to open a new fast-charging station as there are so many stakeholders and a long sequence of work to happen before a new station can open.
Once Tesla knows it wants, or needs, to open a new Supercharger in a specific area, it needs to find a property to build it on and get the property owners to agree to a contract.
Then the automaker needs to design the project, get it approved by the municipality and the local electric utility. Then it needs to schedule a local contractor to do the installation and work with the local utility to get it activated.
If Tesla runs into an issue with just one of those steps, a project can see a significant delay.
We are seeing a lot of that with this new map update as a lot of projects that were shown to be expected in 2021 are now seeing Q3 and Q4 2022 timelines.
But Tesla is still growing the network fast. The automaker went from 23,277 Superchargers at 2,564 stations at the end of 2020 to 31,498 Superchargers at 3,476 stations at the end of 2021.
That’s growing at a 35% year-over-year pace.
However, it is lagging behind vehicle deliveries, which grew 87% during the same period of time – on top of now gradually starting to allow non-Tesla EV owners to use the network.
It also lags behind Tesla’s own goal to triple the Supercharger network in two years.
But we are seeing many new stations planned in this map update including in the Northeast:
It looks like Tesla also added a lot of planned stations in Europe, where it is first allowing non-Tesla EV owners to use the network, and therefore, where demand is expected to grow the fastest.
Let us know in the comment section below if you are finding interesting new stations in your areas.

“FMVSS 208, S7.3 (a)-(1), requires the audible seat belt reminder chime to activate upon vehicle start (i.e., driver presses the brake pedal after entering the vehicle) if the driver seat belt is not detected as buckled. On certain MY 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles and on all MY Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, a software error may prevent the chime from activating upon vehicle start under certain circumstances. This condition is limited to circumstances where the chime was interrupted in the preceding drive cycle and the seat belt was not buckled subsequent to that interruption (e.g., the driver exited the vehicle in the preceding drive cycle while the chime was active and later returned to the vehicle, creating a new drive cycle).”
Other alerts, including the one that activates at 22 km/h if some seat belts are unbuckled, are not affected nor is the visual reminder.
Since NHTSA considers a missing seat belt chime reminder a safety risk, Tesla couldn’t just push a software update to fix the issue and it had to be made into an official safety recall.
NHTSA explains the risk in the notice:
“If the audible seat belt reminder chime does not activate at the start of a new drive cycle and the driver does not notice the accompanying visual seat belt telltale, the driver may not be reminded to buckle their seat belt and may begin operating the vehicle in an unbuckled state, which could increase the risk of injury. Tesla is not aware of any injuries or fatalities related to this condition.”
The people at the South Korea Automobile Testing & Research Institute (KATRI) are the ones who found the issue and brought it to Tesla’s attention last month.
Tesla already started pushing the software update to fix the program to the fleet last week.
Here’s the full recall notice from NHTSA:

2022/02/02,"Earlier this month, Electrek got an invite from ECD Automotive Design to come visit its facility in Orlando and discover how its team builds completely custom 1:1 electric Land Rovers. The company has recently begun building electric versions of its one-of-a-kind vehicles by integrating Tesla motors and battery packs. After a tour of its entire footprint and a test drive in a completely custom electric Defender, it’s fair to say that ECD Automotive Design puts the “custom,” in “customer service.” 
ECD Automotive was founded eight years ago over several adult beverages between two of the three founders – Scott Wallace and Tom Humble. They’re friends with no automotive manufacturing experience who thought it might be a great idea to open a custom vehicle shop – a business focused on one-of-a-kind Land Rovers from their native UK, designed with the customer in mind throughout the entire process.
Wallace recounted the boozy brainstorm to me outside ECD headquarters, sharing that when the next morning came, he had expected to hear from Tom, admitting the beers had gotten the best of them. In a clearer state of mind, the idea of making custom cars was silly, if not fleeting.
To Wallace’s surprise, Humble had instead quit his sales job. The two then recruited Tom’s younger brother Elliot from the UK, rented a 1,200 sq. ft. garage unit in Kissimmee, Florida, and ECD Automotive Design was born. 
ECD Automotive specializes in completely custom vintage Land Rovers – more specifically, D90, D110, D130 Defenders, the Series IIA, and the Range Rover Classic. Since these Land Rovers are much more prominent in the UK, the guys at ECD have cleverly figured out a process to ship them over in cost effective ways.
To import Land Rover chassis from the UK, they must be at least 25 years old. So, ECD Automotive ships the chassis alone, then newer Land Rover models are dismantled and shipped over as parts. ECD’s team then sand blasts the chassis to ensure they are quality and begins the custom rebuild with the newer parts atop them.
Remember that 1,200 sq. ft. garage I mentioned? ECD Automotive has since taken over the entire 45,000 sq. ft. facility, combining all its individual garages into various work stations, each with its own role in the build. 
According to Wallace, the entire custom vehicle process takes 14 months from the start of the design to customer delivery. That includes 2,200 hours of labor spread across 20 different stations. The custom Land Rover spends five days at each. ECD also test drives its completed builds for at least 1,000 miles before delivering them to ensure the quality and design is up to spec for its fastidious customers.
Although Wallace comes from a venture capital background, he helps run an extremely tight ship at ECD, using organized processes and technology to keep track of every single movement of each and every vehicle, from chassis to completion – putting talented individuals into roles that empower them but still hold them accountable. Each step of the process is triple checked by multiple teams, then probably checked again.
When I say these are custom vehicles, I don’t mean you simply choose your exterior color and your interior fabric (you hear that, Porsche?) These are complete 1:1 automotive works of art that are hand built to a customers’ exact specifications, which can change quite often during a 14-month process.
Wallace explained to me that once a custom Land Rover is delivered from ECD Automotive Design, it becomes the intellectual property of that customer. Should a new customer see one of ECDs many previous projects and request the same build, ECD will say no. No two vehicles that leave its assembly lines are the same, and the ECD team prides itself on that approach. 
Throughout the tour, Wallace gave me story after story of the customizations ECD Automotive has brought to fruition for its customers throughout the 400-ish builds it has completed to date. This includes everything from a custom skid plate with a message in Swahili cut out of it, to various animal furs on the dashboard and even a custom paint color to match a client’s house. 
“We always say yes,” admitted Wallace as he explained the true nucleus of ECD Automotive’s customer-first approach. Give the customer exactly what they want and keep them in the loop throughout the entire process, including after delivery by offering a warranty that covers personal and efficient fixes for any issues or damages that may arise after delivery.
If customers don’t come visit ECD’s facilities in Florida, the company will send them various leather and color samples along with video and picture updates of the build every two weeks. Customers also receive one of the original door hinges (see above) framed and sent to them as a memento of the old Land Rover before it becomes completely reborn.
Lastly, when an ECD vehicle is delivered, each customer receives their own custom book, documenting the entire assembly process with photos and professional images of the final product. This attention to detail and customer service is a large reason why ECD Automotive Design has doubled in growth YOY. 
Despite custom Defenders starting at $180k each, ECD gets plenty of repeat customers, some purchasing three or four. Wallace explained that ECD once delivered a custom Land Rover on a Saturday, and that same customer reached out about another build on Sunday. He compared it to a child leaving for college – These customers miss being part of the design process that has been a part of their life for over a year.
Recently, some customers have begun requesting electric versions of ECD’s custom Land Rovers, and who are they to say no?
As a writer of electric mobility news, the main reason for my visit was to experience one of the newer types of custom builds at ECD Automotive – all-electric Land Rovers equipped with Tesla Motors and batteries.
Currently, ECD is using an electrification kit from Electric Classic Cars (ECC) in the UK, which is comprised of one 450 kW Tesla Model S motor and two Tesla battery packs – one to use under the hood in lieu of the combustion engine and one for the rear. These 8,256 cells combine for a battery capacity of 100 kWh.
I was able to see one of the electrified versions being built and got a peek at ECD’s clever approach to putting a Tesla Motor on a 25+ year old chassis. Rather than have the electric motor turn the wheels directly, ECD’s team turns the Tesla motor 90-degrees to power the existing driveshaft. 
While electrification is somewhat new to self-described “Petrol heads” like the Humble brothers and Wallace, they are optimistic they can continue to electrify their Land Rovers and provide better specs to customers. “When building one of a kind vehicles, there isn’t a book,” Wallace told me as he spoke about all the various engine and motor options ECD Automotive can offer, “Normally by truck six or seven, we figure it out.”
That may sound like a nonchalant approach to vehicles costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, but make no mistake – even if the ECD founders sometimes fly by the seat of their pants to deliver what their customers want, the teams they have put in place that actually build the vehicles know exactly what they’re doing. One of the ECD paint team members, Gio Sarika, even showed me how to do my first hydro dip:
Following my tour, I was able to test drive a recently completed EV called Project Britton – a Land Rover Defender D110 equipped with the aforementioned Tesla Model S motor and batteries. 
ECD co-owner Elliot Humble walked me around the electric truck and showed me the batteries. As you can see from the images, the rear pack is hidden by beautiful teakwood that doubles as a bench which can be slid open for easy access. 
According to Elliot Humble, the 100 kWh battery currently delivers 170 miles of range on average, which makes sense for a vehicle much larger and less aerodynamic than a Model S. He said that if you were to drive frugally, you could probably get 200 miles of range out of it, but who wants to do that?
The current electric Land Rovers rolling out of ECD use a J1772 plug rather than the proprietary Tesla plug and support Level 1 and 2 charging. Elliot Humble told me that future electrification kits ECD acquires will soon be able to offer DC fast charging capabilities as well.
ECD Automotive Design can electrify any of its Land Rover models for customers, which tacks on about an additional $50k for the Tesla kit. 
On my drive, I noticed a mixed feeling within the electric Land Rover. The accelerator had the oomph that comes with the instant torque of an EV (which never gets old, btw), but the brake required a lot more push than I’m normally used to, more reminiscent of a combustion truck.
Once ECD’s sales and design lead, John Price, and I got out on some open road outside Orlando, I punched it over 60 mph in under five seconds. There was a whistle-like hum of the electric motor working, giving me a feeling of being inside a teakwood clad spaceship. That being said, the sound was nothing compared to the rattling and revving of a combustion engine, especially the Chevy LS3 or LT4 engines ECD currently offers.
The interior was absolutely stunning, featuring a simplistic but intuitive dash that supports the EV without losing its classic car charm. I truly enjoyed the experience and hope to be asked back when the new facility is up and running.
After driving in both an electric and combustion Land Rover, I’ll take the electric all day. According to the ECD team, most people that have driven the electric Land Rovers agree.
Looking ahead, ECD Automotive Design continues to expand. I was able to pop in and see its new 100,000 sq. ft. facility being completed across the street. The departments will slowly start switching building in the coming months. When the new space is running full steam, ECD’s build capacity will jump from 60 vehicles a year to 200. 
As EV adoption grows, ECD’s new facility should be able to support orders for more and more customers requesting all-electric Land Rovers. Currently the company is cycling about one EV a month, but as kit prices lower and electrification becomes more mainstream, ECD is confident it can sell plenty more.

2022/02/02,"Elon Musk and Tesla fans are ramping up the pressure to get recognition from President Biden, who has had a clear problem acknowledging that Tesla is leading the electrification of the auto industry in the United States. Almost 50,000 Tesla supporters have signed a petition, and someone has even bought an ad about it on Times Square.
The tension between the Biden administration and Musk and his fans has been growing for months now. The first major blow seems to have been the ceremony where President Biden signed a new executive order for 50% of new cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2030.
Tesla wasn’t invited, and both Musk and many Tesla fans took offense. However, the event was about the US automakers, like Ford and GM, committing to go 50% electric by 2030. Tesla is already all electric.
But then the Biden administration, influenced by the United Auto Worker union, pushed for reform of the electric vehicle tax credit to include an additional $4,500 credit per electric vehicle produced at a unionized factory.
Some Tesla fans saw this as an attack on Tesla since the company is the biggest US producer of electric vehicles, and its workforce is not unionized. Musk later called out Biden for “being controlled by unions.”
Things started to escalate from there when President Biden made the undoubtedly ridiculous statement that gave GM CEO Mary Barra credit for ‘electrifying the entire auto industry.’
Biden and his administration have since made several similar claims and appeared to have an issue even mentioning Tesla when it came to electric vehicles, despite the company being the biggest electric vehicle producer in the country and a big part of the administration’s plans to lower emissions.
It led Musk to tweet this last week:
Starts with a TEnds with an AESL in the middle
Since that tweet, Tesla fans have ramped up their effort to get the president to acknowledge Tesla. A fan even bought ad space in Times Square to promote Musk’s tweet (via /u/dappermarketer on Reddit):
Somoene going by ‘Poet From The Stars’ even started a petition on Change.org to have President Biden “acknowledge Tesla’s leadership in regards to electric vehicles.” Almost 50,000 people have signed the petition in just a few days.
It’s pretty comical to be honest. Tesla is undeniably the leader in electric vehicles, especially in the United States, where over 60% of all electric vehicles have been made by the company. Not even mentioning Tesla in the conversation is ridiculous.
On the other side, I don’t know why Tesla fans care so much. It’s politics. Musk is a controversial individual, and the Biden administration clearly doesn’t want to associate with him. He literally advocated for the Senate not to pass the Build Back Better act. It’s not surprising that the administration would see him as the enemy in this political climate.
If they want to show it to Biden, Musk and Tesla should just focus on continuing to build the best electric vehicles they can in the highest volume possible. Biden and his administration won’t be able to ignore them at some point.

2022/02/02,"Tesla has communicated to employees and some customers that its supply chain issues are now extending its solar roof product, and for now, it is stopping scheduling for new installations.
It’s not clear when those problems will be solved.
Supply chain issues are affecting many industries.
When it comes to Tesla, the focus is on how it is affecting its car business – which is significantly – but the Texas-based automaker is doing better, while the rest of the industry has doubled its production last year, and most other automakers saw decline year-over-year.
But the solar industry is also under great pressure from supply chain issues and Tesla’s solar business is also being affected. Last year, we reported on early signs that supply chain issues are affecting Tesla’s solar panel business.
In December, we released a report on how Tesla was starting to delay some solar rooftop projects. At the time, Tesla’s solar roof installation weren’t affected by the same issues, but now it is starting to be the case.
This week, Electrek learned that Tesla informed employees that the supply chain issues are now affecting solar roof projects:
Most of the solar industry has been experiencing supply chain delays. These constraints are beginning to impact Solar Roof as well. This will lead to delays in scheduling installations for Tesla customers not already on the calendar.
Several customers are reporting having received the following message from Tesla’s solar team:
Supply Chain Delays May Impact Your Installation Timeline
Due to supply chain delays, your installation timeline may be extended. These delays are broadly impacting the U.S. solar industry and are outside Tesla’s control. We do not currently have a firm timeline from our suppliers as to when these delays will end. We will be in touch with you as soon as we have updated information.
Thank you for your patience and for helping accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
Tesla says that it doesn’t want to share any updated timeline until it received the material from suppliers. It didn’t specify what material is problematic right now.
The company produces its own solar roof tiles at Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, but it is dependent on many suppliers, especially solar cell suppliers, who have been greatly affected by the current supply chain issues.
Last quarter, Tesla’s solar deployment was down 1% year-over-year to 85 MW.
With those supply chain issues, it’s fair to expect the down trend to be significant in Q1 20221. In Q1 2021, Tesla had deployed 92 MW of solar power. That includes both solar roof tiles and regular solar panels.

2022/02/02,"After opening strong in pre-market trading, Tesla’s stock (TSLA) fell this morning as more attention is brought to its serious phantom braking issue on Autopilot.
Back in November, Electrek released a report called ‘Tesla has a serious phantom braking problem in Autopilot.‘
It highlighted a significant increase in Tesla owners reporting dangerous phantom braking events on Autopilot.
Phantom braking is a term used to describe when an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) or a self-driving system applies the brakes for no good reason.
The system can be falsely detecting an object on the road or anticipating a collision that won’t actually happen and apply the brake to try to avoid it.
Obviously, phantom braking is something you want to avoid since it can create accidents if someone is following too closely behind you.
This issue is not new in Tesla’s Autopilot, but our report focused on Tesla drivers noticing an obvious increase in instances, which also showed in complaints to the NHTSA.
Our report made the rounds in a few other outlets, but it didn’t really go mainstream until now.
The Washington Post just posted a very similar report focusing on the NHTSA complaints, which they compiled in this chart:
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) dropped by more than 3% following the report this morning, after it was up more than 1% in pre-market trading.
In the report, NHTSA spokeswoman Lucia Sanchez said that they are talking with Tesla about the complaints:
“NHTSA is aware of complaints received about forward collision avoidance and is reviewing them through our risk-based evaluation process. This process includes discussions with the manufacturer, as well as reviewing additional data sources, including Early Warning Reporting data. If the data show that a risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately.”
Tesla has not commented on the issue. Elon Musk did admit that one of the Full Self-Driving Beta updates had a real issue with phantom braking, but this particular problem is with the Autopilot suite of features and not the FSD Beta.
Many owners are still reporting having the same problematic phantom braking rate, but at least the complaint rate with NHTSA has reduced over the last two months.
",tesla
2022/02/02,"Tesla has started to releases a new Full Self-Driving Beta software update (10.10) that includes several changes, including removing ‘rolling stop’, addressing some corner cases, and more.
Since October 2020, Tesla has been slowly rolling out what it is calling “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta), which is an early version of its self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.“
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it.
As of Q4 2021, the automaker said that it almost had 60,000 owners in the FSD Beta program.
Now Tesla is releasing the new v10.10 of FSD Beta and it includes several improvements, including the ability for the vehicle to use an upcoming lane to try to avoid an object on the road if it is deemed safe.
This shows that Tesla is increasingly venturing into making sure that FSD can not only tackle regular driving maneuvers but that it is also prepared for some rare corner cases.
The 10.10 FSD beta update also rolls back the “rolling stop” feature as part of the NHTSA safety recall announced yesterday.
Here are the full release notes:
This update came fairly quickly after 10.9 was rolled out only 2 weeks ago.
At the time, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla would expand the program to Canada within “2 to 4 weeks.”
Yesterday, the CEO said that it will be in the country by the end of the month.
We expect more updates to come frequently in the coming months as Tesla works toward the goal to achieve a full self-driving system safer than humans by the end of the year, which Musk said he would be “shocked” if it doesn’t happen.

2022/02/01,"Elon Musk is accusing an Associated Press reporter of being a lobbyist over an article about NHTSA’s recall of Tesla vehicles in the Full Self-Driving Beta program. Now his fans are attacking the journalist on Twitter.
The biggest news dominating the Tesla universe today is the recall notice that NHTSA issued about Tesla’s “rolling stop” feature in Full Self-Driving Beta. The feature enables Tesla vehicles to not stop completely at an all-way stop if it detects no other vehicle or pedestrian. Instead, it slows down to about 2 mph and continues.
It’s something fairly common that drivers do when approaching an all-way stop, but it’s technically not a legal driving maneuver, and police can give a traffic violation ticket to someone caught doing it.
Tesla appears to have implemented the feature to try to mimick normal driving behavior, but NHTSA couldn’t allow the automaker to literally program a driving habit deemed a traffic violation and potentially dangerous. So, NHTSA pushed Tesla to initiate a safety recall in the form of a software update that is going to remove the feature.
Elon Musk took issue with some of the reporting around the recall and directly accused Associated Press reporter Tom Krisher of being a lobbyist instead of a journalist:
He’s actually a lobbyist, not a journalist. There are many who pose as the latter while behaving like the former. No integrity.Indeed, there were no safety issues. The car simply slowed to ~2 mph & continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians.
The Associated Press article on the recall was rather matter of fact, but Musk (through his response to Whole Mars Catalog, a Twitter account run by Musk superfan Omar Qazi) seemed to particularly take issue with AP’s headline: “Tesla recall: ‘Full Self-Driving’ software runs stop signs.”
As for Musk’s claim that “there were no safety issues,” that wasn’t AP’s claim. NHTSA qualified the feature as a “safety risk” and wrote in the recall notice:
Entering an all-way-stop intersection without coming to a complete stop may increase the risk of collision.
As for the claim that Krisher is a “lobbyist,” Musk doesn’t seem to have based the claim on any evidence other than Krisher’s perceived behavior, as mentioned in Musk’s tweet. Krisher is a 16-year veteran of the Associated Press and has no known links to lobbying.
The journalist is now being attacked by Musk fans on Twitter after the CEO responded positively to Qazi calling him a “moron.”
This is the kind of behavior from Musk that I really dislike. Whether he wants it to or not, it is going to set all his Twitter superfans against Krisher. And, whatever your opinion of his reporting, trust me, he doesn’t deserve that.
While the headline is technically accurate, it is certainly deep on the clickbaity side of things. But, Krisher likely didn’t even write it. At large publications like AP, headlines are often created by editors pooling ideas to get the best SEO and most clicks as possible. It’s less than ideal, but that’s the unfortunate media framework these days.
As previously mentioned, the article itself was matter of fact and based on NHTSA’s own recall notice.
Now I already notice Tesla fans on Twitter attacking Krisher for what they see as “mostly negative stories about Tesla.” I don’t think that’s fair. Krisher is not a Tesla reporter. He reports on NHTSA issues. So when he reports on Tesla, it’s mostly about stories related to NHTSA investigations into Tesla. You can’t blame him for having this beat. 
Also, if Musk doesn’t like the reporting around the recall, he should blame himself for dissolving his PR deptartment. With no contact with Tesla, reporters have to solely base their reporting on this issue on the NHTSA recall notice.
Back in the day, Tesla would have reached out to reporters like Krisher before the notice was released to give more background on what led to the recall. I have been on the receiving end of these calls back when Tesla had a PR department, and they were useful. 
With that in mind, the fact that Musk would encourage someone like Qazi to call a journalist a moron – knowing that he is giving the green light to his millions of fans to go insult the person – is a terrible use of his time and doesn’t show the best part of his character, to say the least.

2022/02/01,"Tesla has launched a new ‘Charge Stats’ feature in its mobile app that gives owners more access to their charging information than ever and a clearer idea of savings compared to gas.
Over the years, Tesla has run into some issues about how it advertised “gas savings” that its vehicles can achieve.
The automaker has used gas savings in a somewhat controversial way by displaying the prices of its vehicles on its website after “potential gas savings,” which obviously can vary greatly based on a bunch of factors.
After some complaints, Tesla stopped using it for a while, but the company brought it back in 2018.
Some consumer protections agencies, including one in Germany, have asked Tesla to stop or modify the practice.
While the gas savings advertised on Tesla’s website can still vary significantly from what you will experience, Tesla owners can now get a much better idea of how much they are saving every month based on actual accurate data.
With the latest mobile app update, Tesla snuck in a new feature called ‘Charge Stats.’
You might have missed it since it wasn’t mentioned in the release notes, and many people are reporting that the update wasn’t automatic and they had to go to the app store to push it.
Once you have the latest update, you can scroll down on your vehicle page to ‘Charge Stats’:
It might only be available to Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, since it is not showing up for my Model S or Model X.
The new feature breaks down your charging over the last month based on where it is coming from:
In this case, the “other” is also home charging, but at my friend’s house since he is using my Model 3 while I’m in Mexico for the winter.
The cool part is that you can add information in order for Tesla to know the exact rate that you are paying:
This results in a much better estimate on how much you are saving if you had a gas car.
For example, with this information, it shows that we saved about $230 this month with a Model 3 on cheap hydro electricity in Quebec.
That’s based on someone doing a ~30 km commute twice a day and charging solely at home overnight.
Here’s another example from Electrek’s Seth Weintraub with a Model Y on a different kind of usage that includes Supercharging on weekend travels:
Despite almost twice the energy used, the savings are less, at $186 USD, because of the higher mix of Supercharging and the higher electricity rates in New York and Vermont where the vehicle is being used.

2022/02/01,"Tesla has launched a new software update that lets owners customize the color of their vehicle in the  user interface, allowing customers with after-market wraps or new paint jobs to color match their vehicle.
The feature is currently only available on Tesla vehicles in China.
Amongst premium automakers, Tesla is known for offering the least amount of options.
Years ago, the automaker decided to streamline its ordering process to have customers only make a handful of choices when ordering.
Tesla customers literally only have five options when it comes to the paint.
With now the automaker producing vehicles at a rate of over one million per year, and mainly Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, it results in a lot of cars looking the same on the road.
Many Tesla customers have opted to wrap their vehicles to give them a little more personality.
Tesla even announced a program to offer its own wraps to customers in China.
A downside of wrapping your Tesla is that all the renders in the in-car user interface and mobile app won’t match anymore.
It might not be a big deal for most people, but you are looking at that render all the time, since it’s always on your center screen.
Jason Hughes, aka wk057, managed to change his after wrapping his Model S bright yellow, but unless you are also a genius Tesla hacker like him, you didn’t have options… until now.
In China, Tesla launched a new feature that allows Tesla drivers to change the render to any color they want directly inside the user interface.
Here’s how it works:
The new feature was part of Tesla’s Chinese New Year software update, which also included the launch of the TeslaMic microphone.
For now, it’s only available in China, but Tesla has been known over the last year to first introduce new features in Chinese vehicles before bringing the change globally.

2022/02/01,"Tesla has been hit by a safety recall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  on all vehicles in its Full Self-Driving Beta over a feature called “rolling stop” that allows vehicles to drive past stop signs.
The automaker is going to have to roll back the feature in an upcoming software update.
NHTSA took issue with the feature first introduced in Tesla’s 2020.40.4.10 Full Self-Driving Beta software update back in the original release of FSD Beta in October 2020, but it went mostly unnoticed.
The agency met with Tesla to talk about it only on January 10, 2022, and a week later they decided to proceed with the voluntary safety recall.
Here’s how the “rolling stop” feature is described in the recall notice:
The “rolling stop” functionality is designed to allow the vehicle to travel through an all-way-stop intersection without coming to a complete stop when several operating conditions are first met. The required conditions include:
If all the above conditions are met, only then will the vehicle travel through the all-way-stop intersection at a speed from 0.1 mph up to 5.6 mph without first coming to a complete stop. If any of the above conditions are not met, the functionality will not activate and the vehicle will come to a complete stop.
NHTSA determines that “entering an all-way-stop intersection without coming to a complete stop may increase the risk of collision.”
Tesla told NHTSA that “it is not aware of any collisions, injuries, or fatalities related to this condition.”
As we previously reported, Tesla recently claimed that there hasn’t been any accident in the FSD Beta program since its launch in 2020.
However, there have only been a few thousand of vehicles in the program for the first year until Tesla ramped it up in Q4 2021.
As we reported yesterday, Tesla confirmed going from “a couple of thousand in Q3 to nearly 60,000 vehicles” in the program in Q4.
The recall notice says that it affects 53,822 vehicles.
NHTSA says that Tesla will push a new software update that will disable the “rolling stop” feature in FSD Beta:
“Tesla will disable the ‘rolling stop’ functionality on affected vehicles, starting with firmware release 2021.44.30.15. Firmware release 2021.44.30.15 is expected to begin deployment OTA to affected vehicles in early February 2022. The disablement will carry forward in firmware release 2021.44.30.15 and later releases. No further action is necessary from owners who install firmware release 2021.44.30.15 or a later release on their vehicles. Tesla does not plan to include a statement in the Part 577 owner notification about pre-notice reimbursement to owners because there is no paid repair relating to this recall’s underlying condition and owners will receive the remedy free of charge through firmware release 2021.44.30.15 or a later release.”
Tesla has previously complained about having to call this a “recall” since it is not physically recalling any product and only pushing a new software update, which can be done over-the-air unlike with many other automakers.

2022/01/31,"Tesla confirmed an interesting data point: It had 400,000 Storm Watch activations on Powerwall battery packs in 2021. The feature helps homeowners avoid power outages in extreme weather.
Back in 2018, Tesla started integrating features for Powerwall and solar customers to its mobile for vehicle owners. A year later, the company introduced a new ‘Storm Watch’ to detect storms and prepare by storing energy for use in case of power outages.
Tesla described the new feature at the time:
When a storm or severe weather is on the horizon, increasing the likelihood of a utility power outage, Powerwall triggers Storm Watch. This mode automatically charges Powerwall to maximum capacity so it can provide backup power.
The Tesla app notifies customers that Powerwall has activated Storm Watch. The mode remains active until the weather event ends, at which time the system returns to its previously selected mode. It is possible to disable this mode by going to the Tesla app, selecting ‘Customize’ and then ‘Storm Watch.’
The feature quickly proved useful as homeowners with the Tesla Powerwall in Queensland, Australia have reported that Tesla activated the feature ahead of a cyclone coming. Tesla later also used the feature for ‘hundreds’ of Powerwall owners over California wildfires.
Now a few years after Storm Watch being enabled, Tesla has increased its weather-based features and expanded Storm Watch to many more weather events:
This week, Tesla Solar announced that its fleet of Powerwalls had 400,000 Storm Watch activations in 2021:
400k Storm Watch activations in 2021, protecting customers from weather related power outageshttps://t.co/FTwK0VquvR pic.twitter.com/o4R3NmzSgh
That large number is also partly due to the increase in the number of Powerwalls deployed over the last year. Last year, Tesla announced that it deployed over 250,000 Powerwalls around the world.
This is pretty cool. I myself just got two Powerwalls installed at my place in Quebec:
My Tesla Powerwalls were installed today. One of a very few installations in Quebec. Not the best market for it, but it’s still a great alternative to a generator. pic.twitter.com/b4LmMDHD06
I plan to add independent energy production at this property at some point, and the Powerwalls will be useful to take full advantage of that, but they are mainly for backup power.
Therefore, Storm Watch is certainly one of the most interesting features to me.

2022/01/31,"Tesla has officially expanded its pilot program to open Superchargers to electric vehicles from other manufacturers in Norway and France.
Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers.
In November 2021, we saw Tesla take the first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands where non-Tesla EV owners can charge using the Tesla app.
When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it plans to slowly expand it as it tests the user experience for both new non-Tesla EV owners being onboarded on the network and current Tesla owners who are going to see more traffic at those charging stations.
Last month, we reported that Tesla was in talks to expand the program in Norway.
Today, Tesla announced the official expansion of the program to select charging stations in Norway and France:
Non-Tesla vehicles can now charge at select Superchargers in France and Norway via the Tesla app. Learn more at https://t.co/9t43ifJugM pic.twitter.com/CC4fpaNPaw
With the expansion, the automaker has significantly increased the number of stations as part of the program from just a dozen in the Netherlands to now over 40 Superchargers:
As we previously reported, Tesla is gradually opening more sites to test how other EVs are affecting the overall experience and increasing traffic at the stations.
EV drivers simply need to download the Tesla app and have a vehicle with a CCS connector to use those select Supercharger stations.
Tesla is expected to eventually give access to EV drivers to more if not all stations in Europe and use the new revenue to accelerate the expansion of the network.
The automaker is expected to also do the same in North America, but it is going to be more complicated in the market since Tesla uses its own proprietary plug instead of the CCS standard. 
Non-Tesla EV drivers are going to need an adapter the use the existing Supercharger stations.
We previously noted that being used by EVs from more than one automaker is a requirement to get access to the $7.5 billion that the US government recently announced to be investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure as part of its broader infrastructure bill that passed last year.

2022/01/31,"Elon Musk gave an update on his expected timeline for Tesla achieving Full Self-Driving capability, and he now says that he would be “shocked” if Tesla does not achieve “Full Self-Driving safer than human this year.”
We have heard that before.
Since back in 2018, Musk has been predicting that Tesla will solve “full self-driving” next year. The company made an early bet on hardware for self-driving, and it has since been promising that it can deliver the technology to millions of vehicles already on the road through software updates.
The CEO has updated the language around his predictions a few times.
For example, he previously talked about Tesla delivering a “feature complete” version of “full self-driving, which means that Tesla vehicles would have the capacity to attempt to drive by themselves on both local roads and highways with driver supervision at all times, but the capacity wouldn’t be good. In short, it can drive through intersections, but it often needs assistance from the driver with the goal that it gets better over time.
Tesla delivered that through its FSD Beta program in 2020, but it was a lot more limited than many people hoped and quite far from Musk’s original promise of Tesla having a million “robotaxis” on the road.
The automaker has made great progress since the release of FSD Beta, which is now being used by almost 60,000 Tesla owners in the US.
But despite this progress, it’s hard for many to imagine when it can lead to an actual (for real this time) full self-driving system or even if it can even happen at this point without Tesla needing a new approach with different hardware.
During Tesla’s Q4 2021 earnings call last week, the CEO updated his timeline for Tesla delivering full self-driving “safer than human” by saying that he would be “shocked” if it doesn’t happen this year:
“I would be shocked if we do not achieve Full Self-Driving safer than human this year. I would be shocked.”
Now he didn’t elaborate by what metric it would be considered “safer than human” or if that will be enough for Tesla to take responsibility for the system away from the driver, which is really the only thing that matters to consider a system self-driving.
Despite the lack of detail, the CEO was so confident that he added on Twitter this weekend that Tesla also plans on licensing its self-driving software to other automakers.
He believes that every other company developing self-driving technology is about five years behind Tesla.
It’s hard to take these predictions seriously anymore, but based on Musk’s own standard, we should be.
When admitting to having missed a few self-driving timeline predictions, the CEO once said that you can at least track whether or not progress is being made by the fact that the predicted timelines are getting shorter and not longer.
It’s not “next year” anymore, but this year.
Now give us access to the data that shows some progress. The anecdotal data from beta testers is nice, but we need something more concrete.
During the call last week, Musk even mentioned that beta testers would see improvements if they were to “plot their beta interventions per mile.”
Why doesn’t Tesla collect and release this data for the whole beta fleet? That would be the best way to track progress. 
It’s time for Tesla to do that if it wants any credibility about delivering on its goal for full self-driving.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/01/28,"Tesla gave an update on the status of its in-house production of the 4680 battery cell. The company didn’t want to confirm a production capacity, but it did say that it doesn’t expect to have supply constraints from it this year.
In 2020, Tesla unveiled its new 4680 battery cell, a new tabless cylindrical cell in a much bigger format that the company claimed six times the power and five times the energy capacity while significantly reducing the cost.
Since the unveiling, Tesla has been producing the 4680 cells at a “pilot production facility” in Fremont and deploying large-scale production at other factories, including Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
The first Tesla vehicle to feature the new 4680 battery cells is going to be the Model Y produced at Gigafactory Nevada.
Last week, we reported that Tesla planned to deliver those first new Model Ys by the end of the quarter.
After the release of the company’s Q4 2021 earnings, Tesla Senior Vice President of Engineering, Drew Baglino, provided an update on 4680 battery cell production:
“Throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680 effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible. As we sit today, sales from suppliers actually sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022. Or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans, based on the information we have. But we are making meaningful progress on the ramp curve in Kato. We’re building 4680 structural packs every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas. I was driving one yesterday and the day before. And we believe our first 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter.”
The engineering executive confirmed that first deliveries are expected by the end of the quarter using cells from the factory on Kato road in Fremont, but he didn’t confirm the production capacity of the pilot plant.
While Tesla is calling it a “pilot factory”, the automaker had announced a goal to produce 10 GWh of battery cells at the plant, which is more than many other full-scale battery cell factory.
Baglino also said that Tesla is making progress deploying cell production capacity at GIgafactory Texas:
“Our focus on the cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we’re ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year. And the 4680 and pack tool installations here at Giga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing first parts.”
Gigafactory Texas is expected to be the first full-scale 4680 battery cell production facility with a capacity of over 100 GWh per year.
With the facility in Kato, and eventually the start of production in Texas, and 4680 supply from cell suppliers, Tesla doesn’t expect a constraint in 4680 cells this year.
CEO Elon Musk said that chip supply is still Tesla’s main production constraint for 2022.
He expects the situation to improve later this year, and that next year, battery cell supply might again become Tesla’s biggest bottleneck in increasing production.

2022/01/28,"Tesla has launched a new product: a microphone called ‘TeslaMic’ designed for its in-car karaoke system.
It’s only available in China for now.
Today, Tesla started pushing its ‘Chinese New Year’ software update in China.
Like in the rest of the world, Tesla often bundles up features for a bigger end-of-the-year software update that most often includes some fun features.
For the Chinese New Year update, Tesla went a step further and actually also launched a physical product.
The company released the ‘TeslaMic,’ a microphone designed to work with Leishi KTV, a karaoke system that is being included as part of the update.
The device has launched on Telsa’s Chinese merch store for 1,199 Chinese Yuan (~$188 USD):
The webpage to order the new microphone, which comes in a set of two, has been crashing.
With the release of its V10 software in 2019, Tesla launched a new in-car ‘Caraoke’ feature to its vehicles. It plays a limited list of songs with lyrics appearing on the center display.
But in the new 2022.2.1 software update in China, the company is launching a more complete karaoke system using Leishi KTV’s interface and catalog, and running on the in-car computer:
According to Tesla’s description, the TeslaMic pairs automatically with the system and it comes equipped with a few sound modes to help out the singers.
It can also be used outside Tesla vehicles, as the automaker showed in a video demonstration of the 2022.2.1 software update released on its official Weibo account:
TeslaMic is only available in China, but as we recently reported, the automaker expanded its US trademark to audio products. It could mean that Tesla is preparing to launch the TeslaMic in other markets.
Karaoke is a hugely popular hobby in many Asian countries, and it has gained in popularity in China over the last decade, with the mainland now reportedly having over 50,000 karaoke venues.

2022/01/27,"Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla is not working on its previously announced $25,000 electric car right now because it has “too much on its plate”.
At Tesla Battery Day in 2020, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will be making a $25,000 electric car.
The CEO commented in the announcement:
Tesla will make a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that is also fully autonomous.
He made it clear that this new price point is achieved through Tesla’s new battery cell and battery manufacturing effort, which could reduce battery costs by over 50%.
The $25,000 Tesla electric car, which is often referred to as the “Tesla Model 2,” has been likened to a new electric hatchback that Tesla has been planning to produce at Gigafactory Shanghai in China and export globally.
In 2020, Tesla announced plans to establish a new R&D center in China to build “a Chinese-style” electric car.
Tesla started taking design submissions for its Chinese-made small electric car that summer and started hiring for the program shortly afterward.
At the time, the automaker also released this early design drawing of a small electric hatchback. It led many to think that it was the design direction and form factor that Tesla is going for in the upcoming electric vehicle:
We recently reported on some media reports coming out of China that claimed the production of the Model 2 could start imminently, however, we warned that this isn’t likely to happen.
Last year, we reported on Musk telling employees in a company-wide meeting that Tesla is aiming to release a $25,000 electric car in 2023 and it will likely not have a steering wheel.
Now during Tesla’s Q4 2021 earnings, Musk was asked by shareholders about the status of the $25,000 Tesla and the CEO responded:
“Well, we’re not currently working on the $25,000 car. At some point, we will, but we have enough on our plate right now, too much on our plate, frankly. So, at some point, there will be.”
Musk confirmed that work on the new model is paused.
Then he added that a $25,000 model doesn’t matter as much if you achieve self-driving:
“It’s sort of the wrong question. Really, it’s really the thing that overwhelmingly matters is when is the car autonomous? I think, at the point in which it is autonomous, the cost of transport drops by, I don’t know, a factor of four or five.”
The value of autonomous driving is something that the CEO reiterated several times during the call.
During the call, I sensed some frustration from Musk about people not appreciating the value of self-driving.
For example, when an analyst asked him how Tesla expects to sell over 3 million vehicles in 2024 with only Model 3, Model Y, and some Cybertruck, Musk said that those vehicles will sell a lot more with self-driving adding value to them. He again implied that people don’t appreciate the value it will add.
However, I don’t think that’s the problem. I think most people understand how much value self-driving capability has.
I think the issue is whether or not people believe Tesla can achieve the self-driving capability and on Musk’s timeline, which he reiterated is by the end of the year, which he has said every year since 2018.
I think some skepticism on that front is quite healthy, to be honest.

2022/01/27,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla is going to be shifting its product development to make Tesla Bot, a humanoid robot also known as Optimus, a priority in 2022.
This is quite a surprising change of strategy.
When Tesla Bot was announced, Musk presented the project as something Tesla could do by leveraging existing work and parts from the development of self-driving technology, and if they don’t do it, someone else will, and they might not do it as well or as safely as Tesla can.
The CEO said that Tesla was aiming to have a prototype of the humanoid robot ready by the end of 2022, but it certainly didn’t appear to be a priority for the company.
Many saw it as another recruiting opportunity for Tesla as the company was trying to secure AI talent to help advance its self-driving efforts.
In the last few weeks, we noted what appears to be a shift on the Tesla Bot, now known as “Tesla Optimus” as Musk says that the name is sticking.
Musk announced that Tesla could play a role in making Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) a reality through the humanoid robot project.
Then yesterday, we reported on Tesla’s AI director, Andrej Karpathy, stating he “believes ‘Tesla Bot’ is on track to become the most powerful AI development platform.”
It became clear that the humanoid robot powered by Tesla AI is becoming a more important project within the company.
Now Musk confirmed it during his product roadmap update in Tesla’s Q4 2021 earnings result.
The CEO said:
In terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we’re doing this year is the Optimus humanoid robot.
Product development generally refers to the process of bringing a product to market.
With Cybertruck expected to be Tesla’s next product launch, it was expected that it will be the product development priority in 2022 for a launch late this year, but the electric pickup truck was delayed again.
During the announcement, Musk reiterated that he believes Tesla’s upcoming robot can help solve labor shortage:
I think “Tesla Optimus” has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time. If you think about the economy, the foundation of the economy is labor. Capital equipment is distilled labor. So, what happens if you don’t actually have a labor shortage? I’m not sure what an economy even means at that point. That’s what Optimus is about. So, very important.
The CEO also said that the first use of Tesla Optimus will be at the company’s own factories as he stated “if we can’t find a use for it, then we shouldn’t expect that others would.”

2022/01/26,"Tesla confirmed today that it is delaying the start of Cybertruck production as supply chain issues, especially the chip shortage, would limit volumes significantly. The new timeline is now quite vague.
When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, Tesla said that the electric pickup truck would make it to market by the end of 2021. As the deadline was approaching, the automaker confirmed that production slipped to 2022. 
CEO Elon Musk later said that Tesla was targeting a start of production for the electric pickup truck in “late 2022” at Gigafactory Texas. With the focus clearly on bringing the Model Y to production at the factory, and that being delayed as well, it appeared likely that the Cybertruck production timeline could also slip.
Today, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the Cybertruck timeline has slipped again.
Musk said that Tesla would not launch any new vehicle this year due to supply chain constrained. In a conference call following the release of its Q4 2021 financial results, the CEO explained that any new vehicle launch this year wouldn’t actually help Tesla deliver more total electric vehicles in 2022 since some parts shared between vehicles, especially chips, wouldn’t see more supply.
As for the new timeline for the Cybertruck, Musk only said that it would “hopefully come next year,” which would mean sometime in 2023. The company didn’t issue new specs or pricing for the vehicle despite removing those from its website last year.
Lately, a new Tesla Cybertruck prototype has been spotted around Gigafactory Texas.
Obviously, this is very disapointing news, especially for the reportedly more than 1 million people who reserved the electric pickup truck. Not only did we not get the updated specs and pricing for the truck, it gets delayed by an unknown amount of time.
Tesla is going to be falling further behind in the race to deliver electric pickup trucks, which are much needed to accelerate EV adoption in the US – a large market for pickup trucks.
It is good news for companies like Rivian and Ford, who at this point are not only beating Tesla to bringing electric pickup trucks to market but also seem in good position to beat Tesla to volume production of electric pickup trucks.
However, the latter is still dependent on those two executing on their ramp-ups.

2022/01/26,"Tesla confirmed that Model Y production started at Gigafactory Texas late in 2021, and now the company is working on “final certification” for the new version of the electric SUV being built at the new factory.
It looks like Tesla didn’t actually miss its goal to start production at Gigafactory Texas by the end of 2021. The company confirmed its new Q4 2021 earnings report that it started “builds of Model Ys”:
Builds of Model Ys started in late 2021 at Gigafactory Texas.
This is not surprising considering many fully-built Model Y vehicles were spotted at Gigafactory Texas over the last few weeks.
Tesla confirmed that it is now waiting for “final certification” of the new version of the Model Y built in Austin to start deliveries:
After final certification of Austin-made Model Y, we plan to start deliveries to customers.
As we reported last week, sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is now aiming to start deliveries of the new Model Y by the end of the quarter – likely toward the end of March. However, final approval is not solely dependent on Tesla, and it could be delayed.
No buyer has reported receiving a VIN for a Model Y from Austin to date.
In the Q4 report, Tesla released several new pictures of Gigafactory Texas that show some progress in deploying production capacity:
The last picture shows one of the innovations that is featured in the new Model Y built in Austin. With the structural battery pack consisting of the floor of the vehicle’s body, Tesla can directly attach the seats to it to simplify the assembly process.
While Tesla didn’t exactly confirm that the new Model Y in Austin will feature the new 4680 cells in the structural pack, it almost did by making the distinction that the first new Model Y built at Gigafactory Berlin will feature 2170 cells.
We expect Tesla to give more details in the earnings conference call starting at 5:30 ET.

2022/01/26,"Tesla has quietly unveiled a fleet of new ‘Tesla Semi’ electric trucks as part of its new financial result report. 
Yet, there’s no word on the status of production and customer deliveries.
The situation around the Tesla Semi has been unclear over the last few months.
The electric truck has already been delayed several times, as it was originally supposed to be delivered in 2019.
While Tesla has been making progress toward bringing its electric semi-truck to low-volume production in Nevada, the automaker confirmed last year that customer deliveries of the Tesla Semi are pushed to 2022.
Some new prototypes have been spotted around Gigafactory Nevada over the last few months, and the CEO of Pepsico even said that he was expecting to get his first few Tesla Semi trucks by the end of the year.
That didn’t happen, but the first deliveries could be imminent.
Tesla surprisingly didn’t comment on the status of Tesla Semi production in its earnings report today, but it did release a new image of a small fleet of four brand new units:
This is the most Tesla Semi trucks that we have seen at the same place ever.
They appear to be parked at Tesla’s new Megacharger station at Gigafactory Nevada, where the automaker has deployed some low-volume production capacity.
While Tesla didn’t comment on the status of the vehicle program in the earnings report, the company could comment on it in the following conference call.
Shareholders are going to be looking at an update on the production specs, pricing, and a better look at the production ramp, which is going to be needed to start making a dent in the long backlog of orders.

2022/01/26,"Tesla (TSLA) has released its financial results and shareholders letter for the fourth quarter of 2021, and consequently for its full-year 2021, after market close today.
We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders’ letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information.
Yesterday, we posted our Tesla Q4 2021 earnings preview with Wall Street expectations.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.112 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.30 per share.
It represents both massive quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in expectation – mainly due to the fact that Tesla confirmed record deliveries of over 300,000 vehicles during that quarter.
Now Tesla has posted the full results in its new shareholder’s letter and presentation (see below) and confirmed that it beat expectations on both revenue and earnings.
The company reported $17.7 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.54 per share (Non-GAAP).
Tesla generated over $2 billion in profits during the quarter for a total of over $5.5 billion in 2021 despite significant investments into future production:
“Additionally, we generated $5.5B of GAAP net income and $5.0B of free cash flow in 2021 – after spending $6.5B to build out new factories and on other capital expenditures.”
The company also achieved an impressive 30.6% gross margin on its vehicles in Q4, but it goes down to 29.2% when excluding regulatory credits – still way better than the rest of the industry.
Tesla’s cash position as also increased significantly this quarter:
“Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased sequentially by $1.5B to $17.6B in Q4, driven mainly by free cash flow of $2.8B, partially offset by net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.5B. Our total debt excluding vehicle and energy product financing has fallen to just $1.4B at the end of 2021.”
A very interesting disclosure is that Tesla incured a massive $340M payroll tax expense over CEO Elon Musk’s compensation plan in Q4. That was a big hit on their profitability.
We will be posting our follow-up posts here about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts):

2022/01/26,"Tesla’s Director of Artificial Intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, says that he believes ‘Tesla Bot’ is “on track to become the most powerful AI development platform.”
Since Tesla AI Day last year, CEO Elon Musk has been slowly pushing the idea that Tesla is becoming more of an AI/robotics company.
Musk has been boasting about the company’s AI talent, led by Director of Artificial Intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, and believes that the company is in the best position to make advancements in AI due to the real-world applications in its vehicles.
More recently, the CEO even suggested that Tesla could play a role in making Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) a reality through the ‘Tesla Bot’ project, a humanoid robot.
The project has been seen more as a tool to attract AI and robotic talent to the company, and surely Tesla has been in a hiring mode for AI talent since the event and the big reveal of the plans for a robot.
On his LinkedIn page this week, Karpathy shared a new batches of job listings:
– Deep Learning Engineer / Scientist – Software Engineer, Deep Learning Infrastructure– Software Engineer, Deep Learning – Software Engineer, Evaluation– Backend Engineer, AI Tooling– Frontend Engineer, AI Tooling
The AI expert elaborated on the positions:
“I am hiring Deep Learning Engineers for the Tesla AI team. Strong software engineering is the primary requirement. Except for the scientist role, deep learning interest or knowledge is only a bonus (we will teach you). For the deep learning scientist role any domain outside of computer vision (e.g. speech, NLP, etc.) works great too.”
Karpathy suggested that applicants watch the Tesla AI Day presentation to get an idea of what Tesla is trying to accomplish with AI.
The Tesla Bot project was unveiled at the end of the presentation as sort of a “one more thing” moment by Musk, and the rest of the presenters, including Karpathy, didn’t comment much on it.
In this new post to seek applications from deep learning experts, Karpathy did mention that he believes Tesla Bot is “on track to become the most powerful AI development platform”:
“There is no other organization that vertically integrates, develops, and deploys cutting-edge robotics AI at this scale. Our goal is to improve the safety and comfort of driving along the way to automating transportation with Full Self-Driving. We are also applying everything we’ve learned to our humanoid robot “Tesla Bot”, which I believe is on track to become the most powerful AI development platform.”
The comment is in line with Musk’s recent announcement that Tesla Bot “testing against the real world” will help advance AI technology.

2022/01/26,"Tesla released an interesting new video demonstration to visualize how its HEPA filter and bioweapon defense mode in the Model Y can keep cabin air clean.
Watch it below.
With the Model X and later the Model S, Tesla has started to put massive HEPA-rated air filters inside its vehicles.
The idea is for Tesla to put efforts into developing a more powerful air filtering system in order to not only contribute to the reduction of local air pollution with electric vehicles but also to reduce the direct impact of air pollution on the occupants of its vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk credited Google cofounder Larry Page for turning him onto the idea.
The automaker claims that the filter in the Model X is about 10 times larger than a normal car filter, and it is “100 times more effective than premium automotive filters,” as it removes “at least 99.97% of fine particulate matter and gaseous pollutants, as well as bacteria, viruses, pollen and mold spores.”
When it is operating at full blast, Tesla claims that it is powerful enough to protect against a bioweapon attack — hence the name of the mode.
Musk said that Tesla didn’t have space in the Model 3 for a big enough HEPA filter to make the “bioweapon defense mode” work, but the bigger Model Y has the space.
Tesla first introduced the filter and bioweapon defense mode in the electric SUVs produced in China.
Last year, the automaker made it standard in all Model Y vehicles that it produces.
Now Tesla has released a video demonstration about the air filtration system that can successfully help visualize the function:
Tesla released smoke bombs in an air-tight enclosure where both a Model Y and what appears to be a BMW (the company was careful not to focus too much on the baseline vehicle) are parked.
In the Model Y, Tesla activated the “bio-weapon defense mode,” which is a function that basically pressurizes the cabin and forces all the air to go through the HEPA filter.
You can clearly see that the cabin remains smoke free, which doesn’t appear to be the case in the other car.
Now that’s far from a scientific test, especially since they didn’t show what climate controls were on in the other car, but it does help visualize what the HEPA filter is able to catch.
However, when first introducing the feature in the Model X in 2015, Tesla did release some test results with PM2.5 air quality readings that showed the system greatly improved the air quality when needed.

2022/01/25,"Tesla has started pushing a new software update that enables Autopilot to better use regenerative braking. It should result in higher efficiency and a smoother experience in stop-and-go traffic, where Autopilot is really useful.
Regenerative braking is one of the coolest things about electric vehicles. An average electric powertrain is already much more efficient than even the best internal combustion engines, but the gap can be widened even further with intelligent use of regenerative braking.
Automakers have incorporated the technology in many different ways to control the strength of the regenerative braking, which consists of harnessing energy while slowing a vehicle to help charge the battery by tapping into the ability of an electric motor to turn into a generator.
Tesla has been known to have one of the most aggressive regenerative braking systems, but it has the lowest level of customization. The automaker previously only had two options – standard and low – but it removed them in 2020 to only have the standard as default.
New EV drivers may need some time to adapt to stronger regenerative braking, which can even enable one-pedal driving as the car can sometimes come to a complete stop quite rapidly just by taking your foot off the accelerator.
For Tesla, Autopilot adds another layer to regenerative braking since it is controlled automatically when using the traffic-aware cruise control feature. Autopilot uses both the regenerative braking and the regular brake pads, but it can always improve the balance for efficiency.
Now Tesla has started to release a new software update (2022.4) that improves on this balance to use more regenerative braking at low speed.
The automaker wrote in the release notes:
Regenerative Braking in Autopilot
Autopilot will now use more regenerative braking at low speeds for higher efficiency and an improved driving experience, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Increased use of regenerative braking results in less brake pedal noise and smoother stops.
The software update is now starting to be pushed to the fleet, but it can take days to weeks to propagate completely.

2022/01/25,"Tesla appears to have finally agreed to walk back one feature of its controversial yoke steering wheel, as it will now provide a regular horn.
When Tesla unveiled the new Model S with the “yoke” butterfly steering wheel, it was controversial. Some were worried about the actual shape of the wheel being problematic, while others were concerned about the lack of drive stalk to choose the drive mode.
As for the former, we thought that the automaker wouldn’t risk bringing the controversial yoke steering wheel to market without a nonlinear steering curve enabled by a steer-by-wire system – especially knowing that Tesla has been developing a steer-by-wire system.
However, as Tesla started deliveries of the new Model S Plaid last year, we were surprised to see that the wheel had a normal 14.0:1 steering ratio, and it is proving to be impractical at lower speeds. CEO Elon Musk later confirmed that Tesla is indeed working on progressive steering, but it’s still years away. As for the lack of stalks, Tesla replaced all their functions with force touch buttons on the wheel, even for things like turn signals and the horn.
Musk’s logic is that “all input is an error”, and that the car should automatically perform all the functions that were on the stalks (now on the force touch buttons).
However, the capability is not quite there yet, especially when it comes to the horn, and Tesla has been quite stubborn when it comes to the yoke steering wheel. Despite several Model S Plaid prototypes spotted with regular steering wheels, the automaker has refused to offer it as an option.
Now, it looks like Tesla actually backed off on one feature.
A Redittor on /r/TeslaMotors spotted a new Tesla Model S with a sticker that said “Airbag horn enabled in SW-352573”:
Tesla appears to be testing a new version of its steering wheel with a regular horn activated that has a press on the center of the wheel where the airbag is located. Along with the turn signal, this has been amongst the most requested changes to the yoke steering wheel.
It’s not clear when the change could be coming to the production version of the Model S and Model X – Tesla’s two models using the yoke – but we have been expecting an update to the Model S after new design features were spotted on a new version of the Model S for international markets.

2022/01/25,"Tesla (TSLA) is set to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial results tomorrow, January 26, after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management is scheduled after the results.
This time things should be a bit different, as a product roadmap update is also expected.
Here we’ll take a look below at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.
As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q4 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drives the vast majority of the company’s revenue.
Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered 308,600 electric vehicles during the last quarter.
That’s a new record and brought the full-year total to over 936,000 vehicles delivered in 2021.
The deliveries were significantly above the Wall Street consensus this quarter and the firms have been updating their expectations for revenue and earnings over the month in order to adjust.
Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results.
For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect thanks to the delivery numbers.
The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $17.112 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $17.416 billion.
Unsurprisingly, the market is expecting a significant quarter-over-quarter increase due to the rise in deliveries.
Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years: Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus are in gray, actual results are in green:
Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful doing so over the last two years now.
For Q4 2021, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $2.3 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is slightly higher with a profit of $2.51 per share.
The earnings are more of a hit-or-miss since it depends on how much Tesla is spending that quarter, and with supply chain issues and cost increasing at new factories being brought online, it could be not as profitable despite record revenues.
Or not. It’s hard to tell.
Here are the earnings per share over the last two years: Estimize predictions in blue, Wall Street consensus in gray, actual results in green:
As we previously reported, this earnings call and shareholder’s letter is expected to be a bit different since Elon Musk said he will be returning to the call and bringing a “product roadmap update“.
That’s new because the CEO previously said that he doesn’t like to make product announcements on earnings calls.
We expect a lot of the focus of that will be on bringing Model Y to production at Gigafactory Texas and Berlin, updated Cybertruck design, specs, pricing, and timeline, and maybe a few more things if we are lucky.
Over the last few earnings call, Tesla has been using the website ‘Say‘ to gather questions from retail investors and respond to the top-voted ones.
Here are a few of the top ones, which we should expect answers to tomorrow:

2022/01/24,"Guangdong Hongtu Technology (GHT), a part supplier to Chinese EV automakers like NIO and XPeng, announced it will begin developing a 12,000-ton die-casting unit with the help of Tesla supplier LK Technology. Recent responses from representatives at NIO and XPeng hint that they might soon be using GHT’s large, one-piece die-casting machines to manufacture their own EVs. 
As one of the biggest global names in EVs, Tesla needs little introduction. While its expanding US facilities sit as some of the biggest and best, Tesla also has Chinese manufacturing in place, which includes its famed Giga Press, a 6,000-ton die-casting machine used to produce larger, one-piece EV components such as single front and rear pieces for the Model Y. 
Last November, we reported news from Tesla’s die-casting supplier LK Technology, which stated it was working with six Chinese automakers to deploy similar manufacturing technology. At the time, an LK Technology engineer stated that these Chinese automakers still had a ways to go in vehicle design before the supplier could deliver the large die-casting machines.
At least two Chinese automakers may have figured out how to adapt similar manufacturing techniques to Tesla, with the help of a mutual part supplier called Guangdong Hongtu Technology. 
A recent ceremony announcing plans to launch die-casting units hints that NIO and XPeng could be applying the technology to their own assembly lines soon.
CnEVPost covered a ceremony out of China in which Guangdong Hongtu Technology (GHT) announced it will launch 6,800-ton chassis integrated structural parts. Furthermore, the Chinese auto parts supplier has as entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of LK Technology to purchase eight large and super die-casting machines.
GHT stated it will work with partners like LK Technology to develop a 12,000-ton die-casting unit as well – that’s double the size of Tesla’s current Giga Press machines currently used for EV manufacturing. 
GHT did not get into any further details of the Chinese automakers that may utilize this manufacturing technology, but some did participate at the event. The report points out that Zeng Shuxiang, NIO’s XPT Motor Division CEO, congratulated the company on screen via a pre-recorded video. 
Additionally, XPeng Motors VP Jiang Ping gave a speech stating Guangdong Hongtu’s expansion in one-piece die-casting is a milestone event. As previously mentioned, both Chinese automakers currently work with GHT for automotive parts. 
While neither of these Chinese companies has publicly acknowledged plans to use GHT’s die-cast manufacturing technology to emulate Tesla, they haven’t said otherwise either. Adapting this manufacturing technique could be a major game changer for any Chinese automaker beyond Tesla choosing to use it.

2022/01/24,"Tesla is now operating the most productive car factory in the US, according to a new report tracking all US auto factories.
Just a few years ago, many players in the auto industry couldn’t imagine that Tesla could become a major manufacturer. After all, it was the first US car startup to not go bankrupt since Ford. But over the last few years, Tesla has truly emerged into a major car manufacturer with an annual production rate of over 1 million cars as of the last quarter.
Much of that growth is coming from Tesla’s Gigafactory Shanghai, but the automaker is also growing at Fremont factory.
Bloomberg put together an interesting tracker of production at some of the biggest auto plant in North America, and Tesla’s Fremont factory takes the number one spot:
In times when most automakers see their production going down amidst the pandemic and the subsequent supply chain issues, Tesla actually managed to increase production at Fremont factory.
Combining the two trends, Tesla Fremont factory has managed to take the top spot (see Bloomberg’s article for an interactive version tracking all the factories):
Tesla is also apparently more efficient with its use of space at its factories.
In square-feet, Toyota has almost twice the space as Fremont factory, but produces about the same number of vehicles:
Also, Tesla is known as one of the most vertically integrated automakers as makes a lot of parts in-house, which helped the company grow during the supply chain issues. At Tesla’s last shareholders meeting, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla plans to still grow at Fremont factory.
Of course, the automaker is also building a bigger (almost 8 million sq-ft.) factory in Austin, Texas.
Gigafactory Texas is expected to be even more efficient with Tesla building the new Model Y using its single-piece rear, front casting parts, and structural battery pack.
Tesla has previously indicated that the new factory could produce 1 million vehicles per year once it reaches full production. That’s almost 20,000 vehicles per week.

2022/01/24,"After a few pictures leaked this weekend, we now have a full video walkaround of Tesla’s latest Cybertruck prototype.
As we previously reported, some pictures of the latest Tesla Cybertruck have leaked this weekend. It appears to be from Gigafactory Texas, where the automaker plans to build the electric pickup truck late this year. The pictures gave us a better look at the lack of door handles as well as the new wheels without any aero cover on.
But now, a video of the same Cybertruck prototype was released and it gives us an even closer look at the truck. The video appears to have been filmed by contractors or new employees at Gigafactory Texas, based on the commentary on the video that was shared on Facebook:
The prototype appears similar to the one spotted on the test track at Fremont factory last month. It features the same design changes in the front and the giant wiper, which CEO Elon Musk said won’t be the one on the production version.
Here’s a closer look at that giant wiper from the new video:
The previous video of the Cybertruck prototype was from a drone flyover.
In this new video, we can see people standing around the car, giving the impression that it might be smaller than the original prototype, but that’s hard to confirm.
It still looks pretty big to me, and the design can be deceiving in terms of size. The video also gives us a good look at the bed with the tonneau cover opened or missing:
The Tesla Cybertruck is supposed to have an automatically retractable bed cover and Musk said that the automaker also planned to offer a solar power option on the cover. As noted in our post about the leaked pictures, it shows that the Cybertruck prototype doesn’t have door handles.
That’s something Musk previously confirmed about the updated design, but he didn’t say the doors would open – they are expected to open automatically when detecting the owner approaching as the original Model X front door did, but that is still unconfirmed.
Tesla is expected to give an official update on the Cybertruck program on Wednesday during its earnings report.

2022/01/24,"According to a new report, Panasonic is investing $700 million to produce Tesla’s 4680 battery cell at a factory in Japan by 2023.
Tesla is preparing to start production of its first vehicle using its 4680 battery cell, a new tab-less battery cell in a bigger format with new chemistry unveiled in 2020.
For the first time, the automaker plans to produce its own cells to support its electric vehicle production.
However, Tesla is going to need so many cells that it is also partnering with current battery suppliers to deploy their own production of the new 4680 cell.
Panasonic, Tesla’s oldest battery partner, has tentatively announced that it would be deploying a prototype production line for the new battery cell.
Later, Panasonic’s new CEO, Yuki Kusumi, said that it is prepared to make a “large investment” in producing Tesla’s new battery cell if test production proves successful.
In October 2021, the Japanese manufacturer unveiled its own 4680 cell developed with Tesla.
Now a new report from Nikkei Asia claims today that Panasonic has green-lighted an 80 billion yen ($705 million) investment at its Wakayama factory in Japan to produce the 4680 cell for Tesla.
Panasonic didn’t want to comment on the report and said that it is still focused on its test production line:
We are studying various options for mass production, including a test production line we are establishing this business year. We don’t, however, have anything to announce at this time.
The report said that Panasonic was planning a production output of less than 10 GWh at the plant.
At an average pack size of 60 kWh, that’s enough to produce over 150,000 vehicles per year.
However, it is anticipated that Panasonic could also deploy new production lines for the 4680 cells at other factories, including potential GIgafactory Nevada where the company already produces 2170 cells for Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y vehicles produced at Fremont factory.
Along with Panasonic, LG, Samsung, and CATL have all also indicated that they aim to produce 4680 cells for Tesla.
Along with its own battery cell production, which is being deployed at Gigafactory Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai, Tesla said that it will buy every battery cell it can from suppliers for the foreseeable future.

2022/01/24,"A couple of new photos leaked over the weekend of the Tesla Cybertruck, giving us a closer look at design changes that we’ve spotted recently from afar.
The photos were posted to Cybertruck Owners’ Club forum and have inspired quite a reaction so far.
The same… er, “unconventional” look of the original prototype is maintained, with large flat body panels, sharp angles, and a massive windshield. But there have been a few notable changes between the original unveiling and now.
The rims are perhaps the most notable change that we haven’t seen before. In the recent drone video of the Cybertruck driving around Tesla’s test track in Fremont, the wheels looked different than these photos today.
And those wheels were, in turn, different from the original prototype, which had a large plastic wheel cover that improves vehicle aerodynamics and also added to the vehicle’s blocky and aggressive look:
These new rims look similar in design to the Model 3 standard wheels with removed aero covers. Zooming in closer to the new photo, we see that the tires have the same design as the Cybertruck prototype with seven “spokes” on the tire sidewall corresponding to the seven ridges on the original prototype wheel covers. As such, we suspect that these rims were hiding underneath the wheel covers all along, and that the Cybertruck will have removable wheel covers like the Model 3 and Model Y base wheels.
On the original prototype, there was no windshield wiper or side mirrors – this is common on concept vehicles that are not intended to be driven on normal roads.
Car designers for years have been imagining a future where side mirrors are replaced by cameras, which allow for a cleaner design and better aerodynamics, but this dream has clashed with safety regulators who aren’t quite ready for it yet. Tesla would like to ship the Cybertruck without side mirrors, and has designed them to be “easy to remove” should regulations be updated to allow cameras instead of mirrors.
The massive front windshield requires an equally massive windshield wiper, which we get a closer look at in these leaked photos – one huge blade on the driver’s side of the windshield, which looks to extend across the entire windshield in one large sweep. Tesla has been designing their own electromagnetic wiper system, which is rumored to appear on the Cybertruck.
While we’re on the windshield, the windshield now looks to have a slight curve to it (as was also visible in the drone video), whereas the original prototype was completely flat. The LED light bar at the top of the windshield is not visible in either this new photo or the drone video – maybe it’s better hidden, or maybe it has been removed.
Another thing missing from this new prototype are the door handles. In previous iterations, the Cybertruck had flat but visible door handles that would “present” as in the original Model S, but Tesla confirmed since then that the production version will have no door handles at all. The car instead will recognize you walking up and open the door for you. Tesla seems to be following through with that idea, as there’s no hint of a door handle in these photos.
As for changes to the overall proportions of the vehicle, given that we only have two photos from one angle, it’s hard to tell if there are any differences. A lot of apparent changes could just be perspective or lighting tricks, so we can’t be authoritative here, but, it does look like the front end has changed a little bit.
In the original prototype, the front end was more angular and the front edge above the headlights jutted out a bit, even beyond the bumper. This was immediately pointed out by many as a big no-no, since safety regulations require that vehicles be designed to minimize pedestrian injury in a crash, and a high pointy bumper would probably not do that.
It looks like, in these new photos, the top edge of the headlights has been brought back slightly, and the plastic bumper underneath has been made larger (including larger air intake) and to jut out a little farther. Again, it could just be a trick of perspective, but if there has been a change, it was likely done to get closer to satisfying pedestrian safety regulations.
Update: After this post, a walkaround video leaked and it looks like, while the lower bumper area has been made larger, the headlight still does stick out beyond the plane of the bumper. Thus, we still suspect this area will be subject to some redesign before the car is homologated.
These changes definitely show a vehicle that is getting closer to being “real,” with the addition of mirrors and a windshield wiper and what looks like some changes to the bumper. Removable wheel covers will come as a welcome change to many, as some think the Model 3 wheels look better with the aerodynamic covers taken off (I think you’re all crazy – not only do they look better with the aero covers, the car performs better with them on).
But the same basic design of the Cybertruck is still there. For those who have been eagerly awaiting this truck for years now, it will be refreshing that the original shape of the concept has been largely maintained. But for me, well, I still find it hideous. I was told it would grow on me, and I said I knew it wouldn’t, and it just hasn’t. But that’s just me, and I’m not in the market for one anyway.
I still do respect the idea of doing something different, and perhaps the manufacturing cost savings from a simpler design will turn out to be beneficial, but I’d still never want to be seen driving one myself. Luckily there are many other electric truck options available now or soon for prospective buyers depending on how radical your aesthetic tastes tend to skew – the F-150 Lightning, Silverado EV, Rivian and Hummer EV, roughly in that order.
How about you? What do you think about these new design changes? Let us know in the comments.

2022/01/22,"Just a decade ago, EVs were barely an afterthought when it came to transportation, and even those trailblazers who embraced them wouldn’t necessarily call the segment “sexy.” A lot of that changed with Tesla’s original Roadster, followed by other cool looking EVs that helped pave the way (and get legacy automakers to wake tf up). With over twenty new EV models scheduled to arrive this year alone, the thirst for EVs has never been greater. That’s evidence based on all of our Google search data, which has been compiled to present some of the most sought after EVs around the world – even if some don’t technically exist yet.  
This study was published by Lease Fetcher, which utilized Google search volume data for EVs across 168 different countries. From there, the team compiled three separate top ten lists of most sought after EVs by location – The UK, US, and the entire globe. Here are the results.
As you can see from the table below, Brittania (like most of the world) is very interested in Tesla’s upcoming EVs, despite their habitual production delays. Building the anticipation, I suppose. 
Compared to the US and global lists, the UK has searched more EVs European automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Renault. In fact, Tesla and Apple are the only two American companies on the list. 
Polestar is a Swedish automaker, but the Polestar 3 SUV is going to be manufactured in the US and China. Regardless, the UK is particularly excited about it (as it should be). 
Check out the full top ten:
As one might expect, a majority of the US EV searches are for American-made models, although there are certainly some repeats compared alongside the UK. Tesla again takes the top two spots, but is instead followed by GM’s electrified Chevy Silverado and Cadillac Lyriq, as well as Ford’s ultra-hyped F-150 Lightning pickup.
The Apple Car again makes the top five in the US, despite not really existing yet, at least not publicly. The Fisker Ocean also holds a unique spot in the US at #9 as it prepares to launch its flagship Ocean SUV this fall. 
Additionally, Solar EV startup Aptera averaged 28k searches a month in the States. Its flagship SEV is currently in beta phase, and is scheduled to arrive later this year. You can currently reserve your own for $30 off the $100 deposit.
One noticeable facet of this US data is how much more robust it is compared to overseas. The #10 spot in the US only saw 10k less monthly searches than the #1 searched Roadster in the UK, which averaged 38k a month. 
This difference correlates rather fairly with population, as the US has roughly five-times the amount of people than the UK. That translates to many more fingers typing on Google.
Last but not least, Lease Fetcher has compiled Google search data from 168 of 195 total countries to provide the most searched EVs on Earth (spoiler alert – you’ve already seen all of these names). 
While the search volumes are certainly larger in scale, the results don’t veer too far from the tables above. In fact, they sort of combine to provide top names from the UK and US. 
Tesla again sits atop the list, although the next generation Roadster takes gold for the globe. One could argue that this EV is at an advantage as it shares the same name as its 2008-2011 predecessor, so either search could technically count.
What is most interesting about this list is that the only EV in the top five scheduled to arrive this year is the i4, which has already begun deliveries. As for the other four – people can search all they want, but there are still some question marks.
GM has stated the Silverado will arrive next year, which sounds promising. While there’s still a slight possibility the Cybertruck could deliver in 2022, all signs realistically point to 2023. Tesla has previously stated that the new Roadster’s arrival will depend on supply chain shortages and the fact that Cybertruck deliveries will take priority – even if it arrives in 2022. 
Roadster is joined by the mysterious Apple Car that is rumored to arrive in 2024, although its saga dates all the way back to 2007. There are still plenty more questions than answers when it comes to an Apple EV, but one thing is certain from this data, the curiosity remains.

2022/01/21,"Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla aims to deliver a few Model Y vehicles from Gigafactory Texas by the end of the quarter.
It would be an important milestone for the automaker and its new factory in Austin.
The start of production and subsequent ramp-up at Gigafactory Texas are two of Tesla’s most important milestones to achieve this year.
In recent weeks, we saw several indications that Tesla might be starting production at the factory, with many new Model Y vehicles spotted at the plant.
Sources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is currently doing test production batches, and it now aims to have some Model Y vehicles ready for deliveries by the end of the quarter.
By the end of March, the automaker should deliver a small number of Model Y SUVs built at Gigfactory Texas.
This is a few months behind schedule, but it should still set Tesla up for a good ramp-up to volume production during the second half of the year.
A source familiar with the matter told Electrek that Tesla is now ramping up the hiring of production associates in Austin, which is generally a sign that it is preparing for a production ramp.
As we previously reported, the start of Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas is not only critical to the company’s growth, but it also marks the launch of a new version of the electric SUV featuring Tesla’s new structural battery pack and 4680 battery cells.
The idea is to produce large cylindrical cells and package them into a single module battery pack that also acts as the structural platform on which you install the vehicle’s body.
CEO Elon Musk has touted the technology as a “manufacturing revolution” in the auto industry.
However, he also says that 4680 cell supply could be limited early in the Model Y production ramp, and it could manufacture some vehicles with the 2170 cells until supply issues are resolved.
It is going to be interesting to keep eye on this situation in the coming months.
At the moment, we are still not aware of a way for Tesla Model Y buyers to know if their vehicles are going to come from the Fremont factory or if it will be the new version from Gigafactory Texas.
Here’s a look at Gigafactory Texas from earlier this week:

2022/01/21,"Tesla has started deliveries of the Model X Plaid with tri-motor powertrain, and the first reviews are coming in. They show the electric vehicle, which is now the fastest SUV in the world, doing a 0-60 mph launch in 2.3 seconds – faster than advertised by Tesla.
The Model X Plaid has received as much attention as the Model S Plaid since it was announced at the same time, but it came months later, and it doesn’t have the same appeal as “the fastest production car in the world”. But it is the fastest SUV.
Tesla lists the performance specs of the Model X Plaid:
However, it looks like the automaker might have been underpromising in order to overdeliver with the Model X Plaid.
Vehicle Virgins posted a driving POV review of the new Model X Plaid, and it included a 0-60 mph acceleration test on launch mode:
According to the Vbox, the electric vehicle achieved a 0-60 mph acceleration in surprising 2.3 seconds:
That’s a significant 0.2 seconds faster than advertised by the automaker and reiterates that the Model X is the quickest accelerating SUV in the world. Tesla has been delivering the updated Model X for a few months now, but only recently started deliveries of the Plaid version, which starts at $126,500.
There’s a significant backlog of orders for the electric vehicle as the automaker guides deliveries of new orders all the way through October 2022.

2022/01/21,"A new startup called Autonomy launches in California as a Tesla subscription service with a fleet of 100 Model 3 vehicles, which it aims to grow to 10,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of the year.
The question is: Who is it for?
The concept of “subscribing” to a car instead of outright buying it or leasing it has gained traction in recent years.
Several automakers and third-party companies have started such services, which have the main advantage of being simpler and requiring less commitment than leases.
Scott Painter, the founder of TrueCar, announced today his new company, Autonomy, will provide a Tesla subscription service.
They bought 100 Model 3 vehicles, which they are offering through a subscription service in California.
As shown above, the company is marketing it as “the cheapest way to get into a Tesla Model 3.”
The service starts at $550 per month, but it requires a steep $5,500 “start fee,” which is more than a deposit on a base Model 3 lease with Tesla.
Tesla Model 3 leases start at ~$480 for a Model 3 RWD and ~$560 for a Long Range.
Autonomy enables you to pay a much lower “start fee,” but it is going to significantly increase the monthly subscription payment:
Of course, if you go through Tesla, you are going to have to wait as the automaker has some significant delivery wait times on new Model 3 orders in the US.
Autonomy claims that they can get you in a car tomorrow as long as they have availabilities in their fleet of 100 Model 3 vehicles.
The company told Bloomberg that it is still buying a lot of Tesla vehicles with a goal of the fleet growing to 500 cars by March and 10,000 cars by the end of the year:
Autonomy has been able to buy cars from Tesla by being flexible on things like color, configuration and wheel choice – features that consumers who are buying cars often have strong feelings about. The company hopes to have 500 Tesla cars by the end of the first quarter and 10,000 by the end of the year. Customers will have access to Tesla’s Supercharging network.
Of course, that’s assuming that the service proves successful. 
Autonomy claims that its main advantage is that there’s no long-term commitment since it only requires a three-month minimum subscription, and it is also simple since everything is done through its app with a driver’s license and credit card. 
The subscription includes 833 miles per month, and a fee of $0.25 per mile is added if the allowance is exceeded.
What do you think about this Tesla subscription service? Let us know in the comments below.

2022/01/20,"Tesla has started construction on a new, much-needed giant Supercharger station in Santa Monica. The station was also supposed to include the automaker’s 1950s restaurant, but now it’s not clear if the diner is still in the plans.
In 2018, Elon Musk said that Tesla plans to open an “old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in Los Angeles.” It was yet another, “Is he joking?” kind of Elon Musk idea, but he apparently wasn’t kidding.
A few months later, Tesla actually applied for building permits for “a restaurant and Supercharger station” at a location in Santa Monica. However, the project has since stalled, apparently due to local regulations.
Nevertheless, Tesla still moved forward with a Supercharger at the location as this part of Los Angeles really needs more Supercharger stations.
Last year, we reported on construction plans revealing that Tesla was planning a large, 62-stall Supercharger V3 station at the location. When the project was approved in April 2021, Musk again said that Tesla still was aiming to build a 1950s diner at the location.
Now almost a year later, a local Electrek reader spotted construction starting at the site:
The reader noted that construction is happening fast. The location was only a dirt lot only a few weeks ago. The company has already poured concrete and installed quite a few Supercharger stalls.
Now the question is whether or not the diner and outdoor movie screen are still in the plans, as Musk said last year.
The construction plans submitted to the city haven’t been updated with anything that could indicate a diner, but there are a few other constructions at the site, including solar canopies and a small building.
We will be keeping an eye on the project to see if anything more comes out of it.
But the main objective is to provide much-needed fast-charging to Santa Monica and the surrounding neighborhoods.

2022/01/20,"Tesla announced the expansion of its new insurance business to Arizona and Ohio – making it now available in five states.
Tesla had already introduced its own insurance product in California, but it didn’t utilize real-time driving data and Tesla’s safety score, which had been its original goal.
Before expanding its insurance product to other markets, the company wanted to build up its safety score system, which utilizes driving data collected in real-time from Tesla vehicles to determine if you are a “good driver” based on things like the number of “Forward Collision Warnings” you get, the amount of hard braking you do, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and if you get forced Autopilot disengagements.
In October, Tesla finally launched its new insurance product based on the safety score in Texas.
The automaker says that it expects those deemed “average” drivers based on their safety score should save 20% to 40% on their premium compared to competitors, and those with the safest scores could save between 30% to 60%.
In a review of some quotes compared the existing premiums for Tesla drivers, it was hit or miss on whether Tesla’s product was cheaper or not. There seems to be a bigger difference for those who already had a high premium based on age and gender, which Tesla insists it is not using in its own premium calculations, unlike other insurance companies.
Also, when first quoting and starting a policy, Tesla assumes a safety score of 90. The monthly premium price can quickly go down if you improve this score.
Tesla released an example that shows how the premium can change month to month depending on your score:
In December, the company expanded the insurance product to Illinois.
Today, Tesla decided to expand its insurance offering to Arizona and Ohio, according to an update on its website:
“Get competitive rates in Arizona, California, Illinois, Ohio and Texas in as little as one minute. Insurance based on real-time driving behavior now available in Arizona, Illinois, Ohio and Texas.”
That now makes five states where Tesla Insurance is available, but only the last four have the product based on “real-time driving behavior.”
In October, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is aiming to be “in most states” by the end of 2022. The regulatory landscape for insurance is complex and varies state by state. Therefore, Tesla has a lot of work to do to launch in any new state, which slows the rollout of the new product. 
California is expected to get the “real-time driving behavior” in the future, but it needs to be approved by regulators. In the meantime, Tesla still offers its regular insurance product in the state.

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/01/20,"A new survey of searches shows that the Tesla Roadster and Cybertruck are the most popular upcoming electric vehicles despite the delays. You have to go down to fourth place for a vehicle available on the market this year.
One of Tesla’s biggest market advantages is its mind shares in the EV market – when people think “electric vehicle”, they often think “Tesla”. Of course, in some markets, like in the US, Tesla also has some large literal majority market shares, but the automaker often dominates the headline with vehicles that are not even on the market yet.
Now, Lease Fetcher has put together a report on the most searched EV models in the world, and it shows why that’s the case: people are looking for those EVs.
In the top 10, Tesla took the first and second place with the Roadster and Cybertruck despite those vehicles being delayed several times and being called “vaporware” by naysayers:
The Roadster has captivated people’s attention for its incredible performance as well as the SpaceX package, which will supposedly add cold air thrusters to the electric hyper car.
However, the vehicle has been delayed several times and now it doesn’t look like Tesla plans to bring to market before late next year. That said, it looks like people are not losing interest in it based on those search results.
The Cybertruck is in a similar situation. The launch of the vehicle was massively popular due to the vehicle’s polarizing design and incredible specs, but delays have cooled things down. The electric pickup truck is officially planned for the end of the year, but further delays are possible. Tesla is expected to give more details next week during a product roadmap update.
Apple Car, which is also a vehicle that has vague production plans, takes the third spot. Not much is known about it beyond that Apple wants it to be electric and autonomous. 
You have to go all the way down to the BMW i4 in fourth place to find a vehicle that is going to make it in the hands of customers this year.

2022/01/20,"Tesla has applied to expand its trademark in order to be able to sell audio equipment under its own brand. Does this mean Tesla has new audio products coming?
The automaker filed for the trademark in the new category two weeks ago, but it went unnoticed until an Electrek reader pointed it out to me this morning.
Tesla applied for both its “TESLA” and “T” logo trademarks in this new audio equipment category:
TESLA™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of microphones; headphones; earphones; digital audio players; sound transmitting apparatus; audio speakers; subwoofers; earpads for headphones; audio interfaces; audio equalizer apparatus; horns for loudspeakers; megaphones.
As usual, it’s important to point out that companies sometimes apply for trademarks that they ended up not using. That said, even if Tesla were to use this one, it is such a wide-ranging trademark category that it’s difficult to tell what could come of it.
It could be as simple as Tesla developing its own speaker for inside its vehicles and having them branded with their own brand and logo or Tesla could really be developing its own headphones.
In recent years, Tesla has put an emphasis on the sound system inside its vehicles.
The sound system in the Model 3 has been well-received by audiophiles, and the one in the new version of the Model S has also received positive reviews.
It has been compared to an expensive Bang & Olufsen system often found in premium vehicles, but for a fraction of the price.
When a reviewer made the comparison on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented:
Tesla audio engineers come from B&O & many other companies. They literally rock. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates.
Tesla indeed has several audio engineers from Bang & Olufsen, like lead audio engineer Markus Koch, who spent over a decade at Harman and Bang & Olufsen before joining Tesla in 2015. He briefly left for a stint at Byton before coming back to Tesla in 2019.
More recently, Tesla also hired several engineers from Jawbone and Amazon Lab126, where they develop the Echo speakers.
Again, Tesla could be looking to just produce its own audio equipment for its vehicles. But then, would it need a trademark for them if it is just using them internally? I don’t know.
Tesla could also be leveraging its work in developing premium audio systems in its cars to launch other consumer products, like headphones or speakers. It’s not exactly aligned with its mission, but also not impossible.
Years ago, Musk even discussed Tesla launching its own music streaming service and they got relatively far into the development before dropping the idea.

The product has been widely recognized for its beautiful design. It undeniably has significant advantages over regular solar panels, with the ability to penetrate markets like new houses and homes that need a roof replacement relatively soon.
However, it has been hard to bring it to market.
Tesla has had issues testing for longevity, with prices fluctuating widely as the company realized the difficulties of creating a streamlined product that works with different roof types.
As we previously reported, Tesla significantly increased the price of the solar roof tiles last year, after introducing a new “roof complexity factor.”
But the company claimed that the demand for the solar roof was still strong after this price increase, and that installations are accelerating.
That’s despite the fact that Tesla ended its referral program for cars last year, but it decided to keep the program for its solar roof and even increased its referral award to $500.
Now Tesla is introducing a new way to increase demand through a new financing option:
20-year Solar Roof loan with lower monthly payments now available https://t.co/MbLpal1sZt pic.twitter.com/LTjbHwrR6b
The new financing option comes with 3.99% APR and with 10% down payment.
Here’s what it looks like for a typical 10 kW solar roof project:
For a project like this one, the monthly payments would amount to $574 per month with this new financing option.
Previously, Tesla solar roof buyers had to find their own financing options for the new solar product or buy it outright.
It often didn’t make sense for homeowners looking to invest long-term into their property while reducing their electricity costs.
As we previously reported, Tesla started taking solar roof orders from anywhere in the US last year.
However, the company is still selective on its projects based on roof complexity, location, and availability of installers. It has been known to cancel orders at times.

2022/01/19,"A new collaboration between hypercar company Koenigsegg and Tesla tuner Unplugged Performance will lead to the former manufacturing aftermarket parts for Tesla vehicles.
Unplugged Performance is one of the most popular Tesla tuners and aftermarket accessory makers.
It’s also the one with the closest relationship with the automaker.
Car tuners and modification companies are not always appreciated by the original automaker.
It’s not always the AMG story where the tuners end up being bought by Mercedes-Benz to officially make tuned and modified versions of their cars.
But Unplugged Performance is as close as it gets.
It was authorized for official vehicle service by Tesla and the automaker also appeared to have given UP early access to the Model S Plaid last year.
The company makes a big move by partnering with Koenigsegg, a legendary hypercar company, to make parts for Tesla vehicles.
The new partnership is called UP x KAM:
“We are proud to announce a manufacturing partnership between Unplugged Performance x Koenigsegg Advanced Manufacturing (UP x KAM). Koenigsegg, the world’s leading Hypercar manufacturer, is now producing Unplugged Performance tuning products for your Tesla.”
It involves carbon fiber parts that are added to UP’s already extensive lists of aftermarket Tesla parts:
“UP x KAM carbon fiber parts are made exclusively from Koenigsegg’s proprietary carbon fiber weave which is pre-impregnated with epoxy resin, precision computer cut to the geometry of the product, assembled by hand by artisans using specialized tooling, pressurized, and temperature optimized in an autoclave, extracted, precision trimmed, sanded, precision bonded, finished in a UV clear coat and topped with a special collaboration sticker indicating the manufacturing partnership.”
Ben Schaffer, CEO of Unplugged Performance, commented on the new partnership:
“We are grateful to partner with the best engineers and factories in the world who share in our vision and mission. Koenigsegg is an iconoclastic global leader in innovation and Hypercar grade manufacturing. They also happen to share our ideals of balancing sustainability and driving excitement in harmony. The future of car enthusiast culture depends on embracing the best of craftsmanship, the best of technology, and never losing sight of creating cars that we love to drive. Together with Koenigsegg we want to excite Tesla owners and to contribute towards an exciting electric future for the car culture we love.”
UP provided a list of the first UP x KAM products that came out of the partnership with Koenigsegg:

2022/01/19,"Elon Musk announced that he is thinking about involving Tesla in the creation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
He also added that he plans on decentralizing the control of Tesla Bot to avoid a Terminator-like scenario.
For a few years now, Musk has been pushing the idea that Tesla is the world’s leading company when it comes to real-world applications of artificial intelligence.
He describes Tesla’s fleet of vehicles equipped with sensors and computers for self-driving as “robots on wheels.”
Through this “real-world application,” the company has also been able to attract world-class AI talent, and Musk boasts that Tesla has the best AI team on the planet.
At Tesla’s AI day last year, the automaker unveiled its latest supercomputer, Dojo, to train its neural nets.
It also announced that it plans to build a ‘Tesla Bot,’ a humanoid robot meant to do general tasks and repetitive work.
Now Musk took to Twitter this morning to announce that Tesla might go a step further and get involved in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):
“Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus.”
Optimus, or Optimus Subprime, is the codename that Musk gave to the Tesla Bot project.
This is somewhat surprising considering the many warnings that Musk has issued about creating AGI and the risks to humanity that come with it.
Musk was a co-founder and the main benefactor of OpenAI, a non-profit AI research group focused on “ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”
In 2018, he ended up stepping down from his role at the group after citing potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own artificial intelligence effort.
Along with the announcement that Tesla might work on AGI, Musk also added on Twitter that Tesla will make sure to “decentralize” control of Tesla Bots:
“Will do our best. Decentralized control of the robots will be critical.”
The comment was made in response to someone mentioning “summoning the demon,” which is what Musk referred to as creating an AGI that would turn against humanity.
Decentralizing the control of Tesla Bots would avoid giving this “demon” access to an army – much like a Terminator-like scenario.
Musk previously said that he tentatively expects Tesla to have a working prototype of ‘Optimus’ by the end of 2022.
This appears to be just the latest of many indications that Musk is slowly pivoting Tesla into an AI company.
Of course, no one is arguing that cars are not Tesla’s main business still, but the CEO is known for thinking long-term and he does appear to increasingly see Tesla as an AI and robotic company.
I think it is going to be a while before the wider public sees Tesla as a Skynet type of company, but as always, I wouldn’t bet against Musk on making it happen.

2022/01/18,"German auto data for 2021 shows that Tesla is beating German automakers on their own turf when it comes to electric vehicles. That’s even without Gigafactory Berlin, which has yet to start production. Should they be scared?
The German auto market was down 10% in 2021 as supply chain issues and broader economical effects from the pandemic are still being felt. But the good news is that electric vehicles are up significantly in the market over the same period. All-electric and plug-in vehicles now represent 14% of the market and over 355,000 units.
Tagesschau put together a list of the top best-selling all-electric vehicles in the market, and Tesla topped the list:
Every German automaker saw their sales go down in 2021, and some of them, like Mercedes-Benz, where down significantly:
In the meantime, Tesla was up 137% in the German market in 2021 with 39,000 units delivered in the year.
The most impressive thing is that Tesla is achieving these results by still only importing vehicles in the market from the US and China. The automaker has built a giant new factory in Germany, and once production has ramped up at the plant, it is expected to greatly help sales in Europe, especially in Germany.
Should German automakers be scared?
I’ve stated for years that I think some giants will fall in the automotive industry’s transition to electric vehicles. For now, I think the Germans are in a better position than the Japanese, but they should still be nervous.
The German auto market is big, and buyers certainly favor local brands. If the domestic automakers aren’t doing well locally – like Mercedes-Benz and Audi being down 25% and 15% respectively – it’s a real problem.
From what I am hearing, Tesla is expected to get a big boost in Germany once they can buy cars coming out of Gigafactory Berlin. Even though Tesla is an American company, there’s a lot of German engineering in its cars, especially since the company bought Grohmann Engineering and now with the vehicles being built in the country.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla is in the top auto brands in Germany by the end of 2023, which would have inconceivable just a few years ago.

2022/01/18,"A Tesla driver has been charged with two counts of vehicular manslaughter after running a red light on Autopilot – this is likely the first time that a driver is charged with a felony for something that happened while using semi-autonomous driving features available to customers.
The incident happened back in 2019 in Gardena, a suburb of Los Angeles, but it is now coming to light after legal documents reveal the charges filed last October.
Kevin George Aziz Riad, a 27-year-old limousine driver, was using his Tesla Model S on Autopilot when he ran a red light and crashed into a Honda Civic, killing the two occupants, Gilberto Alcazar Lopez and Maria Guadalupe Nieves-Lopez. An occupant in the Model S was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.
Now, a year later, prosecutors have decided to file to charges of vehicular manslaughter (via The Washington Post):
California prosecutors have filed two counts of vehicular manslaughter against the driver of a Tesla on Autopilot who ran a red light, slammed into another car and killed two people in 2019.
The use of Autopilot was confirmed by an NHTSA investigation into the crash, but it is not mentioned by the prosecutors as the driver is always responsible for the vehicle when behind the wheel. Also, at the time of the accident, there was no Tesla Autopilot to slow down and stop for a red light.
The Post suggests that this is the first time that someone was charged with a felony for a crash involving a partially automated driving system:
The defendant appears to be the first person to be charged with a felony in the United States for a fatal crash involving a motorist who was using a partially automated driving system. Los Angeles County prosecutors filed the charges in October, but they came to light only last week.
The Uber driver behind the wheel of an autonomous test vehicle involved in a fatal accident with a pedestrian in Arizona was charged with a negligent homicide charge. They are making distinctions between the two cases since the Uber incident involved a test vehicle as part of a self-driving test program and not a driver assist system, like Tesla Autopilot, which is available to the public.
Kevin George Aziz Riad has pled not guilty to the vehicular manslaughter charges and he is out on bail.
Based on the information we have at the moment, which to be fair is coming from the prosecution, it sounds like a simple case of the driver not paying attention and running a red light, causing those tragic deaths.
Autopilot is just a driver-assist system that happened to be active at the time – it will be interesting to see if the driver and his legal team decide to use it in his defense.
I feel like that would be problematic since all the Autopilot literature – including the alert that pops up in the car every time you activate it – lets you know that you need to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, ready to take control.

2022/01/18,"Elon Musk confirmed that he will be visiting Tesla Gigafactory Berlin in “mid-February” – hinting at the potential start of production, which is still awaiting government approval.
Over the last year, Tesla has run into a lot of red tape while trying to get approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin, a giant new factory located near Berlin in Brandenburg.
The bottleneck right now is the environmental approval from the Brandenburg State Environment Ministry.
Most recently, environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project, which delayed approval for another month. The new period concluded last November, and Tesla has been rumored to be on the verge of approval, but it has yet to happen.
While waiting for the approval, Tesla was authorized to produce 250 Model Y bodies for testing purposes. Some Model Y vehicles were spotted leaving the plant last month.
Earlier this month, Tesla received another approval to produce 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin.
The government has also confirmed that it received all the necessary documents to make a decision as of the last week of December.
Therefore, the approval for the start of production has been expected to be imminent.
Over the last week, several publications erroneously reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would be visiting Berlin this week based on a single source on Twitter.
The CEO corrected the information and instead confirmed that he will be visiting the factory in “mid-February,” which could coincide with the timing of the start of production since the automaker would be expected to have completed its 2,000-vehicle trial run by then.
With the first batch of completed Model Y vehicles spotted at Gigafactory Texas this week, it looks like the Austin factory might have beaten Gigafactory Berlin to a start of production – though nothing has been confirmed by Tesla yet.
However, as we like to point out, the start of production at either of those new factories is not the most important milestone.
The smoothness of the production ramps is the most important by far.
We will be keeping an eye on that in the coming months.

2022/01/18,"Tesla has increased the price of its Full Self-Driving Capability (FSD) package to $12,000 as previously announced last week.
Interestingly, it looks like the automaker decided not to increase the price of its FSD monthly subscription service.
CEO Elon Musk has made Tesla’s pricing strategy clear when it comes to FSD: Tesla is going to increase the price of the package as it introduces new features. But, since the package doesn’t actually do what the name says (which is for the vehicle to fully drive itself), people have criticized Tesla for increasing the price, which gradually went up to $10,000 in October of 2020.
The automaker has refrained from increasing the price since launching the Full Self-Driving Beta program, but Musk announced last week that Tesla will increase the price to $12,000 on January 17.
A day late, Tesla updated its online configurations on January 18 to reflect the price change:
Last year, Tesla also launched its FSD subscription service at $199 per month. 
We expected that Tesla would also increase the price of the subscription service since the automaker previously made clear that it wants the one-time purchase to be the best economic option when acquiring the Full Self-Driving package.
However, Tesla is still listing the same prices for the FSD subscription on its website following the price increase to $12,000:
Although the situation with the subscription service is a little more complicated. 
The price of the package gives you access to future capabilities while you pay for what you get now with the subscription package. At the same time, Tesla said that the price of the package would increase with new capabilities and that hasn’t been the case with this price increase for most people.
The vast majority of Tesla owners who bought the FSD package still don’t have access to the FSD Beta.
As we previously reported, Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) is an early version of Tesla’s self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company through its “safety test score.” The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a two steps forward, one step back type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
Recently, Musk said that Tesla could potentially achieve level 4 autonomy with the program by the end of 2022, but he has gotten that timeline wrong more times than there are levels of autonomy.

2022/01/17,"Over half a dozen new Tesla Model Y vehicles were spotted at Gigafactory Texas as production has been expected to start soon. 
Does that mean that production has started?
Tesla has been aiming to start Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas in Austin by the end of 2021.
The start of Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas is not only critical to the company’s growth, but it also marks the launch of a new version of the electric SUV featuring Tesla’s new structural battery pack and 4680 battery cells.
The idea is to produce large cylindrical cells and package them into a single module battery pack that also acts as the structural platform on which you install the vehicle’s body.
CEO Elon Musk has touted the technology as a “manufacturing revolution” in the auto industry.
For those two reasons, there are a lot of eyes on Tesla starting Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas.
We previously reported on Tesla ramping up its mega casting effort at the factory to produce Model Y bodies – with some bodies being spotted late in December.
While Tesla has missed its deadline of starting production by the end of the year, it is now believed to be imminent.
Now we have a new indication that Tesla might have started Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas.
Jeff Roberts, who often flies drones over Gigafactory Texas, shared a picture of a bunch of brand-new Model Y vehicles charging at the factory:
New Model Ys at Giga Texas! #ModelY #Tesla pic.twitter.com/ZcFyyiMNZl
These Model Ys look brand new out of the factory, but it can’t be confirmed that they were produced at Gigafactory Texas, albeit likely, or to what extent they were built there.
If they were fully built at the factory, it would be an important milestone for the automaker.
Gigafactory Texas is expected to be an important part of Tesla’s growth in 2022, especially during the second half of the year, when it should reach volume production.

2022/01/17,"Elon Musk claims that Tesla has not had a single crash in its Full Self-Driving Beta program since the start over a year ago, but that’s just as much proof that the testers are being careful as a proof that the system is safe.
“Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta) is an early version of Tesla’s self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.“
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times. Tesla started the program in October 2020, and it has now pushed the software to several thousands of customers.
The test program has been criticized for putting advanced autonomous features in the hands of customers and leaving the responsibility with them by calling it a level two autonomous system in Beta testing – Tesla has defended itself by saying that it has been careful with slowly rolling out the features to customers it deems “safer drivers”.
In response to a comment by Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber on Twitter, CEO Elon Musk confirmed  yesterday that Tesla believes there still has been any accident in the Full Self-Driving Beta program over a year after the launch:
Correct
It would mean that he is disputing a previous crash report to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A Model Y owner in the FSD Beta claimed in a complaint to NHTSA that the system caused a crash, but the complaint couldn’t be confirmed.
If the report was indeed inaccurate, it is impressive that Tesla didn’t have an accident in likely millions of miles on FSD Beta. NHTSA says that on average there’s an accident every 500,000 miles for human drivers (aka all drivers).
While impressive, it is probably more proof that Tesla owners in the FSD Beta program are being careful than the system itself is safe because we have seen plenty of videos where the FSD Beta would have caused an accident if it wasn’t for the driver taking control.
It’s a “so far so good” situation, but we know that accidents are inevitable. Once one happens, I expect to see a significant ramp-up in criticism of Tesla’s approach to testing its self-driving system. In the meantime, Tesla is enjoying the use of a lot of data from a test fleet that is not only for free, but is made of customers who paid a lot of money to test the system.
We can argue if this is right or not, but you can’t argue that as a business, this is one hell of a move.

2022/01/17,"Tesla is starting to push a new version (10.9) of its Full Self-Driving Beta software update with some improvements, and Elon Musk announced an expansion of the test program in Canada.
For more than a year now, Tesla has been slowly rolling out what it is calling “Full Self-Driving Beta” (FSD Beta), which is an early version of its self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company and through its “safety test score.“
The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.
In recent updates, the automaker has been releasing more details about the changes to the driving behaviors in the release notes.
Here are the release notes for Tesla FSD Beta 10.9:
Based on the percentages of improvements, it looks like a more modest update than the previous ones, but CEO Elon Musk did say that a bigger update (11) is coming likely next month.
It should also coincide with an expansion of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta program in Canada.
The CEO announced last night on Twitter:
We will start rolling out FSD beta in Canada cautiously in next 2 to 4 weeks.
This will be the first official expansion of the FSD Beta to customers outside of the US.
Musk didn’t talk about the “safety score” system, which is part of how Tesla decides who gets access to the FSD Beta.
It currently isn’t available in Canada, so the automaker would presumably have to launch that first, and the people who get the best scores and purchased the Full Self-Driving package would get it first.

2022/01/17,"Elon Musk announced that Tesla is starting to roll out a new over-the-air software update that includes a ‘fix’ to a heat pump issue that has been plaguing Tesla vehicles in cold-weather regions.
However, some are worried that it might need more than a software fix, as Tesla service centers have indicated to owners that it might be more of a hardware problem.
Last week, Electrek reported on Tesla owners are losing heat in extreme cold as some heat pumps are failing.
As we explained, it’s a problem that first emerged last winter with Tesla vehicles equipped with the automaker’s new heat pump system first introduced in the Model Y and added to an updated version of Model 3.
It was the first full winter for both vehicles.
At the time, Tesla said that it fixed the issue with a software update, but it is now resurfacing a year later in a big way.
Many Tesla owners complained that they are losing heat in extreme cold and several owners who brought their cars to the service center had their whole heat pump system replaced. 
CEO Elon Musk said that fixing this issue was a “high priority” at Tesla, and this weekend, he announced that the automaker is rolling out a software fix for it:
“Firmware fix to recalibrate heat pump expansion valve is rolling out now.”
This comes after several Tesla service centers shared with affected customers that the issue came from the air intake of the heat pump where a “flap,” or now potentially a valve, gets stuck with an ice buildup.
It was described as a hardware issue to them, and again, several had to have parts of their heat pump system or the whole heat pump system replaced.
Therefore, there are doubts that a software fix can completely fix the problem.
However, it could be that the heat pump repairs are not due to a hardware defect but to this software problem with the valve and/or an ice buildup leading it to break, and the new software fix could potentially prevent that from happening.
Both NTHSA in the US and Transport Canada announced that they are investigating the issue as a safety concern.
If you are a Tesla owner affected by this problem, please let us know as we will keep tracking the issue in the coming weeks.

2022/01/15,"Tesla has released its latest Autopilot safety report, and it shows some improvements despite the limited data making things hard to analyze.
Since 2018, Tesla has been trying to create a benchmark for its improvement in Autopilot safety by releasing a quarterly report that compares the number of miles per accident on Autopilot versus off Autopilot.
Today, Tesla released its safety report for Q4 2021 (between October and December):
“In the 4th quarter, we recorded one crash for every 4.31 million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology (Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no Autosteer and active safety features), we recorded one crash for every 1.59 million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA’s most recent data shows that in the United States there is an automobile crash every 484,000 miles.”
The automaker did it a little different this time and only released data for miles driven with Autopilot and safety features and without any Autopilot or safety features.
Previously, Tesla also released miles drive “without Autopilot but with our active safety features“.
The data was already limited and criticized for not taking into account that accidents are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highways, where Autopilot is mostly being used.
But we still can compare the data with previous reports.
However, as the company writes in the report, we need to take into account seasonality:
“Note: Seasonality can affect crash rates from quarter to quarter, particularly in quarters where reduced daylight and inclement or wintry weather conditions are more common. To minimize seasonality as a variable, compare a quarter to the same quarter in prior years.”
If we compare Tesla’s latest Q4 2021 numbers to the previous quarter, the safety appears to be down, but it is significantly up if compared to Q4 2020:
It shows a significant improvement year-over-year based on this dataset, which again is fairly limited.
Tesla also doesn’t release similar safety data for its Full Self-Driving Beta testing program.

2022/01/14,"Tesla has added a reference to the structural battery pack to the Model Y owner’s manual as production is expected to be imminent.
While Tesla has missed its goal to start Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas by the end of the year, we have seen several indications that production is imminent. Now, we get yet another.
Tesla has updated the US version of the Model Y owner’s manual and it includes a reference to the structural battery pack. The structural battery pack is expected to be the biggest difference in the Model Y to be produced at Gigafactory Texas versus the current version from Fremont factory.
Instead of several battery modules put together in a battery pack, Tesla plans to use its new 4680 cells in a single block to create a battery pack with structural integrity that becomes a part of the vehicle’s body.
It shouldn’t have a major impact on the owner’s experience, but Tesla updated the owner’s manual regarding the jacking procedure since the lift points are different:
The update to the owner’s manual would indicate that Tesla is getting ready to deliver the new version to customers.
It’s still not clear if or how Model Y buyers in North America are going to know that they are going to get a new Model Y from Austin or the older version from Fremont before taking delivery. Since the battery pack affects efficiency, it is expected to have slightly different specs than the Fremont version, but Tesla has yet to update the configurator. Tesla is also going to need regulatory approval to deliver those vehicles to customers.
Last month, a Model Y body made for a structural battery pack was spotted at Gigafactory Texas.
There have been rumors that Tesla is preparing to start Model Y production at the factory within the next 2 weeks, but it’s still unconfirmed.

2022/01/14,"We are seeing a lot of new reports about Tesla Cybertruck coming out and being shared in the Tesla community – I’d take those with a big grain of salt.
Earlier this week, we reported that Tesla plans on releasing a product roadmap update on January 26 with Cybertruck being a product of focus. Since then, several other news reports came out about the electric pickup truck, but we have doubts about their veracity.
Reuters reported that the planned production has been delayed to the first quarter 2023:
Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) aims to start initial production of its much-anticipated Cybertruck by the end of the first quarter of 2023, pushing back its plan to begin production late this year, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
This report by Reuters’ Hyunjoo Jin is based on a single source and after looking at his history of coverage for Reuters, it doesn’t look like he ever had any exclusive information on Tesla before, which raises a red flag for me.
Now if I was to bet on whether or not Tesla Cybertruck would start in 2022 or 2023, I’d certainly bet 2023, but that doesn’t mean that the report is based on any concrete information. Analyst Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research also came out with a new report on the Cybertruck.
He claimed that Tesla will unveil the production version of the Cybertruck in March, and that it will include two versions, including one about 15-20% smaller than the original one.
There have been talks about Tesla making a smaller version of the Cybertruck, but Elon Musk put the plans on the backburner in 2020 and said that a smaller version would come later, likely for European markets.
I’d also take this report with a grain of salt.
It’s not impossible, but it sounds unlikely due to previous statements directly from Musk about Tesla’s plans to make the Cybertruck smaller. We have also seen a new Cybertruck prototype being tested by Tesla at Fremont factory last month, and it appeared to be just as big as the original prototype.
We should get more information on January 26, but in the meantime, I’d take all these reports with a giant grain of salt.

2022/01/14,"Tesla has officially started accepting Dogecoin to buy some of its merchandise in its online store.
But the automaker went a step further, and it appears to only be accepting Dogecoin for some items.
Over the last year, Tesla has been delving deep into the cryptocurrency world. 
Early in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin.
Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.
Later, CEO Elon Musk even talked about the potential of Tesla starting to accept Dogecoin as payment for its vehicles.
However, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:
Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.
This is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn’t think about it in the first place.
At the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin and that they planned to resume taking bitcoin payments once the network showed a higher mix of renewable energy.
Last summer, Musk said that he believes Tesla will resume taking bitcoin payments as he sees improvements in the energy mix of Bitcoin mining.
This has yet to happen, but in the meantime, the CEO said last month that Tesla will start to accept Dogecoin to “buy some merchandise” through its Tesla Store website.
Today, Tesla made the move to accept Dogecoin and even went a little further:
It looks like the automaker is only accepting Dogecoin as a payment option on some items:
It appears to only be affecting some of Tesla’s more novelty items like its Giga Texas Belt Buckle, its Cyber Whistle, and even the Cyberquad for Kids.
Tesla is only listing those items in Dogecoin, and it’s the only payment option that appears when clicking on them:
The automaker also says that all Dogecoin purchases on its website are final and no return will be accepted.
This is one of those moves from Tesla, and Musk in particular, that I don’t see how it’s helping the mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
It only appears to serve in pumping the price of a cryptocurrency that was started as a joke, but Musk happens to like it.
In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t matter that much as long as Tesla didn’t waste too much time and resources trying to integrate the payment option.

2022/01/13,"New satellite images show that Tesla significantly expanded its rooftop solar array at Gigafactory Nevada as it aims for it to become the world’s biggest.
In 2017, Tesla announced plans for a giant 70 MW rooftop array at Gigafactory Nevada, which would be the largest in the world by a wide margin. The project has been lagging for a long time. Tesla finally started construction of the solar array in 2018 and expanded on it throughout the next few years, but it has never grown near the size Tesla has been talking about.
Last summer, the automaker said that it had deployed 3.2 MW at the site. At the time, Tesla also changed its goal to deploy 24 MW instead of 70 MW on the rooftop of the factory, which itself is now smaller than originally planned. The company said that it believes this would still be enough to be the largest rooftop deployment of solar power.
To be fair, there are much bigger solar farms than 24 MW out there, but Tesla is specifically talking about rooftop solar arrays and not ground-mounted installations.
Now a few months later, it looks like Tesla has made a lot of progress with several more MW of solar power deployed at Gigafactory Nevada based on new satellite images. The image on the left is from September 2021 and the one on the right is from yesterday, January 12 (via Building Tesla):
It’s hard to determine exactly how much capacity Tesla deployed, but it looks like a significant increase over the last few months.
As for the factory itself, it has been expanding in size for a long time. The factory has been producing a lot of battery cells, packs, and drivetrains for Tesla, but the giant structure has been stuck at ~30% completion for the past four years.
There have been no indications that Tesla is going to follow through with its plans to complete the giant building in the near future.
Gigafactory Nevada is used by Panasonic to produce battery cells for Tesla, and the latter use those cells to make battery packs for its electric vehicles at the same location as well as drivetrains and stationary energy storage products, like Powerpacks, Powerwalls, and Megapacks.

2022/01/13,"Many Tesla owners using third-party apps to monitor have found them not to be working in the last few days as Tesla appears to have revoked many log-in tokens – a hacker claims to be behind the action after he supposedly gained access to several Tesla accounts.
Tesla doesn’t have an official dev kit or app store, but it does have an unofficial API that led to a market for third-party apps. These apps provide Tesla owners with additional features that are not native, like logs for your trips and charging sessions, battery health reports, and more.
In order for those apps to get access to your data, they either require your Tesla account log-in information or an authentication token associated with your account.
Yesterday, several Tesla owners using those apps, like Tezlab, reported that they didn’t work anymore.
Tesla apparently expired a lot of authentication tokens early:
At approximately 6:30 UTC, we saw the simultaneous expiry of several thousand Tesla authentication tokens from Tesla's side. Many TezLab members will need to sign in again in order to re-establish the connection to their vehicles. We apologize for any inconvenience!
Tyler Corsair, who operates Teslascope, another third-party app, says Tesla appears to have moved to a new version of its token (via Twitter):
It appears that Tesla has just deprecated their V2 tokens which will effectively kill off all TeslaMate instances, as they haven’t updated to use V3 (OAuth/SSO) yet.
The fix is as simple as reconnecting your Tesla account to whatever third-party apps you are using. However, it doesn’t seem to affect all Tesla owners using third-party apps, but especially newer tokens.
David Colombo claims to be behind Tesla revoking the token and moving to its V3 token early:
Just as clarification: This comment was made jokingly because my report to the Tesla Security Team apparently led to a ton of tokens getting revoked.@TezLabApp is not involved at all here and not the source of any leaked auth tokens.
Colombo previously said that he managed to get access to several Tesla owners’ accounts, which enables you to log into their Tesla app and have some control over their cars.
He has been vague about how he managed to get access, but he said that it wasn’t due to Tesla’s own security, which made many suspects that he gained access to the account through a third-party app.
It serves as a good reminder to be careful about who you give your information to and how to do it.

2022/01/13,"The new Tesla Model S is getting its first third-party yoke steering wheel replacement, but there are caveats – starting with the price.
When Tesla unveiled the new Model S with the “yoke” butterfly steering wheel, it was controversial. Some were worried about the actual shape of the wheel being problematic, while others were concerned about the lack of drive stalk to choose the drive mode.
As for the former, we thought that the automaker wouldn’t risk bringing the controversial yoke steering wheel to market without a nonlinear steering curve enabled by a steer-by-wire system – especially knowing that Tesla has been developing a steer-by-wire system.
However, as Tesla started deliveries of the new Model S Plaid last year, we were surprised to see that the wheel had a normal 14.0:1 steering ratio, and it is proving to be impractical at lower speeds.
CEO Elon Musk later confirmed that Tesla is indeed working on progressive steering, but it’s still years away.
In the meantime, Musk confirmed that Tesla doesn’t plan to offer a regular steering wheel as an option with or without stalks.
This is creating an aftermarket for yoke steering wheel replacements.
We previously reported on a Model S Plaid owner successfully performing his own replacement using a Model 3 steering wheel, but he didn’t have a plan to offer the product.
Now we see the first company offering a yoke replacement as a product.
Tsportline is a longtime Tesla tuner and accessory maker, and it is now offering Tesla yoke steering wheel replacements:
The company is working off of a regular yoke wheel and adding “the finest 3M metal structure and baltic birch plywood” to create the new shape.
Now, this obviously only “fixes” one of the major complaints about the steering wheel – its shape – and not the lack of stalk.
It still uses force touch buttons to replace the functions of the stalks, including the turn signals.
It has some other caveats, like the lack of airbags and the loss of a heated steering wheel if you choose the cold weather package.
Update: Tsportline says that it actually uses the airbag in the original steering wheel assembly.
Finally, there’s also the price. Starting at $2,299, it’s far from cheap.

2022/01/12,"Tesla announced that it will release its 2021 Q4 earnings report on January 26, and Elon Musk confirmed that he will come back to the call and give a Tesla product roadmap update.
The automaker confirmed the date of its next earnings report in a press release today:
AUSTIN, Texas, January 12, 2022 – Tesla will post its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021 after market close on Wednesday, January 26, 2022. At that time, Tesla will issue a brief advisory containing a link to the Q4 and full year 2021 update, which will be available on Tesla’s Investor Relations website. Tesla management will hold a live question and answer webcast that day at 4:30 p.m. Central Time (5:30 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company’s financial and business results and outlook.
Last year, CEO Elon Musk announced that he wouldn’t attend the earnings conference call anymore. However, Musk said last month that he would be attending the next call to give a “product roadmap update”:
Product roadmap update on next earnings call.
Now we know that it is going to happen on January 26.
The CEO originally made the comment in response to a question about the Cybertruck after Tesla removed Cybertruck specs and prices from its website. Therefore, the automaker is expected to release more details about the updated new trims and pricing for the electric pickup truck. Musk already confirmed that the new top trim and the first one to production is going to be a quad-motor version. But we don’t know how much it is going to cost.
The previous top Cybertruck trim was a tri-motor version with over 500 miles of range starting at $69,900:
An update on the planned timing of the start of production could also be part of the road update. Tesla previously stated that production of the Cybertruck should start around the end of 2022.
As for other products on the roadmap, Tesla is also expected to give an update on Tesla Semi. Low volume production of the electric semi truck has started at Tesla’s facility in Nevada. Tesla investors are going to be looking at an update on the production specs and timing on volume production at Gigafactory Austin.
An update on Model Y production coming from Gigafactory Austin and Gigafactory Berlin would also be welcomed by Tesla shareholders.

2022/01/12,"Tesla is taking delivery of yet another giant casting machine, known as Giga Press, at Gigafactory Texas as the automaker moves to produce entire car bodies in just a few pieces.
Over the last few years, Tesla has been heavily investing in casting and alloy technology to enable larger casted parts that have the capability to greatly simplify manufacturing. 
The company acquired several units of the biggest casting machines in the world. Those giant, multi-million dollar machines are developed by Idra. Tesla’s first Giga Press, which was installed at the Fremont factory, was put into operation in 2020. The machine, nicknamed Giga Press, was the first of its kind at the time and has a clamping force of 55,000 to 61,000 kilonewtons (5,600 to 6,200 tf).
Tesla has already been producing the Model Y with a single rear body piece that replaced 70 different parts in the vehicle.
Now Tesla has started deploying those machines at other factories in the US, Berlin, and China. Gigafactory Texas in Austin has been getting a lot of them. 
Jeff Roberts, who often flies drones over Gigafactory Texas, spotted another Giga Press delivery at the factory this week:
Another Giga Press for Giga Texas! This makes four. #Tesla #GigaTexas #Gigafactory pic.twitter.com/5vU9pawEyJ
This is believed to be the delivery of the fourth Giga Press at Tesla’s new Texas factory.
Last year, a picture of the first single front casting part of the Model Y produced at Gigafactory Texas leaked. In October, we reported that Tesla produced the first Model Y with both front and back single-piece casting.
While Tesla has slipped behind in starting production at Gigafactory Texas, which was supposed to kick off last year, it looks like the automaker is going to start production with its front and back single-piece casting with Giga Press and possibly link both with its structural battery pack.
This will drastically reduce the number of parts needed to produce a vehicle body, which will simplify production and greatly reduce the capital needed to deploy production capacity.
It was disappointing that Tesla didn’t manage to start production at Gigafactory Texas in 2021, but as I have often stated, the ramp is more important than the start of production. And with four Giga Presses now deployed, it looks like Tesla is preparing for a massive ramp-up at Gigafactory Texas.
I think the bottleneck is going to be 4680 battery cell production, which we have been hearing less about.

2022/01/12,"A new video shows how Tesla Solar Roof automatically makes snow slide right off it to be able to keep producing electricity.
Solar Roof is Tesla’s solution to deploy solar power on brand-new houses or houses that are in need of a new roof.
Homeowners that are soon going to need a new roof generally don’t want to install rooftop solar panels since they are going to need to be removed during roof replacement.
To remedy the situation, Tesla designed glass roof tiles with embedded solar cells resulting in a roofing product that is long-lasting and produces electricity.
After a few delays to test the product for longevity, reduce cost, and improve installation times, Tesla has started to ramp up installations of the solar roof in the last year.
Recently, Tesla almost tripled its Solar Roof deployments, and CEO Elon Musk said that it is Tesla’s next “killer product.”
Early installations were in markets like California and Florida where snow is rare, but now that installations are ramping up, we see more of them up north where snow is going to be a common occurrence on those solar roofs.
People have some misconceptions about solar in colder climates, like that it only has value in places that get a lot of sun.
Solar power systems indeed produce more energy in regions that get more sun, but they also work well in less sunny places.
They even produce some energy in very cloudy weather as photons from the sun will still get through, but if your solar power system is covered in snow, it will not generate energy.
But that doesn’t mean that rooftop solar installations are not useful in the winter.
Solar panels produce some heat that can help snow melt or slide off the roof faster by creating a layer of water to help gravity after an accumulation from a snowstorm.
While it’s true of solar panels, it’s also true for Tesla’s solar roof tiles, which makes it interesting since, unlike solar panels, they cover the entire roof.
Now we see an interesting early example of it.
Jason Lassen, a new Tesla Solar Roof owner in Wisconsin, shared video of his roof during and after a snowstorm:
As you can see, while the snow accumulated briefly, it slid off the Tesla solar roof while neighboring houses still had snow-covered roofs.
Interestingly, it quite uniformly slid off the roof despite the fact that some of the tiles have solar cells embedded in them and some don’t.
In the past, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even discussed the possibility of implementing a heating grid to automatically melt snow and ice off your solar roof in order to prevent the disruption of energy generation.
Update 2022: Tesla shared another cool example of solar roof’s snow shedding capability:

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.
Apple CarPlay® is standard on every #LucidAir. pic.twitter.com/Daw0zDlne4
Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/01/12,"Tesla owners are again losing heat in extremely cold weather as some heat pumps are failing badly.
The problem was thought to be fixed last year, but it is resurging in a big way this year.
Around this time last year, we published a report: Tesla owners of brand-new Model 3 and Y cars plagued with heating issues in dead of winter.
The problem was with the newly introduced heat pump.
Tesla claimed to have solved the problem with an over-the-air update, but now a year later, it is resurging in a big way.
Currently, Canada and the north of the US are hitting new record cold temperatures with several regions doing down below -30C (-22F).
As an example, it’s so cold out right now that I just got an alert that one of my security cameras at my house in Shawinigan, Quebec had to shut itself down to protect against the cold:
It’s the first time I’ve ever seen that happen and it’s apparently not only affecting cameras.
The forums and social media are full of Tesla owners reporting issues with their heating system, like it was last year.
Again, it appears to only affect owners of newer Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles equipped with a heat pump system
Heat pumps are super-efficient, but they are known to not work as well in extreme cold (around -15C or 5F and below).
Tesla claimed to have solved that with a dual loop system, but it appears that something else is failing.
Several owners are reporting being hit with this system alert and completely losing heat in the car (via John Saxon): 
This is creating potentially dangerous situations as some Tesla owners can get stuck in remote locations in freezing temperatures without heating.
Several Tesla owners who brought their car into Tesla service centers following the issue were told that the automaker is aware of the problem and it is working on a software fix.
However, it looks like it might need more than a software fix.
Jimmy Yeung, a Model Y owner from Toronto, had the same issue happen in his Model Y and the service center had to replace the AC compressor and the supermanifold “Octovalve” part of the heat pump system.
He shared the service bill on Facebook that showed that it would have cost over $5,000 CAD ($4,000 USD) if the work wasn’t done under warranty:
Now this might be more of an extreme case, and if the problem is caught sooner and fixed by a software update it could potentially prevent a full replacement.
Tesla told several owners of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with heat pumps experiencing issues with heating that the problem could be as simple as ice affecting the front air intake near the windshield, which triggers an error in the heat pump sensor.
The company recommends using pre-heating to thaw the air intake and/or manually removing the ice.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously called the Model 3 and Model Y heat pump system “some of the best engineering he has seen in a while“.
It looks like it still might need some work.
It’s disappointing that this issue is surfacing a year later when we thought it was fixed.
For owners Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with heat pumps in cold weather regions, you should really take this into consideration when going on longer road trips as there’s a real danger in being stuck somewhere without heat.
Be prepared.
As for the fix, Tesla can hopefully find something soon, and for its own sake, I hope it’s not what happened to Yeung because it’s going to get costly fast, as I wouldn’t be surprised if this issue affects thousands of vehicles.
And for EV naysayers, don’t be too quick to rejoice because, at the very least, those Tesla vehicles are driveable albeit cold.
At these temperatures, many combustion engine vehicles have issues starting. Also, the issue is limited to Tesla vehicles with heat pump. 
My 2018 Model 3, which doesn’t have a heat pump, started just fine and had heat this morning at -20C. That’s according to my friend who is driving my car while I’m in Mexico though (haha).

Bizarre anti-environment move by govt of California https://t.co/1OwdBNWbxT
On Monday, Tesla, which sells solar roofs and solar panels, launched a web page to enable people to complain to Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) about the proposal:
Tell Governor Newsom and the CPUC to reject the proposed solar tax and retroactive changes to existing solar customers.
Encourage the Public Utilities Commission to reject a proposed punitive tax on solar customers and retroactive changes to existing customers. 
The CPUC’s controversial NEM 3.0 proposal, which is expected to be voted on later this month, imposes fees on solar and battery storage customers, which would make solar and storage more costly. NEM 3.0 would reduce the bill credit solar customers get for selling electricity back to the grid. As Electrek reported on January 3:
The credit for energy that residential solar owners put back into the grid would be slashed to a wholesale rate of about $0.04 per kWh.
On top of slashing net metering rates, the NEM 3.0 proposal adds a new fixed monthly charge for solar owners of $8 per kW installed on their roof.
It means that someone with a 10 kW system has to pay $80 per month to their electric utility just to stay connected to the grid and send back electricity at a new lower rate.
At a press conference on Monday, Newsom expressed concern about the proposal, which is backed by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric. All are investor-owned electric utilities. Bloomberg reported yesterday about that press conference:
“I’ll say this about the plan, we still have some work to do,” Newsom said. He later added that he thinks changes will need to be made to the proposal that’s expected to be voted on later this month by state utility regulators. He didn’t say what those changes would be.
In a statement released yesterday, the Environmental Working Group‘s president and California resident Ken Cook weighed in on Newsom’s statement:
We welcome the governor’s comments and respectfully urge him to use his voice and full authority to stop the ill-conceived plan. It is clearly meant to increase profits for the utilities and crush the only competition they now face – the competition from Californians who are investing to install solar panels and, increasingly, battery storage on homes, businesses, schools and in communities.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) stated in an email on December 13 that “this decision will deter many Californians from installing rooftop solar and storage and slow clean energy deployment, leaving the state’s grid vulnerable to blackouts and power outages, and harming California’s ability to reach its clean energy goals.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA, said then in a written statement:
Only the wealthiest Californians will be able to afford rooftop solar, shutting out schools, small businesses, and the average family from our clean energy future.
The only winners today are the utilities, which will make more profits at the expense of their ratepayers. We urge Governor Newsom to act quickly to change this decision — at risk are 65,000 solar jobs, the security of our electricity grid, and the health of California residents and our planet.
We at Electrek advocate for clean energy, so of course we think NEM 3.0 is a terrible idea. The State of California needs to put its citizens and the environment first if we are going to continue the race to combat climate change.
Musk weighing in is only going to help fight this misguided proposal. Newsom needs to do the right thing and kill it.

2022/01/12,"Tesla, which has managed to avoid reporting autonomous driving data to the DMV, could be forced to open the books on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta to the California DMV after what the latter called “videos showing dangerous use.”
Many companies from Apple to Tesla have been testing autonomous driving technology in California.
The California DMV requires them to share data from their autonomous driving programs, like disengagements and accidents.
Tesla has been able to avoid sharing this data with the DMV, and it has officially only logged in a few hundred miles of “autonomous test driving” in the state over the last seven years.
We have previously reported that most if not all of that mileage was related to creating video “demonstrations” of Tesla’s self-driving technology.
But since the release of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program, things have been more complicated.
Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) is an early version of Tesla’s self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company through its “safety test score.” The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system despite its name. 
Previously released communications between Tesla and the California DMV showed that the automaker asked the DMV to be exempt from its autonomous test reporting because FSD Beta requires driver supervision at all times, and therefore, it doesn’t fit its description of autonomous.
The DMV accepted this explanation, but after some pressure from a state senator last year, the government agency now said that it is “revisiting” this decision.
The decision to revisit forcing Tesla to report autonomous driving data was confirmed in a letter the DMV sent on Monday to State Senator Lena Gonzalez, who put some pressure on the DMV about Tesla’s FSD Beta in a letter in December.
In the letter, the DMV said that they decided to review their decision after “recent software updates” and “videos showing dangerous use” among other things (via the LA Times):
“Recent software updates, videos showing dangerous use of that technology, open investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the opinions of other experts in this space” prompted the reevaluation, the DMV said in a letter Monday to state Sen. Lena Gonzalez (D-Long Beach), chair of the Senate’s transportation committee.
Several Tesla owners who have received access to the FSD Beta software have posted videos of the feature at work.
While none of them have shown accidents, several have shown near-misses that could have been extremely dangerous.
Last year, Tesla told FSD Beta testers to “be selective” in what they share on social media about the FSD Beta program and that “a lot of people want them to fail.”
The DMV didn’t offer a timeline on when it might make a decision on changing its definition of autonomous driving testing to get Tesla to report its data.
At this point, I’m all for it. Tesla should share more data about its Full Self-Driving program.
They owe it to the thousands of people who bought the FSD package and have nothing to show for it years later.
FSD Beta has been out for over a year now, and Tesla itself admits that it is optimized for California roads where most of the early testing happened.
Right now, we can only track progress through anecdotal data points based on what owners with FSD Beta share, which is less than ideal to say the least.
If Tesla was to release disengagement data, which is how many times drivers need to intervene when FSD Beta is active, it would give us something tangible to track progression.
What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below.

2022/01/11,"Tesla’s sales numbers for December in China are in, and it shows another record month of deliveries and confirmed that almost half of Tesla’s record year of production and deliveries came from Gigafactory Shanghai.
The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released its numbers early on Tuesday and showed that Tesla sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December – a new record.
The vast majority were sold in China, and only 245 units were exported to other markets.
Gigafactory Shanghai has become Tesla’s exportation hub, and early in the quarter – in this case, October and November – the automaker produces vehicles for international markets, especially Europe and Asia, and focuses on producing vehicles for the Chinese market later in the quarter.
These new 70,847 units add up to now a total of 473,078 vehicles coming from China or sold in China for Tesla in 2021.
That’s roughly half of the 936,000 electric vehicles delivered by Tesla last year.
About 160,000 of those 473,000 vehicles were exported to markets outside of China.
It shows just how critical Gigafactory Shanghai and the Chinese market have become to the American automaker.
Tesla had previously guided an annual output of 450,000 vehicles out of Gigafactory Shanghai in 2021.
It not only beat that, but if the rate achieved in December is maintained, which is not a guarantee with the supply chain issues, Tesla would have a production capacity of over 800,000 vehicles annually at the plant.
It will be interesting to keep an eye on Tesla’s output out of China in the next few months to see if this incredible capacity is maintained.
If it’s the case, Tesla is going to see a massive ramp-up in 2022 with this new capacity in Shanghai being combined with the Model Y ramp-ups at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas.
Wall Street is currently expecting Tesla to deliver about 1.4 million vehicles in 2022, which is roughly a 50% increase year-over-year.

2022/01/11,"Tesla has unveiled an updated version of the Model S today with new headlights, taillights, and CCS charge ports.
Tesla started producing a refreshed version of the Model S just six months ago with a completely new interior, refreshed exterior features, and updated powertrain.
That’s why it was surprising to see a new Model S prototype already spotted being tested by Tesla last month.
As we noted at the time, the prototype seemed to have new taillights and a slightly modified backend with also a bigger charge port.
We suspected that this could be a new version of the Model S meant for international markets with some of the design updates likely to make it to the North American version, which is currently the only one being delivered.
Sure enough, Tesla unveiled in Taiwan today a new version of the Model S featuring those changes and more (via Caster on Facebook):
It’s the first time that the new Model S is shown in an international market other than Canada.
Generally, Tesla will introduce the European or Asian version of a new car, or in this case an updated version of an existing model, with the appropriate charge port, but this time it also made some other changes.
Both the headlights and taillights are brand new.
The new headlights appear to also be matrix projector headlights, like the ones found on the latest Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
The backend of the Model S has also been modified. Tesla has removed the trim over the license plate for a more simple and streamlined look.
At the same time, Tesla also unveiled the new Model X, but it didn’t feature the same changes other than the CCS port pictured above.
These new vehicles are expected to be the new Model S and Model X that Tesla will deliver to international markets with the CCS standard.
The design changes are expected to also make it to the version of the Model S made for the North American market since Tesla produces all Model S vehicles in the Fremont factory.
The only change that might not make it to the North American version is the bigger charge port to support the CCS connector, which is bigger than Tesla’s proprietary plug.

2022/01/10,"Tesla has signed a new deal to source nickel for battery cell production from an upcoming new mine in the United States. It’s a landmark deal to start sourcing the critical battery material in the US and help boost upcoming new mining projects.
Over the last few years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been pushing for nickel producers to boost production as he expects the resource could become a bottleneck for battery production.
The company gets its nickel overseas. Vale, the Brazilian mining giant, is Tesla’s main nickel supplier, and the company has recently done a big deal to secure nickel supply from New Caledonia. But, North American production of nickel is limited, and Tesla is not sourcing locally.
There are several new projects in the work as demand for nickel is expected to explode. The EV market is already affecting the nickel industry despite BEVs representing less than 4% of the global auto industry.
Nickel prices went up 85% in the last years. By the end of the decade, it is expected that EV nickel demand could jump from 5% to 59% of overall nickel supply. This is not sustainable, and it is going to require many new nickel mines to open.
Talon Metals, which is working on just such an endeavor in central Minnesota – called Tamarack Project – announced today that it signed a deal with Tesla to supply the automaker with 75,000 metric tonnes (165 million pounds) of nickel in concentrate.
Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon, commented on the deal:
This agreement is the start of an innovative partnership between Tesla and Talon for the responsible production of battery materials directly from the mine to the battery cathode. Talon is committed to meeting the highest standards of responsible production that is fully traceable and that has the lowest embedded CO2 footprint in the industry. Talon is excited to support Tesla’s mission to accelerate the transition to renewable energy
Drew Baglino, SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, added:
The Talon team has taken an innovative approach to the discovery, development and production of battery materials, including to permanently store carbon as part of mine operations and the investigation of the novel extraction of battery materials. Responsible sourcing of battery materials has long been a focus for Tesla, and this project has the promise to accelerate the production of sustainable energy products in North America
Talon Metals shared the main details of the deal:
The Tamarack project is expected to enter its production phase in 2026.
A major electric automaker like Tesla deciding to support a project to establish a local supply chain for nickel is a good signal for junior nickel miners in North America.

2022/01/10,"A 9,000-plus lb., 1000 hp, three-motor, all-wheel drive mechanical monster, the new GMC Hummer EV defies most people’s understanding and expectations of what a car can do. Astonishingly, this nearly five-ton beast can rocket from 0–60 mph in 3.0 seconds in production trim – which is impressive enough, until you find out that the prototypes could do wheelies!
You read that right. GMC’s new Hummer can pop a wheelie if the conditions are right. That’s according to the vehicle’s chief engineer, Al Oppenheiser, who told the story to Peter Holderith over at The Drive.
Update, we’re told the Drive misrepresented the story and the 9000lb pickup didn’t and can’t in fact do a wheelie. 
“In the early days when we were just trying to balance the front and rear torque, I got the front end to lift (in WTF, or Watts to Freedom, mode),” says Oppenheiser. “We had to back off the torque on the front end.” As delivered (to that one guy, presumably), the three-motor Hummer can still absolutely roast all four of its 35-inch Goodyear A/T tires from a standstill … if not halfway down the eight.
The big electric Hummer isn’t the only EV known to be able to pop wheelies on the regular. Back in 2008, with Tesla on the verge of bankruptcy, Elon Musk struck a deal with Mercedes-Benz to develop an electric Smart car. There were a few problems with this.
You can probably guess what happened, but I’ll tell you anyway: Tesla took a Roadster drive train and stuffed it underneath an otherwise bone-stock Smart ForTwo. The end result was something Elon Musk called, “the fastest car ever made … It was so fast you could do wheelies in the parking lot.”
Doug Dirac posted a video of the Tesla-powered Smart ForTwo back in 2009, during the Menlo Park Model S unveiling party. He talks about first gear being “interesting,” and gives it a blast down the back lot. It looks quick, if not quite as quick as the new Hummer.
Whether you’re putting a powerful electric motor into a Smart car or a ’72 Plymouth Satellite, it’s going to be quick off the line. That’s just the nature of electric motors because they produce maximum torque at 0 rpm, as opposed to an internal combustion engine that needs to “rev” in order to reach its peak output. With enough traction, torque, and the right (or, wrong, I guess) weight distribution, you’ve got wheelies.
All of which, of course, begs the question: Can the production Hummer do a wheelie? “However, when it comes to the production versions of the hefty 4×4, [Oppenheiser] made it clear that, for ‘functional safety reasons,'” writes Holderith, in his original article, “that wouldn’t be in the Hummer’s big bag of tricks.”
Which, like, lame, but understandable.

2022/01/10,"As we eagerly slam the book shut on 2021 and look toward a promising year of further EV adoption in 2022, it’s important to look back and assess how far the global market has come during this most recent trip around the Sun. From there, we can compare 2021’s numbers to the year prior and gain an idea of the trajectories many of the major EV automakers may travel on into 2022. We will begin with EV deliveries in China, a rich mecca of EV production and innovation with many companies now expanding to other markets around the globe.
As you will soon see from the chart below, EV sales and deliveries continue to boom in China, which has become a major hub for electrified innovation. This makes a lot of sense given how much technological and battery manufacturing the country does for the global market.
Below is a list of 10 of the more prominent Chinese automakers either solely producing or pivoting toward all-electric vehicles. Some are new, some are old (by infantile industry standards), but all are seeing growth in sales, production, and deliveries.
You may notice a couple major names are left off the list. Baidu for instance, has not released any of its Q4 numbers nor has it provided an annual report for 2021. Geely also did not provide a breakdown of its deliveries sorted by type, so they’ve been left off too – although, we did include two Geely sub-brands/JVs, Zeekr and Lynk & Co.
You’ll also notice tremendous numbers from SAIC Motor. While SAIC is a major automotive conglomerate in China, its numbers on these charts are a bit skewed. SAIC Motor along with competitor Great Wall Motor provided sales data for total NEVs, not solely BEVs. 
We made do with the data we could gather but wanted to present that caveat. Lastly, Tesla’s official numbers aren’t public in China yet, although they should be any day now. For now, the totals are based off confirmed deliveries in China through November 2021 plus December estimates made by teslashanghai on Twitter.
Rounding out the bottom of the list is the newest brand of the bunch, Zeekr. The Geely-owned EV brand just shared its December production numbers, and while they’re minuscule compared to other Chinese competitors, the company is ramping up at a pace close to 90% month over month. 
With about 6,000 deliveries of its 001 sedan in 2021 (deliveries began in late October), Zeekr is aiming for 70,000 in 2022 and 650,000 by 2025. They’ll be one to watch.
WM Motor (Weltmeister) has been around a bit longer but has also seen big gains as of late. Its 44k+ deliveries in 2021 are close to matching its previous three years combined. 2021 saw a 200% increase compared to 2020.
Rounding out the first half of the list are three of the bigger names in EVs in China. Li Auto, NIO, and XPeng are close competitors in their segment, although Li Auto has only produced PHEVs thus far. Nevertheless, 2021 deliveries showcase how evenly matched these automakers are. Of the three, XPeng takes the crown on EV deliveries in China in 2021. In fact, its 263% YOY growth is the best of the entire bunch.
Beginning at #5 is Great Wall Motor, which is reporting 1.28 million vehicle deliveries for 2021. Of that total, 136,953 were NEVs (including PHEVs), an over 80% increase compared to a year ago. Hopefully, GWM will focus on furthering EV production to ensure an even larger piece of overall deliveries is electric in 2022.
A sleeper on this list is the Geely/Volvo PHEV sub-brand Lynk & Co., which made up a huge chunk of the Chinese umbrella company’s EV numbers for 2021. The year saw over 220,000 deliveries and a year-over-year increase over 25%. Although, that’s the lowest YOY growth on the list.
BYD was very straightforward in its annual report, tallying 320,622 BEVs produced this past year. That makes it second only to SAIC, whose numbers are not as large as they seem. 
Tesla remains the most successful automaker in the US and a global leader by marketshare, and it continues to make progress in China as its Shanghai facility truly hits its stride. The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) just released December numbers, allowing an annual total to be tallied for 2021 of at least 473,078 units. 
The Chinese automotive conglomerate has joint ventures with several legacy automakers around the globe, contributing to its robust delivery numbers. According to its sales volume report, the company sold over 5.64 million units in 2021 alone. Over 730,000 of them were NEVs, but that number also includes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

2022/01/10,"Tesla is losing its head of human resources, Valerie Capers Workman, who has also been seen as the number one diversity advocate at the company.
Workman, an attorney, joined Tesla’s legal department as associate general counsel for compliance back in 2018. She quickly rose through the ranks, and in 2020 she was made vice president of people, the highest HR role at the automaker, reporting directly to CEO Elon Musk.
Today, Bloomberg reported that Workman is leaving Tesla to become chief legal officer of career-placement firm Handshake. 
She commented in an email:
I am proud of all that I was able to accomplish at Tesla with the support of truly excellent colleagues, especially the People and Legal teams,” Workman said in an email. Citing her high school experience in track and field where she needed to “pass off the baton in a better place than when I received it,” Workman wrote that she was “confident that I have done this at Tesla with the implementation of so many important programs for employees worldwide.
As the highest-ranking black executive at Tesla, Workman often commented on diversity at the automaker. Recently, she defended Tesla’s support for minorities within the organization after several lawsuits exposed alleged “racial abuse” and “a culture of sexual harassment.”
Tesla was recently ordered to pay an ex-worker $137 million in a racial abuse lawsuit. In response, the automaker published a blog post that consisted of an internal email that Workman sent to employees:
The Tesla of 2015 and 2016 (when Mr. Diaz worked in the Fremont factory) is not the same as the Tesla of today. Since then, Tesla has added an Employee Relations team, dedicated to investigating employee complaints. Tesla has added a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team dedicated to ensuring that employees have the equal opportunity to excel at Tesla. And Tesla now has a comprehensive Employee Handbook (replacing the Anti-Handbook Handbook) where all of our HR policies, employee protections, and ways to report issues are published in one easy-to-find online document.
The executive was also featured in Tesla’s first diversity and inclusion report as an example of the automaker promoting minorities. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Workman was also the one addressing employee concerns amid CEO Elon Musk pushing for reopening the Fremon factory despite local restrictions.

2022/01/10,"Tesla has received a special approval from the Brandenburg State Environment department to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory berlin ahead of the much-coveted final approval.
Over the last year, Tesla has run into a lot of red tape while trying to get approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin, a giant new factory located near Berlin in Brandenburg. 
The bottleneck right now is the environmental approval from the Brandenburg State Environment Ministry.
Most recently, environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project, which delayed approval for another month. The new period concluded last November, and Tesla has been rumored to be on the verge of approval, but it has yet to happen.
While waiting for the approval, Tesla was authorized to produce 250 Model Y bodies for testing purposes. Some Model Y vehicles were spotted leaving the plant last month. Now, Tesla has received another approval to produce 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin.
This is a much higher number, but Tesla will not be able to sell those vehicles.
According to the updated advanced approval, Tesla told Brandenburg that it wasn’t satisfied with the quality of the first 250 vehicle bodies that it produced (translated from German):
The applicant has explained in detail – and also plausibly for the approval authority – their technical necessity. Because the results of the ongoing system tests show that the necessary quality and production efficiencies in relation to the above-mentioned operating units have not yet been achieved. The parts and/or bodies manufactured or joined as part of the system tests have a poor quality that deviates significantly from the system specifications. It is also understandable for the authority that the system tests are those that represent the indispensable minimum for the respective test procedures with a view to the specific system (parts) to be tested.
Tesla is approved to produce 500 Model Y bodies per week and therefore, it would take them at least four weeks to produce those vehicles.
That said, this doesn’t mean that it couldn’t get the final approval beforehand since the government has confirmed that it received all the necessary documents to make a decision as of the last week of December.
Here’s the full document for advanced approval:
[scribd id=552082735 key=key-5K2jEra0r3SsNa5VlV2Y mode=scroll]

2022/01/10,"Tesla has been spotted using a mobile Powerpack battery system at its first Megacharger station for the Tesla Semi electric truck in Nevada.
The details of the charging solution are still unknown.
Last October, we reported that Tesla was finally deploying its first Megacharger station at Gigafactory Nevada to support its upcoming fleet of Tesla Semi electric trucks.
The automaker has been leading the way in terms of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles with its Supercharger network, but it won’t be able to support electric semi trucks.
It needs a new solution, and with the unveiling of the Tesla Semi in 2017, Tesla unveiled its plan to deploy “Megachargers,” a more powerful version of its Supercharger network that can add 400 miles of range in just 30 minutes.
This would require a charging capacity of over 1 MW or about four times the current top charging output of a Supercharger. Our calculations showed that it could be as high as 1.6 MW.
We don’t know the specs or any details of the Megacharger just yet as Tesla hasn’t commented on the first station deployed at Gigafactory Nevada.
But we have now received some new pictures of the Megacharger station from Jason Colepaugh that hint at an interesting aspect of the Megacharger.
Tesla was spotted using a mobile Powerpack battery system on a trailer at the Megacharger station:
While we can confirm what Tesla is doing with these Powerpacks, we believe the automaker is likely testing the energy storage system as a solution to the extremely expensive demand charges that will come with operating a charging system such as a Megacharger.
Demand charges are a higher rate that an electric utility charges when a user’s electricity needs a spike.
It can be extremely costly for electric vehicle charging networks considering the nature of their electricity needs – a station can see minimal use for most of the day and then have several EVs show up to charge at once.
Tesla has been known to deploy Powerpacks at some Supercharger stations to address the issue, and Electrify America has deployed Tesla Powerpacks at over 140 of its own charging stations for the same reason.
When first announcing the deal with Tesla, Giovanni Palazzo, president and chief executive officer at Electrify America, told us that some utilities will charge them as much as $30 to $40 per kW in demand charges.
Now, this is a problem for something like a Megacharger, which could see no use most of the day, and at one point, an electric truck stops by to charge at over 1 MW.
Instead, Tesla can use the grid or solar to slowly charge a Powerpack battery system and use it to shave some of the peak demand when a Tesla Semi stops by to charge.
It would certainly help the cost of charging those big electric trucks, but is it enough to deliver on Elon Musk’s previously announced guaranteed rate of $0.07 per kWh at Megachargers? Doubtful.

2022/01/10,"Tesla is using its “Tesla Engage” platform to ask its fanbase to support a new push to convince the New York governor and legislature to allow direct sales of its electric vehicles in the state.
To this day, there are still some states that prevent Tesla and other automakers from selling directly to consumers.
It’s due to old laws put in place to protect franchise dealerships against automakers trying to compete with the people who invested a lot of money into providing a sale and service workforce for them.
It made a lot of sense.
But now those same laws are being used to prevent Tesla and other new automakers who never had franchise dealerships from competing against dealers who sell vehicles from other automakers.
It is being used in an anti-competitive way.
Several states have changed those direct sale laws in order to avoid this misuse that gave a monopoly on car sales to third-party dealers.
New York went with a strange comprise.
In 2014, the state changed its laws to enable Tesla to open five stores in the state.
It didn’t take long for the automaker to outgrow those five stores, but several attempts to expand were shut down over the years.
Now Tesla is trying again, and this time it is enlisting its fanbase to help through “Tesla Engage,” a social platform that launched last year.
In a post about the situation in New York last week relayed by Tesla NY Club manager Stephen Pallotta , Tesla argues that the state is behind on electric vehicle adoption because of its direct sale restrictions:
“New York State has adopted the strongest climate law in the country, yet it is 23rd in electric vehicle adoption per capita and lags far behind states like California, Colorado, Florida, and Massachusetts that are leading in EV adoption. Florida allows direct sales without restriction and has over 50% more electric vehicle registrations per capita than New York simply because it is easier to buy an electric vehicle there. This has to change.”
The automaker asks people to contact Governor Hochul and NY Leadership and express their support for direct sales of EVs:
“Support direct sales in New York by making your voice heard. Please consider contacting Governor Hochul and NY Leadership today, and encourage them to support direct sales for electric vehicle manufacturers.”
Up until recently, Tesla was alone in this fight. But now that Rivian and Lucid have both managed to bring new electric vehicles to markets as new automakers who never were involved in the dealer model, they are also pushing for better direct sale regulations.

2022/01/07,"Tesla announced today that it is going to increase the price of its Full Self-Driving package to $12,000 starting on January 17. The price bump should coincide with the release of an important new update.
The Price of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) package has been somewhat controversial.
CEO Elon Musk has made Tesla’s pricing strategy clear when it comes to FSD: Tesla is going to increase the price of the package as it introduces new features. But, since the package doesn’t actually do what the name says (which is for the vehicle to fully drive itself), people have criticized Tesla for increasing the price, which gradually went up to $10,000.
The automaker has refrained from increasing the price since launching the Full Self-Driving Beta program in October of last year, but now Musk has announced that Tesla will increase the price to $12,000 on January 17:
Tesla FSD price rising to $12k on Jan 17
That’s despite most people buying the package not getting any more features and most drivers not having access to the FSD Beta.
Speaking of the FSD Beta, Musk also said that a new update (10.9) should be coming next week around the same time as the price increase and another bigger update will come “probably next month”:
Beta 10.9 should be ready in about a week. Beta 11 with single city/highway software stack & many other architectural upgrades probably next month.
The price increase is only in the US, which is also the only market where the FSD Beta is available to people who have a “driver safety score” of over 97.
Last year, Tesla also launched its FSD subscription service at $199 per month. It’s likely to also see an increase in price since Tesla says that it wants the one-time purchase to be the best economic option.
As we previously reported, Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) is an early version of Tesla’s self-driving software that is currently being tested by a fleet of Tesla owners selected by the company through its “safety test score.” The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.
Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level-two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a two steps forward, one step back type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities.

2022/01/06,"Tesla announced today the launch of ‘Plaid Track Mode’, a new version of its track mode software to push the track performance of the Model S Plaid to a whole new level.
The automaker originally launch ‘Track Mode‘ for Model 3 Performance back in 2018.
The software fine-tuned the dynamic controls for better track performance.
In 2020, Tesla released a new version of track mode: Track Mode V2. 
The new version of the software included a lot more customization features and even included maps of some racetracks with a full video game-like experience inside the car.
Now that Tesla has the new Model S Plaid, its highest performance car yet, the company is relating yet another version of track mode: Plaid Track Mode.
It enables everything that the stability control, handling balance and regenerative braking.

Since Track Mode was launched in 2018 on Model 3 Performance, we have taken advantage of instant motor torque to make cornering on the track feel as natural as forward acceleration.
This week, Plaid Track Mode is rolling out to Model S Plaid vehicles across North America. With Plaid Track Mode our goals were simple: achieve the quickest lap time for a production electric vehicle at Germany’s Nürburgring, and allow individual adjustability of stability control, handling balance and regenerative braking to give drivers more authority over vehicle control at the racetrack.
Plaid Track Mode was developed to take full advantage of our tri-motor platform and more than 1,000 horsepower on tap, with features including:
With Plaid Track Mode, we have added a host of new features to make Model S Plaid as quick around a racetrack as it is at the drag strip. Our approach focuses on allowing greater driver control and adjustability while promoting driver confidence, and like most aspects of Tesla vehicles, we’ll continue to improve Plaid Track Mode over time with future over-the-air updates.

2022/01/06,"Tesla has unveiled its giant new Megapack battery project in Texas in a new Youtube video. It’s one of the biggest yet.
Texas is having to rethink its electric grid after bad weather last winter put so much pressure on the grid that it pushed it to the brink of failure. The strain resulted in many regions having rolling blackouts, and a lot of people are rethinking their energy situation.
Residential energy storage has gained popularity with homeowners in Texas since the crisis as they don’t want to rely on the grid too much. Electric utilities are also turning to energy storage on a bigger scale, and there has been a big project underway in Angleton near Houston.
Tesla was revealed to behind the secretive big battery project in Texas early last year. Now the company has unveiled the 81-Megapack project in a new Youtube video:
Tesla wrote about the project in the description:
In Angleton, Texas, an energy storage project was proposed to provide sustainable backup support to the grid. This resulted in the installation of 81 Tesla Megapacks, providing greater outage protection while reducing the community’s reliance on fossil fuels.
The project has a capacity of 100 MW/200 MWh – making it one of the biggest Tesla energy storage projects in the world. Hopefully, it will help soften the blow if an event similar to last February’s happens again, but the Texas grid is going to need to add a lot more backup power.
As we previously reported, Tesla has been approved to be an energy distributor in the state of Texas. The move is part of CEO Elon Musk’s vision for Tesla Energy to become a distributed global utility, an endeavor that could even outgrow the company’s automotive business.
Texas, where Tesla has officially moved, could become a big market to help the company achieve this goal. The company has several major energy projects underway in the state, including a deal to deploy solar roofs and Powerwalls on a “large scale” in a new community being built in Austin.

2022/01/06,"Tesla had record sales in the United Kingdom in 2021, and the new car registration data show that it helped the country reach a new electric market share milestone: over 10% of the auto market for the first time.
With car sales being down across the board since the pandemic, it’s giving EVs an opportunity to capture more market shares. Several markets have seen massive jumps in EV market shares in 2021.
We have seen several jumped over 10% market share, but those are mostly smaller markets, which is why it is impressive to see what is happening in the UK.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) released the December numbers, and the 2021 numbers. It showed that battery-electric vehicle market share went up from 6.6% to 11.6%:
For the first time in a long time, petrol-powered vehicle market share have dipped below 50% of the market. Tesla contributed the most to this milestone with the Model 3 being the best-selling EV in the market.
The electric sedan outsold the next three best-selling EVs combined:
34,783 units delivered in 2021 was also enough to make the Tesla Model 3 the second best-selling vehicle overall in the UK last year:
In Europe, several smaller markets have also achieved new records thanks to Tesla starting Model Y deliveries, but the UK didn’t have this advantage because the automaker has yet to produce a right-hand-drive version of the electric SUV.
It’s a significant milestone for a major auto market like the UK to reach over 10% BEV market share.
We will probably not see that in North America until there is volume production of electric pickup trucks just because of how popular the segment is here, but we are still seeing the important market shift.
Once you are almost doubling market shares per year, things start to move fast.
I wouldn’t be surprised if we see the same thing happen in the UK again this year, especially with new EV models launching on the market, like the Model Y.

2022/01/05,"Our Next Energy, also known as ONE, installed one of its battery packs in a Tesla Model S and managed to have it travel 752 miles on a single charge.
The Model S is Tesla’s longest-range vehicle with up to 405 miles of range on a single charge depending on the configuration.
CEO Elon Musk has often said that Tesla could make it have an even longer range by jamming a 120 kWh battery pack in it, but the automaker instead focuses on achieving a longer range through better efficiency.
In order to showcase its own battery technology, Our Next Energy (ONE) has now installed its own battery system in a Model S.
The company did a test drive with an average speed of 55 mph and achieved a range of 752 miles:
Our Next Energy, Inc. (ONE), a Michigan battery technology company, has demonstrated a proof-of-concept battery that powered an electric vehicle 752 miles without recharging. The vehicle completed a road test across Michigan in late December with an average speed of 55 mph. The results were validated by a third party using a vehicle dynamometer where the test vehicle, a Tesla Model S retrofitted with an experimental battery, achieved 882 miles at 55 mph.
They released a video of the range test:
In the original press release, the company didn’t explain anything about its battery technology.
After we asked, ONE sent Electrek more details confirming that they added about 99.8 kWh of energy capacity in the vehicle, which originally comes with a ~100 kWh pack, through a higher energy density design:
The battery system has an energy density of 416 Wh/L (compared to approximately 245 Wh/L of the original pack) and uses a Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese cathode and a graphite anode. The pack added an additional 331 kg in total to the original mass of the battery (and vehicle) while also adding 99.8 kWh of energy. The specific energy density of the pack we tested measured at 231 Wh/kg.
Aside from an impressive energy density, there’s not a lot of information in this statement since the chemistry of using a nickel-cobalt-manganese cathode and graphite anode is fairly common.
Though the company also added that it plans to change the chemistry of its Gemini battery:
Gemini will employ a new graphite free anode and a Nickel-Cobalt free cathode improving energy density to approximately 450 Wh/L and 290 Wh/kg in the long term. We have 10 Ah cells on test that support the system targets above and plan to scale up these test cells to produce 1000s by mid 2022. We will integrate a full pack using Gemini architecture for pairing a LFP traction battery with a manganese rich anode free range extender by the end of 2022.
The Michigan-based company plans to produce a production prototype of its cell by the end of next year.
This is interesting, but as I stated, it lacks details. Also, the fact that it achieved an impressive range doesn’t mean that this solution is commercially viable. The longevity of the pack has not been addressed and a 200 kWh battery pack would greatly increase the price of the vehicle.
So it’s something to keep an eye on, but I’ll keep a healthy skepticism for now.

2022/01/05,"Nikola has officially given up on its $2 billion patent trolling lawsuit against Tesla over the design of the Tesla Semi electric truck.
As we previously reported, Nikola alleged that Tesla’s electric truck design infringes on its existing design patents for an old truck prototype it unveiled in 2016. 
Specifically, a series of three design patents that Nikola obtained for the design of its Nikola One truck.
The patents are about simple design features, like a mid-entry door, the general shape of the fuselage,  and the windshield wrapping around the cabin.
We broke down each of the Nikola’s specific claims in what we believed basically amounted to a patent trolling case in a purely design-based objective way.
Nikola was asking for $2 billion in damages from Tesla in the lawsuit.
Over the last year, Nikola has run into a lot of other issues unrelated to Tesla. Last year, Nikola was in hot water after a report from Hindenburg Research made several allegations exposing deception by Nikola and its founder Trevor Milton, including several claims corroborated in previous reports from Electrek and Bloomberg.
Nikola issued a response to those claims, but as we reported, the response lacked any rebuttal of the main allegations of deception by the company and its founder, Milton.
The most damning claim was that it faked the first video of its hydrogen truck driving. The company even admitted to it, without issuing an apology, and instead claimed its deception was fine due to a technicality. Milton ended up leaving the company as the pressure started to increase.
In July, Milton was officially charged with three counts of criminal fraud over false claims he made about the company. 
It looked like these issues have taken Nikola’s attention away from its $2 billion lawsuit against Tesla.
The judge in the case said that Nikola stopped responding to inquiries from the court, and it looked like the case was about to be dropped, but the company started focusing on it again back in October.
However, now a few months later, Nikola has finally decided to drop the lawsuit.
In a new joint filing in federal court this week, Nikola agreed to drop the $2 billion lawsuit and Tesla dropped the counterclaims it made against Nikola.
As we previously reported, Tesla claimed that Nikola stole its truck design from a Rimac designer in response to the lawsuit.
Now they decided to put the whole thing behind them with nothing being accomplished over the three years of litigation except for a bunch of lawyers being a lot richer.

2022/01/04,"Tesla announced that it installed a new Supercharger station in Hawaii, which means that the  Supercharger network is now “officially” in all 50 states.
I say “officially” in quotes because technically, there was already a station in Hawaii, but there was a big caveat.
Electric vehicle adoption is starting to ramp up in more significant volumes, and the charging infrastructure is following to support those new EVs.
Just a few years ago, people were still talking about EV adoption and charging infrastructure as a chicken or egg problem.
But as with most new technology in need of infrastructure, they both have been growing simultaneously.
Tesla has been a good example to follow with its Supercharger network, the most extensive global fast-charging network.
The automaker invested heavily in the network in the US, its home country and a huge market for Tesla.
In November 2021, we reported that Tesla had finally expanded the Supercharger network in all 50 states with a new Supercharger in Alaska, the last state that didn’t have a Supercharger.
Technically, Hawaii already had a Supercharger station on the island of Lanai, but it was built for Tesla board member Larry Ellison who owns most of the island.
So with a new station launching in Aiea, Hawaii today, Tesla announced that it has “officially” expanded the network in all 50 states:
Supercharging goes to Hawaii and is now in all 50 states.New Tesla Supercharger: Aiea, HI (6 stalls) pic.twitter.com/eVSBRfk8BV
Tesla previously announced that it reached the new milestone of 30,000 Superchargers worldwide.
Earlier this summer, we reported on how Tesla is gearing up for a giant Supercharger expansion ahead of opening the network to other EVs.
Following Tesla’s confirmation of this, the automaker started hiring many new charging design managers – in charge of opening new stations in the US.
As we noted, the move coincides with a new $7.5 billion federal program to fund EV infrastructure that is currently being adopted, and one of the requirements to get access to the funds is that the charging stations are open to vehicles from more than one automaker.
By opening its network, Tesla will increase traffic, but it will also have access to more funds to grow the network faster. And Tesla plans to grow its Supercharger network quickly.
Last year, Tesla announced plans to triple the size of the Supercharger network within two years.

2022/01/04,"Panasonic announced that it is going to purchase copper foil produced from recycled materials by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel’s Redwood Materials for battery cell production at Gigafactory Nevada.
The materials will end up in Tesla vehicles – going full circle.
When JB Straubel left Tesla in 2019 to focus full-time on Redwood Materials, Tesla fans were disappointed because the engineer was critical to the company’s technological success. However, we suspected that Redwood Materials would eventually collaborate with Tesla and help the automaker solve some supply issues in the future.
While that’s not happening directly yet, it is happening indirectly through Panasonic.
Redwood Materials has been best known as a Nevada-based company developing new processes to recycle materials with a focus on electric car batteries, but the company recently announced that it is also getting into cathode and anode production with a 100 GWh battery material factory in the US. Redwood Materials is becoming a full-cycle battery material company.
During a presentation at CES, Allan Swan, President of Panasonic North America, announced: 
“By the end of this year, we expect to include Redwood’s copper foil, produced from recycled materials, back into our new battery production.”
This anode copper foil from recycled material is going into Panasonic’s battery cell production at Gigafactory Nevada and will eventually end up in Tesla’s electric vehicles. Redwood Materials confirmed in a statement to Electrek that the company plans to start anode copper foil production in the first half of the year.
In short, starting this year, the company is already going to contribute to Tesla’s supply chain, which is growing fast as the automaker ramps up EV production at a record pace.
As we previously reported, Redwood Materials recently raised $775 million to accelerate its plans, and it also partnered with Ford to help the company with its battery supply chain.

2022/01/04,"Criticisms of Tesla are mounting up over the company’s announcement that it is opening a new store in Xinjiang, a region of China where human rights groups believe the Chinese government put over 1 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities in labor camps.
After U.N. experts and human rights groups have raised the issues with China’s treatment of Uyghurs in the region for years now, there has recently been mounting pressure from Western governments on China to address the situation in Xinjiang.
The Chinese government has denied that the camps where the Muslim minorities are sent involve forced labor or any kind of abuse.
Instead, they claim that they involve “vocational training.”
With the situation seemingly at an impasse, several groups have suggested boycotting companies that do business in the controversial region.
Volkswagen was recently in hot waters for defending its factory in the region.
Now the attention is turning to Tesla.
Last week, Tesla announced that it is opening its first Tesla Center in the region (via Weibo):
Several groups have since come out asking Tesla to shut down the new store.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim advocacy group in the US, wrote in a press release:
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today called on Elon Musk to close a recently-opened Tesla showroom in China’s Xinjiang region, where Chinese authorities are carrying out a campaign of genocide targeting the Uyghur Muslim minority.
In a comment, CAIR national communications director Ibrahim Hooper said that Tesla’s new store “amounts to economic support for genocide”:
No American corporation should be doing business in a region that is the focal point of a campaign of genocide targeting a religious and ethnic minority. Elon Musk and Tesla must close this new showroom and cease what amounts to economic support for genocide.
US officials have stated that they see the treatment of the Uyghur in China as a “genocide.”
The CAIR has been recently launching boycott initiatives over the issue, like boycotting Hilton hotels for building a hotel on the site of a mosque that was demolished in the region.
Several politicians and human rights groups criticizing Tesla, like US Senator Marco Rubio, see the store opening as Tesla taking a side on the issue:
Right after President Biden signed Sen. Rubio’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, @Tesla opened a store in #Xinjiang. Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labor in the region. https://t.co/2yWBTQSLbM
The automaker hasn’t commented on the response to its store opening in Xinjiang.
Tesla doesn’t have a PR department to answer press questions anymore, but it does in China.
Companies being criticized for doing business in the region have been careful about how they comment on the situation since they get affected both ways.
Both Intel and H&M faced issues with Chinese customers earlier this year after they simply stated that they do not use forced labor, which China saw as suggesting that there is forced labor in the first place.
Chinese State run media offered up the following:

2022/01/03,"Investors welcomed Tesla’s (TSLA) Q4 production and delivery numbers as they sent the automaker’s market capitalization surging up by $100 billion on the first trading day of 2022.
Tesla’s lead in electric vehicle production is becoming undeniable.
As we reported yesterday, Tesla released its Q4 2021 results and confirmed that it produced “more than 305,000 electric vehicles and delivered over 308,000 electric vehicles during the quarter.”
These results were about 40,000 electric cars over Wall Street expectations, which is a massive expectation beat – even for Tesla.
With demand for electric vehicles going through the roof, the focus is on automakers ramping up EV production, and Tesla is proving to be the best at it right now.
Cars, electric or otherwise, are hard to manufacture, and it takes time to increase production volumes.
On top of it, current supply chain issues are making things difficult throughout the entire auto industry.
It makes Tesla’s growth over that period even more impressive:
For years, Tesla naysayers have said that demand will fall once other automakers launch electric vehicles, but as many EV proponents predicted, the opposite happened.
There are more EV models available than ever, yet Tesla’s demand is at an all-time high, which leads to long wait times to get a new vehicle.
It shifted the focus from demand to production. Now the race is to deploy as much EV production capacity as possible to meet that demand.
Last quarter, Tesla surprised with a big jump of 70,000 more electric vehicles produced compared to the previous quarter.
It showed the automaker’s impressive capacity to increase production, and the market rewarded the company with a more than 10% jump this morning:
This kind of jump in value is massive for a company already valued at over $1 trillion. It means that Tesla’s market capitalization increased by over $100 billion this morning.
Tesla’s stock is reaching close to its all-time high that it achieved after Hertz announced that it ordered 100,000 Model 3 vehicles.

2022/01/03,"Tesla has become the best-selling brand in Norway for the whole year of 2021 despite having only two models available on the market, which helped the country hit again new electric vehicle records.
Norway has been the leading market for electric vehicles in terms of adoption per capita.
As many markets are introducing plans to “ban” gas-powered cars by 2030, 2035, and even later, Norway is aiming for each new car on the road to be all-electric by 2025, and it’s on pace to achieve that early.
The results this year have been nothing short of stunning, with the December numbers released today being no exception and showing us the whole year.
64.5% of all cars sold in Norway in 2021 were all-electric – up 10 points from last year:
As you can see, sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines (petrol and diesel) have slowed to a crawl with only 4% market shares each.
If you look at the top 10 best-selling vehicles in the market in 2021, you will only find all-electric vehicles except for the Toyota RAV4:
Tesla Model 3 is leading by a wide margin and the brand also has the Model Y in 4th place with over 8,000 units delivered in 2021. 
It was enough to make Tesla the best-selling car brand in the country in 2021:
That’s despite not delivering any Model S and Model X in the market and the Model Y coming later in the year. Other electric vehicles also added significant volumes, like the VW ID.4 electric SUV, the Volvo XC40, and the Mustang Mach-E.
This goes to show that the notion of Tesla falling once the competition arrives is false.
The EV competition has arrived in Norway, but it doesn’t affect Tesla because the demand for EVs in the market still outpaces supply. For years, I’ve been talking about an imminent market shift, which for the US, I think should happen in 2024-25, where the vast majority of new car buyers realize that their next car needs to be all-electric.
That shift already happened in Norway and we see what’s happening in the market. Soon, we are going to see more and more markets making a similar shift and whatever automaker can allocate more EV supply in those markets will come out on top.
Right now, this is still Tesla.

2022/01/03,"Tesla is rallying its employees to fight back against California’s NEM 3.0 proposal that could potentially make its biggest solar market not viable.
NEM 3.0 is a controversial proposal from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that would introduce some massive changes to net metering for solar customers of the three major electric utilities in the state.
The credit for energy that residential solar owners put back into the grid would be slashed to a wholesale rate of about $0.04 per kWh.
This would destroy the value of residential solar in California, especially for those who don’t have a home energy storage system, like a Tesla Powerwall, with their solar power system.
On top of slashing net metering rates, the NEM 3.0 proposal adds a new fixed monthly charge for solar owners of $8 per kW installed on their roof.
It means that someone with a 10 kW system has to pay $80 per month to their electric utility just to stay connected to the grid and send back electricity at a new lower rate.
The new proposal, which is currently being reviewed by CPUC, has been slammed by solar companies and environmental groups for discouraging a shift to residential solar, while the three major electric utilities – PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E – have voiced their support for the proposal.
Tesla, which aims to become a major decentralized electric utility with its solar and battery systems, is now voicing its opposition to the proposal and asking employees in California to contact the CPUC to let them know they are against the proposal:
Tesla is working with our partners in the solar and environmental community to urge the CPUC and Governor’s office to adopt a more reasonable approach that doesn’t punish solar customers.
Here’s the full communication to employees from Tesla first reported by CNBC:
Announcement – Net Energy Metering 3.0

2023/03/23,"Tesla Supercharger locations are now being integrated into Rivian’s navigation system as part of the automaker’s latest software update.
After years of planning and speculation, Tesla finally opened up the first few Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US last month. Tesla is integrating what it calls the Magic Dock as a new docking station for its connector on some Supercharger stations.
When a Tesla vehicle comes to charge, it acts as a regular docking station for the Tesla connector, but when a non-Tesla EV comes to charge, through the Tesla mobile app, they can unlock the Magic Dock and turn it into a CCS adapter.
It is going to be a game changer for electric vehicle owners as many consider Tesla’s Supercharger network to be the best DC fast-charging network in the US. But for now, only a dozen stations have this Magic Dock.
This will help all the Rivian owners who live near a Tesla supercharger with a Magic Dock. For now, that's almost nobody. Eventually, it might be useful. Whenever I've taken a recent road trip, I generally see at least one Rivian at one of the supercharger stations, plugged into a nearby third party charger. It's enough of a presence to show me that they exist, but is a tiny fraction of the number of Teslas charging there. I hope to see more Rivians someday. 
Even though it’s just starting, some automakers are already taking advantage of this.
Rivian, which has a very similar charging strategy to Tesla, has already released a new software update that includes these Supercharger locations with Magic Dock in their navigation system:
Your vehicle now shows select Tesla Supercharger locations with a Magic Dock in the Navigation app’s charger filters. A Magic Dock allows you to charge your Rivian at select Tesla Supercharger locations. These locations also show in the Rivian mobile app version 1.12 or later. To charge at a Tesla Supercharger, you need to download the Tesla app.
As previously stated, Rivian has a similar approach to charging as Tesla with its own Rivian-branded Adventure Charging network while most other automakers rely on third-party networks. However, Rivian is still early in the deployment of its own network with only two dozen stations in operation to date.
Therefore, Rivian owners still have to rely on third-party networks and now adding Tesla’s Supercharger network to the mix is going to be helpful as more stations get the Magic Dock.

2023/03/23,"Who says you can’t adventure in style with zero emissions and at a reasonable price? Grounded, a Detroit-based electric RV startup, launched the first fully customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1, on Thursday; it’s based on the Ford E-Transit. And the best part is that the electric RV is offered at an affordable price through its subscription model, with deliveries expected to begin in April.
Grounded was established in 2022 by a group of former Tesla and SpaceX engineers. The startup was invited to work out of Ford and Newlab’s “Accessible Streets Studio” in Detroit, designed for testing new electric vehicles for a cleaner tomorrow.
Aiming to “create amazing products that will enable people to explore more without harming the planet,” Grounded plans to lead the charge with fully electric, zero-emission customizable RVs. 
The company is launching, what it calls, the world’s first fully electric customizable smart electric RV, the Grounded G1.
Grounded says it developed the G1 in response to the shift toward spending time outdoors that spurred during the pandemic. More importantly, it aligned with the expansion of charging infrastructure to finally support outdoor electric RVs. 
Grounded CEO and former Senior Software Engineer at SpaceX (where he embedded software for Starlink), Sam Shapiro, says:
The Grounded G1 gives people the freedom and self-reliance to live, work, and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated with nature.
The G1 is built on Ford’s E-Transit platform, the top-selling electric commercial van in the US, featuring up to 108 miles of range, a comfortable ride and handling, and a spacious interior that includes: 
In addition, built-in 650-Watt solar power capacity is used to power appliances and augments the powertrain charge.
Shapiro says the company has designed a new assembly system allowing them to manufacture customized designs at scale with “near-infinite” layouts. Through the Grounded app, you can control appliances, lighting, temperature, view charging, water use, fuel, and other data, as well as receive diagnostics.
To make it more flexible and affordable for everyone, Grounded offers its electric RV with a $2,300-per-month subscription, making it a good option for those who don’t want to commit fully.
Otherwise, the purchase price is $125,000 and is available today to reserve for a $100 refundable deposit on Grounded’s website. Deliveries of the G1 will begin in April 2023.
Although $125,000 may not seem affordable, paying $2,300 a month gives people the alternative to committing to a full purchase of even a gas-powered RV that can be well over $500,000.
Compared to other electric RV options like the Bowlus Volterra starting at $310,000 or Lightships L1 all-electric RV trailer for $125,000, a subscription option doesn’t seem so bad for a customized smart EV alternative.

2023/03/24,"Tesla has released a new software update activating its vision-based park assist feature, and videos are starting to roll in showing it in action.
In October of last year, Tesla abruptly decided to stop including ultrasonic sensors on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. These ultrasonic sensors were used for short-range objects detection, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, like parking, to help drivers know how far they are from objects outside the car.
Tesla said at the time that it planned to move to a fully vision-based parking system, using the myriad cameras around its cars to estimate distances and provide park assist functions, without the added complexity of these additional ultrasonic sensors.
Since then, these vehicles have been delivered without sensors, but with no driver aids to help in parking. For these cars, Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon would not be available until a software update came along to enable them.
Now, just under six months later, these software efforts have finally borne fruit as Tesla has started rolling out vision-based park assist in its 2023.6.9 update. It should be available on cars now or soon, so check for software updates if you’ve been waiting for this feature.
The update notes state:
Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car.
Note: Tesla Vision Park Assist is for guidance purposes onlv and is not a substitute for an aware driver. Please be attentive and avoid obstacles as required.
The update does not seem to activate Autopark, Summon, or Smart Summon, yet merely brings back the lost functionality showing drivers how far they are from various objects while parking their car.
Videos have started to surface on social media showing drivers testing out the new functions in their garages and driveways, and results so far seem… a little inconsistent.
It seems to work reasonably well in some situations, showing roughly similar graphics as the vehicles with sensors, but with the added benefit of detecting objects all around the vehicle, instead of just in front or behind. One driver found the measurements to be quite accurate in a well-lit and straightforward parking lot:
Vision Park Assist measurement was surprisingly accurate in this case! Distance verified with tape measure @klwtts @WholeMarsBlog @itskyleconner @BeardedTesla @teslascope @NotATeslaApp pic.twitter.com/7j8eOlt66G
Though the lines are quite wiggly, significantly more so than they are when using ultrasonics.
In other situations, the system still seems like it needs work. Here, a driver pulls between two cars and toward a trash can, before the system deactivates and states “park assist unavailable” when he gets close enough to actually need it. Then, he gets out to compare the car’s 26-inch approximation with reality, and eyeballing the distance, thinks that it’s closer to “three and a half, four feet”:
And here, another driver tries to use it with a bike rack attached to the rear of his Tesla, and the system continually detects the rack as an obstruction, repeatedly telling him to stop even though there’s plenty of room behind the car:
@Tesla vision USS parking does not like my bike rack. pic.twitter.com/PHCgyFvW51
Well, it’s clear that the system still needs some work. Which, frankly, is not unexpected when it comes to Tesla’s history with similar things.
A couple years ago the company abruptly removed radar from its cars, moving to a fully camera-based system for its driver assist features (which it’s now reversing course on). At the time, this led to temporary limitations for new owners of non-radar cars, who had to wait for software updates to re-add those features.
The same has happened here with ultrasonics, which caught several customers by surprise. Tesla has sold a lot of cars in the last six months, and I know of at least one who hadn’t heard the news of the missing ultrasonic sensors and was quite annoyed to realize he had just bought a vehicle without a relatively standard modern feature that he had expected his brand-new high-tech $53,000 car would have.
Tesla owners have gotten used to similar things happening, and often give the company slack because actions like these are balanced out by the benefit of over-the-air updates, which improve cars and add features over time.
While I like and enjoy my Tesla without parking sensors, I probably won't buy another Tesla.  Between the autopilot that is inferior to radar cruise control, the lack of parking sensors, and the horrible windshield wiper sensors, there are just some real annoyances that are entirely avoidable on Tesla's part.  And the gap between charging networks seems to be narrowing enough to not make that a major issue.
But this is such a basic and expected feature on modern vehicles, and it has been estimated that these sensors cost about $114 per car. That’s a significant cost but certainly not a massive one, but we’re six months in and so far we’ve only seen one of the four missing features reactivated for the cars in question.
Further, the feature just doesn’t look ready for prime time yet. A feature like this doesn’t need to work 50% of the time, or even 99% of the time – it needs to work 100% of the time because any dings or scratches don’t just go away the next time you park, they stay there for good. If drivers are going to rely on it, and use it in place of their eyes, it needs to be reliable. And if drivers aren’t going to use it in place of their eyes – as Tesla currently recommends that they don’t – then why don’t they just use… their eyes? What’s the point of the sensor if it’s just replicating what your eyes see?
One benefit of ultrasonics is to provide additional confirmation of distance through something other than vision. As in the first embedded video above, the driver could already estimate distances with his eyes, but the ultrasonics would give him additional information that he doesn’t have visually. If the car is just estimating visually the same way the driver does that, then it’s not giving any new information.
This doesn’t mean the system can’t improve. Surely it can and it will have access to more advantageous angles than the driver’s eyes do, and be able to look all around the car at once instead of only in one direction at a time (as it already can). And in certain situations, it already seems to do a good job. But for now, the visualization doesn’t seem a lot better than eyeballing, which is disappointing six months after the feature was unceremoniously eliminated. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another six months for underwhelming results from Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon.

2023/03/23,"Lucid Motors is in the process of delivering all four of the original trims of its flagship Air sedan promised when the ultra-long-range EV made its initial debut a couple of years ago. We’ve had a chance to experience several of those models inside and out, but have wondered when the promised addition of Apple CarPlay would arrive. Today, Lucid has finally confirmed that CarPlay will now come as a standard feature.
To date, we’ve experienced Lucid’s Dream Edition Air sedan, the Grand Touring Performance, and most recently the Touring. None have disappointed. As the most affordable Air Pure sedans make their way to reservation holders next, we are awaiting that drive opportunity… well, that and the tri-motor Sapphire of course. 
As we’ve relayed, there is a lot to admire in the Lucid Air. From its 500+ mile range, to its ultra-efficient propulsion and proprietary Wunderbox charging system, much of the components inside the Lucid Air are easy to marvel at. All within a luxury sedan that is loaded with top tier design details – new features I personally continue to notice each time I get behind the wheel of one, no matter the trim level.
Up to this point, Lucid’s own UX has been more than adequate and has gotten better over time as the American EV automaker has worked out many of the early software bugs over-the-air. However, sometimes… many times, it’s just easier to connect your own smartphone and use Apple CarPlay… even in a Lucid Air.
The ability to access your iPhone’s apps through a vehicle’s head unit has come in truly clutch over the years as we are more familiar with our phones and their software, whether its easier access to Google Maps or your latest Taylor Swift playlist on Spotify.
When I test out EVs, I’ll always use the EV’s own system to at least try it out, but will almost always end up using Apple Carplay (ideally wirelessly) whenever possible, even if its in a $100,000 EV. Until today however, the ease of Apple Carplay was not available in the Lucid Air. That wait is now over.

Lucid announced the addition of CarPlay integration as a standard feature in the tweet seen above. Per the automaker, its latest OTA update will allow current Lucid Air owners to gain access to Apple CarPlay capabilities, opening a new door to easily accessible apps right from the EV’s own Class Cockpit touchscreen.
Lucid says the latest software update will roll out to its EVs in the next week and will come implemented on Air sedans rolling off its assembly lines going forward. Keep an eye out for that update and enjoy!

2022/01/02,"Tesla (TSLA) announced that it achieved both record production and deliveries during the last quarter of 2021.
The automaker produced “more than 305,000 electric vehicles and delivered of over 308,000 electric vehicles during Q4 2021.
Sunday morning, the automaker decided to release its production and delivery numbers for the fourth quarter of the year:
“AUSTIN, Texas, January 2, 2022 – In the fourth quarter, we achieved production of more than 305,000 vehicles and deliveries of over 308,000 vehicles. In 2021, we delivered over 936,000 vehicles.”
This is a massive quarter-over-quarter increase considering Tesla produced 237,000 vehicles during the third quarter.
Most of the increase came from Model 3 and Model Y production, which Tesla still doesn’t differentiate in its report:
Deliveries came in way above the Wal Street consensus of about 265,000 deliveries in Q4.
But more importantly, these results give Tesla an annualized production rate of over 1.2 million vehicles, which is unprecedented for producing electric vehicles.
Since these are the fourth quarter results, we now have Tesla’s full 2021year delivery and production numbers.
With the significant beat on deliveries in Q4, Tesla is finishing the year with 30,000 more deliveries than most estimates.
Another incredible quarterly performance by Tesla. Congrats to everyone involved.
The most impressive part is undoubtedly achieving a run rate of 1.2 million vehicles and doing it without even having started production at Gigafactory Berlin or Gigafactory Texas.
As I started in my article about Tesla in 2022, this year is again all going to be about growth for Tesla and I believe exiting 2022 with a run rate of 2 million electric vehicles would be a great goal.
But I thought Tesla might exit 2021 with a run rate of 1 million to 1.1 million vehicles. 
Now it looks even more achievable, but it’s still going to be a difficult task.
Let’s say there is room to add capacity for 200,000 vehicles at Shanghai and Fremont this year, it means that both Gigafactory Berlin and Texas each need to reach a production capacity of 300,000 vehicles by the end of the year.
To be clear, I am not talking about each producing 300,000 vehicles in 2022, but exiting the year at a production rate of 300,000 vehicles per year.
That requires a fairly smooth production rate at both plants, which is going to be hard to do, but achievable in my opinion especially since Shanghai got up to speed very quickly.
The other story is in the mix of cars. Model S/X accounted for only about 2.5% of Tesla’s sales for the year. Obviously the switch to the new models had some downtime, but the mix is overwhelmingly the smaller cars. That means that Tesla is almost entirely selling the Model 3/Y which are both based on a singular vehicle platform. 
",tesla
2021/12/31,"When I think about what Tesla’s upcoming 2022 year is going to look like, I think it will revolve around growth, much like 2021. But there will also be a renewed focus on securing battery cells in an even more competitive landscape.
Gigafactory Shanghai has proven to have plenty of room to grow, and it has become Tesla’s new main export hub.
The automaker entered 2021 with a production rate of about 700,000 vehicles per year, and it looks like it’s about to exit 2021 with a production rate of over 1 million vehicles per year.
Tesla launched the new Model S and Model X in 2021 and added a bunch of new features to its existing lineup, but it didn’t really unveil or launch a whole new product.
I think 2022 is not going to be as much about new products for Tesla either.
There’s a chance that the company will unveil its $25,000 model and launch the Cybertruck, but if either of those things happens, it is going to be toward the end of the year, and it’s not going to have much impact on Tesla in 2022.
I think Tesla’s 2022 is going to be about growth again with the start and ramp-up of production at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin.
The automaker’s most important goal in 2022 is going to be achieving the highest production volume possible at those factories while maintaining good gross margins and efficiency.
While new products are not going to be an area of focus, in my opinion, you could argue that the growth is going to come from a new product. The Model Y that Tesla plans to produce at those two new factories is basically going to be a whole new version of the car, powered by Tesla’s new 4680 cells.
And it means that, for Tesla, 2022 is also going to be about battery cells.
The automaker is looking to become a major manufacturer of battery cells in 2022, which is new for the company.
Tesla has been involved in battery cells for a long time, but it never manufactured them itself until starting production at its 4680 pilot plant in Fremont last year.
In 2022, Tesla looks to expand into massive volume production of those 4680 battery cells at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin simultaneously.
The automaker is still buying as many battery cells as it can from suppliers, but I believe its own cell production in 2022 is going to be a difference-maker.
I think also think we will also see a focus on securing the raw materials to produce those cells.
Increased production from existing nickel, lithium, and graphite mining companies and mines is not going to be enough in the next few years, and we are going to need a lot more production to come online.
I wouldn’t be surprised to see Tesla get more involved with off-take agreements to help finance new projects. The automaker has dipped its toes in this area before, but it has the potential to have a great impact here in the next few years.
But ultimately, in 2022, we should want to keep an eye on Tesla’s 4680 production volumes, which I’d like to see reach an annual rate of 50 GWh by the end of the year and an overall vehicle production capacity of two million vehicles.
As CEO Elon Musk often points out, manufacturing is the most difficult thing, which means that Tesla is going to face a lot of challenges in trying to achieve both of these goals.
Our Tesla reporting in 2022 is likely to focus a lot on how the company is trying to overcome these goals.
Now you could argue that calling any of these “side projects” is extremely diminutive – and you would be right.
Some billion-dollar companies are built around delivering competitive products to those of Tesla’s “side projects.”
But the way I see it is that Tesla’s biggest impact is in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles, which it achieves through producing compelling electric vehicles in higher volumes than anyone.
Therefore, in 2022, delivering over 1 million (probably closer to 1.5 million) Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, as well as building the supply chains to support even more electric vehicle production, will be the most impactful things.
That said, Tesla is also going to make progress on other projects, like Full Self-Driving.
The automaker made a lot of progress on that front in 2021, and I think 2022 will be similar. I don’t think 2022 is the year Tesla will deliver on its promise with FSD, but it could start to get close.
Tesla Semi is also likely going to be a more important product in 2022, but I don’t think Tesla will be ready to produce it in significant volume until 2023 – when its own battery cell production starts to achieve higher volume.
As previously mentioned, Tesla has been guiding a start of production for Cybertruck in 2022, but if it’s going to happen, it will be very late in the year. I think 2023 is going to be the big year for Cybertruck.
As for the Roadster, we might see a new prototype in 2022, but I doubt production will begin until 2023.
The new $25,000 Tesla might see a prototype unveiling too, which is likely to be a massive news event, but it’s something that won’t reach production until 2024-25.
I think we are also going to see some other surprises in 2022, but the meat will be Model 3 and Model Y growth with a battery cell production ramp.

2021/12/31,"Tesla has started two recalls of almost 500,000 vehicles in the US due to a problem with its trunk latch and reverse camera.
Now we learn that the same recalls are extending to 200,000 more vehicles in China.
Yesterday, we reported on NHTSA announcing that Tesla initiated two recalls.
The first recall affects about 119,000 Model S sedans in the US and it involves a potentially misaligned front trunk (frunk) latch that can result in the hood opening when driving.
Now China’s State Administration for Regulations has announced that Tesla is also recalling 19,697 Model S vehicles imported into the country for the same problem.
They wrote in the notice (translated from Chinese):
“Vehicles within the scope of this recall may have a situation where the front trunk latch and the lock catch are aligned slightly behind. Although this situation does not affect the locking of the primary latch, it may affect the locking of the secondary latch. . When the primary latch is accidentally released, if the secondary latch is not locked, the front trunk lid may suddenly open while the vehicle is driving, affecting the driver’s line of sight, increasing the risk of a collision, and posing safety hazards.”
The second recall NHTSA announced yesterday involved up to 356,309 Model 3 vehicles in the US built between 2017 and 2020.
The rearview camera harness may be improperly assembled, which could lead to it being damaged and not working anymore.
In China, they announced that the same issue is resulting in a recall of 35,836 imported Model 3 vehicles and 144,208 Model 3 vehicles built at Gigafactory Shanghai.
In both cases, Tesla is notifying the affected owners. It will check each car and fix the latch or rear camera harness if needed.
As we reported yesterday, the fixes for both issues are fairly simple and inexpensive, but they will put a strain on Tesla’s busy service team due to the volume of vehicles to check.
",tesla
2021/12/30,"Tesla (TSLA) has issued two recalls on almost half a million Model 3 and Model S vehicles.
The fixes are small, but it will still put a strain on its service team.
The first recall involves the latch of the Model S’s front trunk (frunk), which could have been misassembled, leading to it opening by itself while driving.
NHTSA writes in the recall notice:
“Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling certain 2014-2021 Model S vehicles. The front trunk latch assembly may be misaligned, preventing the secondary hood latch from engaging. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 113, “Hood Latch System.”
It can affect up to 119,000 Model S vehicles built between 2014 and 2021.
Tesla will inspect all vehicles affected and fix the latch if required.
The second recall affects up to 356,309 Model 3 vehicles built between 2017 and 2020.
The rearview camera harness may be improperly assembled, which could lead to it being damaged and not working anymore.
NHTSA writes in the recall notice:
Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) is recalling all 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles. The rearview camera cable harness may be damaged by the opening and closing of the trunk lid, preventing the rearview camera image from displaying.
The solution is to inspect all affected vehicles and install “a guide protector and new cable harness” if necessary.
The fixes are fairly small and simple here, but it’s still a significant recall for Tesla since it needs to physically inspect almost half a million vehicles.
It’s something that will put a strain on its service team over the next few months.

2021/12/30,"New York City is closing out the year with a big electrification move as it adds 184 Ford Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs to its fleet, and it approves the option to buy 250 Tesla Model 3 electric sedans.
Most of the vehicles are going to the NYPD and other emergency service departments.
Earlier this month, we reported on the city of New York proposing a contract to buy a fleet of up 250 Model 3 vehicles from Tesla.
We later learned that the Model 3 vehicles would be used as police patrol cars by the NYPD.
The city has now approved the option to purchase the vehicles.
It doesn’t mean that the Tesla vehicles are on order, but they can buy up to 250 Model 3 vehicles from Tesla at any time in the next five years.
The program is part of a new $420 million investment to “drastically cut citywide climate emissions and advance carbon neutrality” that Mayor de Blasio announced earlier this month.
It includes a plan to buy “over 1,250 electric vehicles” in 2022 alone.
The city of New York operates a fleet of about 30,000 vehicles and the single biggest category of NYPD vehicles, which replaces its police cars at a rate of about 1,400 vehicles per year.
Now they have the option to buy 250 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, but they also already made some actual EV orders.
Today, the city announced that it placed an order for 184 Mustang Mach-E SUVs:
Today the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) announced that it is placing an order for 184 all-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E Sport Crossover Utility Vehicles for law enforcement and emergency response use. The new electric crossovers, purchased as part of the City’s largest electric vehicle (EV) purchase to date, are slated for use by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the New York City Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Correction, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Protection, NYC Emergency Management, DCAS Police, and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The new electric vehicles will replace gas-powered vehicles currently in the City fleet. The new all-electric crossovers will be received by the City by June 30, 2022.
Ford has always had a significant market share in the police car market, but that was with its internal combustion engine-powered vehicles.
Now the Mustang Mach-E, its first all-electric vehicle built to be electric from the ground up, is already dinging some success in the market.

2021/12/29,"Tesla is going to start sponsoring Formula SAE electric racing teams with free battery cells and discounted hardware.
The automaker has often hired former students who participated in these competitions.
Formula SAE is an organization that puts together student competitions in the field of mobility.
Over the last decade, electric vehicles have been popular with the teams of student engineers entering the contests.
It provides them with real experience building electric vehicles in a competitive setting.
Tesla has been hiring a lot of students who participated in Formula SAE competitions after the fact.
Now the automaker wants to get involved earlier in the process and directly sponsor some teams.
John Furtado, a staff mechanical design engineer at Tesla, wrote on LinkedIn about the genesis behind Tesla’s involvement in the competition:
“Last summer, several of us from Tesla volunteering at the Formula SAE events were dismayed at the number of electric vehicles competing and started discussing what Tesla might be able to do to help accelerate that transition. Pretty excited to be able to share this sponsorship opportunity, just in time for the holidays. If your team is planning to enter any of next year’s Formula Student events as an EV, act fast since applications are due Wednesday the 29th.”
Furtado, who participated in Formula SAE competitions when he was a student at Western Washington University, shared the application form, but today is the deadline to apply.
Tesla wrote in the form:
“As a part of Tesla’s mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we will be supporting university student teams aspiring to build electric vehicles as part of Formula SAE and Formula Student competitions around the world.”
The automaker will offer two options to the teams that it will sponsor.
They can choose to get up to 1,000 Tesla battery cells or a heavy discount from Enepaq, which makes custom components for prototypes:
Furthermore, Tesla said that it will also “offer sponsored teams the opportunity to review their designs with some of the world’s leading electric powertrain engineers and will provide guidance through the design and validation process.”

2021/12/29,"Elon Musk says that he is considering Tesla Bot becoming more than just a humanoid robot to perform useful tasks but to have it potentially develop a unique personality and be a companion.
He says Tesla Bot could make an “incredible buddy like C3PO or R2D2.”
Earlier this year, Musk announced plans for Tesla Bot, a humanoid robot equipped with artificial intelligence aimed at completing general repetitive tasks.
At first, it sounded like another one of Musk’s jokes, but as we previously reported, it is a real project, and Tesla already started hiring for it.
Musk said that Tesla would build the robot to do useful work, and he even suggested that it could help solve the labor shortage.
On the Lex Fridman podcast, Musk was asked if he considered a potential companionship role for the Tesla Bot either as an assistant or even a friend.
Musk answered:
I think the possibilities are endless. It’s not quite in Tesla’s primary mission directive of accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, but it’s an extremely useful thing for the world to make a humanoid robot that is capable of interacting with the world and helping in many different ways.
The CEO reiterated that Tesla will focus on making the robot do “repetitive and boring work,” especially tasks that can lead to repetitive stress injury, but he did say that it could make “a very good companion”:
It could develop a personality over time that is unique. It’s not like all the robots are the same. That personality could evolve to match the owner, or whatever you want to call it.
Fridman, a scientist who specializes in human-robot interaction, suggested that there’s a “huge opportunity” to reduce loneliness with such an application of the Tesla Bot.
Here’s the full interview:
During the interview, Musk didn’t want to offer a clear timeline on when Tesla could make the robot available, but he did say that he expects Tesla to have “a decent prototype toward the end of next year.”

2021/12/28,"Tesla has introduced the new AMD Ryzen chip and 12v Li-ion battery in 2022 Model 3 Model Y vehicles.
Earlier this month, we reported on a bunch of new features and changes coming to the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y that leaked through a test program in Europe.
Amongst many things, the leak revealed that new Model 3 and Model Y vehicles coming to Europe, which are made in China, would come with the new AMD Ryzen chip that is powering the media computer in the new Model S and Model X and the Model Y Performance made in China. Also, the lead-acid 12v battery will change to a Li-ion battery system.
As we noted at the time, changes made to Tesla vehicles made in China often end up coming to Tesla vehicles made in the US soon after. Now we learn that Tesla has started production of the Model 3 and Model Y with those changes in the US:
The first Model 3 and Y vehicles with MCU3 (Infotainment Computer with AMD Ryzen) are now being produced and delivered in North America! pic.twitter.com/BHbpyKr78D
It’s the same for the Li-ion battery system to replace the old 12v system:
New Model 3 and Y vehicles also include the new 12v battery. pic.twitter.com/oXw4w6S7YR
While under the hood, so to speak, these two changes are quite significant to the performance and experience of Tesla vehicles.
As we previously reported, an independent test of the center display in a new Model Y Performance in China with the new AMD Ryzen chip for the MCU showed an impressive performance update. Considering a lot of the Tesla experience is built around the center display, the change should make a big difference.
As for the new 12-volt battery, Tesla vehicles have been known to often suffer from 12-volt battery failures. Furthermore, it has been strange for Tesla, a company seen as a leader in battery technology, to still use an old battery chemistry to power its 12v vehicle system. Unlike the new chip, if the change is good, Tesla owners shouldn’t even notice it since the battery should just not fail as often as the previous version did.

2021/12/28,"An interesting new Tesla Model Y body that appears to be designed for the new structural battery pack has been spotted at Gigafactory Texas ahead of the start of production.
Tesla has been aiming to start Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas in Austin by the end of the year, which is just a few days away.
The start of Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas is not only critical to the company’s growth, but it also marks the launch of a new version of the electric SUV featuring Tesla’s new structural battery pack and 4680 battery cells.
The idea is to produce large cylindrical cells and package them into a single module battery pack that also acts as the structural platform on which you install the vehicle’s body.
CEO Elon Musk has touted the technology as a “manufacturing revolution” in the auto industry.
For those two reasons, there are a lot of eyes on Tesla starting Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas.
We previously reported on Tesla ramping up its mega casting effort at the factory to produce Model Y bodies.
Now, in a new drone flyover of the plant, Joe Tegtmeyer spotted a new Model Y body on a truck:
As Tegtmeyer noted, the body has no floor, which would indicate that it has been built for the structural battery pack.
Tesla previously disclosed that it will use the battery pack to install things that generally go onto the body’s floor, like the seat mounts.
Tesla plans to take a platform like this and marry it to the body that was recently spotted at Gigafactory Texas.
These pieces of the puzzle that is Model Y production are starting to appear, but it’s still not clear if Tesla can actually start production within the next few days to stick to its goal.
However, as we previously stated, the start of Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas is not as critical as how quickly Tesla can ramp up to volume production.
The company is expected to achieve volume production during the second half of 2022.

2021/12/28,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is up in premarket trading today on a new note from top Wall Street analyst Dan Ives who believes Tesla is going to double its production capacity in 2022.
With delivery times of up to a year for some of its models, Tesla is currently sitting on what Ives called a “high-class problem of demand outstripping supply.”
The question is how fast can the automaker ramp up production to address that demand.
Tesla is currently making electric cars at a rate of roughly 1 million per year.
Ives believes that Tesla is going to double that next year and exit 2022 with a production rate of 2 million cars.
The analyst wrote in a new note to clients today:
We believe by the end of 2022 Tesla will have the capacity for overall ~2 million units annually from roughly 1 million today…
Most of that growth is going to come from two new factories coming online any day: Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas.
Tesla’s growth in 2022 is going to be dependent on how smooth the production ramps are going to be at those two factories.
Those production ramps are also going to free up production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai and enable Tesla to grow deliveries in China.
Ives noted the importance of the Chinese market for Tesla in 2022:
While logistical hurdles will be a near-term cost burden, we importantly believe Tesla has the potential to further expand its auto [gross margin] and profitability profile over the next 12 to 18 months especially with more higher-margin cars being sold and produced in China…
The firm reiterated a $1,400 price target on Tesla’s stock with a bull case of $1,800 per share.
Tesla’s stock was up 1% on the new note with the stock trading $1,105 per share in premarket.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is ranked #22 out of 7,756 analysts on TipRanks with an average success rate of 76% and an average return of 36%.

2021/12/24,"Tesla has released a rare new blog post, something that doesn’t happen often since the company dissolved its PR department. In the post, Tesla releases more details about its v11 holiday software update, including something for non-Tesla owners.
Earlier this week, we reported on Tesla starting to push its new “holiday update”, which is a bigger-than-usual software update that usually comes with a bundle of features that are more fun than practical. That said, we are still learning more details about the update as it is being rolled out to the fleet.
For example, we learned of a new “megaphone” feature this morning. Now, Tesla has released a blog post about the software update, which also becomes Tesla’s v11 software. V11 was already released as the user interface of the new Model S and Model X vehicles, but now it is making its way to Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
Tesla released a new breakdown of which vehicles are getting which features:
The Light Show is going to all vehicles – here’s what it looks like out of the box:
A post shared by Tesla (@teslamotors)
But the feature is actually also available to non-Tesla vehicle owners as Tesla published the open-source software called xLights that it used to create the feature. 
Anyone can use the feature to create a light show and upload it to their car.
For Tesla vehicle with matrix headlights, it can actually project graphics:
The blog also reveal some new features that we didn’t see in the previous release notes, like an updated audio experience:
For an even better audio experience, there are now five levels of Immersive Audio, including an Auto setting that adapts to the content you’re playing, and you can adjust subwoofer output independently to get just the right amount of punch from the bass.
Here’s the full blog post:
Software Version 11.0 is here as part of our biggest holiday release yet. Introducing some of our most creative features, from a new Light Show function that lets you (or anyone with a computer) choreograph light shows to your own music, to new games and entertainment experiences, safety features, customizable controls, and an all-new user-interface design.
This week, Tesla owners around the world will be able to do more with their cars, and have even more fun, all with a free, over-the-air software update.

2021/12/24,"Tesla has released a new software update that lets drivers use their Tesla vehicles as actual megaphones to communicate with their surroundings – so don’t be shocked if people start talking to you through their Tesla on the road.
Earlier this week, we reported on Tesla starting to push its new “holiday update,” which is a bigger-than-usual software update that usually comes with a bundle of features that are more fun than practical.
There’s one feature that we missed in our report because it’s only coming to more recent Tesla vehicles (2019 and newer) because the vehicle needs to be equipped with an external speaker, which is meant to be used to play the pedestrian warning sound at low speeds.
In last year’s holiday update, Tesla released a “Boombox” feature that let owners play pre-recorded sounds through the speaker.
Now with this year’s update, the automaker is updating the “Boombox” feature to add a “megaphone” option that lets drivers literally use the feature as if it’s a megaphone.
Here’s a quick demonstration of Tesla’s new “Megaphone” feature in the 2021 holiday update:
NEW Tesla Megaphone feature. This is crazy! These cars haha… pic.twitter.com/OB8oI3wwhH
It also apparently adds some voice effects to whatever you are saying that is being played to your surroundings through the speaker.
The feature builds on Tesla also releasing remote live view via Sentry Mode that lets you broadcast your voice to the car using the Tesla mobile app.
I am sure Tesla owners will find uses for that feature, and it won’t be annoying at all.
In all seriousness, it’s pretty amazing how Tesla managed to take a mandated feature that was forced on them by regulators and something that many Tesla owners were upset about, and then turned it into a feature that people are actually excited to try.
I’ve now seen some pre-2019 Tesla owners who were happy to not get the pedestrian warning sound in their cars, and who are now jealous of the feature.

2021/12/23,"Tesla confirmed that it will shut down “passenger play,” which allows for playing video games on the center screen of its vehicles while driving. The change comes after NHTSA announced that it is opening an official probe into the situation.
Tesla has recently been putting more work toward video games inside its vehicles with the goal to “optimize fun” with its ownership experience.
Last year, we reported on Tesla building a new video game and user interface team in Austin, Texas. The goal is to build the platform, Tesla Arcade, and onboard as many video games as possible. Video games are primarily supposed to be used while parked and charging, but Tesla allows playing them while driving after a warning that the feature — called “passenger play” –should only be used by passengers.
Earlier this month, we reported on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirming that it is talking with Tesla about the “passenger play” situation. Yesterday, NTHSA confirmed that it had opened an official probe into the situation and planned to study how the feature is being used.
The probe put enough pressure on Tesla that the company decided to walk back the feature.
NHTSA confirmed Tesla’s decision today (via Associated Press):
“The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the company will send out a software update over the Internet so the function called “Passenger Play” will be locked and won’t work while vehicles are in motion.”
The update is reportedly already being pushed as part of Tesla’s holiday update.
NHTSA says that it will continue its probe despite Tesla making the change and will study how Tesla owners use the center display and its entertainment features.

2021/12/23,"A Tesla Model S owner in Finland decided to blow up his electric car with dynamite after it needed a battery replacement, which Tesla said was going to cost $22,000.
There’s not a lot of information about how much an electric car, or especially Tesla vehicle, battery replacement costs.
It’s a hard question to answer since the vast majority of Tesla battery replacements have been done under warranty. 
Early on, Tesla offered eight-year unlimited mileage powertrain warranties for Model S and Model X.
With Model S production starting in 2012 and higher volumes not coming until 2014, only recently have those vehicles started to come off their powertrain warranty. We have seen quotes from Tesla for battery pack replacements between $20,000 and $30,000. That’s a lot of money, but the good news is that Tesla’s battery packs have been known to last a long time.
I have a Tesla Model X that had a battery pack last for more than 300,000 miles.
However, even if the problem is not necessarily battery degradation, the battery packs simply fail sometimes, and it’s expensive to replace those early packs.
We recently reported on a case where a Model S owner was told by Tesla that he needed a $22,500 battery replacement.
That wasn’t really an option since it’s basically equivalent to the value of the vehicle.
Fortunately, the owner managed to find a third-party repair shop the fix the battery pack for a fraction of the cost – though the fix is somewhat controversial in the Tesla repair community.
Yeah I mean that's another point and I added Jason's insights, which I respect, in the article. But Rich's team disagree and they claim that made a similar module swap 2 years ago that is still working fine.
Now we learn of a similar case in Finland where Tuomas Katainen, a 2013 Tesla Model S owner, had a battery pack that was out of warranty fail, and Tesla asked for the equivalent of $22,000 USD for a battery pack replacement.
Katainen didn’t like the value proposition considering used 2013 Model S vehicles go for about 35,000 euros in Finland and he didn’t have access to a third-party shop to fix the pack.
What options does one have at that point? Quite a few actually: You can try to find a used battery pack, you can sell the car as non-functional and still get decent money for it, or you can sell it for parts.
But Katainen decided to go a different way. 
He reached out to YouTuber Pommijätkät, a channel known for blowing things up, to strap 30 kg of dynamite to the electric vehicle and blow it up:
That sounds like a reasonable solution to an expensive battery replacement.
To be fair, they did remove the non-functioning battery pack and other expensive parts, like the electric motor, before blowing up the car.
Obviously, I don’t support this as a solution, but I definitely feel for early Model S owners in his situation.
One thing to keep in mind for EV naysayers that like to use this as “proof” that EVs don’t work, the high battery replacement cost is mainly for early vehicles that were produced in lower volumes.
It’s more expensive to have battery replacements for those vehicles.
Battery pack replacements for higher-volume vehicles like Model 3 and Model Y are expected to be much less expensive when they will be needed off warranty, and also battery technology is improving, which makes them last longer.

2021/12/23,"Tesla has applied to install Supercharger stations in Texas with CCS connectors, which would be a first in the US.
The move comes as Tesla is planning to open its Supercharger network to other automakers.
The Texas Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Program (TxVEMP) is a program that uses the settlement from the Dieselgate scandal to fund projects to help the air quality in Texas, including funding electric vehicle charging stations.
Over the last month, the program has been accepting applications for grants on new charging stations.
According to a new filing, Tesla has applied for grants ranging from $375,000 to $500,000 on four different new Supercharging stations (via Mockingbird on Reddit):
[scribd id=549041655 key=key-yszN8o4w1wOlKYAEWd0T mode=scroll]
Now the interesting thing is that there’s a requirement for at least one CHAdeMO and CCS connector to be installed for a station receiving a grant:
This would be significant for Tesla since the automaker has so far only been using its own proprietary connector at Supercharger stations in North America.
The move comes as Tesla starts to open its Supercharger network to other automakers for the first time – starting in Europe.
Technically, Tesla could fulfill the requirement by adding a third-party CCS station, but in the context of Tesla moving to open its Supercharger network to EVs from other manufacturers, it’s more likely that it’s going to be a different integration.
We can forget about CHAdeMO since the standard is basically dead.
It’s more likely that Tesla integrates CCS connectors.
Now the question is how? It could be through an adapter available at the stations, dual connector cables, or having some stalls being CCS Supercharger stalls.
Previously, Tesla has hinted that CCS adoption at Superchargers in the US would come through adding an adapter at the stations.

2021/12/23,"Tesla (TSLA) has secured new “Active Anode Material” from graphite for battery production in a rare new offtake agreement deal with Syrah Resources Limited.
Australia’s Syrah Resources Limited operates a graphite mine in Balama, Mozambique.
The mine supplies an upcoming natural graphite Active Anode Material (AAM) production facility based in Vidalia, Louisiana.
Syrah is currently ramping up the facility to produce 10kt of AAM per year.
Today, the company announced that Tesla has secured most of that production through a new offtake agreement:
Tesla will offtake the majority of the proposed initial expansion of AAM production capacity at Vidalia at a fixed price for an initial term of four years commencing from the achievement of a commercial production rate, subject to final qualification. Tesla also has an option to offtake additional volume from Vidalia subject to Syrah expanding its capacity beyond 10kt per annum AAM.
Tesla rarely does offtake agreements with junior mining companies, but in this case, the project appears to already be quite advanced.
As we previously reported, Tesla has recently asked the US government to waive tariffs on graphite from China – claiming that it can’t get the mineral elsewhere. 
The request covered both artificial and natural graphite.
Furthermore, Tesla has indicated that it is working on new chemistry that it obtained through a startup acquisition that utilizes a new silicon in the anode to replace the graphite.
The automaker said that it plans to use this silicon in some versions of its 4680 battery cells that will be produced in-house.
The company is currently ramping up production at its large-scale (10 GWh) pilot plant in Fremont and hopes to deploy 4680 battery cell production capacity in even larger volumes (100 GWh) at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas next year.
But the automaker also said that it plans to use a variety of chemistries and cell supply in order to satisfy its rapidly growing need for battery cells as it ramps up battery-electric vehicle production.

2021/12/22,"Tesla’s stock (TSLA) has surged 7% today to rise back to over $1 trillion in market valuation. The reason behind the surge appeared to be Elon Musk saying that he is done selling the stock, but the CEO actually corrected his statement.
Ever since Musk announced that he will sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, the company’s stock has been suffering. Earlier this week, it lost the incredible gains it made following the announcement that Hertz would be buying 100,000 Model 3 vehicles, which pushed Tesla’s stock to over $1 trillion for the first time.
But, it has had a reversal yesterday and today. Tesla’s stock surged by 7%, which is wild for a company that valuable. The stock has now settled past $1,000 a share, which gives it back a market capitalization of over $1 trillion:
Today’s surge happened on a slow news day, and the main new information that contributed to the price increase appears to be Musk saying that he believes he sold enough shares to satisfy his statement that he would sell 10% of his Tesla stocks.
As we previously reported today, it does seem that he didn’t quite sell 10% of his stake based on the number of stocks he owned in Tesla when he made the announcement. But Musk did sell over 13 million Tesla shares over the last month, which put direct pressure on the stock on top of the bad signal of the CEO selling shares, even if it was mainly to pay taxes. 
Now Musk said on Twitter this afternoon that he still has a few tranches of stock options to exercise:
“When the 10b preprogrammed sales complete. There are still a few tranches left, but almost done.”
In Tesla’s last filing, the company disclosed that Musk still has 2,637,455 stock options to exercise as part of the plan set in September. However, it sounds like Musk won’t be selling any additional shares other than what was part of his compensation plan.
Tesla’s stock is now recovering with its valuation back to over $1 trillion amid a lot of talk about automaker and EV startup valuations. Rivian also went public recently, and it currently holds a valuation of $85 billion – making it one of the most valuable automakers in the world despite only having delivered a few vehicles.

2021/12/22,"The NHTSA confirmed that it has now launched an official probe into Tesla drivers playing video games on its vehicles’ onboard computers.
Other than common sense and/or fear of getting caught, there’s nothing stopping anyone from using their phones, including playing video games on them, while driving.
You can get hefty fines for getting caught using your phone while driving. There have been some efforts from smartphone companies to detect driving and warn users not to use their phones while driving, but that’s basically the extent of the effort to prevent the dangerous practice.
As for Tesla, the same problem exists with phones, but the automaker is also introducing a new factor: its in-car video games.
Tesla has recently been putting more work toward video games inside its vehicles with the goal to “optimize fun” with its ownership experience.
Last year, we reported on Tesla building a new video game and user interface team in Austin, Texas. The goal is to build the platform, Tesla Arcade, and onboard as many video games as possible.
It is primarily supposed to be used while parked and charging, but Tesla allows playing video games while driving after a warning that it should only be used by passengers.
Earlier this month, we reported on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirming that it is talking with Tesla about the issue.
Now Reuters reports that the NHTSA has launched an official probe into the issue:
“The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said its preliminary evaluation covers various 2017-2022 model year Tesla Model 3, S, X, and Y vehicles. This functionality, referred to as “Passenger Play,” “may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash,” the agency said.”
It covers 580,000 vehicles or basically all Tesla vehicles in the US with the capability for “passenger play.”
The agency will try to evaluate how the feature is being used in order to see if there’s any safety risk that can be mitigated.

2021/12/22,"Tesla and others have now submitted all documents needed for the environmental approval that would allow Gigafactory Berlin to start production.
Over the last year, Tesla has run into a lot of red tape while trying to get approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin, a giant new factory located near Berlin in Brandenburg. Most recently, environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project, which delayed approval for another month. The new period concluded last month, and Tesla has been rumored to be on the verge of approval, but it has yet to happen.
Earlier this week, we reported that the Ministry for the Environment said that Tesla and other entities have yet to deliver all the needed documents for approval.
Now the government has confirmed that the documents have all been submitted (via Reuters):
Tesla and relevant authorities submitted all the documents necessary for the approval process for its planned battery factory near Berlin, the environment ministry of the German state of Brandenburg said on Wednesday.
This is believed to be among the last steps to deliver the final approval.
Tesla has been aiming to start Model Y production at the plant by the end of the year, but time is starting to run out.
Brandenburg Premier Dietmar Woidke has recently said that a decision for approval might instead come in early 2022.
The start of production at the plant is critical for Tesla’s expansion in Europe and its global operations since Gigafactory Berlin production is going to free up production capacity at other factories to focus on local deliveries.
But even more important than the start of production is the ramp-up to volume production.
While it is waiting to clear the red tape, Tesla has been spotted already producing pre-production vehicles at the plant.

2021/12/22,"Elon Musk says he sold enough Tesla (TSLA) shares to “get around to 10%” – which was the amount he said he would sell as part of his controversial Twitter poll.
The CEO is actually far from 10%, but the whole situation is murky.
Last month, Musk said he would sell 10% of his stake in Tesla if a Twitter poll would agree, which it unsurprisingly did.
The CEO framed the idea as pressure from the media and politicians about the rich not paying taxes on unrealized gains.
However, Musk wasn’t as vocal about the fact that he was facing a giant tax bill regardless of his sale of shares, due to a large number of stock options he needs to exercise over the next year.
10% of his stake at the time of the poll would be roughly 17 million shares.
Yesterday, Tesla disclosed that Musk exercised 2 million more options worth almost $1.9 billion and sold 584,000 of those shares.
In a new interview with Conservative satire site The Babylon Bee released the same day, Musk claimed that he “sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff”:
I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff, and I tried to be extremely literal here…
Musk has in fact sold 13.5 million Tesla shares since making the Twitter poll announcement about selling 10% of his stake in Tesla.
On top of it, he exercised 16.4 million Tesla stock options during the same time as part of his previous compensation package.
Therefore, Musk’s holding in Tesla has increased in the total number of shares since making the announcement.
It’s not clear if he means to say that he is now done with exercising options and selling Tesla stocks at this point, but it does sound like it.
What is clear is that the way Musk framed the stock sale had absolutely nothing to do with the Twitter poll or pressure for him to pay taxes as the world’s richest man.
Tesla disclosed that most of Musk’s stock sales were related to exercising his expiring stock options based on a plan established back in September – way before the Twitter poll.
Yes, the CEO did sell additional shares that didn’t have to do with this plan and exercising stock options, but nowhere near 10% of his stake in Tesla. 
Either way, Musk will indeed pay a historic tax bill this year. It just wasn’t about a Twitter poll, like he made it seem.

2021/12/21,"The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the main independent organization that conducts crash tests on vehicles in the US, released the result of its latest tests on the Tesla Model Y and confirmed that it achieved the highest possible safety rating.
While Tesla is known for being a technology-forward automaker and emphasizing the “fun” aspect of its vehicles with video games and other entertainment, safety is actually its top priority, and Tesla has been really successful at it. Both the Model S and the Model X both achieved 5-star safety ratings with some of the lowest probability of severe injury ever seen.
As for the Model 3, the electric sedan has won several safety plaudits, including 5-star ratings in all categories and the lowest probability of injury ever tested from NHTSA, 5 stars from Euro NCAP, while being hailed as setting a “new safety technology benchmark,” and 5 stars from the Australiasian NCAP.
With the Model Y being Tesla’s most recent vehicle, it has been subject to all the same testing yet, but it is also getting some impressive results from the first few agencies that crash-tested the electric SUV.
Earlier this year, Model Y aced the NHTSA crash test.
Now the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) released its safety rating for the latest version of the Tesla Model, Y and it achieved the highest possible rating:
The 2021-22 Tesla Model Y, a midsize luxury SUV, qualifies for a TOP SAFETY PICK+ award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
It released several crash test videos of the Model Y:
The Model Y has achieved a “good” rating, the highest one, in every single category except for the headlights where it received an “acceptable” rating:
Therefore, the Model Y continues Tesla’s streak of success when it comes to safety ratings.

2021/12/21,"Tesla has secured another order of Tesla Semi trucks, its upcoming electric class 8 semi trucks.
Karat Packaging announced in a press release that it ordered 10 Tesla Semi trucks.
The Tesla Semi has been delayed several times, but it now appears to be close to production, and the automaker is still accumulating orders.
Tesla first started taking reservations with a $5,000 deposit per truck, but it later changed the listed deposit price to $20,000 for a “base reservation” of the production version and the full $200,000 for the “Founders Series” truck.
It helps confirm a stronger commitment to later change the reservation into an order.
Now Karat Packaging announced that it has placed a reservation on 10 Tesla Semi trucks to electrify its fleet:
“Karat Packaging Inc. (NASDAQ: KRT), a specialty distributor and manufacturer of environmentally friendly, disposable foodservice products and related items, today announced it plans to expand its logistic services business geographically and that it has placed an order for 10 Tesla Semi trucks.”
Alan Yu, chairman and chief executive officer of Karat, commented on the announcement:
“We are excited to incorporate alternative-fuel trucks into our fleet. This purchase represents our commitment to continue investing in environmentally friendly solutions. Adding to Karat Packaging’s competitive advantage and the Company’s distinguishing characteristics, we are pleased to offer additional 3PL services to new and existing customers, particularly during the current supply chain environment.”
Now the question for Karat is when should it expect to receive those Tesla Semi trucks.
While Tesla has been making progress toward bringing its electric semi truck to low-volume production in Nevada, the automaker recently confirmed that customer deliveries of the Tesla Semi are pushed to next year.
But surprisingly, Ramon Laguarta, CEO of PepsiCo, one of the biggest Tesla Semi reservation holders, recently said that it expected delivery of its first 15 Tesla Semi trucks to start by the end of the year.
Laguarta’s comment coincided with a new Tesla Semi prototype being spotted and PepsiCo executives visiting Tesla at its Nevada production facility.
But time is starting to run out for Tesla Semi deliveries to start this year.

2021/12/21,"Chinese battery cell manufacturer Gotion High-Tech confirmed that it entered into a very important deal to supply LFP battery cells to an unnamed “large US automaker” and partner with that automaker to deploy US production of LFP battery cells.
Tesla is rumored to be that unnamed automaker.
Currently, there is no US production of iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells and it’s a problem for Tesla, which recently announced it’s transitioning all its “standard range vehicles” to the battery chemistry globally.
China’s Gotion, which counts on German automaker VW amongst its shareholders, announced the framework of an important agreement via a filing on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
The company announced that it agreed to supply at least 200 GWh of LFP battery cells to a large US automaker between 2023 and 2028.
The cells would come from Gotion’s Chinese operations at first, but the agreement also includes a component to bring LFP battery cell production to the US.
Gotion wrote in the filing (translated from Chinese):
“Expansion and localization of production lines. U.S. Guoxuan agreed to allocate the company’s existing or new domestic to build production capacity and build new production capacity in the United States to meet the customer’s battery procurement needs.”
The deal also includes an option for a joint-venture LFP battery factory in the US with the automaker (translated from Chinese):
“Joint venture to build a factory: The two parties will conduct friendly consultations on the establishment of joint ventures or other cooperative efforts. Jointly explore the possibility of establishing a joint venture company. In addition to the joint venture to build battery production bases, the scope of joint ventures. The scope may cover investments in upstream materials and downstream battery recycling industries.”
Now, who is this US automaker that Gotion is partnering with?
The company remains vague about the partner, but here’s the relevant section describing the automaker and the deal in the filing (translated from Chinese):
“Guoxuan Hi-Tech Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) overseas wholly-owned grandson company GOTION, INC.(Hereinafter referred to as “U.S. Guoxuan”) is the supplier of a large listed automobile company in the United States (hereinafter referred to as “the customer”) Respond to business. In order to further deepen the cooperation, the United States Guoxuan and the customer recently signed the “Strategic Supply and Localization Agreement” (ie “Strategic Supply and Localization Agreement”, hereinafter referred to as “this agreement”), The two parties hope to reach a strategic agreement on the supply and procurement of lithium iron phosphate batteries (hereinafter referred to as “LFP batteries”).do. On the one hand, based on the customer’s needs, the company will export LFP through its battery production base in mainland ChinaBatteries; on the other hand, the two parties plan to localize the production and supply of LFP batteries in the United States and jointly discuss future the possibility of establishing a joint venture company. The above-mentioned LFP battery products will be used in the customer’s US and global markets electric cars and other applications.”
Technically, it could be any US automaker, but Tesla certainly fits the bill.
The fact that they mentioned a “large listed automobile company in the US” and there’s no larger listed automaker in the US than Tesla.
As a minority shareholder in Gotion, VW would make sense, but it is obviously a German automaker, and the filing mentions that there was no prior relationship with the automaker involved.
The agreement also mentions using the cells in electric cars and “other applications,” which could mean stationary energy storage products, like Tesla Powerwalls, Powerpacks, and Megapacks.
But the biggest tell of all might be the actual volume involved in the deal.
200 GWh of LFP cells between 2023 and 2028 is a lot. 
Considering LFP cells are used for smaller and shorter-range vehicles, the deal could support the production of over half a million electric cars per year.
When you consider that Tesla has been open about its shift to LFP cells and that it’s likely the only automaker that would need that many LFP cells in the US starting in just over a year, it’s likely that Tesla could be behind the deal. However, it’s still only speculation at this point.
