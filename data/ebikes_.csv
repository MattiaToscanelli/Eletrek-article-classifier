2023/03/15,"After a costly and time-consuming legal battle to secure the trademarks for its most powerful HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler 2 e-bikes, Juiced Bikes has decided to discontinue the current model lines. As part of that closeout, the company has put its existing inventory on closeout sale.Juiced Bikes is one of the oldest and most established electric bicycle brands in the US.I remember scrolling through their site in college back in 2011, and by then the company had already been in operation for a few years. So if like me, you remember the OG Juiced even back before the company’s name change, then you’ll know that Juiced has never just followed trends; it sets them.That was the case with Juiced Scorpion e-bike launched in The Before Times back in 2019, and it was the case with the high-power, 28+ mph HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler 2 e-bikes that followed.But after a protracted legal battle to secure the trademark for those e-bikes, Juiced has decided to close out those lines. In doing so it has dropped prices on its remaining bikes.As the company explained further:Juiced Bikes has been working diligently for several years to secure legal protection for the HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler brand names. Those efforts have been costly, time-consuming and still haven’t provided the level of trademark protection we have achieved with the other models in our portfolio. As a result, we are now phasing out both the HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler models. This decision is in no way reflective of the quality or performance of these e-bikes. On the contrary, we believe so much in the performance and value of these products that we refuse to burden them with any additional legal and/or licensing fees.The good news is that while the HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler may be ending, the bikes themselves will be reborn.Juiced has promised to bring the models back under new badging.“Both the HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler 2 will be renamed and relaunched before the end of 2023. In the meantime, we hope our current and future customers can take advantage of current close-out pricing and enjoy the incredible power, performance and safety features of these two exceptional e-bikes.”Those new prices, which can be found on Juiced’s closeout deals page, are as follows:Close-Out pricing:These are fast and high-power electric bikes that have a build quality closer in line with mopeds and light electric motorcycles.We’ve tested these models ourselves, which you can see in the video below, and have fallen in love with the power and performance that Juiced has been able to stuff into an electric bike-size package.And who knows, perhaps with the closeout of these models and the upcoming name change, the remaining models will become collector’s items. If there was any doubt about that case for the limited-edition Founder’s Series HyperScrambler 2, then this closeout should settle that.",ebikes
2023/03/14,"Not familiar with HOVSCO? Eh, it’s not really your fault. Even if you spend all day wrist-deep in the e-bike industry like me, there’s a thousand and one e-bike companies out there. I’ve only followed HOVSCO for a few months now through some rather run-of-the-mill e-bike launches, but the company’s latest two models have actually gotten me interested. Meet the new HOVSCO HovWagon and HovScout.If the HovWagon sounds like the RadWagon from Rad Power Bikes, that’s probably not an accident. Rad has been copied up and down the e-bike block for years, from its designs to its product names.But the HovWagon, despite borrowing the same naming and coloring scheme, brings some interesting bits and pieces to the table.It’s a smaller format cargo bike, bordering on utility bike territory, and uses 20″ fat tires to keep the ride fairly low on a compact cargo bike. The wheels are small enough in diameter to prevent the bike’s center of gravity from climbing higher, yet still offers a nicer ride on big fat air-cushion tires. For anyone who takes occasional detours off-road, it will likely make a big difference.The 750W Class 2 e-bike ships with a 20 mph (32 km/h) speed limit on throttle and pedal assist, but can be unlocked via the company’s app to reach 28 mph (45 km/h).Those that plan to make use of that pedal assist will be happy to hear that the bike includes a torque sensor to offer a higher quality pedaling experience. As the company explained:The torque sensor pedal assist systems measure the amount of power you are putting into the pedals and it will increase or decrease the electric assist based on your pedaling power. The torque sensor systems have a very intuitive ride feel because they emulate your pedal power very well.The frame-integrated yet still removable 720 Wh LG battery is said to offer up to 60 miles (96 km) of range on pedal assist, though I’d estimate that riders will get around half of that range if they’re heavy on the throttle and don’t pedal very much. Even so, that’s a nice big battery and some decent range, to boot.The real star of the show for any cargo bike though is its cargo capacity. With a long rear rack that be converted into a bench seat, the HovWagon claims a maximum capacity of 450 lb (205 kg). That’s one of the highest weight ratings we’ve ever seen in the e-bike industry. There’s almost no way to verify that claim, and since Tern’s heavy hauling e-bikes are rated for similar or slightly less weight yet routinely break the test equipment used to certify them, there might be a bit of a guesstimate going into those HOVSCO weight capacity numbers.But with hydraulic disc brakes, a 7-speed Shimano transmission, a 2-year warranty and a whole host of cargo-related accessories that bolt onto the front and rear of the HovWagon, this still seems like a more than capable e-bike for most families, and the $1,999 price tag feels fair compared to several other similarly-spec’d cargo e-bikes on the market. If you find the bike on Amazon, though, there seems to be a $100 coupon that makes the price even more attractive.For those that want to step things up a notch with their adventure level, the HovScout is a bit more appropriate.This full-suspension e-bike features larger diameter fat tires that are better for dedicated off-road riding, as opposed to the smaller dual-purpose fat tires on the HovWagon.The HovScout is thus a more purpose-built trail bike for adventurous riding. Despite the different geometry and design, the tech specs are actually quite similar between the two. The HovScout shares the HovWagon’s 750W power rating and 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed out of the box, but can also be unlocked for Class 3 28 mph (45 km/h) riding.Other parts that appear to be shared by the two models are the 720Wh battery, torque-sensor pedal assist, hydraulic disc brakes, Shimano 7-speed transmission, and massive weight rating.You’ll have to fork over an extra five hundred bucks, though, as the HovScout is priced at $2,499. Color me interested. Of course it’s hard for any cargo e-bike to compete with the Lectric XPedition these days, but HovWagon looks like it has a place to stand on its own. The $1,399 XPedition can save you some cash, but it’s got a smaller battery and no torque sensor, plus the integrated battery on the HovScout looks better than the ol’ behind-the-seat-tube battery on the XPedition.For the HovScout, again it’s the torque sensor that has me really interested. A full-suspension fat tire e-bike isn’t cheap, but a torque sensor generally adds significantly to the price by putting it in a higher quality e-bike class. $2,499 isn’t nothing, but it’s not bad for a full-suspension e-bike with this loadout.",ebikes
2023/03/13,"The electric bicycle company Engwe has just launched its latest e-bike design known as the Engwe M20. While borrowing significantly from other e-bikes in the industry, the M20 goes its own way in one key area: the price tag.That’s because this dual-suspension electric moped starts at just $1,299, though an extra $150 early bird discount is available on the launch page.You may even be surprised by just how much you get on this e-bike, despite its rather low price tag.The dual suspension setup is already a nice feature to see at this price point, especially for folks that plan to make full use of the fast 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed of the Engwe M20.But there’s also an option for dual batteries, which adds a second 48V 13Ah battery to the top tube in place of the included storage bag. That doubles the capacity to 1.25 kWh of battery and doubles the range to 94 miles (151 km) on pedal assist. The dual battery version is priced at $1,599, though that $150 early bird coupon on the page still applies and can bring the price down to a more than reasonable $1,449.And while the company is doubling up on features, they seemed to have given the twin treatment to the front headlight as well. There’s a second identical headlight mounted directly above the first. I’m not sure why that would ever be necessary or even desirable, but I guess having a spare is a good thing?Back down in the drivetrain, the Engwe M20 lays down its power from a 1,000W rear hub motor mounted in a cast rim wheel. The lack of spokes removes a common maintenance concern on high-power hub motor e-bikes.The inclusion of mechanical disc brakes seems to be a cost-saving measure, as many companies prefer the higher stopping power of hydraulic disc brakes for a fast and fairly heavy 76 lb. (35 kg) e-bike like this. The brake rotors are also a bit small at 160 mm, so perhaps keep that in mind if you attempt any super-long downhill canyon carving trips.The bike rolls on 20″x4″ fat tires that appear to have an off-road tread, making this something of a dual sport electric moped. Both a throttle and pedal assist can be used to activate the motor, though most of these moto-inspired e-bikes tend to see their pedals used more like static foot rests.The bike is rated for riders up to 265 lb. (120 kg) and comes in three color options of black, white, and green.Shipping appears to be already underway, which is a nice change from the many pre-order e-bikes we’ve seen launched lately.I haven’t tested the Engwe M20 yet, though it’s on my list. But with my past experience with the Engwe Engine Pro folding e-bike and the Engwe P26 e-bike, I can say that the company is pretty decent as far as value goes.They can’t compete with the larger US companies on either production quality or support, but the bikes seem to have excellent bang-for-your-buck and are put together fairly well. They’re aren’t amazing, but they’re pretty good for the price.I look forward to getting on the M20 soon to see how it compares to the usual suspects in the e-moped space. While the dual headlight thing is a bit odd and the lack of hydraulic brakes is a bummer, the rest of the bike seems interesting. I’m sure the suspension won’t be high end, but if it’s good enough for recreational use then this might be a nice deal for those looking for a dual-suspension e-moped.",ebikes
2023/03/13,"Fox News is no stranger to the tactic of fearmongering as a way to stir up its base. But the media network’s latest misdirection campaign attempts to use fear to attack a surprising new target: electric bicycles.Electric bicycles are essentially normal bicycles but with the addition of a small electric helper motor and a lithium-ion battery for energy storage. They go faster than most pedal bikes while requiring less effort from the rider, which has made them a popular alternative vehicle in cities and suburbs. They’ve found favor as cheaper car replacements for many people. As a type of small EV, or electric vehicle, it’s not exactly a wonder that Fox News would put e-bikes somewhere on its enemies list.But with a misleading story running last week entitled “How e-bikes are exploding and killing people,” the media giant leaves little room for doubt about just how far they’ll go with misdirection to try and scare people away from the fastest-growing form of low-cost, efficient, and effective transportation.It’s true: All the long-term trends show that electric bicycle sales are skyrocketing. They’re outselling electric cars in the US, and in some areas, e-bikes are soon set to outsell all cars – gasoline or electric. They’re helping replace the tired image of Americans driving their single-occupant SUVs a mile down the road for a gallon of milk.That makes them ripe for Fox News to hold up as some form of boogeyman to scare up their base, a group that is famously resistant to change. And e-bikes are exactly the kind of change that Fox News would vilify – a low-cost technology that helps Americans of all socioeconomic levels get around without a clutching dependence on Big Oil and Big Auto.The basis of Fox News’ attack on electric bicycles is cherry-picked fire data in New York City. You might have heard about electric bicycle fires in the news lately, as it is a topic that is getting increasing coverage despite the relatively few events. Even with minimal incidents compared to the number of e-bikes rolling around the city, examining any threat to public safety is certainly warranted. Between the dense urban population of NYC and the higher-than-average number of e-bikes used in the city, the issue has become a growing concern.What you might not know (since it is much less frequently reported) is that most of these electric bike fires aren’t related to electric bikes at all – they’re much cheaper electric scooters. Most of the pictures of these fire aftermaths show charred husks of cheap Chinese e-scooters. But regardless of the semantics, the underlying concern is this: Why do these batteries catch on fire, and how concerned should the public be?So what’s going on here? There are hundreds of thousands of high-quality e-bikes and e-scooters in the US with battery certifications and proper safety protocols. Even so, low-cost e-scooters (and yes, sometimes e-bikes too) have been increasingly imported to the US with low-quality lithium-ion batteries that, in very rare cases, have caught fire. It’s usually when people have used the wrong third-party chargers or have tried to do at-home repairs on the complicated battery systems.That distinction isn’t overly complicated. It’s not that it requires any significant amount of nuance to understand. But it also isn’t as flashy as a Fox News headline of “How e-bikes are exploding and killing people.”And it’s not that Fox News doesn’t realize the incredibly small size of the actual risk. A single line admission gets tossed near the very end of the article, presumably in a halfhearted attempt to claim some form of balance: “In the meantime, it’s important to note that the vast majority of e-bikes on the market are safe and reliable when used as intended and maintained properly.”By Fox News’ own admission, there had been a single fatality in NYC this year from this spate of e-bike or e-scooter fires at the time of publishing.But even while paying lip service to the small proportion of e-bike fires within the larger e-bike population, the story fails to properly frame the impact of the threat. For instance, did you know that cyclists in NYC are over 10 times more likely to be killed by a car than to be killed by an e-bike fire? In 2021, there was a single e-bike fire fatality compared to 19 cyclists killed by cars in NYC. That same year, there were over 200 pedestrians or micromobility (bike, scooters, mopeds, etc.) riders killed in NYC.I don’t mean to unjustly minimize the real risk of e-bike fires but rather to justifiably demonstrate how minimal the risk truly is. Just like how there was a spate of Samsung cell phones with lithium-ion batteries catching on fire a few years ago, the actual risk was significantly smaller than the reporting made it feel. Dozens of phones out of millions is a similar ratio to the e-bike and e-scooter scenario now. It is true that NYC has seen approximately one dozen deaths due to lithium-ion battery fires in micromobility vehicles in the last few years. And there have been legitimate, balanced reports from other news organizations about e-bike fires. In the same period, though, many hundreds of pedestrians have been killed by cars and trucks in the city. Thousands of pedestrians are killed by cars in the US each year. Often dozens per day. Dozens.But that doesn’t play into the Fox News narrative, and so it doesn’t get coverage. It also doesn’t get included for reference to understand the size of the e-bike fire risk. Cities need to do more to encourage people to ride bicycles. Safe protected bike lanes and trails are needed so adults and children can ride safely. Speak up for bicycles in your community.  Bicycles make life and cities better. Ask your local transportation planner and elected officials to support more protected bike lanes and trails. Children should be riding a bicycle to school and not be driven in a minivan.That’s because when you tell people the truth, that you’re between 10 to 30 times more likely to die by being hit by a car while walking around the city than from an e-bike battery fire, it doesn’t promote the right type of fear for Fox News. It shows that the true villain isn’t the e-bike but rather the car.The truth doesn’t scare people away from effective, low-cost alternative transportation. Instead, it shows the very fact that Fox News wants to hide: that e-bikes aren’t the problem – cars are. E-bikes, in fact, are the solution. Steps are being taken to reduce battery fires, but even if they weren’t, a drastic increase in e-bikes used to replace cars would still save lives by reducing fatalities. It’s simple math.If Fox News cared about saving lives or protecting people, it wouldn’t pander fear about NYC’s single-digit deaths per year from lithium-ion batteries in micromobility vehicles. It would highlight the city’s hundreds of deaths per year from cars killing pedestrians. But you won’t hear about that because the goal isn’t to save lives. It’s to use fear and misdirection in an attempt to resist a changing transportation paradigm that is slowly shedding our nation’s dependence on Big Oil and Big Auto.Fear keeps people hooked, and Fox News is well practiced at wielding it. When someone peddles that fear in an attempt to prop up a boogeyman, we should always ask ourselves why.",ebikes
2023/03/12,"Electric bicycles have been finding favor in a growing number of communities. From hunters to surfers and even soldiers, e-bikes and their low-cost, far-reaching transportation options have permeated a surprising number of different groups and use cases. The latest community adopting e-bikes en masse may be even more of a surprise: the Amish.Amish communities, more often known for their black buggies pulled by horses, have been increasingly turning to electric bikes as an alternative form of transportation.But how could that be?It’s a common misconception that Amish communities entirely shun electricity and technology. Rather, each Amish church and its surrounding community decides its own rules regarding how much technology is integrated into daily life. There is no single Amish doctrine or set of regulations, since these rules are decided at the individual community level.That means electric bicycles, which have become a much lower impact solution than cars, are booming in many Amish communities.David Mullet, a member of the Old Order Amish Church and the owner of E-bikes of Holmes County, a popular bicycle shop in a heavily Amish-populated area of Ohio, explained that e-bikes are simply faster and easier than horses:“It’s a lot quicker to jump on your bike and go into town than it is to bring your horse into the barn, harness it to the buggy, and go. It’s a lot quicker and you travel faster too.”Many Amish are permitted to ride in cars that they don’t own or operate themselves, which means it can be common to hire a driver for specific trips. But the practice can become expensive, as anyone who uses Uber on a regular basis will already know.E-bikes have thus become an effective solution to the problem of commuting longer distances without hiring a driver.As Mullet continued:“Commuting to work is probably the number one way that electric bikes are being used. Some people are commuting eight to ten miles, some only one or two miles, but they jump on their bike and go. With a traditional bike, that would never have been considered. They would have had to hire a driver or the place of work would have had to hire a driver to bring in their employees. That still happens, but there are more people who commute to work every day on e-bikes.”It is common for Amish areas to avoid dependence on the outside world, and thus the communities that do use electricity will often rely heavily on solar panels and other local forms of electricity generation.That aligns well with electric bicycles, which have small batteries that are easily charged by equally small solar panels.Mullet’s bike shop is entirely off-grid, with two dozen solar panels on the roof to power the store’s electricity. Public e-bike charging stations are also becoming more popular in Amish country, which are simple to create with a series of outdoor weather-protected 120VAC outlets. Powered by a solar panel array and battery bank, the outlets help riders charge up their e-bikes without relying on an electricity connection provided from outside of their own community.Not only are the Amish using e-bikes, they're building them. I recently visited relatives in an Amish community in northern Indiana, and they had an e-trike that had been made by local Amish craftsmen. They retrofitted a trike with a battery and motor as well as a basket large enough for most shopping trips. Ingenious. An Amish e-bike charging station recently shared on Reddit seems to be quite busy, and bike theft in the community is probably non-existent.Well, there you go, yet another example of e-bikes changing lives for the better.It’s great to see how many different types of folks have discovered the usefulness of electric bikes, and for such different reasons.The ability to go completely off-grid with their e-bikes is also a neat aspect of the Amish community’s adoption of e-bikes. It’s a great example of how these powerful transportation alternatives can make a difference in areas of the world without reliable electricity supply, such as in developing countries.",ebikes
2023/03/09,"The SUPER73 C1X has become a hotly anticipated light electric motorcycle design from Los Angeles-based electric bike company SUPER73. But eager riders may not have to wait that much longer.[Update March 9, 2023: Ok, they’ll actually have to wait a bit longer than we thought. The OCBJ report from below that included a Spring 2023 rollout date for the C1X turned out to be a bit overly optimistic. SUPER73 has confirmed to us that we’re still looking at a likely 2024 rollout. But with a bike this slick-looking, we can wait.]According to a recent report by the Orange County Business Journal, the SUPER73 C1X is expected to launch sometime this spring. That would mark a significant shortening of the original timeline, with the company stating a year ago that the bike’s production was expected to begin in “late 2023.”[Update: Again, the actual release date still seems to be “sometime in 2024”. We regret the misinformation in the original article.]SUPER73 appears to have doubled down on the new electric motorcycle’s development, with a team of four engineers comprised of two former Rivian employees. The electric truck maker Rivian, in an ironic twist of fate, is in fact working on its own electric bicycle with the help of designers plucked from e-bike companies. There’s no timeline on the Rivian e-bike, so SUPER73’s C1X electric motorcycle could conceivably hit the streets first.The SUPER73 C1X doesn’t come with many published specs yet, though we have a general idea of the company’s targets.A top speed of “at least 75 mph (120 km/h)” and a maximum city range of 100 miles (160 km). Based on the way most light electric motorcycle companies rate city range, that would put the battery pack at an estimated size of at least 5-6 kWh of capacity.Interestingly, SUPER73’s first electric motorcycle seems to have caught the eye not just of motorcycle fans, but also prospective riders that haven’t previously ridden a motorcycle.The company surveyed its customers and found that 60% of people wanted the company to make a motorcycle, despite also finding that 67% of its buyers have never ridden a motorcycle before.Pricing information for the C1X is nearly as vague as performance specs, though the company appears to have several models planned to allow it to hit multiple price points. The entry-level model is expected to slip in under the $10K mark, putting it in competition with other low-cost commuter electric motorcycles like the Ryvid Anthem, SONDORS Metacycle, and CSC RX1E.Prospective riders can get their name on the reservation list for a lot cheaper, putting down just a $73 deposit to hold their spot.Electric bicycle companies becoming moto-curious isn’t anything new in the industry. SUPER73 is arguably one of the closest e-bike companies to e-moto performance, with the brand’s fast and powerful electric bicycles already famously flirting with the fuzzy line between e-bikes and e-motorcycles.Other e-bike companies have explored similar paths. SONDORS unveiled its own electric motorcycle, the Metacycle, way back in early 2021. It took nearly two years to come to market, but it eventually scored praise for its ease of use and innovative design, despite leaving many early fans disappointed when it didn’t quite live up to its original performance specs. When viewed through the lens of a capable scooter in a motorcycle’s body, the bike tends to receive favorable reviews – including my own. However, the company recently launched a promotion that cut nearly 40% off the price of the $6,500 bike, raising demand questions.Electric bicycle drivetrain maker Bafang has also expanded into electric motorcycles with the launch of a sister brand developed to build motors and powertrains for much more powerful electric two-wheelers than the electric bicycles that the brand has largely focused on.",ebikes
2023/03/07,"Bafang is best known for its electric motors, batteries, controllers, and other powertrain components that help millions of electric bicycles zip through streets around the world. But after two decades in the bicycle market, Bafang has now launched a new brand known as T&D to expand its influence into the electric motorcycle industry.The Suzhou, China-based company recently announced the formation of T&D to leverage its electric vehicle powertrain technology on a larger scale, namely for faster and more powerful electric two-wheelers like electric motorcycles.As the company explained:T&D is an evolution of Bafang’s electrical drive-system offering, focused on the sphere of e-motorcycles. After 20 years in the cycling industry, Bafang remains a brand committed to providing innovative technology and unique riding experiences – T&D represents a confident step towards new opportunities and green mobility solutions.Along with the announcement of the new electric motorcycle component company, Bafang has also shared details of T&D’s first drivetrains.The FE01 (Storm) Off-Road Drive System is said to offer 6 kW of peak power (8 hp) and 125 Nm of torque, with the ability to climb gradients up to 60%. The system weighs just 22 kg (48 lb.).The new LI01 (Forest) City Commuting Drive System offers an even higher 240 Nm of torque and a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). The system uses a 72V 50Ah (3.6 kWh) battery, which would put it in line with several leading commuter e-scooters and motorcycles.Bafang is leaning heavily into the environmental aspect of electric motorcycles, as the new head of T&D, vice general manager of Bafang Sunny He, explained:As a team, we sincerely value the harmonious existence of nature and humanity and are keenly aware of the natural demand for sustainable and intelligent products for our shared future. One way to achieve that coexistence is to follow the natural rhythm of things, and the time of e-motorbikes has truly arrived, the time is ripe to go green.Even the company’s name has an earthy origin, with the T&D title originating from the Chinese characters “tian” and “di,” or heaven and earth.Well, jeez, it’s about time!Bafang has long been the Chinese alternative to Bosch, offering e-bike drivetrains with higher power and speed yet at more budget-friendly prices. That means while Bosch systems have found their way into nicer (and pricier) electric bikes, Bafang motors are often associated with either more affordable e-bikes, higher power e-bikes, or both.And since their claim to fame has always been good power at a good price, expanding into the electric motorcycle market just makes sense. Hopefully this results in some new, more affordable electric motorcycles headed out way.I had assumed that Bafang would originally start with more a scooter-style target, something like the currently Bosch-powered NIU electric scooters. But their off-road system with 60 kW of power sounds like a true electric dirt bike, so we may actually see some serious muscle from T&D.When can we expect these new drivetrains to roll out on OEM bikes? No one is saying for sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we get some offerings before the end of the year. Bafang has proven itself to be more agile than a lot of European heavyweights in the same industry, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see the company moving quickly here too.Oh, and if you’re curious what the inside of Bafang’s factory looks like, check out the video below from my last visit to China.",ebikes
2023/03/07,"A new law already passed by the New York City Council will ban the sale of electric bicycles, electric scooters, and other electric mobility devices that are not UL-certified. The move is part of an ongoing push to improve e-bike safety and reduce the risk of fires.The law, which is expected to be signed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the coming days, was developed in response to a spate of fires caused by the lithium-ion batteries used in many electric mobility devices.New York City is home to hundreds of thousands of electric bikes, e-scooters, and other micro-mobility devices. They are commonly used by delivery workers, food couriers, and commuters as a quicker and more efficient way to navigate the city.But when not constructed properly, lithium-ion batteries can result in intense fires. These cases are extremely rare, but the high number of battery-powered devices in NYC has led to a higher number of such fires.These lithium-ion battery fires are more common when batteries are modified or repaired by untrained technicians, which has become a common practice employed to prevent needing to buy a new and expensive battery. Another factor that has led to some of these fires is the use of third-party and non-compatible aftermarket chargers that can overcharge a battery.A five-alarm fire that broke out in the Bronx earlier this weekend is just one of several that have resulted in significant property damage over the last few years. While rare, several lithium-ion battery fire-related fatalities have also been reported in NYC.The new law will require electric mobility devices with lithium-ion batteries sold in NYC to be certified to the UL 2849 standard, which covers not just the battery in an electric bicycle but also the motor and drivetrain.The president of the National Bicycle Dealers Association, Heather Mason, explained to Bicycle Retailer that she believes the decision will benefit the e-bike industry:“I’m telling dealers to adjust their inventory. I know this is going to create a hardship for our retailers, but (the regulation) is in the best interest of the future of e-bikes. It will allow growth in the category while keeping people safe. It’s the right thing.”NYC is one of the first cities in the nation to require such a standard, but the new law could be a sign of legislation to come in more cities and states, or even at a national level.Safer e-bikes are always a good thing, and reducing fire risk through properly constructed batteries is imperative to improving the safety of micro-mobility devices.I have a UL account for work so I looked around and the majority of the companies that have listed products for E-bikes were Chinese that I had not heard of. The only ones I recognized in the list (I think there were 15 companies listed) were Panasonic, Trek, and Ninebot. However, it is important to keep in mind that e-bike fires aren’t just rare, they are exceedingly rare. We’re talking single digits out of millions of e-bikes, e-scooters, and other e-mobility devices.The headline “Hundreds of thousands of e-bikes quietly finish charging again last night” just isn’t as clickable. And so the teeny tiny percentage of fires get more coverage. It’s just like how 500 combustion engine cars catch on fire everyday in the US, but one Tesla fire is the only thing that will make the news. Another consideration to keep in mind is that these e-bike fires are almost always the most junky of the models out there. These aren’t the typical e-bikes we often cover – they’re the eBay specials. When you see the aftermath pictures of these e-bike fires, it is nearly always an ultra-cheap product produced in a no-name factory. These are the bargain-basement crap-on-wheels models that have made significant quality compromises to reach those low prices. And even those rolling dumpsters rarely catch on fire, it’s just the minuscule few that do that we end up hearing about.So yes, I definitely support the idea of improved e-bike safety. But let’s all keep the scope of this problem in perspective. At risk of some type of moral relativism here, I’d say there are some significantly bigger threats to public safety rolling around that we could be committing this type of energy and legislation toward fixing. Around 300 pedestrians are killed by cars in NYC every year. So far this year NYC has reported two deaths from e-bike fires. While each is a tragedy, the difference in scale is obvious. ",ebikes
2023/03/06,"If there’s two cool pieces of green technology that have greatly improved my day-to-day life, they’re probably electric bikes and solar-powered portable power stations. I’ve reviewed plenty of both, and they’re even better when you combine them. Take the case of the Mokwheel Scoria, which straps an inverter onto an e-bike to create a mobile power station.The Mokwheel Scoria looks like a typical step-through fat tire e-bike. And in many ways, that’s just what it is.But what really sets this thing apart is the optional inverter and solar panel combination that turns it into a rolling battery that can be recharged from the sun.To see what I mean, check out my video review below. But don’t stop there! Keep scrolling for the rest of my review.Let’s start with the main attraction. The base model of the Scoria, which is priced at $1,999, doesn’t come with the extra goodies. You can fork over $2,398 to get the version with the add-on inverter, or $2,997 to get that bundle plus a folding 200W solar panel.The inverter has a cable that allows it to plug directly into the e-bike, sharing power between the two.On the power station, you’ll find a pair of 120VAC outlets as well as several USB-A and USB-C outlets. There’s even a full power 100W USB-C outlet.This would be the perfect setup for bikepacking or camping, since you could run appliances off the AC outlet and keep your USB devices charged up as well. When you come to a rest, you can recharge the bike via the folding solar panel, or use it on multi-day camping trips as you begin to drain the bike’s battery over time. With a 960Wh battery on the bike, you’ve got a lot of capacity to draw from.The inverter is obviously the major draw here that separates the Mokwheel Scoria from other e-bikes. But even by itself, this e-bike is pretty nice in its own right.It’s a moped-style electric bike, meaning it’s got smaller diameter fat tires that give it a lower ride and more motorbike-like handling. The front suspension and the fat tires make for a nicer ride over pot holes or nature trails, and the rear rack gives some classy wood-lined storage.Hydraulic disc brakes help bring this heavy 79 lb (36 kg) e-bike to a quick stop, and are important features on a bike that is supposedly capable of supporting a payload of up to 400 lb (181 kg).And since the bike edges over Class 2 speeds to max out at around 22 mph (35 km/h), strong stoppers are a nice addition.The 48V and 19.6Ah battery offers 940 Wh of capacity, which is especially important if you plan on draining the battery through the inverter in addition to through the wheels. The company claims a max range of 60 miles (96 km) from the large battery, though that seems fairly optimistic to me unless you’re in the lowest power pedal assist level.Achieving 22 mph (35 km/h) on throttle-only made the bike feel fun to ride on the road and on the trails, but it definitely won’t last for 60 miles at those speeds on throttle-only riding.That 750W motor is battery-hungry as well, so keep that in mind if you plan to use the inverter for a while and then go for a ride. You’ll want to make sure you leave yourself with plenty of battery.At a price of $1,999, the bike seems a bit overpriced compared to other similarly-designed e-bikes in this class. Perhaps the company is banking on the fact that you can’t really use many other e-bikes – or perhaps any other e-bikes – in this type of rolling powerstation capacity.Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great bike that rides well, has plenty of power and is comfortable to boot. And the inverter add-on is a really cool feature. There are some nice features like mag wheels instead of spoked wheels, but does that justify the price? I’m not sure the cost is in line with the value.But then again, if this type of functionality is something you really want or need, then I guess the value is for you to decide.",ebikes
2023/03/05,"Here at Electrek we have spent countless hours undertaking detailed hands-on testing of hundreds of electric bikes. Through those thousands of miles of riding, we’ve gotten to know these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That dedication to real world e-bike testing has helped us find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget. Below you’ll find some of the top e-bikes we’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of March 2023. Spring is in the air (even if you can’t quite feel it yet where you live), and that means riding season is getting ready to heat up! Check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.The sub-$1,000 electric bike category is critical for a few reasons.First, it’s pretty hard to produce a quality e-bike and sell it for under $1k. Most of the options in this price category make too many sacrifices in quality or longevity to earn a spot on this list as one of “the best”. Second, many newcomers to the e-bike industry just aren’t prepared to drop several thousand dollars on a brand new concept, making this price range critical for many first time e-bike shoppers.Fortunately, we’ve found some excellent options for cheap electric bikes that can still save you some serious dough.The recently-unveiled Lectric XP LITE is likely the latest king of bang-for-your-buck electric bikes. For years, the $999 Lectric XP 2.0 and its previous 1.0 predecessor reigned supreme in the budget electric bike category. That’s still a great bike, and we’ll discuss it next, but the recently-released and more affordable $799 Lectric XP LITE is an even more wallet-friendly electric bike.That new e-bike offers some great riding at under 800 bucks.It’s a throttle-enabled Class 2 folding electric bike with 20″ wheels, a max speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) and a motor rated for 300W continuous and 720W peak.It’s not going to be the strongest hill climber, but it does get going quickly on flat and modestly hilly terrain.This is the only e-bike in this price range that I know of with a 48V electrical system. All the other budget e-bikes under $800 use a 36V system and thus suffer from weaker power.There are some things that you give up with this model, such as that the fenders aren’t included free. But for just $799, you’re still getting built-in lights, a hidden battery, large LCD display and a lightweight folder. Plus it comes in four color options. There’s a lot of value there!Lectric XP LITE quick specsIf you like the idea of a low-cost US-based company like Lectric eBikes but want something with more power than their XP LITE, consider the $999 Lectric XP 3.0. The XP 3.0 was just unveiled last month and is the newest version of America’s best-selling electric bike, the XP 2.0. In my opinion, this is the current king of bang-for-your-buck electric bikes right now. Between the fast 28 mph speed, comfortable ride with front suspension, nimble yet thick three-inch tires, and the powerful 1,000W peak-rated motor, the bike combines high performance with an awesome price. The new version comes with a higher power motor featuring more torque, a new rear rack that can support 150 pounds (and has a passenger package option for carrying a friend), has longer travel suspension, and several other key upgrades.There are both step-over and step-through frames available. To be honest, the frame member is low on both of them and so they’re both easy to mount, but I actually prefer the step-through. Even though low-step bikes are often considered to be “women’s bikes,” the Lectric XP 3.0 looks badass enough that no one would ever think of calling the step-through option a ladies bike. It’s just a more comfortable way to hop on and off.Plus, the Lectric XP 3.0’s folding frame means you can bring this high-value e-bike with you in a car or truck. I know several people that keep one in their RV, and I’ve even heard of folks traveling with it on their boat or light airplane. The company just unveiled longer range batteries for the XP 3.0 that add 45% more range. If you’re the kind of person that likes to ride fast, that battery will help you use that power for longer rides at higher speeds.It’s hard to find a better combination of low cost and high performance anywhere in the e-bike market right now.Check out my first ride experience on the Lectric XP 3.0 here.Lectric XP 2.0 quick specsThe Ride1Up Roadster V2 seems to hop back and forth in price from $995 to $1,095, depending on the time of year and current sale. Even when it falls just north of the $1k mark, the Roadster V2 is an awesome deal. But you should know going in that this is very much a pedal-oriented e-bike. There’s no throttle and the motor is only moderately powerful, peaking at 500W. That means the Roadster V2 is best for someone who enjoys cycling and simply wants an assist motor to help them go faster and farther.The belt-drive setup, low-weight design, and fast speed of up to 24 mph make this an incredible deal.You can check out my full, in-depth review of the Ride1Up Roadster V2 here.Ride1up Roadster V2 quick specs:The $849 Propella Mini almost looks a bit odd at first glance, but the quirky proportions result in a super nimble and lightweight e-bike. It’s not particularly fast at just 18 mph. And it’s also a pedal-assist e-bike, meaning you don’t have a throttle for the days when you feel lazy. But for anyone that doesn’t mind pedaling as long as you get a decent electric boost, the Propella Mini is a great option for you.I love the bright blue rims, white chain, and slim black frame. The look is killer. And the bike rides both smoothly and efficiently. There’s no suspension to speak of, but the upside is there’s no suspension fork to break. The bike should last a long time with modest upkeep, and it’s a definite winner for anyone that’s low on space.See my full review of the Propella Mini here.Propella Mini quick specsThe $999 JackRabbit is in one of these fuzzy areas between e-bikes and other e-rideables. In this case, it straddles the line between an electric bike and an electric scooter.It more or less feels like an electric bike based on its ride geometry. However the lack of pedals means that it could also be classified as an electric scooter, albeit a large-wheeled e-scooter.But with those 20-in wheels and bicycle seat, the JackRabbit rides much more like a small folding e-bike than an e-scooter. And its electronics match that of a light e-bike too. The 300W motor gets the little runabout up to 20 mph (32 km/h). The small 158 Wh battery only offers around 10-12 miles (approximately 16-20 km) of range, but is also conveniently small enough to easily keep a spare battery in a cargo pocket or even a small purse.The biggest benefit of the JackRabbit is that it is so simple that the lack of frills keeps the weight down to just 23 lb (10.5 kg)! For an e-bike, that’s almost so light that it floats. See my full review of the JackRabbit here.JackRabbit quick specs[UPDATE: It looks like the RadMission has sold out, and now we’re waiting to see if Rad will replace it with something new.]The RadMission is the epitome of an affordable metro bike. The bike is normally priced at $1,199 but is currently on a super sale for just $499! It’s purely designed for the city, though that hasn’t stopped me from abusing it off road either, testing its impressive ruggedness. The bike features moderately-sized tires that balance ride comfort and efficiency, yet offers no suspension, keeping it light and long-lasting. There’s a peppy 500W motor and removable 500Wh battery. Both are balanced nicely to offer good performance while keeping the price and weight low.Rad Power Bikes is also the largest electric bicycle company in North America, meaning you’ve got the backing of a solid service department and the peace of mind from knowing the company will be around for years to come.You can check out my complete review of the Rad Power Bikes RadMission here.Rad Power Bikes RadMission quick specs:Once you bump up above the $1,000 limit, you start to see many more great options for e-bikes in a wide range of categories.From electric cargo bikes to cruisers and even electric mopeds, there’s something for everyone in this price range.The $1,399 Lectric XPedition has turned the electric cargo bike market upside down, finally bringing a heavy-hitting cargo e-bike to market for an ultra-affordable price.We were the first to review this new model and we called it a runaway hit right from the start. With heavy-hauling weight capacity, the option for one or two batteries for extra long range, hydraulic disc brakes and a watt-based more comfortable feeling pedal assist sensor, this e-bike is dragging electric cargo bikes into the future.While it’s not the nicest cargo e-bike on the market, it’s definitely the best bang for your buck thanks to a combination of high value parts and reasonable pricing.Lectric XPedition quick specs:The $1,199 Aventon Soltera is a beautiful city bike that offers some of the best quality fabrication that I’ve seen in this price range – or even in higher price ranges. It is offered in either a single-speed or seven-speed format.The bike rolls on narrow tires for that efficient city ride, while still packing in a 500W motor.The battery is a bit smaller at 36V and 10Ah, but the bike makes up for a smaller battery by being able to integrate it into the frame in a sleek and attractive package.The beautiful color display also adds to the bike’s charm, as do the powerful headlight and frame-integrated tail light. There’s even an awesome companion app that lets your phone track your bike’s important stats. Basically, you’re getting a lot for $1,199 here!Check out my in-depth Aventon Soltera review here.Aventon Soltera quick specs:Ride1Up has proven itself as a high-value electric bike brand, focusing largely on efficient and speedy commuter e-bikes. While the company has many models in the $1,000 to $2,000 range, the $1,095 Ride1Up Core-5 is one of the best bang-for-your-buck options.A powerful 750W continuous-rated motor gets the bike up to Class 3 speeds that will have you keeping up with traffic or even passing cars when they get bogged down in the city. That extra speed over most class 2 e-bikes can be quite useful when riding on the side of the road trying to reduce the number of times a car whizzes by you. Even when riding alone or in a protected path away from cars, the extra speed sure makes for a fun ride.The street tires, sporty frame, and straight bars are the perfect combination for a responsive commuter e-bike. I’d definitely recommend spending an extra $60 for the rack and fender option if you live in an area that is prone to rain or even sprinkler puddles, plus that $50 optional rack is always useful. The frame even comes in both a step-over and step-through variant to offer both styles. And a new update added a headlight to the standard equipment as well as a larger battery.If you want to upgrade to more power and a nicer set of components, the $1,695 700 Series is worth a look. But I think the Core-5 is sufficient for most riders, and that’s probably why it is Ride1Up’s best-selling model.Ride1Up Core-5 quick specs:The Lectric XPremium packs in so much value at its $1,799 price that it is borderline unbelievable. This is the latest model from budget king Lectric eBikes and it puts many other e-bikes to shame thanks to its combination of high performance and comparatively low cost. There are $3,000+ e-bikes that compete at a similar level to this affordable ride.This is perhaps the lowest-cost mid-drive electric bicycle that still offers a true torque sensor, powerful performance, and long range riding. The 800W motor is paired with a 7-speed drivetrain and offers speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h).The bike comes with two removable batteries totaling up to 1,000 Wh of capacity. That’s enough for 50 miles (80 km) of range on throttle-only riding or closer to 100 miles (160 km) of range with pedal assist.In addition, the bike includes other premium components such as hydraulic disc brakes, an oil suspension fork, built in LED lights, included fenders, a strong rear rack and an easy-to-read LCD display. Oh yea, and the step-thru frame folds in half, too!When it comes to mid-drive electric bicycles, there simply isn’t a better bang-for-your-buck option than the Lectric XPremium. The bike debuted at $1,799 though is expected to increase to its $1,999 MSRP sometime soon. So if you don’t want to spend an extra $200 (which, to be honest, would still be a good deal), you may want to act fast.Lectric XPremium quick specs:See my full Lectric XPremium first ride experience here.The Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser is Ride1Up’s first non-purely commuter electric bike, and boy did they knock it out of the park on this one.The Cafe Cruiser, as its name suggests, is part cruiser bike, part fast motorbike.The cruiser bars, suspension fork, comfortable seat and pedal-forward geometry make it a pleasure to ride. The high performance 750W hub motor and 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed make it a blast for quick errand running and fun commutes.High quality parts like hydraulic disc brakes complete the package, and the included fenders and rear rack increase the bike’s value.One of the coolest features though is the passenger package that adds a rear bench seat, wheel skirt and foot pegs so you can carry a second rider on back. The second seat has a quick release so you can easily pop it on and off the bike whenever you need to swap back and forth between carrying your friends or a basket full of groceries home.At just $1,595, the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser is priced way below fair market value, which makes this an absolute steal of a deal.Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser quick specs:The RadRunner from Rad Power Bikes has been an industry favorite ever since it was first announced back in 2019. The company is actually on the RadRunner 2 now, but the update only made minor changes since the original was already so well designed.The bike uses a step-through moped style frame to create a short utility bike or mini cargo e-bike. It’s quick up to the 20 mph top speed and offers a ton of uses. When outfitted with the Passenger Package, it has a seat and footpegs that let you carry kids or adults on the back, turning this into a multi-passenger e-bike.The high-capacity battery and powerful motor also make for sprightly acceleration and longer than average rides, so you’ll have enough power to ride all day.The RadRunner is truly one of those do-anything e-bikes because it has so many uses. The same bike can be used for fun recreational riding, city commuting, trail riding, or grocery shopping. There’s something for everyone. There’s even an upgraded version known as the RadRunner Plus, which adds suspension, a seven-speed transmission, a more detailed display, and the passenger package, though the RadRunner Plus costs a bit more at $1,899.Check out my complete review of the RadRunner 2 here.RadRunner 2 quick specs:Cargo electric bikes are the workhorses of the e-bike world. They have higher weight capacities and more surface area for carrying all of your gear.The $1,999 Rad Power Bikes RadWagon 4 is one of my favorite options thanks to the awesome build and wide range of compatible Rad accessories.The bike’s 750W motor and large capacity battery make it easy to hit the top speed of 20 mph and ride farther than your errands will require. Plus that long rear bench has tons of room for boxes, bags, or kiddos. I’ve had three riders on the bike plenty of times, and it can definitely do more. Plus, I love that double center kickstand for creating an ultra-stable parking platform.Check out my full in-depth review of the RadWagon 4 e-cargo bike here.Rad Power Bikes RadWagon 4 quick specs:Electric Bike Company is one of the only e-bike manufacturers that actually builds its electric bikes in the US from the ground up.They start with bare frames and perform the entire build locally with highly trained e-bike technicians. That also allows them to offer more customization options than any other e-bike company out there.The $1,949 Model Y is a step-through cruiser e-bike with a hidden battery in the front basket. It offers fast speeds up to 28 mph and high-quality parts like hydraulic disc brakes and top-end hardware. The color screen and leather accents on the seat and bar ends add to the classy look too!The real treat though is getting to select the custom paint on every surface of the bike, plus your own rim colors, trim colors, and tire options. It’s incredibly customizable to the point where you’re virtually guaranteed to be able to create a truly one-of-a-kind electric bike if you wish.Check out my full review of the Electric Bike Company Model Y here.Electric Bike Company Model Y quick specs:By the time you surpass the $2,000 dollar mark, you’re starting to get into serious e-bikes with serious performance or build quality. If you’re spending this much, you’ll want to ensure you’re buying from a reputable company with top-notch products and service.The $2,295 Ride1Up Prodigy has brought new meaning to the phrase “low-cost mid-drive electric bike”.This e-bike sports a high-end German-manufactured Brose mid-drive motor and can hit speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h), yet is price similarly to much cheaper hub motor-based electric bikes.It’s a perfect commuter e-bike for someone that wants high quality parts like that German mid-drive motor, 9-speed Shimano transmission, hydraulic disc brakes, bright LED lights, built in fenders, rear rack, and a very comfortable saddle.The base step-through and step-over versions use a rigid fork that is designed to be stronger than a suspension fork for daily commuting needs. However, there’s also a front suspension version on the XC model that is outfitted for trail-style riding.This e-bike is easily worth another $500 more than the price tag, if not more. In fact, you’ll find many of these same components on e-bikes with $3,000-$4,000 price tags all over the place. So if you’re looking for a higher quality e-bike that doesn’t cost as much as a fancy bike shop e-bike, this is the one to consider.Check out my full review of the Ride1Up Prodigy here.Ride1Up Prodigy quick specs:The $2,199 Juiced Scorpion X has all the old-school charm of a vintage moped, but it adds back in a powerful electric drivetrain. It also has awesome-looking cast wheels that remove the issue of spoke maintenance, plus add to the cool stance.The bench seat allows riders to scoot forward or backward to find the best seating position, and the tall bars give a fun cruiser/motorcycle feel to the bike. With full suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, and a built-in rear rack/fenders, there are a lot of nice parts on the Scorpion XA powerful throttle lets you blast up to 20 mph, or engaging the pedal assist can take you even faster to 28 mph. And Juiced offers a larger battery than most competitors, letting you ride this moto-styled e-bike even further.Check out my in-depth review of the Juiced Scorpion X here.Juiced Scorpion X quick specs:I love the $3,299 Priority Current electric bike so much that it has become one of my daily riders. It’s the one I grab when I’m doing city riding and I know I want to be pedaling.Becuase it doesn’t have a throttle, you’ll need to enjoy pedaling in order to enjoy this e-bike. But it makes it so much fun to pedal thanks to a torque sensor-based pedal assist that provides natural feeling assistance up to a fast 28 mph top speed.The internally geared rear hub combined with a Gates belt drive system and powerful hydraulic disc brakes make this a very nice e-bike for the price. Plus that mid-drive motor offers tons of torque for climbing hills or accelerating quickly.I’m also a fan of the built-in lights and included fenders, not to mention the integrated high-capacity battery that disappears in the frame.Mid-drive electric bikes aren’t cheap, but the price is definitely a fair one for this e-bike.Check out my full review of the Priority Current here.Priority Current quick specs:There’s a lot to like about the Biktrix Moto electric moped. Near the top of the list though has got to be the dual batteries. There’s a single battery option that starts at $2,299, but the dual battery option doubles the range up to a maximum of 100 miles.Even with just one battery, the high capacity of 1,008 Wh makes these some of the biggest batteries in the e-bike industry. Combine that with a high power motor, tall handlebars, and a long bench seat, and you’ve got a seriously fun electric moped.It doesn’t slouch on components either. The lighting is ultra bright and it features other nice parts like powerful hydraulic disc brakes and an included rack/fender setup.See my full review of the Biktrix Moto e-bike here.Biktrix Moto quick specs:This full-suspension electric moped-style e-bike is a masterclass in high performance electric bike design. Sure, it’s an obvious SUPER73 imitation, but it’s a really well done imitation.It handles well, it’s got great rubber between you and the road, the suspension gives a comfortable ride, and it’s got plenty of extra power.Despite the 750W label, the e-bike can be unlocked to make use of nearly 1,500W of peak power. I was able to reach a top speed of 37 mph (59.5 km/h) during my testing (not on public streets!).But the bike ships in Class 2 mode with a 750W limit and 20 mph (32 km/h) maximum speed, meaning you’ll have to contact the company to request an unlock for the bike to be used above Class 2 speeds and power levels.All in all, the $2,395 Ride1Up REVV1 FS is an amazing e-bike for anyone who wants a moped-style ride with full-suspension, high quality 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes and a design that rides almost like a motorcycle, yet in a bike form factor.Check out my complete Ride1Up REVV1 FS review here.Ride1Up REVV1 quick specs:The Tern Quick Haul is an electric cargo bike from famed cargo e-bike company Tern. It holds the distinction of being the most affordable model in Tern’s lineup.That says a lot, because Tern is known for its high quality e-bikes that are built to be ridden everyday for real world errands, carpool duty and more. These e-bikes are meant to replace cars, and they do just that for many riders. With a huge list of accessories, you can outfit a Quick Haul for just about any job.The Tern Quick Haul features a mid-drive Bosch motor, hydraulic disc brakes, Tern’s vertical parking rack, and a relatively lightweight but high utility design that is meant to carry just about anything in your life.We had the chance to test a pair of Quick Hauls at Eurobike in Frankfurt earlier this year, which you can learn more about here.Motor: Bosch Active Line Plus mid-drive motorTop speed: 20 mph (32 km/h) with pedal assist (no throttle)Range: Up to 60 miles (96 km km), less when riding in highest powerBattery: 400Wh, removable/lockableWeight: 50 lb (22.8 kg)Price: $2,999When it comes to fast, powerful electric mopeds on a budget, it’s hard to compete with the $2,399 Ariel Rider X-Class. This is the e-bike I usually recommend when someone simply wants the most power and speed for the least amount of money.The impressive performance comes from a powerful 1,000W motor that actually puts out closer to 2,000W of peak power. It can be limited to 20 mph if you’d like, but I got it up to 36 mph in unlimited mode.The bike rolls on 20″ moto-style wheels and comes with nice parts including hydraulic disc brakes, a bench seat, dual suspension, and a big moto-style headlight.You can see my full review of the Ariel Rider 52V X-Class here.Technically the Rad Rover 6 Plus is priced at $1,999. And with its free shipping, it comes in under the $2k mark. But I’m including it in the $2k-$3k category because you’re going to want to add a couple of important accessories to this one.Rad Power Bikes has one of the widest arrays of e-bike accessories on the planet. In fact, it might have THE widest selection. And I’d highly recommend adding the rear rack ($79) to the RadRover 6 Plus, at the very least. It simply adds even more utility and turns an adventure bike into an adventure/hauling bike.Accessories aside, the RadRover 6 Plus is an awesome ride and packs in some real value. It is the highest-spec e-bike in Rad’s lineup and includes hydraulic disc brakes, redesigned suspension fork, an upgraded frame with a new semi-integrated battery, new displays that are easier to read and use, and so much more. This is absolutely an e-bike that is worth checking out for anyone that does adventure-style riding and needs big tires combined with high power, and who wants the support and comfort provided by going with North America’s largest e-bike company.Check out my full RadRover 6 Plus review here.RadRover 6 Plus quick specs:VanMoof is known for making elegant and techie e-bikes that are designed for commuters and urban navigators. You won’t find giant tires or suspension or huge motors. What you will find is modest power combined with urban-centric features.The S3 will get you up to 20 mph in the US (or 15 mph in Europe) and comes with a high torque motor paired with an automatic electronic shifter. There’s also a nicely enclosed chain, which is a very nicer feature for urban riders that don’t want to deal with chain lube on their pants or ankles.The dot matrix display is considered odd by some, by others prize its minimalism. Lastly, VanMoof employs some awesome anti-theft features, such as a built-in kick lock and find my iPhone integration from Apple to help locate the e-bike if it goes missing.Check out our review of the VanMoof S3 here.Above $3.5k, you’re entering some seriously dedicated e-bike territory. These e-bikes either feature top-shelf components like drivetrain and brake parts, or pack in so much power that they couldn’t possibly be priced any lower.Either way, you’re not in Kansas anymore. You’re heading down the e-bike rabbit hole.Tern is renowned for building high-quality electric bikes that double down on utility features. The Tern HSD is the company’s more affordable utility e-bike, offering many features you’ll find on its higher end GSD but at a price that more riders can stomach.The HSD uses small 20″ wheels and includes a folding stem, making it nice and compact. But taking it one step further, Tern outfitted it with its innovative rack that lets you park the bike on its tail, meaning it takes up barely more space than a coat rack in the corner of a room.The bike’s Bosch mid-drive and high capacity batteries provide a high-end e-bike drive, and they are matched with a variety of performance drivetrain options that you can select from, depending on how high you want to spec the bike.Whether you’re ferrying around kids or buying a week’s worth of groceries, the HSD is a solid option.Check out my detailed first ride experience on the Tern HSD here.Tern HSD quick specs:The CSC FT1000MD sounds like a motorcycle name because it comes from a company with motorcycle heritage. CSC Ebikes was born out of CSC Motorcycles, a company with several decades of two-wheeler experience.The FT1000MD is the company’s highest power option. The fat tire e-bike comes with a 1,000+ watt motor known as the Bafang M620 Ultra. It’s the most powerful and highest torque e-bike mid-drive motor on the retail market. CSC paired it with a big battery, quality suspension, hydraulic brakes, built-in lighting, and more to create a high performance and high-quality adventure e-bike.I was able to hit speeds of around 34 mph with the motor in unlocked format, though you can limit it to 20 or 28 mph to fit into class 2 and class 3 designations.Check out my full review of this incredibly powerful e-bike here.CSC FT1000MD quick specs:When it comes to all-wheel-drive electric bikes, the $3,299 Ariel Rider Grizzly is one of my favorites.This incredible e-bike is really more of a small electric motorcycle. It uses two high-power motors – one in each wheel – to offer speeds in the mid 30’s and acceleration that will get you there in the blink of an eye.Full suspension and hydraulic disc brakes make this an e-bike that handles well at any speed, and the bright red paint job looks as aggressive as the e-bike feels. It even comes with footpegs pre-installed so you can carry a passenger with you.Plus it’s got double batteries to feed those two power-hungry motors, so you’ll be able to ride this e-bike pretty darn far too, as long as you aren’t too demanding from the throttle.Check out my full in-depth review of the epic Ariel Rider Grizzly e-bike here.Ariel Rider Grizzly quick specs:For more of a cruiser/city e-bike experience, the $4,800 Specialized Turbo Como SL is a great option. This e-bike offers a much more upright ride for a fun, relaxed vibe.The e-bike features a high-quality mid-drive motor, hydraulic disc brakes, Gates carbon belt drive, and an eight-speed internally geared hub. Those are a lot of nice parts!And don’t forget the slim fenders, front basket, and cruiser bars that all look super elegant, complimenting the nice lines of the Turbo Como SL.This may not be a low-cost e-bike, but it definitely offers a ride that makes it worth it.See my full review of the Specialized Turbo Como SL here.Specialized Turbo Como SL quick specs:If you’ve been looking for a high-end trekking electric bike that was built with a combination of high-quality parts and the latest technology, look no further than the $4,550 Greyp T5.There’s a reason why Porsche bought this e-bike company – it’s simply one of the best.It uses Greyp’s own in-house developed 700 Wh battery combined with a mid-drive motor to offer a hardtail trekking e-bike. In addition to the awesome bike design, the built-in tech is what really opens people’s eyes. Integrated cameras at the front and rear of the bike can serve as dash cams or livestream your rides. Plus you can capture all of your ride footage on the bike instead of bringing along a Go-Pro camera.There’s also an app that allows you to take full advantage of the built-in eSIM card, giving you connectivity to the bike and letting you check all your vital stats, find its location, and more – right from your phone.The bike is truly a high-end offering by itself, but the embedded tech makes it a rarity in any category.See my first ride review of the Greyp T5 e-bike here.You just couldn’t stop, could you? I showed you plenty of awesome e-bikes that didn’t cost most of a paycheck. But you just haaaaad to keep going.Fine, here they are. These are some of the most expensive e-bikes out there that we’ve tested and that I’d actually recommend someone buying, if you can pony up the cash.The $5,495 Fuell Flluid is a great example of what happens when a motorcycle designer applies his tradecraft to a smaller platform, creating an e-bike built to a higher standard.The Fuell Flluid’s smooth mid-drive motor, internally geared rear hub and Gates carbon belt drive setup combine to make an ultra-responsive and polished electric powertrain. The two removable batteries built into special cutouts in the frame offer long range riding without looking like a packhorse carrying massive batteries. The e-bike is nearly maintenance free thanks to the belt drive and hydraulic disc brakes. The duo remove the two most common maintenance issues with bikes: chain wear and brake adjustment.Flying fast at 28 mph (45 km/h) is a blast, and doing it on a smooth-riding e-bike with Pirelli tires is even better. Then add in the ultra-bright lights, built in fenders and rear rack, the suspension seat post, color LCD screen and other niceties, and now you’re left with a high-end e-bike that could serve you for years as a daily commuter e-bike designed for nearly maintenance-free high mileage riding. The only downside is that the bike is quite heavy at 36 kg (79 lb). But you can’t expect all these great parts and dual batteries on a featherweight bike!Check out my full review of the Fuell Flluid here.Fuell Flluid quick specs:When it comes to ultra premium folding electric bikes, there’s only one name that comes to my mind: GoCycle. These are the most impressive folding e-bikes I’ve ever seen. And they better be – they were designed by a former McLaren engineer.Between the carbon fiber work, single-sided wheels, high-tech tires, trippy LED dot display, innovative rear suspension, and completely enclosed drivetrain, there’s a lot of high-end stuff going on here.The speed will vary from 15-20 mph depending on which country you buy the bike in, but the performance is only part of the equation. The quick folding and light, compact design of the e-bike is the real winner here. Check out my full review of the GoCycle G4i+ here.GoCycle G4i+ quick specs:Serial 1, the electric bicycle company that spun out of Harley-Davidson, has several awesome electric bike models. While most fall under the $5,000 mark, I’m going to recommend their top of the line model: The $5,599 Serial 1 RUSH/CTY SPEED. If you’re in the market to buy a Serial 1 e-bike, you might as well go for the best.Like all of Serial 1’s e-bikes, it’s got a great design and ridability. Serial 1 scored top e-bike designers from companies like Trek, so they know how to build an awesome bike with killer geometry. They also brought in the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric motorcycle engineers to build the custom battery, so it’s top of the line too. Then they used pro parts like the Brose mid-drive and Gates carbon belt drive setup. Basically, it’s an incredible e-bike. And with a 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed plus a huge 706 Wh battery to ride all day, the performance matches the build.Serial 1 even goes above and beyond with their own custom weight bearing fenders that also happen to be functional racks (both in the front and rear), their own custom designed lights that throw serious illumination up front and give you great rear visibility from dropout-mounted lights, and there’s even a glovebox in the bike!Basically, there’s a lot to like here. Yes, it’s expensive. But you’re not just paying for the H-D name on the side. It’s actually a high quality, high performance electric bike regardless of the badging.Check out my full first ride on the various Serial 1 e-bike models here.Motor: High torque Brose TF MAG mid-drive motorTop speed (tested): 45 km/h (28 mph)Battery: 706 Wh Serial 1 custom batteryRange: 25-115 miles (40-185 km), likely more in the 30-50 miles range with normal ridingWeight: 26.7 kg (59 lb)Price: $5,599The FREY EX Pro is a high-end electric mountain bike with crazy high power. It uses the same motor as the CSC FT1000MD we featured above (the Bafang M620 mid-drive), but cranks up the current to provide closer to 1,500W of power. It’s enough to destroy chains if you aren’t careful. We know. Several of us here at Electrek have done it.The FREY EX Pro not only features high-end parts like a RockShox Lyric fork and Magura MT5e hydraulic brakes, but it even comes with dual batteries so you can ride farther and stay on the trails longer.I’ve personally taken this e-bike back UP a downhill mountain bike course – that’s how powerful it is.It may be expensive, but it saves you several thousand dollars compared to many European electric mountain bikes with similar components but a fraction of the power in the FREY.See my full review of the FREY EX Pro here.I've been really happy with my Ride1Up LMT'd which is essentially the Core-5 with some upgraded components include a torque sensor which to me was well worth the extra money since it really makes for a smooth ride if you are more interested in pedaling than the throttle.  It is a critical 10 pounds lighter than my wife's similar priced rad city 5 and between the lighter weight and torque sensor I think its a much nicer ride.  I don't find anything else in the $1500 price range with a torque sensor.The Tern GSD improves upon the Tern HSD with even more capability and even nicer components. There are multiple versions that can take you up to nearly $10k, but even the lower-tier versions are not “low tier,” if you know what I mean.Parts like automatically engaging electric locks, 10-speed Shimano Deore transmissions, Magura MT5e quad-piston hydraulic disc brakes, and more set these e-bikes apart from the rest of the pack.If you’re getting a Tern GSD, you’re getting a fully qualified car replacement. There are many people that use these instead of buying a second car. When you look at it like that, the price suddenly seems pretty reasonable.Check out our full review of the Tern GSD here. ",ebikes
2023/03/02,"The Ride1Up REVV1 FS is a rare breed of e-bike. It’s not that the design is that unique. In fact, it’s obviously another SUPER73 imitation. But what makes it so unique is that it’s a really good SUPER73 imitation. And by that I mean it’s built more like a moped or motorcycle than like an electric bicycle, which translates into an amazingly good ride.Now don’t get me wrong here: This is not an electric motorcycle. The purists out there will try to claim that it is. And I understand their argument. But it’s based on the misinformed premise that anyone can take this 20 mph electric bicycle out of the box and turn it into a crazy powerful speed machine. And while that’s true with many other e-bikes, it’s not true for the Ride1Up REVV1. To actually unlock it outside of Class 2 (20 mph) mode into Off-Road mode, you’ve got to contact the company to request the unlocking procedure that includes multiple passwords used at several steps.It’s not something that a kid is going to figure out, and it allows Ride1Up to control who gets Off-Road mode while giving them one more chance to remind you that it’s for use outside of public streets.Even when left in 20 mph Class 2 mode, the REVV1 is an awesome electric bicycle that offers an incredible ride. But when you unleash the beast, it gets so much better. I tested out both types of riding, which you can see in my video review below. Keep on reading after the video to see the rest of my written review.Just from looking at it, the Ride1Up REVV1 is obviously a beast. But many e-bikes talk tough. The REVV1 walks the walk, too.The bike’s CST Scout moped tires combined with that front and rear suspension let riders carve hard into curves and hit larger obstacles than you’d expect to be comfortable.The long bench seat actually feels really nice under you and is thicker than it looked when I first covered the bike’s unveiling. It’s also made from nicer material than I had imagined, giving it a real fabric upholstery that feels good under you. There’s no cheap imitation leather or plastic-feeling vinyl here. This feels like a motorcycle saddle.Regarding suspension, I will note that the rear suspension felt a bit stiff for me, but I’m a light rider at 150 lb (68 kg). I kept it on the lowest setting and that felt better for me, but heavier riders can crank up the suspension to fit their weight and ride style, which is a big improvement over non-adjustable suspension on other e-bikes.The components used on the bike also inspire confidence, from the high-power four-piston hydraulic disc brakes and the quality-feeling brake levers. The whole bike just has a solid and planted feeling to it. Many cheaper moped-style e-bikes feel more like a moped-shaped electric bicycle, in that they feel like a collection of weaker bolted-together parts. But the Ride1Up REVV1 FS feels like a purpose-built, solid, refined design that gives me motorcycle-quality vibes. It feels planted underneath me. There’s no rattling. There’s no flex (other than a nice give of suspension and a soft seat). There’s just a solid feel to it. I don’t know how else to describe the feel without telling you to just sit on it. But trust me, you can simply tell the difference between a cheap e-bike and a solid one within a few revolutions of the tires. And the difference here is astounding. As someone who rides high-power electric motorcycles, this e-bike gives me that feeling.Ha! Forget about it!Okay, it’s not that bad. You can pedal the bike. But it’s not comfortable. Your knees travel up quite high. The cadence-based pedal assist sensor doesn’t do you any favors either with its laggy response. As much as I love this bike for its throttle riding, I can say it’s not a pleasure on pedal assist. It works as a pedal bike, but it’s far from ideal.If you ran out of battery and needed to pedal home, you could do it. It’s possible. It won’t be fun. But you can physically make it happen. For the 99.9% of time that you’ve got charge though, you’ll probably just be throttling around. That’s the most fun way to ride a bike like this.Again, the purists may rip their hair out over this. An e-bike that can’t be pedaled comfortably?! But then again, the purists probably stopped reading this review a while ago. If you’re still here, it’s likely because you appreciate that this is an e-bike for having fun. Other e-bikes are great for exercise. There are other models for taking kids to daycare. And other models exist for cargo duty. The REVV1 isn’t for any of that. This is for getting around fast and having fun.Speaking of both, let’s talk about Off-Road mode.This is where things get really interesting. Unlike many e-bikes that come with higher power and higher speed modes that simply require playing around in the settings menu for a few minutes to unlock, you’re not going to figure out how to unlock the REVV1 on its own. It comes as a 20 mph (32 km/h) e-bike out of the box and that’s all you get.That’s also likely enough to fulfill stricter e-bike laws that would disqualify 20 mph e-bikes from Class 2 status if they can be easily unlocked by the rider to achieve higher performance.In this case, Ride1Up holds the keys to the power and speed that wouldn’t be legal on public roads in many states. So you have to ask them really nice for permission (and instructions) to get to the good stuff. Theoretically once enough people are granted the instructions, the secret unlocking procedure could get out there into the public domain. But I think the goal is to make the process complicated enough that the average person (and especially the average kid) can’t figure it out on their own.Once you’re welcomed into the walled garden though, you’re in. And you’ll love it.The 28A controller is unlocked, giving you access to nearly 1,500W of power. I took the bike to a non-public road so I could test the speed on a long stretch of tarmac.As you already know from the title of this review, the highest number I saw on the speedometer was 37 mph (59.5 km/h). And in fact that was the same figure I saw on a GPS speedometer I also used, just to make sure I was keeping Ride1UP honest. For the record, I was also wearing my full moto gear, including my motorcycle helmet, armored jacket, leather gloves, and boots. Sure, I put myself on the line for you guys to test this stuff. But my wife still wants me to come home at the end of the day.In fact, the top speed might even be a bit higher than what I saw. I didn’t do a full tuck and I was even at around 75% battery charge. A 100% charge will give the highest speed, but I burned off part of the charge just riding to the test location. I tried to save as much as I could, but I just couldn’t resist going fast on the way there. I tried to stay at 20 mph, but I kept looking down and realizing I had gotten to 30+ mph without realizing it.And that’s a testament to just how well the bike rides. That rubber feels good on the asphalt, the suspension takes up any road vibration, and the entire bike is nicely balanced. It doesn’t feel like it’s going to shake itself to bits, which I’ve experience on other e-bikes at high speeds. And so you can be cruising along at over 30 mph while still thinking you’re at a leisurely 20 mph. Basically, this is an e-bike that can easily handle going twice as fast as its out-of-the-box programmed speed, meaning it’s overbuilt. And for a lot of people, overbuilt is exactly how a vehicle should be built.I’ve talked before about how electric bikes can be a nice gateway drug into the world of electric motorcycles, especially when the power and quality walks up the ladder like in the Ride1Up REVV1 FS.There are light electric motorcycle models like the SONDORS Metacycle that fall somewhere in the gray area, though the Metacycle is more on the motorcycle end of the spectrum. The REVV1 FS feels like another gap filler, though this time more on the electric bicycle end of the spectrum. It’s an e-bike, but it simply feels closer to the experience of riding an electric motorcycle. And that’s a rarity in this industry.When you add in the turn signals, the motorcycle-style saddle, the quality rubber to keep your wheels down when you’re riding hard, and of course that adjustable suspension, you end up with a bike that offers motorcycle-style riding at a price point closer to e-bikes. $2,395 is a fair price for such a capable machine.If I could make one change, I’d have asked for mirrors. When I’m riding fast, I want to be able to look over my shoulder without doing a full head turn. And so a nice set of mirrors would have been some great gear to include. But as it stands, it’s hard for me to complain too hard. Sure, the bike sucks at pedaling. But it was never really meant for that. As a fun urban bike for zipping around like a motorcycle that doesn’t have to pay for registration, parking, insurance, or licensing, the Ride1Up REVV1 is a solid entry. Of all the SUPER73 imitations out there, this is the one to get if you can’t afford a real full-suspension SUPER73. It’s not quite at S73 level, and I’ve pushed those bikes hard, but it’s pretty darn close for a lot less cash. ",ebikes
2023/03/01,"Rad Power Bikes is back with a new version of the company’s RadRunner Plus. The new model, known as the RadRunner 3 Plus (not to be confused with the RadRunner 2 that is still available as the more budget-friendly model), is the brand’s new high-end electric utility bike. This latest model sees several important upgrades to bike’s components, design, and performance.For those that aren’t aware, the RadRunner line is THE budget utility e-bike. It was unveiled back in 2019 (which is practically “vintage” considering the short timeline of e-bikes in the US), and it launched a new wave of low-cost utility e-bike copycats. The step-through design, ease of carrying a passenger, and conveniently short wheelbase made it a runaway hit. The design has been imitated all over the place but never truly matched.The RadRunner was refined over the years, first with the RadRunner Plus and then with the RadRunner 2. And now we’ve come up to the present with today’s launch of the RadRunner 3 Plus.The RadRunner 3 Plus carries the same basic performance specs as all the earlier models, namely a 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed and a range of 25-45 miles (40-70 km) on throttle or pedal assist. The company is working on a second battery option to boost the range to 100 miles (160 km), though more on that in a moment.While the flat land speed remains unchanged, the 750W motor has been reworked to offer improved hill climbing performance that should help riders summit local climbs 10% faster.The bike’s frame has also been revised to improve the handling and offer a longer bench seat for more cargo on back. That’s a key consideration for a bike rated to support up to 350 lb. (160 kg).Several other new components grace the bike, such as the brand’s updated battery that is now half-integrated into the frame. The 48V 14Ah design offers the same 672 Wh of capacity, but it’s a slicker-looking package now than on the former RadRunner Plus.Tektro hydraulic brakes bring the bike to a quick and controlled stop, and the levers even include adjustability so that smaller and larger hands can feel equally comfortable reaching for the levers.In fact, the bike has a wide rider height range as well. Anyone from 4’11” to 6’2″ (150-188 cm) should feel at home on the bike.For those that opt for pedal assist, there are five levels to choose from. For throttle-only riders, well they’ve got that too. But the RadRunner 3 Plus design makes it one of the few moped-style or utility-style e-bikes that is actually comfortable to pedal thanks to a real bike saddle featuring true adjustability.For those who want to pedal even further, a second battery that will slot in under the rack will help offer up to 100 miles (160 km) of range. However, it looks like that second battery isn’t quite ready for purchase yet. Hopefully Rad can get that option out soon, because it looks like a great add-on for delivery riders or anyone else who regularly travels long distances on their e-bike.The RadRunner 3 Plus is compatible with a pile of accessories including locking center console, upgraded passenger seat in back, hardshell locking panniers, a new RadTrailer for towing cargo behind the bike, and more. In fact, Rad says there are over 350 accessory combinations for the new e-bike, meaning you could have a pretty darn unique setup if you want to go nuts with the accessory options.It’s a major part of the design, as CEO of Rad Power Bikes Phil Molyneux explained:“Designed for work, play and everything in between, the latest additions to our lineup of e-bikes and accessories are as versatile as our riders. We know our e-bikes are an extension of our riders’ lifestyles, and we’re excited to see how each individual within our expansive Rad community customizes their ride to upgrade their lives and make everyday experiences, even errands, joyrides.”That new RadTrailer is particularly interesting, especially with the pet insert that gives you a stable setup to safely carry your four-legged friend with you.The RadRunner 3 Plus is already available for purchase online and in Rad’s brick-and-mortar stores around the US where prospective riders can test out the bike in person.The bike is priced at US $2,499 in the US. Canadians, Brits, and the rest of Europe can pick it up for CA $2,999, UK £$2,199, and EU €2,499.I’m a huge RadRunner fan. I own one of the first RadRunner’s to ever come off the line, and it’s a point of pride. This is truly the model that opened the door to utility e-bikes for so many people, especially at a time when e-bikes were largely considered either recreational or for purely commuter use. The RadRunner showed you could have a fun e-bike that offered big utility in a small package.The RadRunner Plus only made it better by adding suspension, gearing, and a slick colorway. And the RadRunner 3 Plus takes it even further with even nicer refinements.I own a Radrunner 2 and an Ariel Rider x52 step-through. Here in hilly Carlsbad, CA nobody in my family wants to ride the Radrunner down to Carlsbad Village because on the ride home, uphill, the best the Radrunner can manage is about 9mph. Whereas the x52 plows through the hills at 20mph!!! I'll be looking to sell my mint condition, low mileage Radrunner 2 this Spring and plan to replace it with an x52. Radrunner 3 10% faster hill climbing? So that's 10mph vs 9mph? Whoopdy do!But as much of a RadRunner fanboy as I am, this pricing is killing me. $2,500 is steep new territory for Rad, at least in the two-wheeler space. That’s especially true when you consider that the original RadRunner debuted at $1,299 – though that was admittedly in the before times.Sure, you definitely get a lot from Rad. The bikes are solid, and the company is always there to stand behind them – something you don’t get from cheaper fly-by-night companies that seem to spring up every month. Rad has a smattering of physical retail stores where you can test out their bikes. Rad even has the largest customer service team in the industry, and second place isn’t even close. So there’s more to the equation here. But wow, that $2,500 sticker shock hits me like a fully-laden RadRunner 3 Plus loaded up to its 350 lb. weight capacity.I’m sure the bike is awesome, and I look forward to testing one soon and letting you all know. Maybe once I try it, the $2.5K price will make sense. And speaking of trying it out, I’m also super stoked to try pulling that RadTrailer around. I really like the utility of a cargo platform trailer from Rad, and the pet insert sounds like a great idea. As someone without a car, back in 2014 I built a wood and chicken wire trailer to take my pup to the beach behind my e-bike, though it wasn’t anywhere as slick as Rad’s. Something tells me she would have preferred the upgrade.",ebikes
2023/02/23,"San Diego-based electric bicycle company Ride1Up has just unveiled yet another new e-bike this season. Unlike the heavyweight electric moped we saw last month, the new Ride1Up Turris is a much lighter touring e-bike that also happens to be lighter on the wallet.The Ride1Up Turris, which just launched at a comparatively reasonable $1,295, is ostensibly a touring bike. That means it falls somewhere between a light duty mountain bike and a city commuter. But what it really is depends on how you use, as the bike offers some serious versatility for such an inexpensive model.The Turris has front suspension and knobby mountain bike style tires, yet sports a nimble city ride and more upright bars for a slightly hybrid-like ride posture.It’s the best of both worlds, if you ask me. And having ridden one myself to prepare for this review, I’m pretty darn smitten with the new e-bike.You can see what I think of the Ride1Up Turris and watch me testing it out in my video review below. Keep on scrolling if you want to read even more details about the bike and my experience testing it out.The Ride1Up Turris combines the essence of multiple styles of bikes. When you first hop on, the touch points of the bike make it feel a bit more urban. The riser handlebars don’t scream off-road, they whisper cruising and comfort. The comfortable saddle, splash-reducing fenders, LED lighting, and even the spiral-wrapped cable management all belong in the urban category.But then that 100mm travel suspension fork and the knobby mountain bike tires lend the bike enough off-road cred to tackle some decent nature trails, gravel roads, or other off-the-beaten-path paths.So essentially, you’re getting two e-bikes in one. The Ride1Up Turris feels like an urban bike but rides more like a light-duty trail bike. And that’s exactly what you want in a touring bike. So here’s the thing: At $1,295, there’s no way the Turris can hold a candle to the many thousand-dollar bike shop touring e-bikes. It’s just not built the same way.I have no doubt that it will last for many years if you take care of it, but the components just aren’t top-shelf. The basic Shimano shifter is fine for leisure riding but isn’t a high-end piece of kit. Same goes for the derailleur. Good enough, but not great.The hydraulic disc brakes are actually quite decent, and help to bring the bike to a quick stop. That’s important for a class 3 e-bike that hit speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h), though my own testing saw me getting closer to a peak of 26 mph (42 km/h). If I had to choose, I’d go with the strategy that Ride1Up decided on: save a bit of money on the transmission and give us good brakes. Many people end up ignoring their shifters or only using the top few gears. But everyone stops – sometimes with more gusto than others. Good brakes are a necessity, and I’m glad to see that the Turris has some quality stoppers.The suspension is somewhere in the middle, good not great. I rode on plenty of rutted-out trails and it worked just fine, especially with the tires at lower pressure of around 25 PSI instead of the 35-40 PSI I usually run on the street.But this just isn’t a super rugged touring bike that I’d take on a trip across the US. Maybe across the state, but then I might want to bring a spare battery.That’s the other area where the company saved a few bucks to offer that amazing $1,295 price. The battery is a tad smaller than average e-bikes these days at 48V 12.8Ah. With just 614 Wh of capacity, it seems like a solid 20 miles (32 km/h) of range is achievable on throttle only, with pedal assist riding netting closer to 35-40 miles. You can stretch that pedal assist range to well over 50 miles if you keep it in the lowest power mode. But good luck resisting the temptation to pull more out of that 750W motor.Ride1Up has long been the king of affordable commuter e-bikes, and many of the company’s models have become the first e-bike for many riders. But now Ride1Up is branching out a bit into more off-road-ready riding with the Turris. And just like with the company’s commuter e-bikes, I think the Turris could become a great first e-bike for someone who wants a single bike that can live in both worlds. It’s a commuter during the week and a trail bike during the weekend!Compared to something like the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition, the Turris has some real advantages. The battery is larger and removable, the motor is more powerful and you even get a throttle. For first-time e-bike riders, those are all going to be big advantages.At $1,295, the bike offers features and performance far above its price class. Included equipment like fenders, LED lighting (at least a headlight) and even a kickstand are great to see as standard features. A rack might have been nice, but we can always add one if we really want it for commuter or urban use. All told, I’m very happy with what the Ride1Up Turris delivers for the price. The bike offers excellent bang for your buck. It won’t compete with fancier touring e-bikes, but it does the job for a much more affordable price, and comes from a company known for its good products and support. That’s what I like to see!",ebikes
2023/02/22,"A year and a half ago, we broke the news about a wild new drive system for electric bikes that lacked any mechanical connection between the pedals and wheels. The Free Drive system, created by a partnership between German companies Schaeffler and Heinzmann, is now finally entering production.The design essentially turns electric bikes into a different style of hybrid vehicle.In a sense, most electric bicycles are already hybrids, though they’re what is known as parallel hybrids. The electric drivetrain that is powered by a battery and the meat drivetrain that is powered by a sandwich can both independently operate the e-bike, either alone or simultaneously. The two drive systems thus work in parallel and aren’t necessarily connected.But a series hybrid like the Free Drive system from Schaeffler and Heinzmann is different. It lacks any physical mechanical connection between the pedals and the wheels. Instead, it places the electric and mechanical drivetrains in series, meaning the rider’s pedaling power is converted to electricity that flows through wires to power the motor and ultimately turn the wheels. You can’t use one without the other.To achieve this, an electric generator is mounted at the pedals. The rider turns the generator instead of a chainring, which converts that kinetic energy into electrical energy. That electricity flows to the motor and gets converted back into kinetic energy to power the bike. Any additional electricity that is generated above what is needed by the motor gets stored in the battery. The battery can also be charged via a wall outlet, which is the more likely scenario.While the Free Drive system has multiple uses, cargo bikes seem to be one of the main applications. Most cargo bike designs are limited by the need to create a long tunnel for a bicycle chain to reach the rear wheel or gearbox. But the Free Drive allows cargo bikes to be designed differently, lowering the floor or deck and creating a much more stable platform that isn’t constrained by the bike’s mechanical drivetrain requirements.And with electric cargo bikes increasingly filling important roles as replacements for delivery vehicles in cities around the world, making these e-bikes more efficient has major implications.A mechanical connection for the pedals is about 95% efficient in transmitting pedal power to the drive wheel. This wireless system is probably no more than 70 to 80% efficient. That’s quite a bit of power loss in the conversions from mechanical energy to electrical energy and back to mechanical energy.As Schaeffler AG CEO Automotive Technologies Matthias Zink explained:We need to rethink mobility for tomorrow’s cities. Electric cargo bikes fill an important gap here, particularly in last-mile goods delivery.Cargo e-bike manufacturers are already lining up to purchase the new system, which is expected to begin rolling out on new e-bikes later this year.I had a chance to test out an early prototype of the Free Drive in 2021 on a trip to Germany, and it was a wild ride. While it wasn’t quite as refined yet (apparently it has received significant design updates), it was still a fascinating feeling to pedal a motor instead of a chain or belt.You can take a look at my testing of the Free Drive in the Eurobike 2021 video below. Start at around the 36-second mark to see the Free Drive — though I think the whole video is worth a watch!",ebikes
2023/02/20,"Electric dirt jumpers are a niche within a niche of the larger electric bike market. But while the ONYX LZR Pro e-bike doesn’t have much competition on either side of it as one of the models in its class, the bike still manages to stand out for its impressive build quality and ability to take it to the streets and the trails.Now I’m not much of a jumper myself. I’ve seen the marketing images and videos from ONYX that show their team of pro riders flying across the sky on this e-bike and thought, “Well, there’s something I’ll never be able to do.”And I was right. This isn’t going to be a review where I learn to defy gravity with the best of them. I’m not setting you up for a path-to-discovery type of story here, where the real dirt jumper was inside of me the whole time.But what I did discover was just how much fun I can have on the trails and smaller jumps with a high-quality e-bike like the ONYX LZR Pro. I didn’t jump it off any loading docks or six-foot ramps, but I still had it nearly sideways on berms and slinging dirt in every direction. And if you’re a better rider than me, you could get some serious air time all day and night on this kind of bike without worrying that it won’t stand up to the abuse.You can take a look at my own in-depth testing with my video review below. And if you want to dive even deeper, then keep on reading for the rest of my written review afterward.First of all, you should know there are two different e-bikes in the LZR series. I tested the LZR Pro, which is the more powerful 900W version with the M600 Bafang mid-drive.There’s also a slightly tamer 500W mid-drive version with a bit less torque (95 Nm vs. 120 Nm). They’re both quite similar otherwise, but you all know me — I’m going to opt for more power whenever possible.Neither has a throttle, though, making these class 3 e-bikes in the purest form. That means that even though there’s good power here, you won’t be able to access it without some good old fashioned pedaling.The first thing you’ll notice about the LZR is the build quality. ONYX didn’t skimp on parts, and it starts right from the frame. They use something called Smooth Weld Additive Technology (SWAT), which somehow results in buttery smooth welds at the frame tube joints. I’ve seen beautiful frames before, and this one puts those other to shame.Even down by the dropouts in the rear, where many nicely made frames tend to still have less-than-desirable weld finishing, the LZR Pro’s frame is immaculate. Whoever welded this thing took pride in their work and it shows.The quality components continue around the bike. The bike uses BMX dirt jump hubs with true thru-axles instead of quick release skewers. The front is still a quick release to make it easy to pull out the wheel when necessary, but the thick thru-axles are designed to take the forces of repeated jumps and hard braking.All the routing of cables and hoses is internal, including for the Tektro HD-M285 hydraulic disc brakes.That front suspension fork offers 100mm of adjustable suspension with lockout for when you head back to the tarmac. And there’s even a beautiful wooden inlay for the battery meter and pedal assist power level display. It reminds me of the wood on ONYX’s electric mopeds, and it helps create continuity in the company’s model lines, despite the very different designs and use cases.Now as much as I love the way ONYX uses real wood in their products, the display on the ONYX LZR Pro is a bit simplistic because of that. You don’t get any speed readout with those five basics LEDs. Instead, you just get an approximate battery percentage with 20% increments and a 1-5 pedal assist level indicator. Does it work? Absolutely. Do I sometimes wish for more data? Also absolutely. I’m used to very detailed e-bike displays, and so moving to this simplistic display came with some adjustment period for me.But I also get it. This is a dirt jumper. It’s a bike that will inevitably fly through the air and come crashing back down to earth. The fewer bits and pieces bolted onto it, the better. There’s less to break that way.And that probably explains the lack of other parts like a derailleur, kickstand, LED lighting, or other added components that could become violently separated from the bike in a crash. You can add all of those (well, maybe except for the derailleur) if you wanted, but riders who use this bike for more extreme performance will likely accept that those parts are largely unnecessary. You’re not worried about being lit up for cars when you’re dropping in on a massive dirt ramp.Since some riders will likely still use this bike for more commuter-oriented roles though, adding your own LED lights is probably a good idea.I tested the ONYX LZR Pro electric bike in a wide range of use cases. I took it commuting in bike lanes. I explored nature trails through the woods. I wound my way through singletrack switchbacks. And I even did a small amount of dirt jumping, at least as far as my primitive jumping skills would let me.As a commuter bike, the fast and responsive pedal assist made it a great bike for taking the lane with cars or for slipping back into the bike lane when traffic got too heavy.The bars are a bit wide for navigating some of the tighter areas in a city, especially if you frequently lane split like me and wiggle through cars in grid-locked traffic. But for anyone who mostly sticks to bike lanes, they’d be just fine.The real fun starts when you head off-road. The powerful motor makes quick work of the trails. Most bikes can hold their own on relaxed nature trails, and the LZR Pro is no different. But it really shines when you get it on the more technical stuff. The winding singletrack that I was riding was perfect for showing off how nimble the bike could be, and the up-and-down rollercoaster nature of the trails really accentuated the benefit of a powerful mid-drive for quickly climbing up inclines to get to the next downhill section. The responsive pedal assist gave me a nice boost, even when I only had time for a couple quick pedal rotations between switchbacks.Since there is no hand throttle, I still felt like I was in the driver’s seat the entire time by providing my own pedaling. And I was still huffing and puffing a bit at the end of each trail, even though I had a powerful motor beneath me. I kept the pedal assist around level 2 out of 5 since the bendy trail made it hard to get going too fast. But on the straighter sections, I would bump the pedal assist up and really feel the wind in my face. And when back on the road, hitting pedal assist level 5 was a quick and easy way to get up to 28 mph (45 km/h) in a flash.I’m sorry to say that I didn’t personally hit the big six-foot jumps that I’ve seen other people do with the ONYX LZR Pro. I wish I had those skills, but sadly I’ve always been more of an urban rider than an Evel Knievel. But a bike like this with such high-quality construction certainly gave me the confidence to get out of my comfort zone and get more air between my tires and the ground than I would normally feel comfortable with. In case you’re wondering what it looks like when pro riders take to this thing, have a look at this.So here’s the rub. Most people are probably more like me, in that you can have some fun off-roading but you’re more likely to be found on the streets and sidewalks than on a takeoff ramp. In that case, the ONYX LZR Pro still works great as an urban bike. And we’ve seen plenty of stunt riding from ONYX’s pro rider team when they turn cities into bike parks and playgrounds. So we know it works just as well on the asphalt.But for us average joes, there are still a few drawbacks. The lack of fenders or racks limit the bike’s utility for true commuter use. The nonremovable battery means you’ve got to bring the bike inside your apartment (or garage, if you’re lucky to have one of those) for charging. And the single-speed setup means you’re stuck with a single gear ratio (44T chainring and 14T rear sprocket). And all of that makes sense for a bike that is primarily designed to launch.Even despite those drawbacks in the eyes of a more urban rider, the bike is so much fun as a dual-purpose runabout that I can look past those shortcomings. They exist not because the bike skimped in certain areas but because it’s specifically designed to be able to do more. And with the kind of build quality to make it rugged enough for that tougher riding that it’s designed for, it should last for years and years with normal city riding. At its current sale price of just $1,999 (or $1,799 for the 500W version), the ONYX LZR Pro feels like a solid deal to me. That price is more than fair when you consider the quality parts and attention to detail in the construction of the bike. This type of riding and this type of e-bike isn’t for everyone, that’s for sure. But for those looking for a bike that can handle this type of use, the ONYX LZR Pro is absolutely built to take it.",ebikes
2023/02/17,"Wisconsin-based bicycle maker Trek has just launched its latest two electric bikes, which are both designed as kid and cargo movers. The new Trek Fetch Plus 2 and Trek Fetch Plus 4 mark Trek’s deepest dive into the cargo e-bike segment yet. The two e-bikes carry distinct designs, with the Trek Fetch Plus 2 rolling out as a longtail cargo bike and the Trek Fetch Plus 4 taking on less common front loader cargo bike layout. Long tail cargo bikes have a stretched wheel base with extra space between the rider and rear wheel. Front loader cargo bikes, sometimes referred to by their Dutch name bakfiets, have a long platform or box in a stretched space between the rider and front wheel.Both categories are becoming increasingly common and we’ve seen dozens of examples from various companies in the past couple years. But this time it’s Trek that is hankering for a slice of the cargo e-bike pie as the company puts it’s own spin on the two popular e-bike categories.The Trek Fetch Plus 2 will use Bosch’s BES3 smart system with the company’s cargo-specific mid-drive motor lineup. Those motors are rated for a continuous 250W of power, though their 80 Nm torque rating betrays the true higher power of the drive system. The motors are usually limited to 20 mph (32 km/h) in the US, and the throttle-less design keeps them squarely in the Class 1 e-bike designation.The Fetch Plus 2 includes Bosch’s 500Wh battery that mounts in the downtube and is removable for charging. That battery is a bit below average capacity for e-bikes in the US, but should still offer plenty of range thanks to the efficient pedal-assist setup of the Bosch drive system. An optional range extender battery will be available for those that want to carry more than 500Wh of battery with them.The bike is rated for a combined operator-and-passenger payload capacity of 200 kg (440 lb). That puts it in competition with other heavy-hauling electric cargo bikes like the Tern GSD, though it carries a higher entry price.The Fetch Plus 2 will go on sale in April of this year with an MSRP of US $5,999.If you thought the Fetch Plus 2 was pricey, wait until you check out the $8,999 Fetch Plus 4.The bike uses a similar drivetrain but swaps in a 750 Wh battery. That higher capacity battery is better suited to the heavier Fetch Plus 4, especially considering the obvious kid-carrying front bucket will likely be occupied much of the time.That’s a big part of the draw, as Trek’s designer Eric Bybee explained:Kids were the center point of when we first started designing these. We realized that when a family is going out to buy one of these bikes, the kids have to be the focus.The Fetch Plus 4 includes a high-end transmission using a Gates Carbon Drive belt-drive system paired with an automatic shifting Enviolo hub in the rear wheel. That’s a fairly significant upgrade over the Fetch Plus 2’s 10-speed Shimano Deore transmission, though even that chain drive setup is nicer than we see on many other cargo e-bikes. Both models carry four-piston hydraulic disc brakes –  another nod towards their heavy weight ratings.While the Fetch Plus 2 looks similar to several other longtail cargo e-bikes we’ve tested before, the Fetch Plus 4 draws from a more European vibe seen in higher end cargo e-bikes like those from Urban Arrow, Riese and Müller, and others.",ebikes
2023/02/16,"Electric trikes are a quickly growing segment of the e-bike market in the US, largely thanks to recent high-profile launches of popular new models. But the AddMotor M-340 electric trike has been around for years as a staple of the fat tire e-trike segment. It recently received some nice upgrades, so we decided to put the newest version of the e-trike to the test.At a current sale price of $2,999, the AddMotor M-340 is positioned higher on the e-trike price spectrum. So does this fat tire three-wheeler have what it takes to command that price?Take a look at my in-depth testing of the trike, including both asphalt and off-road riding, in my video review below.Then don’t forget to keep reading for even more info on my experience testing out the trike!We’ve tested several electric trikes recently, so let’s start with what makes the AddMotor M-340 different.First of all, this is a fat tire trike. That means it comes with much wider tires than most e-bikes or e-trikes – four inches wide, to be exact.The front is a 24-inch wheel that provides better obstacle climbing than smaller wheels, while the rear uses 20-inch wheels that sacrifice some marginal ride quality in exchange for a lower rear end.To be honest, though, you don’t lose much ride quality with the smaller wheels since you’ve got a combination of fat tires with plenty of squishy air volume and also a front suspension fork to soak up the front bumps. In fact, this is one of the few e-trikes available in the US that actually comes with front suspension, marking another key differentiator.The next major difference is the much higher-spec electrical components and performance.For example, the battery is a massive 48V and 20Ah unit that offers way more capacity than you’ll probably ever need. They claim a range of 85 miles in the lowest pedal assist level, and I don’t doubt them. Pedal assist level 1 is super efficient, and that battery will probably last for weeks of leisurely riding in low-power mode, especially since most people just don’t get going too fast on trikes.Even if you want to use the throttle and make use of that wooden platform for your feet instead of actually pedaling, you’re still going to probably get a solid 50 miles of range at reasonable speeds.But for those that want to get a bit wild, there’s enough power here to do it. In fact, the motor is surprisingly torquey. They claim 80 Nm of torque, and I feel every one of those newton meters. On loose terrain like gravel, a twist of the wrist instantly sends rocks flying backward. It’s almost comical just how much power and torque this e-trike has. It’s totally unnecessary since most people aren’t getting a trike for its performance, but they went ahead and gave it to us anyway.Stability is the area where I’ll ding the AddMotor M-340 the most. Because of the larger wheels and generally taller design on the bike, the rider’s center of mass is higher. That makes the whole trike feel tippier than more stable trikes I’ve tried in the past.As long as I lean into turns, I don’t feel like I’ll tip at most speeds. But if I try to do tight circles, I can easily get the outer wheel in the air.I also felt a bit uneasy when riding on an incline since my taller center of gravity made me feel more like I would tip if riding sideways along a hill. That won’t be an issue on most roads — unless there’s some extreme crown to the road — but I did encounter it a few times when off-roading, so it’s something to keep in mind.The AddMotor M-340 has some downsides, but its upsides can’t be ignored. There’s so much power and range that it feels overbuilt, which could be a pro or a con depending on your needs.I like that it has not only a big front and rear basket but that it also comes with a zippered bag for the rear basket to keep your stuff from flying out. It’d keep things dry in a drizzle too, though I’m sure it’s not rated for a downpour.I also like that there are seven speeds to shift through since it lets you downshift to a lower gear for getting rolling or climbing a hill or upshift for when you’re going faster. But the derailleur hangs awfully low and just looks like it’s waiting to get damaged. I rode through lots of tall grass, and amazingly it was fine, but without a wheel next to it to protect it like most bikes, I do worry about its longevity.The three disc brakes are nice, but I would have loved to see hydraulic disc brakes on this model for a few reasons: They’d offer better stopping for a heavy bike designed for heavy loads; they’d have reduced maintenance which would be good for older riders that don’t want to be on their knees adjusting brake cables; and they’d help justify that nearly $3,000 price. I’m also surprised to see that AddMotor didn’t include a parking brake on the levers – one of the only advantages of mechanical disk brakes is that they’re better for implementing a parking brake.The trike is also heavy. I don’t know how heavy since AddMotor doesn’t have the weight listed, and I don’t have a bathroom scale large enough for it. But the shipping weight said 145 pounds (65 kilograms), and so I bet the trike is nearing triple digits itself. At least it does have a high-weight rating too, with a rider capacity of 350 pounds (160 kilograms) and another 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of cargo.So there are certainly trade-offs here. It’s more expensive than many other trikes, and it’s not as stable. That might make it less ideal for older folks that have affordability and stability at the top of their priorities list. But the bike is also high powered, has an ultralong range, can handle off-roading just fine with those big tires and suspension, and is comfortable to boot. It even comes in a half dozen fun colors!So while I can see many people passing up this trike for a more affordable option, the power lovers that have trails on their mind may prefer something with a bit more oomph, like the AddMotor M-340. I know I sure had fun on it!",ebikes
2023/02/14,"The Evelo Dash manages to stand out in an ever crowded segment of electric folding bikes. At Electrek, many of the folding electric bikes we’ve reviewed over the years blend together, but the Evelo Dash has such incredible features that it has unearthed an inherit problem I didn’t know existed.Some people are surprised that despite their appearance of being mission specific, folding electric bikes are often made for a variety of uses. City life, camping, and last-mile options are the most common cases, but within them different specialties begin to arise. The Gocycle, for example, is a totally custom design and weighs very little, shooting for a customer who wants high tech and easy transport. The Wallke H6, on the other hand, is selling a wild ride with inordinately heavy components for a down and dirty adventure. The Evelo Dash is a clean, refined electric folder that puts the money where it counts and saves on the rest. The ride is a bit stiff, but it’s balanced by the smooth pedaling achieved by Evelo’s masterful combination of drivetrain components.Evelo as a company stands out for having the best bikes to pedal on the market today. One look at their lineup of the Omega, Galaxy SLk, or Galaxy Lux will show that Evelo has put a lot of effort into how an electric bike can feel luxurious to pedal and retain the power and throttle demands that American buyers search for. That attention to the ride experience has been placed into the Dash model, albeit scaled down and streamlined for weight, cost, and complexity savings.The heart of the matter is the Gates Carbon CDX belt drive that replaces the chain. This single component improves the bike owning experience in more than just smoothness. A belt drive requires no maintenance with lubrication or constant replacement, which makes the bike travel very easily. Now it can be tossed into a trunk, closet, boat, etc. without the worry of grease or rust damaging the bike or the storage compartment it resides in.The smoothness of the belt drive is magnified by the torque based mid-drive motor that Evelo has custom programmed for this bike. I can’t stress enough how nice this combo is, and I find myself singing its praises in each Evelo review I write. There are many other electric bikes with great motors, such as Bosch, Yamaha, and Shimano. However, these motors are sold as 250w max and, more importantly, have expensive licensing with limited interface options and will absolutely not tolerate a throttle.The Evelo Dash has all of that: 350w power output, cheap price for the components, a wealth of connectivity, and throttle power at any speed. The Dash also sports 160mm dual piston hydraulic disc brakes, which are especially nice. These brakes have a nice bit of stopping power while keeping the size and weight at a reasonable level. They might be a bit overbuilt, but in terms of brakes, this is the side you’d want to err on.The Evelo Dash isn’t perfect, and I wouldn’t recommend it for all folding uses. The folding aspect is very normal for folders, and it’s a bit heavy, coming in just shy of 50 pounds with the battery.The single greatest drawback to the Dash is common for folding bikes: It rides stiff.The Dash has some but not a lot of air volume in the 20″ x 2.4″ tires. Combined with the solid seat post and down-to-business handlebars, the ride feels very harsh compared to the soft experience of pedaling. I think that’s the issue. I probably wouldn’t have noticed the bike has no suspension options, but the pedals feel so amazing that I subconsciously expect that from the road as well.I actually went out to ride a few other folding bikes to test my theory. Maybe it was confirmation bias, but it seemed to me that, indeed, folding bikes are still stiff. I simply gave them a pass these last years since I expected every folding bike to feel like speed-dating on folding chairs. The Dash had quietly dashed my low expectations with normal comfort on an otherwise incredible ride.The Evelo Dash is a sweet folding electric bike that makes me want to pedal just about everywhere. The practical features and amazing drivetrain make for a compelling bike to take on the road or keep handy for car-less days. The motor and battery combo aren’t the heavy powerhouse that others have, but since I want to pedal, I’m going to save more energy from the battery at a natural rate.I would recommend accessorizing the Dash with a thicker saddle, suspension seatpost, and comfort grips. Most of these are available from Evelo’s website.The Dash comes in at an MSRP of $3,199, although the company has periodic sales and open box specials when available.

2023/02/14,"When it comes to electric bikes, many automakers have started tossing their hats in the ring. But Porsche is one of the most aggressive so far at targeting the booming e-bike industry. The company’s latest announcement sees it rebranding Croatian e-bike company Greyp as Porsche eBike Performance.The move actually rolls together three e-bike companies under the Porsche label, with electric bicycle drivetrain maker Fazua and Porsche’s own in-house e-bike group all becoming one big presumably happy family.The saga started after Porsche created its own e-bikes a few years ago and began expanding into the electric two-wheeler space. Porsche was already expanding its stake in Croatian electric supercar maker Rimac, and in doing so also scooped up a portion of Rimac’s daughter company Greyp.Greyp’s high-performance electric bikes proved enticing to multiple companies that sought to acquire the e-bike maker, and so Porsche decided to buy the rest of Greyp, fully acquiring the electric bicycle company.Porsche then followed up by acquiring the electric bicycle drivetrain manufacturer Fazua early last year.All of Porsche’s e-bike endeavors are now being re-homed under one roof. As Greyp’s founder Mate Rimac explained, “the last step in that transformation is the name change to Porsche eBike Performance.”Porsche eBike Performance was technically founded last August, though the company’s scope seems to be expanding.At the time, Porsche founded two parallel e-bike companies. The first of the two new companies became Porsche eBike Performance GmbH and was said to focus largely on the development of electric bicycle components including motors, batteries, and drive software.Porsche eBike Performance GmbH was expected to draw heavily upon the technology developed by electric bicycle drive maker Fazua.The second venture was named P2 eBike GmbH, and it was announced that the new company would use the drive technology developed by Porsche eBike Performance GmbH to produce complete electric bicycles for consumers.Now it has been reported that the new business structure will include the German Porsche eBike Performance GmbH located in Ottobrunn, Germany, near Munich, and the Croatian Porsche eBike Performance Doo located in Sveta Nedelja, near Zagreb, Croatia.Greyp is expected to live on as a brand within Porsche eBike Performance, though it is not yet clear to what degree the Greyp name will remain.We’ve reached out to representatives for Greyp and will update if we hear back.It’s amazing how quickly automakers are now moving to snatch up a piece of the e-bike pie. Companies like Rivian, GM, Toyota, Polestar, Vinfast, BMW, and others are all tripping over each other while playing catch-up. Meanwhile, Porsche is rolling around with e-bike companies to spare.Porsche is certainly ready to throw some real money around and that excites me as I think about what these companies can do with the help of Porsche’s resources.That being said, I hope that companies like Greyp that had such strong company culture can still retain their character. I don’t want to be selfish here, but I was really enjoying the pairs of colorful Greyp socks that showed up in my mailbox each year at the holidays. That and riding those awesome e-bikes. Don’t ever change, Greyp!",ebikes
2023/02/13,"I call this e-bike “overpowered,” but I should really call it “amazingly-powered.” Yes, it’s got more power than nearly anyone really needs – but then again, so does most every performance vehicle out there, whether we’re talking about cars, motorcycles, boats, or any other type of recreational runabout.And so the Super Monarch AWD 1500 Dual Crown is perhaps the textbook definition of excess, but that’s exactly what makes it so much fun, and such a capable off-roader.Now before we go too far, let’s address the elephant in the room. With 1,500W of stated power — which is even less than the true 2,200W peak power — this e-bike easily falls outside of the 750W legal limit for on-road e-bikes in many areas.In fact, it possesses two 750W continuous-rated motors, which is what gives it such impressive power and performance. But while it may not fit within street-legal e-bike classes when fully unlocked (though it can be electronically limited to legal power and speed limits), using this e-bike on the streets is almost of a waste of its awesome abilities. The dual motors, dual batteries, and dual suspension are just screaming for off-road riding across surfaces you simply couldn’t cover with lower power and lesser performance e-bikes. So yes, you probably shouldn’t fly down the road at 30+ mph on this thing and think you won’t raise the eyebrow of a cop who hasn’t met his ticket quota this month. But when it comes to exploring the great outdoors on a silent, non-polluting two-wheeled adventure bike, the Super Monarch AWD 1500 Dual Crown is absolutely within its element. Check it all out in my video review below, or hang on and keep reading for my complete thoughts below.There’s so much going on here that we’ve got to stay organized in order to see it all. On the component side, we’ve got full-suspension with a motorcycle-style dual crown fork up front for extra rigidity and a RockShox Monarch RL rear shock; massive 4.25″ wide fat tires make the ride even plusher than what the suspension already offers.An included torque sensor pairs with a 10-speed Shimano Deore transmission, giving a higher quality pedal assist sensation and a more rugged derailleur – exactly what you need in an off-road e-bike designed for abuse on the trails.The four-piston hydraulic disc brakes aren’t just high-end calipers, but they’re also biting onto massive 203 mm disc rotors that are thicker than standard at 2.3 mm. That translates into higher performance braking, better heat dissipation, and more stable performance under repeated heavy braking. Basically, when you’re flying down a hill on a heavy e-bike like this, these are the kind of brakes you want.On the electric side of things, we’ve got a full color display with optional PIN code lockout for security. We’ve got controls for front, rear, or all-wheel-drive modes on the handlebars, and the bike even sees a return to my favorite style of throttle: the right-side half twist.Two batteries combine to offer a nearly unprecedented 1,820 Wh of battery. Again, when you’re flying around off-road and through loose terrain that is known to burn through battery capacity, you’ll be thankful to have a pair of large batteries at your disposal.And those motors are so torquey that you’ll be worried about traction before you’re worried about if you have enough power to get up a hill. There’s 170Nm of torque from those two motors combined, which is more than just about any other e-bike I’ve ever seen. Basically, there are several things this e-bike lacks: grace, subtlety, and the ability to elegantly lift it into a truck by yourself. But one thing it doesn’t lack is power. In fact, there are a bunch of weak little e-bikes running around out there because this thing took all the power for itself.I did plenty of on and off-road riding on the Super Monarch AWD 1500 Dual Crown e-bike, and it excels at bot; though I guess it’s more fair to say it excels at a certain type of riding in both environments. On the road, I have to treat it more like a motorcycle – especially when I can surpass 30 mph in unlocked mode. In that case I’m riding with traffic, and I’m keenly aware of those around me. I’m countersteering. I’m dressing the part. The whole nine yards.Off-road though is where the bike really comes alive. This isn’t just a bike for the trails – it’s for when the trails end and you just have raw wilderness ahead of you. With these wide tires, the all-wheel-drive and the massive torque, you can climb up and over rocks, downed branches, or just about any other obstacle.The suspension is fully adjustable in both the front and rear to dial it in the way you like it for your terrain and riding weight. And the components are up for the challenge, from the higher quality brakes to the nicer transmission.For those that want to pedal, the torque sensor is a great addition – especially on a heavy e-bike that might not normally feel quite so intuitive to pedal. Torque sensors make pedaling on an e-bike much more natural feeling since they use the strength of your pedal output to directly control the motor power. But then again, I can see many of the customers for a bike like this not being the type of riders who pedal very often, so I’m not sure how much the torque sensor will be used.I was glad to employ it though and I’d absolutely recommend that anyone who rides this bike make use of the pedals instead of purely riding like a motorcycle with the throttle. It’s fun to feel a powerful machine like this being controlled by your feet. It’s almost like a mech suit for your legs.Of course there are downsides – plenty of them! Buy a bottle of Advil now, since you’ll need it when you try to toss this thing in your truck by yourself and throw out your back. It may look like you can lift it, but that 95 pounds of bike feels a lot heavier at shoulder height than at waist height. You can take nearly 20 pounds off by removing the batteries, but still. It’s damn heavy.Next, it’s expensive too. That’s not to say you don’t get your money’s worth. You basically have two e-bikes worth of parts here, and good parts at that. But $5,095 is a big chunk of change any which way you slice it. This e-bike is essentially competing with off-road electric motorbikes at this point, and the price confirms it.Lastly, there are the legal downsides if you want to commute with this e-bike on a regular basis. Sure, it can be put in street legal mode, limiting the speed to 20 or 28 mph and the power to 750W. But whether that truly fulfills the letter of the law in each state may take some deeper consideration.On that note, though, consider this. Today you can go out and buy a 10,000 lb tank of an SUV or truck that could mow down a third grade class on a field trip without the driver even knowing it. That’s not only a perfectly legal vehicle – it’s actively being promoted throughout the industry and even at the highest ranks of the current administration. So I’m not going to tell you not to ride a 95 lb electric bike that is literally one horsepower over the legal power limit for e-bikes in the US, but I will tell you to ride responsibly, consider who and what is around you, and where you ride such a large and powerful e-bike.Basically, if you’ve got the cash and you’re into off-roading with extra power, you absolutely can’t go wrong here. The Super Monarch AWD 1500 Dual Crown brings a giddy smile to your face, no matter how much of a tough guy you are.It takes some getting used to — especially if you come from much smaller and tamer e-bikes — but it’s so worth it for this wild ride.You’ve got to pay to play when it comes to these types of speciality e-bikes, but what you get in return is a seriously good time.",ebikes
2023/02/11,"When we first reported that the Southern California-based electric bicycle and motorcycle company SONDORS was preparing for an IPO late last year, the company was expecting to hit a $10 per share price point in the $20M offering. But that number has since been revised to an estimate of $4-6 per share.And this isn’t the first time SONDORS has lowered their IPO price estimate. It was already lowered once from the original $10 figure to a new target of $6-8.The move comes as SONDORS could become the first electric bicycle company to go public in the US, though, of course, the company has become much more than just an e-bike maker at this point.First, there was the three-wheeled electric car concept unveiled years ago, though it has yet to really materialize.Then there was the two-year-long rollout of the Metacycle, a light electric motorcycle that is now being delivered in increasingly higher volumes after a rocky initial rollout.SONDORS’ own story has been a bit of a rollercoaster itself after the company burst onto the scene in 2015 with an unbelievably low-priced e-bike. The $500 electric bicycle shocked many in the industry. It’s ultimately successful delivery set the stage for what would become a SONDORS hallmark: big announcements that are dismissed by many as unlikely to succeed, only to usually be delivered – even if a day late and a dollar short of some of the loftier initial promises.SONDORS’ initial regulatory filing ahead of the company’s expected IPO has given us our best look yet at the EV company’s finances.It’s been a tough year or more for many electric bicycle companies that saw big sales booms during the pandemic, which then began to peter out in recent months.In SONDORS’ case, the company reported revenue of almost $17M in the first three quarters of 2022, but its high operating costs led to a net loss of over $4M during that period.The same period one year earlier saw $11.2M in revenue and a $1.78M net loss.SONDORS has invested heavily in development and production of its Metacycle electric motorcycle, with a significant number of pre-orders weighing down the company’s liability column. The company has also made several key hires in the past few months, including bringing in top leadership from companies like Tesla in a bid to course correct toward profitability. The upcoming IPO is seen as key to the company’s ability to maintain enough breathing room with the necessary cash to meet its current obligations and capitalize on the expanding rollout of its light electric motorcycle while continuing to produce its wide range of electric bicycle models.SONDORS may be in a tight spot here, looking for enough cash to keep its head floating comfortably above water.The increasing rate at which it is turning those pre-order liabilities into assets is surely helping, but we don’t have a more up-to-date view of the company’s financials than Q3 2022. Deliveries of the SONDORS Metacycle really picked up in Q4 2022, so that’s where we’d likely see major improvements, if they exist.That’s also where any changes from a new management team will likely begin to make an impact, so it’s hard to read too far into this yet without having a clearer picture of what’s going on behind the scenes.Suffice it to say, 2023 is likely a make-or-break year for SONDORS. Here’s hoping for the former!",ebikes
2023/02/10,"The new FW11 electric bike has a lot going for it. It’s fast. It’s a two-seater. But perhaps the most remarkable part is just how massive the battery is, offering more range than almost any other retail e-bike.The battery on most e-bikes is somewhere in the 500-700Wh range. Something along the lines of a 48V and 14Ah battery is quite standard these days. You’ll see them on everything from popular e-bikes to e-trikes.But the WildeWay FW11 folding e-bike more than doubles it with a 48V 32Ah battery. For those keeping score at home, that’s a 1,536 Wh battery. It’s also removable, though the 20 lb (9 kg) battery won’t be easy to lug around by hand very far.According to the company, that’s enough battery for a 60 mile (96 km) range on throttle only, and well over 100 miles (160 km) on pedal assist.Throttle-only ranges are usually calculated around the Class 2 top speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h), and that would be fitting for the FW11 as well. The only problem is that the FW11 doesn’t stop at just 20 mph; it can actually reach 30 mph (48 km/h) on both pedal assist and throttle. The bike can presumably be limited to lower speed limits (a common feature among fast electric bicycles), which would be the responsible thing to do for anyone anticipating riding this in bike lanes and around other cyclists or pedestrians.Even if you’re sticking to lower speed limits, the 750W continuous power rating of the motor and 1,000W peak power rating will surely help the bike accelerate quickly.Since the FW11 e-bike is outfitted with a rear seat and foot pegs for a second passenger, that massive battery will come in handy while carrying heavier loads.Most two-person e-bikes don’t come with twice the battery, though there are of course exceptions.The rear rack is only rated for 110 lb (50 kg) though, so perhaps consider it more of a small girlfriend/wife or kiddo seat. Still, it’s a pretty nice feature to see included. In fact, the bike itself is rounded out by some pretty nice features. There are hydraulic disc brakes, front suspension, suspension seat post, full LED light package, fenders, and a 7-speed Shimano transmission.The price is even quite fair, especially considering it basically has more than two standard e-bike batteries on it. At just $1,399, it is priced at less than many e-bikes with much more limited ranges.There are actually two models available. The FW11 is a step-over frame, while the FW11S is a step-through frame.Both are available either on Amazon or directly from WildeWay’s site.I don’t know much about WildeWay yet, though I’m looking to get my hands on one of these e-bikes to test it out for a complete review. We rarely see such long range e-bikes, so it’s an interesting addition to the market.For the vast majority of people, I think this much battery is overkill. But for delivery riders, couriers, and other folks who use their bike all day for work, this could be a great option to avoid swapping batteries in and out partway through the day.",ebikes
2023/02/09,"Lectric eBikes is know for two things – making affordable e-bikes and making a lot of them. The company’s main goal has been to look at the e-bike market, figure out what people want, and find a way to make it more affordable. They’v’e done it time and again with their other e-bikes and that’s exactly what they’ve done this time with the new Lectric XP Trike. The company invited me out to see the new e-trike at their headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. There I had the chance to hop aboard and get a sense of just what this $1,499 electric trike can do.And the answer, it turns out, is a lot. It can haul. It can climb. It can fold. It’s a three-wheeled Swiss Army knife with a ridiculous amount of torque and seating for one.I only spent a single day with the capable little trike, and so this isn’t a full review… yet. That’s still to come. But even with only a few hours in the saddle, I can already tell you that this is absolutely going to be a major hit… if they can keep it in stock.Check out how the Lectric XP Trike performed in my first ride video below. Then keep reading for the nitty gritty details.Let’s nail the specs right away, so we can quickly get to the ride. I’d say that the trike is almost like a three-wheeled version of the famous $999 Lectric XP 3.0 folding e-bike, albeit with hydraulic brakes, a bigger battery, and an extra wheel.The Lectric XP Trike has a 500W motor that puts out 1,092 peak watts of power. It’s mounted in a mid-drive setup as the trike’s jackshaft, giving it the ability to power both of the rear wheels via an open differential axle. It draws power from a 48V 14Ah battery with 672 Wh of capacity, which is enough for 60 miles (96 km) of range in the lowest power mode on pedal assist. But honestly, even on throttle at the trike’s top speed of 14 mph (22 km/h), you’ll probably still get a solid 30-40 miles (48-64 km).The bike rolls on 20″ x 2.6″ tires, has a single speed drivetrain, and rocks hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm discs. The brake levers each have a parking brake, which I’ve never seen before on hydraulic brakes. The 69.5 lb (31.5 kg) e-bike folds to fit in tight spaces, and that folding trick allows it to arrive in fully-assembled form. You don’t have to bolt anything together, you just unfold it and ride. That’s going to be a major benefit for many riders, especially older ones that don’t want to be bent over a box lifting a 70 pound bike around.Speaking of weight, it’s actually relatively lightweight for an electric trike. And the low step-through size makes it great for shorter riders down to 4’10” (147 cm). It’s apparently good for taller riders also, with a rating for folks up to 6’4″ (193 cm). I’m squarely in the middle of that range, so I can’t personally speak to the extremes, but it felt great to me in terms of sizing.It can also fit a wide range of rider weights thanks to its maximum capacity of 330 lb (150 kg). In addition to the rider payload, the rear rack can carry 75 lb (34 kg), while the front basket can carry 35 lb (16 kg). And as part of the launch, Lectric is including the cargo package consisting of the front and rear basket for free! Getting an entire trike plus the cargo package for just $1,499 is a hell of a deal.Here’s the crazy part: Despite being nice and gentle when you keep it in the lower power modes, there’s some significant torque in the higher power modes that is great for hill climbing.The Lectric team took me to a hill that looked like a small mountain, and I was able to ride the Lectric XP Trike right up the side of it. We even put a few dozen pounds of steel weight in the rear basket to give me a sense of what it’d be like if I was a heavier rider. The trike didn’t care – it just kept climbing like a machine.Coming back down the side of the mountain helped me appreciate those hydraulic disc brakes, especially when I remembered how much steel weight I had in the back.Moving to a park next, I did a combination of paved trail and off-road grass riding. The trike performed well at both. Tight donuts are even possible, though you have to be careful about going too tight. I could get the outer wheel to lift up in tight turns if I really tried, but it was something I had to make an effort to achieve. I never felt like I would tip in a normal turn.Is it as stable as the RadTrike? Not quite. That one feels like the king of stable trikes to me. And the Lectric XP Trike is a tad narrower in the back and has a bit higher center of gravity with taller wheels and a higher cargo rack in back. But it still feels plenty stable, and I’d be comfortable putting my parents on it – if that puts things into perspective.While there’s no suspension on the trike, you’re never really going fast enough to feel like it’s critical. Suspension is more important to me at higher speeds where I hit obstacles with more force and where I have less time to avoid them. At a maximum speed of 14 mph, you see things coming up in slow motion and can easily wiggle around them.As you can see in the video above, I even took the Lectric XP Trike over some seriously rugged terrain in a washed out dry riverbed. I was truly surprised how well it handled such rough off-road conditions.That being said, the three wheels takes some getting used to when avoiding obstacles. You have to learn how to put the pot holes or rocks between two of the three wheels or take a wide berth around them. It’s something that new trike riders will take a few days to get used to, but quickly becomes second nature.I think this Lectric Trike is an industry disruptor; at $1499, no other manufacturer is offering so many features on an e-trike. Either other manufacturers will lower the prices of their trikes, or Lectric is going to raise the price of its trikes soon after the first production run sells out. FWD trikes are simply not able to compete with the performance of RWD trikes. Rear differential & mass centralization of putting the motor & battery in the middles of all three wheels is key to stability of a trike. At its price, can probably resell it quick if the performance is not what's expected. I'm tempted to buy two of them just to have one trike per in-law so they won't fight to ride. Yes, tadpole recumbent trikes may be faster, more stable in corners, but not many elders have the flexibility to bend down near ground level and hoist themselves onto the low seating of a recumbent. Getting off a recumbent after a good ride? good luck with those tired legs/knees. It may not seem difficult for those who have the flexibility & strength to get in & out of a low seating recumbent, but for older folks that might as well be getting in & out of a DeLorean. Lectric has done their homework with this trike; I hope they keep the price low and sell a ton of these trikes. At just $1,499, this is a smoking hot deal, and it follows Lectric’s playbook of bringing popular e-bikes at affordable prices to the masses.How long will the bike last? I have no idea. I only spent a day with it. But the trike felt solid so far, and I also saw a room full of customer service representatives sitting in Lectric’s Phoenix headquarters waiting to help anyone should they have an issue in the future, which gives me good confidence on the customer support side.For the thousands of people aging into electric trike territory every day, I’m excited to see options like this hitting the market. And once I get even more time on the XP Trike than just a fun day in the sun, I’m sure I’ll like it even more.",ebikes
2023/02/08,"We’ve seen several Eunorau electric bikes around these parts, and I’ve tested my fair share of them. But the Eunorau Meta275 is probably the nicest pedaling one yet, thanks to its integrated torque sensor and commuter-ready design.I’ve talked a good amount recently about torque sensors, and that’s because they’re a pretty awesome piece of kit on electric bikes. If you actually like to pedal your e-bike (as opposed to just using the throttle), then a torque sensor makes the pedal assist feel much more natural and intuitive.To see what I mean, take a gander at my review video below. Then feel free to keep scrolling for my complete written review.If you’re wondering where the name comes from, Eunorau is a portmanteau of “Europe”, “North America”, and “Australia”, which seems to be the company’s main export markets. The 275 represents the 27.5″ tire size used by the bike. And I’m not sure why “Meta” is there, but I’m guessing it’s to shoehorn in one more 2020’s buzz word into the mix.So with those larger diameter wheels, hybrid-ish 2.6″ wide tires and general city design, you’ve probably guessed that this is a commuter bike. And it comes with the right commuter loadout, offering comfortable bars, weather protection fenders, and a rear rack for carrying panniers or other gear. The front and rear LED lights add to the commuter-ready design, making this an e-bike that you can ride to work and back even during those early winter nights.But even though this isn’t a comfort bike, it’s still surprisingly nice to ride. The saddle is a good compromise between efficient and still offering enough real estate to not feel like you’re sitting on a postage stamp. The bars are slightly raised and swept back to give you a more relaxed seating position, and the angle is adjustable so you can dial it in to fit you nicely. The front fork adds more shock absorption for when your streets don’t look like the pretty, manicured pavement in the movies.But the real comfort win here is the torque sensor.That torque sensor is a beauty because it means the moment you step on the pedals, you start getting motor assist. If you’re like me and you sometimes forget to downshift into low gear before coming to a stop, you’ll really like torque sensors. Getting rolling in high gear with a cheaper cadence sensor its a slog since you don’t have any motor assist for the first several feet until the sensor gets enough data to interpret your pedaling speed. But with a torque sensor, it feels the instant you stand on the pedal and starts providing you assistance to help out.It also helps give a more natural feeling ride since it won’t accelerate you to pre-defined “steps” of speed, like many cheap cadence sensor controllers do. The harder you pedal, the more motor power you’ll get and the faster you’ll go. It’s intuitive, just like riding a bike should be.We’re starting to see more e-bikes coming with torque sensors, but they’re still the exception rather than the rule at this price point.I was a bit surprised that Eunorau didn’t give us a bit higher performance with the Meta275. The 500W motor is fine for typical commutes and can handle modest hills, but it’s not exactly the most powerful motor I’ve ever tested. The 624 Wh battery is also fine, but again, not the largest, though Eunorau does offer a pretty cool option where you can add a second even larger battery to the downtube if you want to turn this into a super long range commuter.And the limited top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) means that the Class 2 bike is better suited for bike lanes than faster roads where you might want the Class 3 speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) to better keep up with car traffic.But for most commuters, I suspect that this is all going to be quite fine. As a bike lane commuter, the Eunorau Meta275 is pretty much a dream. It’s comfortable. It rides nicely. It has plenty of range in standard form but has the option for even more range with a second battery. And it even has some nice components on it like the hydraulic disc brakes, a thru-axle front hub for a more robust and longer lasting design, color screen, and a 9-speed transmission. For those of you that like to pedal, that 9-speed transmission and the torque sensor are a very nice combination.For the price of $1,799, I feel like you’re getting a very fair offer here. But when you use the coupon code ELECTREK to take 5%, the deal becomes even better.As far as purely commuter bikes go, I’d say Eunorau nailed the important points of a comfortable and efficient e-bike that feels as good to sit on as it does to pedal.",ebikes
2023/02/08,"Get ’em while they’re hot! Denver’s latest round of e-bike rebates proved that demand still far exceeds supply when it comes to the city’s electric bicycle subsidy program. The latest round of rebates, which was opened last week, was exhausted in just 20 minutes.Denverites flooded the city’s online portal to apply for an electric bike rebate, which offered to take $300 off the price of a new e-bike for all Denver residents. Income-qualified residents could receive an even higher rebate of $1,200.The total rebate amount is slightly lower than the rebates offered last year as part of Denver’s rebate program, but that didn’t stop city residents from snatching up the latest round of rebates.Additional rounds of rebates will be launched five more times this year on March 28, May 30, July 24, September 26, and November 28. Those wishing to grab one of the rebates on future rounds should camp out on the city’s online portal here.As popular as the rebates are, it was reported that 46% of the rebates granted last year went unused. That doesn’t mean that they were wasted, but rather that residents had 60 days to apply the rebate before the funds were automatically returned to the pool for future applicants. We’ve also learned more about the impact of those Denver e-bike rebates, with the city announcing that $4.77M in vouchers were provided, leading to the purchase of $9.34M in electric bikes. Around 2/3 of those vouchers went to income-qualified applicants.The city reported that the e-bikes purchased as part of the program were ridden 26 miles (42 km) per week on average, and replaced 3.4 car trips each week.Denver’s e-bike rebate program has become one of the most famous in the US, though it is far from the only electric bicycle incentive program. The state of Colorado will soon be playing catchup by launching its own e-bike incentive program.Vermont was the first in the US to launch a statewide e-bike incentive program, and we’re now seeing other states such as New York and Oregon proposing legislation to create their own statewide e-bike subsidy programs.California has already allocated over $10M for a statewide e-bike subsidy, though it hasn’t rolled out yet. The California e-bike incentive is expected to begin later this year.The e-bike industry has seen a bit of a roller coaster ride on pricing over the last several months, though many companies have found themselves in an overstock situation leading to relatively lower prices than usual this time of year.Favorable pricing combined with increasingly widespread e-bike incentive programs have both helped fuel the rising wave of e-bike adoption in the US, which had already received a massive jump start over the last few years during the pandemic.If you’re looking for some of the best electric bikes in the market at every price range, check out our compilation.

2023/02/06,"The Lectric XP Trike, which was unveiled with quite a fanfare last month, has now launched for pre-orders at a surprisingly affordable price. The electric trike claims to be the first folding, fully-assembled electric trike in the industry, and it looks set to shake things up for all types of riders.The Lectric XP Trike, which is priced at just $1,499, is built on a similar base as the company’s best-selling Lectric XP series of e-bikes.It offers a powerful motor, folding design and an approachable price. But in this case, the XP Trike gains a third wheel, a differential rear axle, hydraulic disc brakes and a super-accessible design.As the company described the new three-wheeler:“The XP Trike accommodates a wide range of abilities and preferences with our lowest standover height ever of just 13.8 inches. As the industry’s first fully foldable and fully assembled electric tricycle, The XP Trike includes the award-winning features our XP series e-bikes demonstrate, plus a bigger battery, hydraulic brakes, and a third wheel. A sturdy rear hub motor setup with a differential axle provides a whopping 65NM of torque – accommodating even the heftiest of payloads without a problem.”And they weren’t kidding about hefty loads, as the trike comes with a 415 lb (188 kg) payload rating for rider and cargo. That includes up to 330 lb (150 kg) riders, as well as a max rating of 75 lb (34 kg) on the rear rack and 35 lb (16 kg) on the front basket.The bike even includes the front and rear baskets as part of a free cargo bundle, though it’s listed as “while supplies last.” The cargo package seems to be part of a launch promotion, so if you’re on the fence but really like the free front and rear cargo baskets, then you may want to consider pulling the trigger on this one before that option is gone.The XP Trike itself weighs 69.5 lbs with the 48V 14Ah battery, though unlocking and removing the battery can probably get the trike down to around 60 lbs even. That battery is probably larger than most riders will even need, offering around 60 miles (96 km) of range on pedal assist, and probably at least 40 miles (65 km) on throttle-only riding considering the lower top speed of the trike.The top speed of 14 mph (22.5 km) is obtainable under throttle or pedal assist, though only in the highest speed setting (level 5). Lower speed levels can keep the trike from getting away from new riders while they get re-accustomed to being back on a bike (or trike).The single-speed drivetrain means there is no shifter to deal with, though it also precludes having a lower gear to shift into on hills. But with two-wheel drive from a 500W motor that peaks at an actual 1,092W and puts out 65 Nm of torque, hills won’t be a problem. And I’m not just saying that – I recently visited the company in Phoenix to test out the first XP Trike on a massive hill up the side of a small mountain. It was tough to walk up the road, which wasn’t even a public road, but rather sort of an access road to an antenna at the top of the mountain (I’m not sure public roads are allowed to be this steep). Even so, the XP Trike pulled me up just fine. I was blown away by how much torque it had, even when we added a pile of steel weights into the rear basket to drag up the hill with me. In fact, the road was so steep that I was thankful Lectric outfitted the trike with hydraulic disc brakes so I could make a confident descent. It’s also great to see the the XP Trike has a parking brake, in case you ever need to park on a hill.Despite that impressive power, keeping the pedal assist in lower speed levels made the power gentle and manageable on startups so that it didn’t feel overwhelming.I’ll have a complete first ride experience coming soon. But if you don’t mind spoilers, know that I’ll definitely be recommending this trike to those who are looking for an accessible three-wheeler that won’t break the bank. At just $1,499, this is a seriously good deal.I'm getting one for my in-laws (in their 80's), likely they will never get 15 mph on their rides, but just having a trike with electric assist allows them to get out and try different things.It's been tough to get the older folks outdoors since COVID, they've got their indoor equipment to keep active, but just getting outdoors makes a difference.  Electric tricycles have become a growing category in the e-bike world and even a hot new battleground after Lectric eBikes followed Rad Power Bikes’ launch of the RadTrike with their own Lectric XP Trike announcement.Other companies are also getting into the trike game, though these are definitely the two major players at the moment.Having ridden both, I can say that the RadTrike felt a bit more stable with an extra wide rear end, though both were more than comfortable in turns and I had to go out of my way to try to get them up on two wheels. With Rad offering what is likely a more elegant ground up design and Lectric coming in with arguably more features (including that key fully-assembled delivery), both e-trikes have strong selling propositions.I’m definitely excited about the future of electric trikes. Companies like these are pushing the industry forward, and that’s good for everyone. ",ebikes
2023/02/04,"We’ve received hints from Rivian over the past year that the electric truck and SUV maker is bike-curious. But now Rivian’s CEO RJ Scaringe has confirmed in a staff meeting that electric bicycle development is a go.Scaringe announced the expansion into e-bikes on Friday during a companywide meeting, according to Bloomberg.The move tracks with Scaringe’s previous interest in electric bikes, especially considering that the company previously filed to expand its trademark to cover electric bicycles.The company also poached some high-level e-bike designers from major brands like Specialized, bulking up its electric bike design team ahead of what many of us assumed was an inevitable e-bike project.In fact, Scaringe confirmed during the meeting that an e-bike isn’t just in the plans but that the first model is already actively being developed in-house.Believe it or not, electric bikes actually outsell electric cars and trucks by a wide margin, in large part thanks to their lower production cost and, thus, much lower purchase prices.And so it would make sense for the electric truck and SUV maker to explore developing a Rivian e-bike, joining other companies like Porsche, which has expanded into electric bikes.The move comes at a rocky time for Rivian, which was recently hit with a wave of layoffs amid serious cost concerns. Rivian recently announced that the company would lay off 6% of its workforce due to issues cutting costs amid its production ramp. That has resulted in the company selling its electric vehicles at a major loss.Rivian has seen success ramping up production of its R1T and R1S electric vehicles over the last year, though the company still hasn’t been able to reduce its costs.In contrast, electric bicycles are highly cost-effective as they are much easier to both develop and produce.E-bikes also have much lower regulatory hurdles, further reducing costs and decreasing the development period. That could help Rivian reach the market faster with lower overhead and a much higher volume product to complement its larger electric vehicles.Many urban residents are also joining a growing cause working against larger vehicles, especially in cities. Massive electric trucks and SUVs like those made by Rivian have been the target of growing opposition online and in grassroots efforts. Smaller and more efficient vehicles like e-bikes are being promoted in many areas as safer alternatives that don’t endanger city residents or take up large amounts of public space.They need to develop production capacity for their current vehicles instead.I’m all for this.I think we’ll look back in many years and see how hard Tesla whiffed it by not entering the electric-bike space. It was their game to lose, especially as more and more auto companies began seeing the writing on the wall and got some skin in the e-bike game.Rivian stands to pick up the slack left by Tesla, bringing major EV automotive design and manufacturing chops to tackle a simple and easy problem: designing and producing a quality electric bicycle.I wish them the best of luck, and I’ll be the first one to put down a reservation on a Rivian e-bike.",ebikes
2023/02/03,"Electric bicycle maker Magicycle has just unveiled its newest model, which is the most premium e-bike yet in the company’s lineup. The full-suspension Magicycle Deer also claims to be an “SUV e-bike,” though that term seems to get thrown around a lot lately.We’ve seen plenty of “SUV e-bikes” before, with some companies applying the term more towards crossover and touring-style e-bikes, while Magicycle seems to lump it into the full-suspension fat tire category.Whatever you want to call it, the Magicycle Deer is a lot of e-bike. It’s 92.3 pounds (41.9 kg) of e-bike, to be exact. Moving that massive bike around is the job of a rear hub motor offering 750W of continuous power and 1,110W of peak power. The motor is rated for 96 Nm of torque, which is quite high for a hub motor.And since that’s a lot of power to demand from an e-bike battery, Magicycle made sure to outfit the bike with plenty of capacity. The removable battery hidden in the bike’s downtube is a 52V and 20Ah pack with 1,040Wh of capacity. The company says that will be good enough for up to 80 miles (130 km) of range in low power pedal assist mode. The throttle range isn’t listed, but you can bet it’s less than 80 miles.When using higher power pedal assist, the Magicycle Deer can reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). Riders who use the half twist throttle to engage the motor without any pedaling will only be able to reach speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h).Bringing the bike back down from those speeds is the job of a pair of hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm rotors.Unlike most full-suspension e-bikes, the Magicycle Deer includes both a complete fender set and a rear rack. That should help it better perform dual roles as both an adventure bike and a commuter bike. The adventure rider in the lifestyle shots seems to have ditched his fenders and rack when he hit the dirt, but they do come as standard equipment.With a max weight rating of 400 lbs (181 kg), the bike also has plenty of extra cargo capacity to load down that rear rack, even with a heavy rider on board.A full color screen is included on the handlebars along with a 7-speed shifter. The bike uses a cadence sensor instead of a nicer torque sensor to engage its pedal assist, but the 7-speed transmission should still help make it a nice hill climber for those that like drop down into lower gear and help the bike up hills. Though with over 90Nm of torque and 1.1 kW of peak power, it sounds like the Magicycle Deer shouldn’t need very much help on the hills.The e-bike is available in both a step-through and a step-over design and comes in three color options: Neon Green, Dawn Yellow and Space Gray. The model carries an MSRP of US $2,699, though comes with a launch promotion of $300 off when using the coupon code NA300. We’ve seen Magicycle e-bikes before and the company has a reputation for being a mid-tier budget brand. They haven’t done anything especially innovative in the past, but they also haven’t had their bikes break in half, so I guess that puts Magicycle in the middle of the pack?One thing that gives me a bit of pause is that despite the bike officially launching today, there are already nearly a hundred glowing customer reviews on the sales page going back almost a month. Hmmmmm.",ebikes
2023/02/02,"The SWFT BMX electric bike doesn’t try to be all flashy with extra features or gizmos. All it does is combine a simple but effective e-bike setup with the versatile and time-tested BMX bike design. And in doing so, it creates something simple yet effective: a low-cost e-bike that you can toss around for fun yet still use for a commute to school or work.It’s definitely not going to be for everyone, but I’m still excited about a fairly authentic return to BMX bikes in the e-bike space, at least in terms of appearance. Bar spins are still not recommended.The SWFT BMX is priced at $999 on the company’s site, but it’s going for just $735 on Best Buy’s site, making that a seriously good deal.Want to see just what you’re getting for that low price? Check out my video review to watch the e-bike in action, then keep reading for the full specs and all of my other thoughts on this small format e-bike.Ok, so let’s start by managing expectations. This isn’t a real BMX bike, in that it isn’t really designed to hit big jumps or anything. And all of those wires and cables coming from the brakes, throttle and display aren’t going to appreciate any bar spins (though I did find you can get a single rotation if you’re very careful – something that many BMX riders aren’t known for being).So it’s more of a BMX-style electric bike, but that still lends it some cool features.The small size keeps it fairly lightweight at under 40 lbs and the small 20″ tires mean it won’t take up much space in your garage, bike room, closet, trunk, or wherever you stash your bike.The single-speed drivetrain is either a pro or a con depending on whether you favor simplicity or pedalability. For those that are used to single-speed BMX bikes, though, it will feel like par for the course.A set of solid axles make it possible to mount the included foot pegs both front and rear, which means you can get your tricks on or carry a friend standing on back. The bike has a 265 lb (120 kg) weight limit, though, so make sure it’s one of your smaller friends.Much like most BMX e-bikes that only have a rear brake, the SWFT BMX comes with a single rear stopper. But they do turn it into a disc brake, unlike most rim brake-enabled BMX bikes out there.Another departure from other BMX bikes is the built-in lighting, with a single front headlight built right into the head tube. It runs off the main battery so you’ll never need to worry about a head light when you’re riding home at night – at least as long as your main battery still has charge.The 350W continuous-rated rear hub motor isn’t a powerhouse, so don’t expect to burn rubber on this thing. But even though it takes you a bit longer to get up to speed, you’ll get all the way up to nearly 20 mph (32 km/h). I found that I was usually a mile and hour or so short of that 20 mph top speed, but it also depends on how charged your battery is. Near the end of the charge, you won’t have as much power to hit those higher speeds.And it’s not a particularly large battery either, at just 270 Wh. In fact, it’s downright small. The advantage is that it’s built right into the bike’s downtube so you don’t have to worry about anyone stealing it, unless they steal the whole bike. The disadvantage is that it would be harder to replace at its end of life in a few years, and you can’t pull it out for charging – you have to take the bike to an outlet or bring an extension cord. There’s also an annoying little switch under the battery where the downtube meets the bottom bracket. I generally just leave it on, but you can turn off the battery from that switch by bending around and blindly feeling for it between the pedals. If you won’t be using the bike for a few days, it’s probably a good idea to turn that off.The rest of the actual controls are found on the SWFT BMX display mounted on the handlebars. There you’ve got the usual suspects of pedal assist adjustments, LED light activation and a readout for your important info like speed and battery charge level.To me, this feels like a nice around-the-town type of e-bike. It’s not going to be as good of a commuter as a true urban e-bike. It’s not going to climb hills like a mid-drive with a multi-speed drivetrain, and it won’t eat up the trails like a fat tire e-bike. But it’s going to be able to do a bit of all of those things, if you don’t mind compromising somewhat.And it will do it for a song since the bike is so affordably priced.I would have loved to see a rack and fender set offered as accessories, especially since there are already mounting points for a rear rack. Since there aren’t any fenders, I don’t think of this as a prime commuter e-bike. But with that throttle and pedal assist always at the ready, it gets the commuter job done on dry days. And of course the fenders and rack would admittedly ruin the BMX look.I probably wouldn’t recommend this for anyone in a super hilly city since the single-speed and lower power motor won’t perform as well as they did for me in my flat city. But I can see it cruising up and down the coast all day, hopping curbs along the way.",ebikes
2023/02/01,"Rad Power Bikes has announced that the RadWagon 4 electric cargo bike is once again available for sale. Orders for the model have opened again on the company’s site after it became unavailable following a November 2022 recall.The major recall affected nearly 30,000 RadWagon 4 electric bicycles. In fact, the recall gave a rare chance for insight into the number of RadWagons e-bikes sold by the company.The RadWagon 4 is widely considered to be the most popular cargo e-bike sold in the US, but thousands of riders were notified late last year that they should stop riding their RadWagon 4 due to a tire issue.As explained in the recall notice from the CPSC, two issues affected the e-bike’s wheels. First, a misaligned rim strip could lead to an inner tube puncture. Secondly, the ribbed sidewall of the tire was also said to occasionally lead to an inner tube puncture. Both cases could result in loss of control of the e-bike if either occurred while traveling at high speed.Rad Power Bikes began sending out replacement part kits to affected owners, which included new tires, tubes, rim strips, and a free top tube bag; now, the company has re-listed the popular e-bike as available for sale on its website.With the RadWagon 4 now available again for order, Rad is estimating shipments to begin in the Spring. According to the company, “We’re excited to be able to offer the ultimate cargo carrier for sale again, with orders placed today estimated to ship by mid-March.”The e-bike has proven popular among families that use it for child transport as well as for those that do utility style trips such as grocery shopping.It’s also become a popular base for modifications, including a solar-powered kid-and-cargo-carrier we covered last year.I’ve tested the e-bike myself and even taken both of my nephews on the back. The cargo e-bike feels longer than a typical e-bike and can take some getting used to for riders that aren’t accustomed to long tail cargo bikes, but its heavy-hauling capabilities are unmatched by most traditional e-bikes on the market today.The RadWagon 4 includes a 750W rear hub motor and a 672 Wh battery, offering a range of between 25-45 miles (40-72 km).The e-bike tops out at 20 mph (32 km/h) with both a hand throttle and pedal assist support, making it a Class 2 e-bike in the US.It is currently priced at $1,999, putting in the mid-range of prices. While we’ve seen other cargo e-bikes undercut the price, it is significantly more affordable than the pricier European cargo e-bikes we often cover.To see the e-bike in action, check out my review video above.",ebikes
2023/01/31,"You might have missed it, but automatic e-bikes are here, and they are amazing. Although the days of selecting your gears on bicycles may never leave us, we are now at the point where shifting is optional. Today we have two otherwise identical bikes with only one major difference: automatic vs. mechanical gears. How do they fare side by side?Specs (Galaxy SL and Galaxy Lux)Evelo has been making electric bikes specialized for the North American market for 10 years and, during that time, has implemented a variety of drive and motor systems across their lineup. Many other electric bikes are rebranded bikes from the Chinese or European market, and that suits a great deal of needs too. But Evelo is one of few companies that has a history of crafting electric bikes for the needs of North American riders. After all this time, Evelo is also ahead of the pack with extra support services, such as a four-year warranty, optional assembly, open box sales, and fast shipping. It’s nice to see the bike company growing with the industry, as that’s unfortunately uncommon.Evelo isn’t the first electric bike company to make use of an automatic transmission, but they are likely the first to do so with a 500w motor and full throttle availability. Many other higher-end bicycles are specced in Europe, where motor wattage and throttle laws are quite limiting. As much as I love a well-built, efficient e-bike from Germany, for a comfort commuter, I’d prefer more electric power.The Galaxy SL and Galaxy Lux both land squarely in the middle of comfort and commuting. Aside from the drive system, the two bikes are identical. The frame, pedals, saddle, rack, and cockpit all work together to give a comforting, inviting stance while riding. The wheels, tires, and brakes provide great control, air volume, and stopping power, respectively. All of the angles, lines, and parts were specially selected, and it really shows in the finished product. Although the list of differences is quite short, it makes a big impact on how the bikes behave (and cost).The Galaxy SL is the cheaper model, but cheaper is a relative term. Truly, the Galaxy SL is a comfortable, smooth bike in its own right. So far, many of the specs we’ve listed are held on bikes with higher caliber, and the SL model continues that with the drive. Instead of a rear derailleur hanging off the back of the bike, the SL model features an internal hub with a continuous variation. This means that instead of clicking into a set number of gears, the rider can twist the grip to change the gearing within a wide range. All the gearing occurs inside the rear hub, and it’s quite amazing. The SL model is also carrying a smaller battery: 36v 13Ah. This battery has a fair amount of range but lacks the punch of a higher-voltage bike battery.Although Evelo does occasional sales, the MSRP for the Galaxy SL is $3,199.The Galaxy Lux uses a fully automatic transmission with a belt interface and a battery pack with more power at the ready. The 48v 11.6Ah battery has the guts to power up almost any hill, even under full throttle mode. The real cost difference is in the automatic drive. The user can connect the rear hub to a phone app (yep, even bike parts have apps now) and then select the desired cadence (or RPMs), and the bike will do the rest. Whether starting, stopping, rolling down a hill, or climbing up, the transmission changes on its own to fit the preset number of pedal rotations. It works, and it’s great. Also, the Lux model replaces the chain drive with a belt drive, which improves upon the smoothness, longevity, and durability.Likewise, under periodic sales, the Galaxy Lux has an MSRP of $4,399.We’ve spent enough time talking about the bikes and how they work, but who are they made for? Not me, in particular, but for my mother, I would absolutely say yes. If you have a cycling background, then you’d be fine with the Galaxy SL. If you’re already in the habit of shifting, then you’d likely appreciate having total control of the mechanical hub. With that experience, your legs might be just fine putting some skin in the game, and the smaller battery power may be just fine for you.I would recommend the Galaxy Lux for someone who is getting back into cycling after decades of a prolonged break from riding. For many returning riders, having automatic shifting may be a necessity, and that’s OK. The advancements in technology allow more people to bikes who otherwise wouldn’t. And this is exactly what we all hoped would happen. Finally, there is a bike that can be set for size and pedal preference, and it’s done. If you want to ride with 10-year-old legs again, never worried about gears or numbers, the Lux is the bike for you.Get $100 off the order of an Evelo with this code: REF-4Q1DYKZ39397O5.",ebikes
2023/01/29,"Automakers have seen the writing on the wall for the car industry, as millions of new e-bike riders opt for lighter and more efficient vehicles. Now Toyota has become the latest in a long line of automakers dipping their toes into the electric bicycle market.Like many other automakers who have rolled out e-bikes in the past few months and years, Toyota isn’t doing it alone.Instead, the Japanese automaker is partnering with an existing e-bike maker as part of a licensing agreement.The e-bike manufacturer DOUZE Cycles has partnered with Toyota in France to create the DOUZE Cycles x La mobilité Toyota cargo e-bike, based on the existing DOUZE Hêta model.The front-loading cargo e-bike can carry up to 100 kg (220 lb.) of payload on its forward cargo platform.The e-bike is powered by a Yamaha mid-drive motor and features a 500 Wh battery rated for 100 km (62 miles) of range on pedal assist.For those that carry more precious cargo, an optional passenger bucket is available to fit three kids strapped-in up front.In a statement that makes it hard to ignore Toyota’s long-standing anti-EV stance, chairman and CEO of Toyota France Frank Marotte explained that the new e-bike partnership follows in Toyota’s sustainability roadmap that started with its early investment in hybrid vehicles:25 years ago, Toyota opened the hybrid road with the first generation of Prius, thus showing the way to decarbonization. The hybrid, of which Toyota has now become the world leader, is now at the heart of the multi-technology strategy of the brand which makes it possible to meet the specific mobility needs of each consumer. Soft and local mobility is one of these needs. It is therefore quite naturally, on the basis of a common vision, that we entered into this partnership with DOUZE Cycles, a key French player in the cargo bike market. Because of Toyota’s history in France, it seemed extremely important to us that our partner have a production site on national territory.Toyota has famously eschewed fully electric vehicles, instead investing heavily in hybrid vehicles that maintain a dependency on fossil fuels.After years of opposing fully electric cars, and after replacing the company’s anti-EV CEO, Toyota may be warming up to EVs — or at least two-wheeled electric vehicles.It seems that Toyota isn’t focusing its e-bike efforts on just France, but has also made headway in the US. A Denver Toyota dealership, seen below, has been spotted carrying Aventon’s electric bicycles. The move is likely intended to take advantage of local e-bike incentives in the city.Several automotive manufacturers have also jumped on the electric bicycle bandwagon in the last few years, chasing the rapidly expanding market and the low barrier to entry for lightweight two-wheeled electric vehicles.Peugot has developed its own diverse line of e-bikes, and Spain’s SEAT previously teamed up with Barcelona-based Silence to brand its own seated and standing electric scooters.GM developed an electric bicycle in-house, though the e-bike was unceremoniously killed off early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, GM recently showed off a HUMMER e-bike that was produced through a licensing agreement to complement the colossal and abominable HUMMER EV.ŠKODA rolled out one of the weirdest electric bike/scooter concepts we’ve seen, though there’s no indication that it is headed for production.Jeep has gotten into the high-power e-bike game via licensing agreements, though its similar attempt to co-develop an electric scooter was significantly less impressive.Rivian, the electric truck and SUV maker, recently expanded its trademark to cover electric bicycles. The company has also hired top talent in the electric bicycle industry, making a move toward e-bikes even more likely.VinFast, a Vietnamese-based electric maker, also recently showed off four interesting new e-bike models.Swedish electric car maker Polestar has announced that it will develop its own electric bicycles.Even motorcycle manufacturers like Harley-Davidson, Ducati, and BMW Motorrad have gotten into electric bicycles and scooters, though Harley’s results and those from Ducati have been much more impressive than BMW’s.",ebikes
2023/01/26,"The CEO of Rad Power Bikes, the leading electric bicycle company in North America, just sent out a mass email committing to changes that it says will strengthen the company’s focus on safety, reliability, and customer service.“A new era of innovation.” That’s what was emblazoned across the top of the email that landed in my inbox, along with presumably hundreds of thousands of other inboxes across Rad Power Bike’s vast rider base.The email from Rad Power Bikes’ new CEO Phil Molyneux explained that Rad was entering a “new era.” It began with an explanation of how he was brought on board by Rad’s founder and previous CEO, Mike Radenbaugh.Molyneux, who came to Rad after leadership positions at Sony and Dyson, took the wheel at a time when Rad was already navigating several different storms. The company’s e-cargo bike known as the RadWagon – which was likely the most popular long tail cargo e-bike in North America – was recalled due to an issue with its wheels. The company is also in the midst of multiple lawsuits ranging from a battery fire to a tragic underage riding death.Molyneux addressed the company’s hardships:“Since its inception, Rad Power Bikes has set both the pace and the standard for the ebike revolution. This road hasn’t always been easy and we’ve faced numerous challenges.As a young company, we recognize that we have made mistakes. Now we are dedicated to learning from them.The culmination of these efforts represents the ‘New Rad,’ one that combines the forward-thinking innovation of our early years with the knowledge and resources to make us more customer-focused than ever before.”The first area addressed by Molyneux was related to product safety and reliability, to which Rad will be applying a “laser focus.”As Molyneux continued:“From the design phase, through component validation methods, to the ever-improving quality assurance activities within our factories, we are doubling down to ensure safer, more enjoyable rides.”Next on the list was a doubling down on customer service to ensure shorter wait times and more effective assistance for riders.We acknowledge that there is still room for growth in our customer support operations and are actively working to improve them. For those who need to connect with a Rad specialist, we are continuing to explore ways we can provide more immediate help, including a new chat function that we launched in December. In addition, we will be revamping our online help center to make it easier for you to find the self-help resources you need to keep riding. As we implement these remedies throughout the year, we hope that you’ll notice the difference the next time you reach out to us for assistance.That one is even more interesting consider the massive size of the Rad Power Bikes customer service team. The company employed several hundred customer service representatives before recent layoff rounds, though that number is still likely in the triple digits.To put that into perspective, Rad’s customer service team alone is likely larger than all of the employees at the next largest North American e-bike company.Rad’s position at the top of the North American e-bike market was hard fought, resulting in e-bikes from Rad finding their way into over half a million homes and counting. Despite the hardships that the company is currently facing, Molyneux has made it clear that Rad intends to do what it takes to maintain its standing and shore up the faith that its customers have long put in the company.The end of 2022 definitely saw stormier seas than Rad had hoped for. The company is still the largest e-bike manufacturer in North America and has continued to roll out new models throughout the year. But between the one-off legal issues and getting bogged down with having to recall thousands of e-bikes while finding a technical solution to get them back on the road has surely prevented Rad from delivering the kind of experience they’ve set out to provide.In my opinion, Rad always stood for two things: Building affordably priced e-bikes that got quality vehicles into riders hands, and advocacy for e-biking as an alternative to car use, and I haven’t seen that change in any major way. Sure, we’ve heard of issues of part reliability stacking up recently, and that’s something that Rad certainly has to address. But the company has by and large been known for good products with effective US-based service, especially in comparison to the many flight-by-night Asian e-bike companies whose bikes tend to breakdown in a matter of months and who don’t have anyone available to pickup a phone when riders need support for those bikes. I'm glad to see them addressing some of their past missteps. I've personally had a great Rad experience, with over 5,000 miles on my Rad City. I've had to contact customer support one time and they were prompt and helpful. But I've seen a lot of frustration from others in their subreddit related to their customer service.I was disappointed when they changed to a proprietary tire size on the Rad Wagon, and it scared me away from away from buying one. Seeing everything that happened with the wagon tire issues and recall confirmed that I made the right choice there. I would have been very upset if I had found myself reliant on a wagon for transportation with limited options to replace my defective tires.In comparison, I’ve beaten the hell out of my 26-month-old RadMission e-bike and it’s still riding great, though of course anecdotal evidence is merely evidence of an anecdote.Sure, Rad is no longer the most affordable option on the block now that many other companies with leaner operations and lower-cost e-bike alternatives have popped up in recent months and years, but the prices are still quite competitive.Rad has also often led the industry in new designs over the years. After the RadRunner e-bike came out, we saw plenty of RadRunner imitations. After the RadTrike came out, we quickly saw trike competitors. It’s pretty obvious that Rad still leads the industry, not just in bike volume but also in bike direction. (And it’s probably worth pointing out that RadRunner imitations from competitors have been literally breaking in half, while Rad’s bikes have been going strong for years).If Rad can double down now on the areas that need improvement to in order to maintain those key areas of strength for the company, then I don’t see any reason they can’t maintain their status as something of a city on a hill in the e-bike world.",ebikes
2023/01/25,"Newport Beach, California-based Electric Bike Company has just announced a big upgrade option to two of its slick cruiser e-bike models. The Model A and Model X now both come with the option for a torque sensor for their pedal assist operation.If you’re not familiar with a torque sensor or how it effects e-bikes, prepare to have your mind blown.Most value-oriented electric bikes (i.e., in the sub-$2,000-ish category) use what is known as a cadence sensor to activate pedal assist. The cadence sensor is a less refined component that basically measures how fast the user is spinning the pedals and uses that to apply pedal assist power from the electric motor. The result is effective at starting up the motor when the user pedals, but it has a several limitations. There is an inherent lag while the sensors waits to measure pedal speed, meaning it can take a second or two for the motor to kick in. Cadence sensors also have less resolution, meaning they aren’t as precise at measuring pedal input. And they have a fundamental disadvantage of only measuring pedaling speed, which is often doesn’t correlate directly to pedaling effort (e.g., hills, heavy loads, changing gears, etc).A torque sensor, on the other hand, measures how hard a rider pushes on the pedals. It allows nearly instantaneous feedback and offers a much more precise way to apply an exact amount of power based on how hard the rider is working. The harder the rider is attempting to pedal, the more motor power can be applied. That helps it intuitively read a user’s input and makes it feel more like the motor is just an extension of the rider’s own muscles, rather than a delayed on/off switch for the motor.Granted, e-bike controller engineers have come a long way with cadence-based pedal assist sensor programming, and we’ve seen big improvements over the years that has improved cadence sensor performance. But there is simply no comparison to a true torque-based sensor for natural feeling pedal assist. Normally e-bikes with torque sensors cost significantly more than cadence sensor-based e-bikes, but Electric Bike Company has now announced a torque sensor option on its Model A and Model X e-bikes for just $99.Both are electric cruiser bikes, with the Model A standing for “Affordable.” Starting at just $1,499, the Model A offers a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), though it ships in Class 2 mode with a 20 mph (32 km/h) limit. A 50-mile (80 km) maximum range is possible with pedal assist on a single charge of the bike’s battery, which comes with a five-year warranty. The frame and motor have a longer 10-year warranty.Hydraulic disc brakes, a rear rack, LED lighting, and a color LCD screen are all included as standard equipment. All of the company’s bikes uses stainless steel hardware for superior rust resistance — something that has proven important for a beach town-based company that builds bikes often used along the salt-spraying coasts.All of Electric Bike Company’s e-bikes are hand-assembled at the company’s multiple facilities in the heart of Newport Beach, California. We’ve had the chance to visit and watch those e-bikes being built starting from bare frames and on through the steps of wheel building, painting, component assembly, battery pack assembly, testing, and shipment. In fact, the company recently expanded its paint shop and offers the most customizable e-bikes in the country — and probably the world — with thousands upon thousands of custom color combinations across all of the components. They even offer their own custom painted helmets now to match their bikes, complete with included front and rear LED lighting built right into the helmet.You can see how the company builds its own e-bikes in my video below.",ebikes
2023/01/25,"Only a couple years ago, electric bicycle manufacturers couldn’t keep e-bikes on the shelves as they were being snatched up faster than they could be produced. But while some e-bike companies have managed to keep up a steady cash flow and balanced operations, others have run into financial difficulties. For European e-bike maker VanMoof, those difficulties turned into a dire situation just a few months ago.As reported by Dutch media company Financieele Dagblad, VanMoof nearly ran out of money to pay its bills late last year.The company has since managed to raise sufficient funding from its original British and Chinese investors to make it out of the woods, but there were surely some sleepless nights for the management team at the end of 2022.VanMoof’s annual report, filed at the end of last year, described the company’s immediate need to raise capital. Without a quick injection of funds, the company could not guarantee its “ability to continue its activities beyond the first quarter of 2023.”The report revealed that VanMoof had asked its suppliers to defer payment until after additional capital had been raised. That’s a move that other large bike companies including Giant have been forced to make recently, according to Cycling Industry News.VanMoof’s electric bicycles fall into an interesting niche among European e-bikes. The e-bikes, which range from around €2,500 to €3,000 in Europe, rely on more affordable hub motor drivetrains and thus undercut the higher-cost European e-bikes made by companies like Urban Arrow, Riese & Müller, Gazelle, and others.Those lower prices along with sleek design and strong branding have helped VanMoof scoop up higher sales volumes.But VanMoof maintains a massive workforce, reaching as many as 900 employees at one point. The company also operates brand stores in several countries across North America, Europe, and Asia. Despite reporting tens of millions of euros in revenue each year, maintaining that large employee base and broad geographic footprint of brick-and-mortar stores hasn’t been cheap. Fortunately for VanMoof fans though, the company’s most recent 11th hour cash infusion from its existing investor base seems to have helped VanMoof return to steady footing for now.Such economic hardships haven’t only affected e-bike companies like VanMoof. Other light EV companies have found themselves in similarly precarious financial standing. We recently reported on Oregon-based Arcimoto suspending production and laying off a large number of employees while it seeks to quickly raise enough funding to continue operations.In that case, Arcimoto has been hampered by its much higher cost of production for highway-legal motorcycle-class electric three-wheelers that have so far failed to achieve the demand required to meet Arcimoto’s large-scale production goals.I can’t fathom how VanMoof can sustain such a large workforce. Companies like Rad Power Bikes sell considerably more e-bikes than VanMoof, and even Rad had to undergo several rounds of layoffs in the last year or so. I imagine VanMoof’s payroll must be a huge part of its burn rate, especially since you can’t put off paying employees the way you can with suppliers of brakes and pedals. And of course those e-bike hunters don’t work for free.I’m glad to hear that the company found the money it needs to go on though, especially since I’m still waiting for them to get around to producing that VanMoof V concept e-bike that is supposed to reach 31 mph (50 km/h). No one can let VanMoof die until I get to ride that slick-looking thing.",ebikes
2023/01/24,"If you thought fat tires were already wide enough, then think again. Himiway’s newest fat tires are still packing a little holiday weight, and the company is not ashamed. Now it’s showing it off on its latest electric bikes.Himiway has used typical 26.0″ x 4.0″ tires on its e-bikes for quite some time, opting for one of the most common fat tire sizes in the electric fat bike industry.But the company has just announced that it is loosening up one belt notch to outfit its e-bikes with an updated 4.5″ tire. The tires come with more than just an extra half-inch of rubber width. They also have an entirely new tread pattern.The new tires are Himiway-badged Kenda tires, specifically the Kenda 26 × 4.5 K1277. This model replaces the previous 4-inch Kenda fat tires that used a knobbier design with a new wider and more multi-surface tread. The stud-style tread blocks of the old tires are replaced by a flatter tread pattern that still offers significant grooves but provides more rubber surface in contact with the ground.The company explained that “the 4.0″ Kenda model comes with moderately sized knobs and moderate spacing that can’t offer the desired highly secured grip in extremely mucky and loose terrain. On the other hand, the new 4.5″ Kenda model has proven to offer the best service for extreme performance for an extensive and versatile range of riding styles and conditions.”We’ve seen e-bikes with 4.5″ fat tires before, but they generally use that more pin/stud-style tread that is idea for traction in grass and dirt, as opposed to this hybrid-style tread for multi-surface riding.The new 4.5″ fat tires will grace many of Himiway’s e-bike models including the Himiway Cobra Pro, Big Dog, Escape Pro, and Zebra.I had the chance to review the Himiway Big Dog late last year, and you can check out that video below. Just try and imagine it with an extra half inch of rubber.I’ll be honest, seven or eight years ago when fat-tire e-bikes were first becoming popular, I thought it was silly. Those ridiculously large tires just looked dumb to me, and I couldn’t imagine why anyone would want to reduce their range with all that extra rubber or make the bike that much harder to pedal with a dead battery.And then I started riding fat-tire e-bikes, and I instantly understood. It was just more fun to ride off-road. The massive tires with low air pressure allowed me to hit obstacles that I would previously have taken great lengths to avoid. They weren’t as nimble at mountain bike tires, but that didn’t matter for the type of recreational riding that most leisure riders do. And if you keep an eye on your battery consumption, you’re never stuck having to pedal those big tires back home.In this case I’m not sure there’s a vast difference between 4.0″ and 4.5″ fat tires, but it certainly does add even more credence to the idea of floating over obstacles. The bigger difference here — and what interests me more — is that pseudo-urban tread pattern. Since so many people are using fat tire e-bikes for city and suburban riding, I’m betting this tread will feel better on streets than the typical pinny-style knobby fat tires that come on many electric fat bikes. Conversely, I wonder how well it will work for slippery terrain like snow, mud, or sand.But there’s only one way to find out, and that’s to try them myself. Himiway, if you’re listening, let’s put these big ol’ fatties to the test, shall we? ",ebikes
2023/01/23,"As much fun as e-bikes are for getting around the city, I love taking them off-road and onto trails. That’s where fat tires really come alive, and the Denago Fat Tire Step-Thru electric bike showcases just what I love about e-bikes with big honkin’ tires.This definitely isn’t a mountain bike or overlanding bike – this is a comfortable bike that can handle both light trails and urban/suburban riding. That means it’s going to be a great option for nature trails, gravel paths, dirt roads, and that sort of riding.Between a powerful motor, large capacity battery and a comfortable setup, the Denago Fat Tire Step-Thru has a nice assortment of features and components for recreational riding on a wide range of terrains.Check out my video review below if you want to see my real world testing of the bike. Then keep scrolling for my complete review.If you’ve been into e-bikes for a while or have begun digging into the topic ahead of buying your first e-bike, you’ll know that suspension and fat tires are two of the best things you can do for comfort. While the Denago here doesn’t have full-suspension, it almost feels like it does thanks to front suspension and plush fat tires. The lack of rear suspension is only noticeable on big obstacles and angry pot holes.For the gravel roads and light trails that I spent most of my time riding on, the bike had plenty of shock absorption for me. It also had plenty of power, combining a 750W motor with a top speed of 28 mph on pedal assist. Checking with a GPS speedometer showed that the 28 mph was often reading a big high by around one or two miles per hour, but it was pretty darn close. Optimistic speedometers are pretty common in the e-bike industry, unfortunately.The 750W motor is quite torquey and will get you rolling quickly as well as climb a decent hill, though the bike’s heavy weight of 79 lbs (36 kg) certainly works against it when it comes to acceleration and hills. The included torque sensor should help mitigate that weight on startup by better translating your pedal force into responsive pedal assist, though I found that it strangely still had a decent pedal assist lag. Torque sensors normally help e-bikes start applying pedal assist power nearly immediately when the rider begins pedaling, but the Denago still had a bit of a lag. It was nothing that a short blip of the throttle couldn’t compensate for, but it still surprised me, and not in a good way.What did surprise me in a good way was the range. With a big battery measuring 921 Wh, I could get a real world throttle range of over 35 miles (56 km), which is quite good for heavy fat tire e-bikes. With pedal assist in a low power level, I’d expect that to be over 60 miles (100 km) of range, though I couldn’t be bothered to keep it in low power mode for that long to find out. Higher power pedal assist and riding fast is just too tempting to pass up.For any fast e-bike like this, I absolutely want to see strong brakes as an important safety feature. Fortunately, Denago delivers with hydraulic stoppers on large 180 mm discs. This is a huge win for me because there’s nothing worse than struggling to stop a heavy e-bike. Powerful brakes make the bike more controllable and give riders more confidence.To afford those nice brakes, the company must have saved a few dollars on the drivetrain. You get a 7-speed shifter, but it’s not a particularly nice one. The Shimano Tourney setup is on the lower end of Shimano’s hierarchy but is acceptable for the type of leisure and recreational riding that most people will use this e-bike for, which is exactly how I was riding it.To make up for the fairly basic transmission, we get some really nice integrated tail lights. In fact, this bike must either be built in the same factory as Aventon’s e-bikes, or else Denago just ripped off their tail light design, because these awesome tail lights look and feel just like the ones that debuted on the Aventon Aventure last year and and have since found their way onto most of Aventon’s other e-bikes.Regardless of where they came from, I’m a huge fan of frame-integrated lighting because it is harder to damage. E-bike lights that stick out are prime targets for damage at bike racks or anywhere else that bikes come into close contact with other bikes or objects. These frame integrated lights are slim and tucked away yet still quite visible to cars and other road users.In fact, this would have been a prime opportunity to incorporate turn signals since the tail lights are actually spread apart. I’ve talked before about how I find most e-bike turn signals to be gimmicky since they are usually only a couple inches apart on a main central tail light. But with two independent lights on either side of the bike’s rear triangle, this could have been a great turn signal setup. Oh well, maybe on the next version.Even so, there’s still a lot to like here. We’ve got a comfortable trail bike with a nice and accessible step-through frame design. We’ve got plenty of power and even more battery capacity than I know what to do with. There are nice components like those brakes and even a color LCD screen, and there are even two different sizes to better fit larger and smaller riders.The Denago Fat Tire Step-Thru e-bike may have a few cheaper parts and carry some extra poundage, but it wears the weight well by not feeling too bulky while riding (just be careful lifting it by yourself!).At the MSRP of $1,999, I’m not entirely blown away. It’s not a bad price when you compare it to other full-featured bikes. It’s only a hundred bucks more than the Aventon Aventure.2, and comes with 33% more battery.  Update: They actually dropped the price by $200 to $1,799. Now we’re talking!There are certainly better bang-for-your-buck deals out there. People often point to budget rides like the Lectric XP 3.0, and I’d agree that you get a lot with those types of e-bikes, but they don’t have the range or big-wheel comfort to match this ride. So if you want a large, comfortable bike that comes with lots of power and battery, you’ve got to pay for those luxuries. ",ebikes
2023/01/21,"California is set to join a number of other cities and states in the US by offering rebates and tax credits for electric bicycles. California’s Electric Bicycle Incentives Project has been over a year in the making, and we recently saw new updates to the planned rebates.The updates come after an end-of-the-year meeting of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss the parameters of the Electric Bicycle Incentives Project.According to the California Bicycle Coalition, which shared a follow-up after the meeting, members of the discussion included representatives from the e-bike industry, bicycle shop owners, nonprofits who work with potential voucher recipients, bicycle coalition leaders, and members of the public interested in the program.The program’s details were still being finalized at the end of the year, but the meeting helped shed more light on the aspects of the program that have already been decided.One of the new updates is additional funding for the program.$10M had already been earmarked for the program, but we’ve now learned that an additional $3M in funding will be added to the total, likely to help with program outreach. That would allow more of the initial $10M to go directly toward the e-bike rebates themselves.CARB also confirmed that the income limit to qualify for the e-bike voucher will be lowered. We previously reported that in order to qualify for the voucher, participants’ household income would have to be below 400% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), which amounts to $51,000 for a single person and $106,000 for a family of four at current figures.Now we’ve learned that the income limit would be lowered to 300% of FPL to align the eligibility requirements for the e-bike program with those of other CARB clean vehicle programs. That would amount to approximately $38,000 for a single person or $79,500 for a family of four.The program originally listed only Class 1 and Class 2 electric bikes (those that are limited to 20 mph) as qualifying for rebates. But due to overwhelming support for allowing Class 3 e-bike models (that can reach 28 mph with pedal assist) to be eligible for incentives, CARB will include all three classes of e-bikes in the program. However, manufacturers will have to apply for their models to be eligible for purchase with the vouchers. The California Bicycle Coalition reports that those manufacturers will also have to provide a two-year warranty on their e-bikes, likely in a nod to concerns about maintenance. That could prove to be an issue since many of the largest electric bicycle manufacturers in the US only offer one-year warranties on the entire e-bike, though many offer longer warranties on the frame or motor. Some companies have started to offer even longer warranties of five years or more, though this is still not common in the industry.We have not learned of any changes to the proposed value of the e-bike rebates, which were previously expected to be set at $750 for a standard electric bicycle and $1,500 for a cargo electric bicycle.Because the program’s details still have not been finalized and more public discussions are expected to be held, all of the above figures could still change before the program reaches implementation. There is also still no firm date for when the program will begin, though it is expected to become active this year.We’ll keep our ear to the ground on this important e-bike rebate program and be sure to update as soon as we have more information on the Electric Bicycle Incentives Project.Until then, let’s hear what you think of the current tentative details for the program. Sound off in the comment section below!via: Streetsblog",ebikes
2023/01/21,"It’s not everyday that the odd little EVs I find for the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week are so cool that I’m tempted to buy them myself. But this week it’s going to be hard to pass up on this three-seater electric pedicab that you can own for a song!Alright, so let’s dive in here. This is what we’re looking at: an electric trike with a pivoting front end that mounts a bench-style seat for two adults (or probably three kids squished shoulder to shoulder).This 85 kg (187 lb.) electric rickshaw is the open-aired pedal minivan you’ve been looking for. Or maybe you haven’t been looking for it, but it found you anyway. Just look at the luck on you, my friend!The electric pedicab comes with comfy cushions for the bench seat and backrest, diamond plate flooring, and even a set of wooden arm rests to keep your fares comfortable.For the driver we’ve got a padded full-width handlebar and a six-speed transmission. Steering is accomplished by turning the whole front end of the e-trike, which is a dead simple way to offer the stability of a tadpole trike (two front wheels instead of two rear wheels) without the complexity of steering knuckles and articulating front wheels.And of course the entire thing is electric, meaning you won’t have to pedal the 200 kg (440 lb.) payload capacity under your own strength, or at least not entirely by yourself.Now I’ll be the first to say that the electric kit on this pedicab leaves a lot to be desired. It’s a simple 250W Dapu e-bike motor and controller. That means it’s not going to get rolling very quickly, and so it’s a good thing you’ve got a six-speed transmission that allows you to drop into low gear to help get things moving.The bike includes a 36V 13Ah battery, which again, is not particularly large. But since this pedicab likely maxes out at around 25 km/h (15 mph), it’s not like you’re going to be burning up that much energy doing low-speed riding.The company claims the e-rickshaw can handle a 35º hill, but that’s probably a fib taller than these handlebars. You’d have trouble walking up a 35º incline, let alone powering a heavy e-bike up one.But we’ll let that slide since the bike seems to come with some pretty nice features. It even has hydraulic disc brakes plus a pair of storage compartments behind the seat! What’s not to like here?You can see the major features in the video below. My favorite part is the tranquil music and the subtle narration.But my favorite part of all of this is probably the price. The non-electric version of the pedidcab is priced at an amazingly affordable $685. If you want the electric pedicab, that’ll be a slightly higher but still more than reasonable $980. And now you’re probably thinking that “sure, it’s cheap, but shipping is going to be the killer here.” And you’re right, sort of. I inquired about door-to-door shipping and the vendor told me that it’d cost over $1,000 to the US. So next I had the vendor check on LCL (less than container load) shipping to Miami port, which turned out to be a cool $280. Ka-ching!If you’re on the West Coast then it’s probably going to be even cheaper, since you’ve got one less Panama Canal to navigate.From there you’d still have other add-on charges, such as import duties, arrival duties, broker fees, and the responsibility of picking it up at port or trucking it yourself to your final destination. But you could probably be home free for less than $2,000 if you play your cards right. Is it going to be as nice as a $2,500 e-trike? No way. But can it carry more and give you a better story of how you got it to the US? Definitely.And the best part is that this is all a write-off, since you’re definitely going to be starting a pedicab company with this thing, right?! I mean, why wouldn’t you? Charge $5 a ride and you’re just a mere 400 fares away from paying this bad boy off. Realistically speaking, even if you’re not planning on bringing in 20 of these and becoming the next pedicab tycoon of your local beach town, this could still make a fun family vehicle. It’d be perfect for more than just Sunday rides with the kids. You could even use it for carpool duty during the week to drop those rug rats off at school or make a little cargo net for the front to turn the bench into a big trunk for grocery shopping.When you own your own electric trike, the world is your oyster!Now I just have to decide if I’m really going to get one of these. I don’t need it, but then again I didn’t need an electric boat or mini e-truck either, and I don’t regret those!",ebikes
2023/01/20,"It’s not that we haven’t seen our fair share of some weirdly named e-bikes before, but there’s something confusing about an electric bike named after an engine. I know that technically motors and engines can be the same thing, but it still feels weird to associate engines with e-bikes in American English. I’ll give Engwe a pass on the confusing and barely pronounceable name for the Engwe Engine Pro electric bike for the sole reason that it’s actually quite a good deal when you consider the performance to dollar ratio here.Check out my real-world testing in my video review below. Or keep scrolling if you prefer to read… nerds.Right away we have to address the elephant in the room, which is the e-bike itself. It’s as heavy as an elephant.This thing is over 80 pounds of aluminum, steel, copper, magnets, rubber, and lithium. That’s a lot of bike to pick up.Yes, it folds into a nice and compact bundle of metal, but it’s still a deadlift to get it off the ground. Like most e-bikes, though, the fairly low battery and the wheel-mounted motor help keep the weight low, and thus you don’t notice how heavy it is while you’re riding.Once you get past the weight, though, things really start looking up. With 1,000W of peak power, the Engwe Engine Pro is ready to blast off as soon as you blip that left-side thumb throttle. The pedal assist is there to support you as well, though I generally give a little throttle on starts even when I plan on using pedal assist since there’s a bit of lag from when you start pedaling and when the power kicks in.For comfort, Engwe gives us front and rear suspension, plus a set of 4-inch fat tires. I love the 20×4 tire size because it’s a good compromise between wide tires for comfort and all-terrain riding. Larger 26×4 tires roll a bit nicer and give a better ride over obstacles, but they are just so massive and heavy that they can sometimes feel unwieldy. The smaller diameter 20″ wheel size is a nice middle-ground, in my opinion.For that suspension, the front fork is nicer than the rear shock. The fork is hydraulic and works pretty well for our recreational type of riding. The rear shock isn’t terrible, it’s just not too fancy. But combined with the front suspension and the fat tires, I don’t think anyone can complain about lack of comfort built into this design.I did a mix of street of trail riding on the Engwe Engine Pro and found that the bike works well in both worlds. It’s not very efficient at either with those fat tires, but the big 758 Wh battery makes up for the lack of efficiency by simply shoving more battery cells in there. There’s two ways to solve the range problem and Engwe chose the “more battery” method.As usual, the company follows the typical route of giving us some pie-in-the-sky range that no one will likely achieve in real life. In this case, they label the bike with a 62 mile (100 km) range. And as usual, that’s probably technically true if you’re sticking to the lowest power pedal assist mode. But don’t be fooled into thinking that you’ll get 62 miles of range on every ride. If you’re like me and want to cruise at a solid 20-25 mph and blast around on throttle or in high power pedal assist levels, then you’ll get considerably less. The company says that at full power you may get around 22 miles (35 km) of range, which feels realistic to me based on my experience.But the real kicker here is the price. For $1,449 you’re getting a lot of mileage. Not in terms of miles, but in terms of stuff. And the $1,369 price on Amazon is even more of a killer deal (or even just $1,299 if you clip the $70 coupon on the Amazon sales page)!You get 1,000W of peak power, full suspension, hydraulic disc brakes (though on measly 160 mm rotors), a big ol’ rear rack, included fenders, LED lights, and a color display. The list just keeps on going!There’s some serious value here, at least in terms of bang for your buck on the bike itself. I have no idea how well Engwe’s customer service and support stacks up against the more traditional US-based e-bikes companies. It could be fine, but they just haven’t been around for as many years to build up a reputation. In fact I had a small issue with the gearing and customer support helped me out immediately. But then again I’m an e-bike reviewer and so they’d have to be stupid not to put on a good show for me.So there’s some tradeoff there, of course. You’re going with a company that doesn’t have a long and storied history in the US. But what did you expect? You can’t get way more performance like this for less cash than the competitors without giving something up.Pound for pound, though, the Engwe Engine Pro gives you some great performance and some very nice features for your hard earned dough. If you don’t need a folder or full-suspension, this might not be the bike for you. But if you want it all in one package (and you want that package to fit in your trunk), then this might be the ticket.",ebikes
2023/01/19,"Juiced Bikes is back with a new edition of its highest-performance electric bike yet – the HyperScrambler 2. This time, the company’s founder, Tora Harris, has reworked the aesthetics of the bike in a limited edition run to create the Founder’s Edition HyperScrambler 2.[Update: The Founders Edition HyperScrambler 2 has just launched for pre-order on Juiced’s site. The quantity is limited to 150 bikes and they will begin shipping in March of this year.]Only 150 of these e-bikes will be made, each coming individually numbered to let you know how quick you were at ordering one. The limited series of Founder’s Edition bikes still carry the same impressive performance specs as the original HyperScrambler 2 that we know and love. That means it gets a 1,000W Retroblade motor with a peak power output of 2,000W and a maximum speed (in unlocked mode) of a published “30+ mph.” The true top speed has been tested by numerous riders, actually reaching closer to 35 mph (56 km/h).The HyperScrambler 2 also carries a pair of high-capacity batteries to make sure that the power-hungry motor and controller can go the distance. In fact, that distance is listed as 100 miles (160 kilometers) of range per charge. Even just one of the 52V 19.2Ah batteries on the HyperScrambler 2 offers more capacity than most other e-bikes, coming in at 998 Wh per battery. But the pair of them pushing close to 2,000 Wh is one of the highest-capacity battery load outs we’ve ever seen on a retail electric bike.The bike isn’t just fast, though – it’s also comfortable. Front and rear suspension turn this into a full-suspension electric moped. A huge headlight and a built-in Bluetooth speaker make it fun to ride, and there’s even a full LED light package, including turn signals.The Founder’s Edition HyperScrambler 2 has a few added accessories personally selected and crafted by Harris to turn the bike into his dream of what the HS2 could truly become. That includes a custom green colorway, upgraded tan saddle, headlight fairing that works like a small windscreen (and might just add an extra mile of range if you stay tucked behind it), custom race plates with Juiced bike’s year of founding (not many e-bike companies have been around since 2009!), and new all-terrain 4-inch fat tires that have never before been offered on the HyperScrambler 2.The HyperScrambler 2 has long been a favorite of ours here at Electrek, and its single-battery cousin, known as the HyperScorpion, even earned vehicle of the year after it debuted.These e-bikes, which can be operated in reduced power and speed modes to maintain street-legal riding, open the door to much higher performance output. For riders who want a street-legal yet highly capable e-bike for daily commuting and a much more performance-oriented bike for weekend fun, the HyperScrambler 2 delivers that thrill.It does so at a price, though, which is around $3,099 for the regular edition of the bike. The Founder’s Edition here will set you back $3,499 when it opens for orders on January 19. But then again, there will only ever be 150 of them made, so perhaps that could be a steal if this becomes a collectors’ item. You’ll have the last laugh with your wife when this bad boy rolls across the Barrett-Jackson auction block in 30 years, fetching a six-figure sum. “See, honey? I told you it was a smart investment!”Sometimes these limited edition e-bikes can be a bit gimmicky, but occasionally, they actually come out really slick-looking. And this is definitely the latter.Not only is the Juiced HyperScrambler 2 already an amazing e-bike, but the Founder’s Edition looks badass. I love that green colorway, tan seat, and headlight fairing add to the motorcycle vibes this e-bike always deserved. I’m not sure if I want to hear other people’s music blasting out of the Bluetooth speaker as they ride down the boardwalk, but the rest checks my boxes.With only 150 of these being made, though, part of me wants to get one and ride the hell out of it, while the other part of me wants to baby it and keep it pristine. What the hell? You only live once. Let ’er rip!",ebikes
2023/01/18,"The Ride1Up Revv1 e-bike was just unveiled this morning, rolling out in all of its moped-style electric bike glory. And in doing so, the new e-bike proved once again that Ride1Up is not content to rest on its laurels in the commuter e-bike category, but rather is serious about expanding its reputation for building high-value e-bikes in other market segments as well.When Ride1Up CEO Daniel Urbino first showed me the Revv1 concept, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The bike was such a stark departure from the typical electric commuters we’ve come to know and love from the San Diego-based electric bike maker that it blew my mind.Urbino explained to me that the goal of the Revv1 was to reach more riders than just its existing base that were interested in commuter e-bikes, such as those that wanted more adrenaline-pumping types of electric bikes. And I get it, but it’s just such a departure for the brand. Though then again, I guess I should have seen the writing on the wall. Last year Ride1Up revealed its first mid-drive e-bike known as the Prodigy and then followed it up with a beach cruiser meets commuter called the Cafe Cruiser. So the company’s expanding aspirations shouldn’t come as a complete surprise.What is surprising though is how well Ride1Up seems to have nailed the moped-style electric bike design on their first try.We often refer to these as SUPER73-style e-bikes, which I think is fair based on that brand’s early success in popularizing the retro-themed electric bike design that bridges moped and mini-bike styles from the 1970s and 80s. And in the process, they’ve created a dedicated community of riders with incredible brand loyalty. But while we’ve seen SUPER73’s prices slowly walk up over the years, Ride1Up has managed to either keep prices stable or even lower them. And the new Ride1Up Revv1 follows the same strategy with attractive pricing for a slick-looking e-bike.The Revv1 starts at $1,899 for the front suspension version or $2,399 for the full-suspension model. The two versions of the e-bike both feature 750W motors and ship in Class 2 mode allowing them to reach 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle or pedal assist. In reality, the bikes are actually capable of higher power up to 1,500 watts and a higher top speed of at least 28 mph (45 km/h), but it’s not something that owners can simply unlock on their own. To modify the e-bike for higher speed intended for off-road usage, riders will need to contact Ride1Up support. It’s a move that’s likely designed to make it harder for the e-bike to be souped-up by younger riders or anyone that isn’t ready for that responsibility, and is likely one more chance for support to explain the reason they call it “Off-Road Mode.”The Ride1Up Revv1 with full suspension will sport a 52V and 20Ah battery that uses Samsung battery cells and offers 1,040Wh of capacity. That’s one of the largest e-bike batteries we’ve seen in the industry, and should offer exceptional range even when used in throttle-only mode. And let’s get real, most of these moped-style electric bikes spend the majority of their lives in throttle mode. On the hard tail version, riders will find a slightly smaller 52V 15Ah battery, though still with Samsung cells.Front and rear LED lights come standard, including a large motorcycle-style headlight. The full-suspension version of the bike also has a pair of turn signals in the front and rear. Fenders in the front and rear help shield those 20″ x 4″ fat tires outfitted with what looks like a dual-sport tread for both street and trail use. Kenda Krusade tires grace the hard tail Revv1, while the full-suspension e-bike gets CST Scout eMoped all-surface tires.The bikes use Bafang’s cast wheels that remove wire spokes (and the spoke maintenance that normally goes with them), and the hydraulic disc brakes further help reduce the Revv1’s maintenance load.Suspension for the hard tail version of the Revv1 includes a 100 mm front fork with rebound adjustment and hydraulic lockout. The full-suspension version has a nicer dual crown front suspension fork that helps lend even more motorcycle-inspired vibes to the e-bike. That models’ rear shock is a DNM model with rebound adjustment, adjustable air pressure and lockout.A planned storage cage accessory will be added in the coming months, allowing riders to add storage into the empty space in the box frame. Foot pegs, a rear rack, and a rear handle are also planned additions to the accessory list.The moped-style e-bike space certainly isn’t lacking options and variety, but the industry leaders have been fairly pricey. While the Revv1 can’t match the 2,000 watts of peak power offered by e-bikes like the SUPER73-RX, it still provides a highly capable 1,500 watt full-suspension alternative for at least $1,500 less.So, bikes are road legal vehicles in most places in US. You can ride a bicycle in the middle of the road if you wanted to, albeit not recommended. This thing can hit 28, which isn't really much slower than a 50cc scooter, and the same as an LSV - both are allowed on roads. You see where I'm going with this... It's a bicycle, which is allowed on roads, and hits speeds of other road legal vehicles. But we can't ride it in the road? I think we are long overdue for legislation that removes the 4 wheel qualifier from LSV laws. If the speed limit is 35mph or less, you should be able to ride just about anything - certainly a 28mph moped like this. The Juiced Scrambler may compare well with the hardtail version of the Revv1, but there too the Ride1Up version has some significant advantages such as the larger battery and more sophisticated lighting.This is definitely new territory for Ride1Up, which is something that the company’s founder Kevin Dugger doesn’t deny:“Electric mopeds are not my first choice in micro-mobility, but they are a fun and unique way to experience the e-bike revolution. They offer options and a ride experience that traditional e-bikes (or bikes) don’t. The Revv1 turns more heads than any e-bike I have ridden and is a perfect all-surface option for cruising. We want all of our models to be the best-in-class, and the Revv1 is no exception. Looking forward, we plan to bring our model of quality, style, and direct to consumer prices to a wider audience of riders.”To me that sounds like Ride1Up has its sights set on even more product expansions. And that’s a pretty exciting prospect for a company that’s had some serious hits on its hands so far.What do you think of the Ride1Up Revv1 e-bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2023/01/17,"Aventon significantly expanded its market reach when the company rolled out its first Aventure e-bike in 2021. Now the brand has updated the hot-selling e-bike with key upgrades. And of course we made sure to get an early look at the bike to tell you exactly how it looks, feels, and rides. Check out my complete review of the Aventon Aventure.2 below.The Aventon Aventure.2 electric bike was just launched today with orders now open on Aventon’s site. The e-bike includes a number of upgrades, but perhaps the most important is the inclusion of a new torque sensor. For those that have had the pleasure of riding an e-bike with a well-designed torque sensor, you’ll know that it seriously improves the riding experience. When you press on the pedals, you get near-instantaneous pedal assist response. It’s fast, it’s intuitive, and it just feels better. But that’s not the only upgrade. The Aventon Aventure.2 comes with several new pieces of kit including a rear rack as standard equipment, upgraded taillights with built-in turn signals, and a new pedal-assist layout with four power levels.You can check it all out in my review video below, but you’ll want to keep reading afterward for even more detail.Real quick, I want to start with the packaging. I know this is an e-bike review, not a box review. But Aventon deserves credit for replacing nearly every single piece of plastic and foam packaging normally included in e-bike packaging with more sustainable alternatives from recyclable material. Plastic sleeves are replaced with cardboard. Foam is replaced with expanded fiberboard blocks. Even the plastic cable ties are replaced with kraft paper rope. It’s frankly incredible. Bravo.Okay, now back to your regularly scheduled e-bike review.The Aventure.2 is a big bike, there’s no tip-toeing around that. But it doesn’t feel quite as big as it looks. Somehow the e-bike retains a level of grace that doesn’t seem to fit its big and brawny appearance.That translates into a fat-tire e-bike that actually works quite well on the road too, even if it was designed to handle the trails as well.But off-roading is where this e-bike shines, and it’s also where that new torque sensor makes the biggest difference. Getting rolling on a big, heavy e-bike like these fat-tire e-bikes can be tricky, especially if you’ve forgotten to downshift (or just didn’t downshift far enough before stopping). A torque sensor gives you near-instant motor response when you step on the pedal, instead of the laggy response of a cadence sensor that can take a pedal revolution or two to kick in. That’s a game-changer off-road where tricky terrain can compound a rough start. The top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) likely won’t have too much of an impact on most off-roaders since you rarely ever get the chance to go that fast on trails. But back on the road, rolling away from a stop sign or a green light is easier than ever with the new sensor setup and the higher speed makes this a serious commuter contender for anyone who regularly shares the road with cars. If you do most of your commuting in the bike lane though, go easy with the Class 3 speeds. This is a big and heavy e-bike to come barreling down on other riders.There are also four new levels of pedal assist selectable on the color LCD screen, and a color-coded label makes it easier to see which level you’re in at a quick glance.For on-road riders that enjoy fat-tire e-bikes for their ability to nearly erase potholes, you’ll be happy to see two other inclusion: a rear rack and turn signals. The rear rack is no longer behind a paywall but instead comes as standard equipment. And don’t get me started on how awesome these turn signals are. In the past I’ve ribbed e-bikes with turn signals when those signals were so close together that they failed to serve their indicator purpose. But with Aventon’s signature taillights mounted on either side of the rear wheel as integrated frame lighting, the turn signals are actually far apart and quite apparent in their role as directional indicators. I still think riders shouldn’t completely rely on e-bike turn signals since most drivers are not expecting to see a blinking indicator on a bike. So I generally still use hand signals, but it’s nice to have a turn signal setup that gives you the best chance of drivers correctly interpreting your intentions.I also really like how Aventon gives you plenty of options for frames. Not only is there a step-through AND a step-over option, but both are available in two frame sizes. Not everything here is rosy though. I was a bit bummed to see Aventon stick with the same 48V 14Ah battery size. That 672 Wh battery is fine, don’t get me wrong. But it’s not as big as I would have liked. It will give you plenty of range if you’re sticking to lower pedal assist levels, such as Aventon’s real-world range rating on Level 1 at 60 miles (96 km). The 30-mile (48 km) range rating on throttle-only riding isn’t bad either, but riders who generally go faster off-road will likely burn through that battery even quicker. If they could have found a way to stuff one more row of cells into that battery for a 17.5Ah setup and an 840Wh capacity, I’d be over the moon. But as it stands, the Aventure.2 still gets great range on pedal assist on the road and respectable range off-road or on throttle. Though that doesn’t mean I can’t still beg for more.The only other downside for me is just that the bike is kind of huge. It’s big and heavy. But that’s what you get with an adventure e-bike. You’re not going to traverse the same terrain on a 20″ folding e-bike, so you’ve got to pack more in to go explore rougher and tougher places.All told, you’re getting one hell of a bike here for a more than reasonable price of $1,899. Punchy hydraulic brakes, a good suspension setup with comfort-enhancing fat tires, awesome LED lighting in the front and rear, and a torque-sensor to boot! There’s just so much to be happy about with the Aventon Aventure.2 that I almost feel bad complaining about the average-size battery or heavy weight. Almost, but not quite. I’ll still complain. But I’ll do it while wearing a huge smile on my face as I sling sand and rocks around my local trails on this fun and adventurous e-bike.Oh and by the way, if you want a deal on Aventon’s original cadence sensor-based Aventure, that model is now on sale for $1,499. That’s a freakin’ steal!",ebikes
2023/01/13,"Lectric eBikes, the Phoenix-based electric bike maker that is known for its ultralow prices, has done it again with a new budget-friendly e-bike. This time the company rolled out an electric tricycle known as the Lectric XP Trike at far below the going market rates. But how did they do it, and what makes their e-trike so affordable? Let’s check it out.Lectric’s CEO Levi Conlow teased the Lectric XP Trike earlier this week, but now we’ve finally gotten the complete rundown of specs.The trike features a 500-watt rear motor with a peak power rating of 1,092 watts. It is mounted on a central jackshaft at the rear of the trike to drive the two rear wheels through a differential axle, allowing two-wheel drive. The motor itself is a hub motor, though it is implemented more like a mid-drive motor.A cursory look at the trike shows that it’s actually quite similar to Lectric’s already quite popular $999 Lectric XP 3.0 folding e-bike. You could almost say it’s a very similar bike, yet with a larger battery, hydraulic brakes, and an extra wheel.In fact, it sort of has two extra wheels, in the sense that the rear end is similar to a trike conversion style setup that allows the front of a more typical e-bike to be combined with a trike assembly in the rear. That likely helped expedite the design process and allowed Lectric to quickly bring an electric trike to market after the last major e-trike launch, the RadTrike from Rad Power Bikes. Sticking with more standard parts that could be adapted into a three-wheeler also helped Lectric keep the cost down while maintaining a similar strategy to the Lectric XP 3.0 e-bike.It’s a different design but one that still follows Lectric’s playbook, as the company explained:We took our award-winning XP series e-bikes and added a bigger battery, hydraulic brakes, and a third wheel to create the industry’s first fully foldable and fully-assembled electric tricycle. This 65 lb three-wheeler is purposefully designed with convenience and fun top of mind.At just 65 pounds (29.5 kilograms), the Lectric XP Trike’s folding frame will be a manageable lift for many people. The frame folds in both the center and at the handlebars to fit into tight places. That handlebar folding mechanism will likely be the most useful for lowering the height of the trike to fit in SUVs and other rear-opening vehicles, though the center fold may help the smaller bundle fit into tighter closets, etc.Folding also allows the electric trike to arrive fully assembled, meaning riders simply need to unfold it, inspect the bike and ride.The electric three-wheeler is powered by a 48V and 14Ah battery with 672 Wh of capacity. Lectric claims that riders can travel as far as 50 miles (80 kilometers) on a single charge, though that high efficiency is likely helped by the slower 14 mph (22 km/h) top speed. A slower top speed might sound like a downer, but it is an important safety consideration for three-wheelers that can feel tippy at higher speeds. It’s hard to say how wide the rear wheels are set on the Lectric XP Trike, but narrower wheels can compound the tipping feeling, making it important to keep speeds reasonable. Don’t expect to fly at 20-28 mph (32-45 km/h) like the rest of Lectric’s e-bikes! But at least you have both pedal assist (5 levels) and throttle to choose from.To bring you down from top speed, the XP Trike has hydraulic disc braking and also includes a parking brake to prevent the trike from rolling away when parked on an incline. Hydraulic disc brakes are normally seen on faster and more expensive e-bikes, but the XP Trike’s massive weight capacity of 450 pounds (204 kilograms) means that it will likely need to make full use of those powerful hydraulic stoppers when fully loaded. Fortunately, the motor is rated for a peppy 65 Nm of torque to help get that weight rolling when filled to the max.Features like the included parking brake and a new upgradable two-part seat with back rest are news to us since the teaser was shared earlier this week. The trike rolls on a trio of 20″x 2.6″ tires that provide slightly more cushioning than most narrower street tires, perhaps offering a bit more off-road readiness than a purely urban e-bike, but not nearly as much as that provided by larger fat tires.Since most riders will surely stick to manicured paths, the tire size is likely appropriate for the target market.The introductory price of $1,499 will include a cargo package consisting of a front and rear basket, though it looks like that might just be a promotion for the launch. Pre-orders will open on February 7, with the XP Trike expected to begin shipping in April.Wow, you can’t help but be blown away by the price here. I’m also glad to see that the company has an upgradeable saddle and a parking brake since those were two things that appeared to be missing to me when I first saw the teaser earlier this week. The included rear cargo basket also adds a ton of value to this already value-packed deal.I definitely hope the XP Trike can live up to its wildly high weight rating of 450 pounds (204 kilograms). I imagine the company had to test at well over that amount to be able to claim that number, but it just seems quite high.The biggest difference between this e-trike and the more expensive e-trikes is that it looks like they started with a similar base to their XP 3.0 bike instead of redesigning a ground-up trike. That’s definitely a quick way to get to a viable product and keep costs down, but I’ll certainly want to test this one out myself to see how it handles. Trikes can feel tippy when the weight is higher up, and the rear wheels aren’t very wide, so I’ll be curious to see how it feels in the rear and how stable the trike is. The wheels are only 2 inches taller than on a RadTrike, but the cargo seems to be higher also. I might have liked to see some suspension or a multispeed drivetrain instead of the single speed, but it’s hard to complain about leaving too much off when the price is this low. And at these slow speeds, I can get by with both no suspension and a single-gear ratio.There’s no denying it – the XP Trike brings affordable electric tricycles to folks that can’t afford several thousands of dollars for the higher-end e-trikes. And it does it with some good components thrown in too. The last thing a retiree wants to be doing is spending time on their hands and knees adjusting mechanical brakes, so seeing components like hydraulic disc brakes makes me very happy. I am curious to see how they implemented a parking brake, though, since those can be tricky on hydraulic brake setups.Here’s looking forward to hopefully trying one of these soon to see how it stacks up to other e-trikes I’ve tested, like the RadTrike.",ebikes
2023/01/12,"The world has been begging Honda for years to bring to market an electric version of its famous Cub line of motorbikes. Now the company has finally done it with the recently launched Honda Cub e:, though it’s not exactly what we were looking for.In case you aren’t familiar, the Honda Cub and its many variants have claimed the title of the best selling motor vehicle of all time. The Cub has been in non-stop production since 1958 with over 100 million Honda Super Cub and Cub variants sold over the years.We’ve seen Honda play with patents for an electric version of the cub, and we’ve drooled over imitations that have come out over the years, but we’ve yet to see Honda actually bring an electric Cub to market.Now the company has finally made good on an electric Cub, though it’s a much lower spec moped version that doesn’t quite carry the same charm or performance of the original.Honda designed it for younger riders in the Chinese market, and the company just unveiled it alongside two other light electric two-wheelers.At a press event in Shanghai, Honda rolled out the new Honda Cub e:, the Dax e:, and the ZOOMER e:.All three of the vehicles are designed to fit into China’s electric bicycle regulations that allow them to be sold and operated with much less regulation.Unfortunately that also means that the three vehicles only top out at a neutered 25 km/h (15.5 mph).They may not be fast, but they do have a bit of style to make up for the lack of performance.The Cub e: certainly draws inspiration from the classic Honda Super Cub, yet it also takes on modern design cues. It’s a more simplified look that loses a bit of the original’s pizazz, likely in favor of affordability for the millennial market that Honda is targeting.It’s the same model we’ve been looking at in recent design filings and sports a pair of pedals that may be functional but are unlikely to be used for that function.Instead, a twist throttle will make quick use of the electric moped’s battery, at least all the way up to 25 km/h.In addition to the Cub e:, Honda also unveiled the Dax e: electric moped that takes on more of a Honda Trail vibe. It’s part of a growing trend of off-road electric motorbikes finding popularity in cities and urban centers. Both the Cub e: and Dax e: were listed for around 6000 RMB, or approximately US $885.The third vehicle in Honda’s trio is the Honda Zoomer e:, which basically looks like a pedal-added Honda ruckus that stuck its spokes in an electrical socket. That design is slightly more expensive, coming in at around US $900. Of course those prices reflect the much lower cost of goods in the Chinese market, and there’s no telling if these models will ever reach international riders.It’s great to see Honda adding more of these electric mopeds to its lineup, and it’s even fun to watch older gas vehicle designs get reimagined as EVs. The Cub e: seems to share a lot of similarities with the MUJI partnership vehicle that resulted in the MS01, though the Cub e: looks a bit nicer to me.The downside for all of the people that don’t live in China (which is amazingly only around 80% of us) is that we’ll have to wait to find out if and when these vehicles will be exported to the rest of the world. And if so, will they get better performance specs?Here’s hoping for a huge “yes!”via: The Pack",ebikes
2023/01/12,"RCA, the century-old electronics brand that may be most famous for its consumer products like the VCR, has launched a series of electric bicycles with the unveiling of three new models. Two of the e-bikes are fairly ordinary models, but the third is a more aggressive and higher-power e-bike with a striking design.The shift to e-bikes might sound strange for a brand known for radios, VCRs and other home entertainment products. However, the RCA brand was purchased by a parent company that brings new products to market using licensing deals with the brands under its umbrella. In this case, the brand’s new e-bikes are designed “to accommodate a range of rider preferences from outdoor fitness enthusiasts to two-wheeled commuters.”Based on the diverse types of e-bikes in the lineup, I’d say that looks accurate. The three models include the GoGo (a folding fat-tire e-bike), the Explorer (a step-through urban e-bike), and the Dirt-E (an off-road e-bike that looks like it got dressed in the dark).The GoGo follows a typical fat-tire folding e-bike design like we’ve seen plenty of times before.It includes front suspension, a pair of baskets for cargo duty, a rear 750W hub motor, fenders, LED lighting, and a multi-speed drivetrain. The bike’s 691 Wh battery is mounted behind the seat tube.The bike folds in the middle of the frame and at the handlebars to create a compact pile of aluminum and rubber that should fit in most cars or closets.The fat tires should help the RCA GoGo travel over rougher terrain, though the smaller 20″ diameter wheels won’t create quite as nice of an all-terrain ride as larger 26″ wheels could.For riders that don’t need a bike that can origami itself into tight spaces, the RCA Explorer might be a better option. This city-styled e-bike has urban tires and uses a step-through frame that should make it easier to mount and dismount.The bike includes front suspension, a fender and LED light package, a rear 750W hub motor, and hydraulic disc brakes. The 691 Wh battery in the Explorer is integrated into the frame yet is still removable for charging off of the bike.The Explorer does not appear to come standard with racks or baskets for utility use, but mounting points in the front and rear would imply that those accessories could easily be added.The Dirt-E is perhaps the most unique of the three new e-bike models. It features functional pedals and thus is still an electric bicycle in the eyes of the law despite its more dirt bike appearance. The full-suspension ride includes cast wheels with fat tires and a rear hub motor. The motor is rated for a continuous power rating of 1,000W and a peak power rating of 1,250W.A typical bicycle saddle is replaced by something that would look more at home on a dirt bike or trials bike.Despite the off-road look of the bike, it features tires that might be considered dual-purpose yet skew more toward on-road traction.RCA never actually made VCRs. RCA poured all their R&D into a failed video disc format called CED. But CED was delayed and wasn't ready when Sony released Beta VCRs in the U.S., so in response, RCA quickly re-badged VHS VCRs manufactured by Panasonic. All of RCA's VCRS in the 1970s and 1980s were actually re-badged Panasonic or Hitachi players.A 60V and 20Ah battery is mounted in between the frame rails above the downtube and offers a capacity of 1.2 kWh.The RCA Dirt-E comes with a software-limited top speed to keep it legal in various jurisdictions but can be unlocked to a maximum of 55 km/h (34 mph). Such speeds would likely only be legal when used off of public streets.We don’t have prices yet, but RCA says that the bikes should become available by late Q2 or early Q3 of this year. What do you think of the new RCA e-bikes? Does the brand name inspire credibility? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2023/01/11,"The RadTrike is the first consumer-focused electric three-wheeler from Rad Power Bikes, the largest e-bike company in North America. It’s designed to make e-biking more accessible to a wider range of riders, especially older riders, and it sure fits that bill. After testing the trike I can tell you that there’s a lot to like here, though I’ve also got a few critiques in areas I would have liked to have seen changed.There’s no better way to get a sense of an e-bike (or an e-trike) than by putting it through its paces of real world use. So I got my hands on a RadTrike and took it shopping, rode around my neighborhood, tried commuting on it, did some leisurely trail riding and basically used it in about as many real world cases as I could imagine.As a three-wheeler, it’s a bit of niche product. But it’s also not as niche as you might think. There are millions of former riders out there who would love to get back on a bike despite not having the same balance or leg strength they used to have.Enter: the RadTrike.It’s purpose built for these types of riders. This electric three-wheeler is a comfortable, stable and modestly powerful setup that can work for a wide range of riders from young adults wanting a utility platform that can haul 50+ lbs (23 kg) of groceries to retirees that want to relive the fun of cycling down the street with the wind in their faces.To see some of my RadTrike review testing in action, check out my video review below. Then keep reading for all of my RadTrike thoughts.The first thing I noticed about the RadTrike was just how stable it is while riding. They made the rear as wide as it could be while still fitting through most standard exterior doors, plus the 18″ wheels keep the center of gravity lower, so you get a nice and stable platform. I had to really try to get it up on two wheels, meaning I could only do it while going fast and simultaneously making sharp turns, or else throwing my weight in a corner turn to purposefully lift the outer wheel. Unlike other e-trikes I’ve tried, I never accidentally went up on two wheels.The point is, despite many people thinking electric tricycles can be tippy (and they can), the RadTrike is well designed to feel pretty darn stable. Unless you’re actively trying to tip it, you probably won’t.It’s also very smooth on startup. Some other electric tricycles I’ve tried do instant front wheel burnouts because the throttle gives you all that power at once. On the RadTrike, they’ve design some very slow and easy throttle ramping profile. That means that even if you go whiskey throttle and essentially “floor it,” the trike will gently accelerate over the first three to four seconds. That’s a nicely thought out feature and one that is especially important when you have a front wheel motor like this.The motor is quite powerful at 750W, and you really feel it pulling you along once those first few seconds of slow throttle ramping pass. I tested the RadTrike if flat Florida so there aren’t any big hills, but even climbing up loading dock ramps and other inclines shows that the motor isn’t a weak little thing.The RadTrike only gets up to 14 mph (22 km/h), but that speed actually feels much faster on a trike than it does while doing 14 mph on any other of Rad’s electric bikes. I could even take turns at full speed as long as the turn was wide enough. I don’t recommend making a sharp 90 degree turn at max velocity, but you can actually do it if the 90 degree turn is wide enough (think street intersection, not sidewalk turn). That’s just another testament to how stable the RadTrike is, even at higher speeds.One thing to note: You have to pay attention to where all your wheels are. That sounds a bit odd, but let me explain. This is true of all electric tricycles, not just this one. But unlike a typical two-wheeled e-bike where you have a single track of wheels to manage, an e-trike has three. So when you see a pot hole or a piece of road debris, you can’t just think “Okay, I’ll go to the side of it” like on a typical e-bike. You have to either straddle it between two of your wheels or take an even wider path around it than you would on an e-bike to make sure you don’t catch your outer wheel in it. But if you start riding an e-trike as your main bike, you’ll quickly become accustomed to knowing where all of your wheels are at all times.Right from the start, the RadTrike is well thought out. It comes in packaging that makes it quite easy to assemble. The two halves of the bike need to be bolted together, but that’s the bulk of the assembly.I originally thought the bike would be foldable in the middle when I first saw the design as it was unveiled online, but I soon realized that the middle joint is a solid bolted connection. You could take it apart in a minute or two with a 6mm allen wrench, but it’s not a quick fold connection. There IS a quick fold connection at the handlebars though, which is perfect for when you want to load the bike into the back of an SUV or van, since it essentially chops off the extra height of the handlebars.The saddle is nice and comfortable, even coming with an adjustable back rest. I was a bit worried that it wouldn’t feel great when pedaling since there’s much more saddle there under you (more like a tractor seat than a bike saddle), but it actually felt just fine while pedaling.The saddle also drops surprisingly low. If you don’t pedal much and want to just throttle around, you can drop it lower than you might otherwise and benefit from even further lowered center of gravity. Plus the ability for the seat to drop so low means it can fit riders as low as 4’10” (I can almost hear my mom rejoicing).When I took the bike off-road on gravel trails and grassy fields, I was glad to have a comfortable seat under me. There’s no suspension and the 18″ tires aren’t particularly big, so I definitely bounced around a good bit, but a wide saddle under me meant I wasn’t bouncing on a banana, I was bouncing on an office chair. That makes a big difference.I also found it neat that there’s an easy to use reverse feature (just hold the “down” button on the display for a couple seconds to enter reverse mode). To be honest, I never once used the reverse feature out of necessity, it was more just playing around with it since it was there. But I can see how it would be useful if you pulled headfirst into a garage spot and needed to back out, or wound up in another tight situation like that. Though another thing to note is that the turning radius is so tight that you can basically turn in the trike’s own length. I could do full 360-degree turns in the width of a sidewalk.Next, let’s talk about braking. There’s a disc brake up front and a coaster brake in the rear. The front brake is really all you need, but if you’re the kind of person that has weaker hands or just doesn’t want to let go of the bars to reach for the brake lever, having the option to stop with your feet is kind of nice. Both brakes are strong and sufficiently powerful to stop the RadTrike by themselves. If you really want to stop on a dime, slam the two simultaneously. It will feel like you dropped an anchor.I also really like the built-in parking brake. Since there’s no kickstand, the trike could theoretically roll backwards on a hill, but the parking brake keeps it in place. I’ve tested other electric tricycles without parking brakes, and it’s 100% true that even a slight hill will see that thing rolling away.Finally, let’s talk battery. I thought that I would have to worry about range due to the rather small 48V 10Ah battery with its lower than average 480Wh capacity. But since the RadTrike isn’t very fast, it sips slowly at that battery. I’m not sure I’d ever see the 55 mile (88 km) maximum range that Rad touts, but it seems that 35-40 miles is easily achievable in higher power modes. If you use lower power mode, I think you might even exceed that advertised range. The trike just doesn’t use as much battery as I had expected, and is thus surprisingly efficient.I really enjoy riding the RadTrike. It’s a pleasure. But like any e-bike, it’s not perfect. There are several smaller complaints I have with this electric tricycle.Because it’s a single speed, it is difficult to start pedaling from a standstill. I always blip the throttle to get rolling and then start pedaling. It’s a bit easier to start on pedal-assist alone if you remember to come to a stop with the pedals horizontal (one forwards and one backwards) instead of vertical (one at the top and one at the bottom). That way you can really push on that front pedal with your weight. Because it’s a cadence sensor, there’s a lag between when you start pedaling and when the pedal assist kicks in to fire up the motor, so that first half a pedal turn or so is all you. The pedaling gear ratio seems to be optimized more for around 10-ish mph (16-ish km/h). Pedal assist level 4 feels perfect to me. That’s my comfort sweet spot. The highest level (PAS 5) has my feet spinning a bit faster than comfortable when I’m zipping along at full speed. And getting started, well, that’s a doozy as I described above. Though another little cool note is that PAS 1 is walking speed, so you could roll along with a partner at about 2-3 mph. It’s a bit harder to pedal at that speed with the higher gear ratio, though.Next, the bike is quite heavy at 82 lb (37 kg). You can lose nine pounds or so by taking the battery out when you lift it, but it still ain’t light. Rad used a steel frame, which isn’t doing weight any favors, but the extra weight also adds up from the wider rear end, extra wheel, coaster brake hub, tractor seat, etc. I could lift the RadTrike out of a vehicle just fine, but I’m also a healthy 33 year old with my masculinity on the line and something to prove. If you’re up there in years or have a back injury in your past, lifting a heavy steel electric tricycle might not be part of the doctor’s orders.I also wish Rad Power Bikes had included baskets as standard equipment. At the minimum, I believe the trike should come with a rear basket. The rear of the RadTrike looks a bit naked and it’s just begging you to use that flatbed area for storage. Plus with the ultra-low center of gravity that’s Rad’s rear end design creates (combined with those low 18″ wheels), it would be an awesome cargo platform. I get that it likely comes down to money. It would cost more to ship the trike in a larger box due to the rack, and it would probably cut into the accessory business model as well. So I get it, they have an awesome line of accessories with many cargo options in that list, but I still think a rear basket would have been awesome as standard equipment.I also would have loved to see Rad include their secondary display that shows speed, odometer, etc. I’ll admit that it’s unnecessary (you don’t have to worry about speeding tickets on the RadTrike), but it’d still be fun to see your speed and also keep track of your odometer reading. The mileage is useful for both the maintenance cycle and as a personal motivator of hitting big milestones (“Congrats on your first 500 miles!”).The last issue here is the price. At $2,499, this is the most expensive bike in the Rad Power Bikes lineup.I keep going back and forth regarding how I feel about the price. It’s not that it isn’t a good bike. It’s a great bike. It is intelligently designed, rides well, feels well constructed, and is surely to get thousands of riders back in the saddle after thinking their biking days were over. But if you look at the components themselves, I’m not sure where all of that $2,499 is going.The battery is smaller than Rad’s other batteries, the brakes are basic (but certainly quite good), there’s no complicated aluminum forming needed for the frame. Even the packaging is cleverly designed to be both effective and economical without requiring a freight delivery – it can show up on a normal FedEx truck. It’s all quite cost effective. If you compare it to a bike like the RadMission that Rad used to sell for under $1,000 (and then bumped to $1,199), the RadTrike basically gets a similar loadout of parts, with the exception of an extra wheel, a parking brake, coaster brake, comfort saddle, and a more powerful motor. So I get that there’s more here, but is there twice as much?But then again, there just aren’t very many good, cost effective e-trikes on the market yet. The few that exist in a cheaper price range are basically from boutique builders and simply aren’t that great. The few e-trikes I’ve seen and tested over the last few years are either budget priced and junky (to the point of feeling dangerous) or they are $3,000 to $5,000 and thus feel out of reach for average riders. So now here comes the RadTrike as a moderately priced, nicely made and well thought-out electric tricycle. And it even comes from a large US-based company with great product support and a vast ecosystem of compatible accessories. So I guess I can justify why you have to pay for that convenience. Is it worth this much of a premium? I think so, yes. At least it is if you’re absolutely in the market for an e-trike. You can of course get better bang for your buck with e-bikes, but e-bikes aren’t for everyone. Adding that extra wheel seems to add a lot to the cost due to the design that goes into developing a purpose-built electric trike, but that may be worth it for thousands of riders who want and need that extra wheel to open up a whole new world of e-biking to them. And trust me, once you roll into that new world, you’re never going to look back!",ebikes
2023/01/09,"Phoenix-based electric bike company Lectric eBikes has been a consistent price leader in the electric bike industry. Now the company has just let it slip that they’re working on an electric trike that will be launched at an unbelievably low price. Badging on the three-wheeler seems to point to a new product in the XP line known as the Lectric XP Trike.The company’s CEO Levi Conlow posted a teaser on Facebook earlier today, revealing that Lectric has been quietly working on an electric trike.And not just any trike, but one that bears a price tag of just $1,499. That comes in at $1,000 less than the most recent major trike launch, the RadTrike from Rad Power Bikes.It’s also significantly less expensive than many other electric trikes on the market that can cost well over $3,000.The truly interesting thing about the Lectric XP Trike isn’t just the price, but rather that it appears to offer significantly more that most other trikes.For example, instead of using a front hub motor for front wheel drive, the Lectric XP Trike uses a more sophisticated drivetrain. It features a centrally mounted motor to drive both rear wheels through a differential axle (a simplified version of the way a typical rear-wheel-drive car functions). It looks like they actually used a hub motor mounted as a mid-drive motor, which is a rare but not totally foreign drive method. It was popularized by a highly acclaimed cargo e-bike setup known as the StokeMonkey over a decade ago and allows a cost effective hub motor to function like a much more expensive mid-drive motor.The Lectric XP Trike also features hydraulic disc braking in the front and rear, which is a more premium type of brake that provides higher performance and lower maintenance.Levi listed the battery as 14Ah but didn’t specify the voltage. Assuming it matches the 48V batteries in all of Lectric’s other e-bikes, that would put the battery at a healthy 672 Wh.The Lectric XP Trike is also listed as fully-foldable and arriving fully-assembled, meaning riders won’t need to assemble it themselves. The inclusion of a central folding mechanism in addition to the handlebar folding mechanism should allow it to fit in tighter spaces while folded.We’re still missing key specs on the Lectric XP Trike, but Levi shared that a full reveal will be coming later this week on January 13.The ultra-affordable e-trike is true to Lectric’s reputation for crazy low prices. The company’s most affordable e-bike, the $799 Lectric XP Lite, is a 48V folding e-bike with value that hasn’t been matched in the industry. The same goes for the company’s $999 Lectric XP 3.0 e-bike, which is a 28 mph (45 km/h) dual-passenger e-bike that undercuts all the other utility e-bikes we’ve seen so far. And even the company’s $1,799 Lectric XPremium e-bike, despite being its most expensive, is a ridiculously good deal for a mid-drive e-bike with a torque sensor and dual batteries.Don’t believe me? Check out the video from my review of that e-bike below.This. Is. Huge.I hate to describe it this way, but this is kind of a RadTrike killer. And not just that, it basically shuts down every other electric trike on the market. Period.Compared to the RadTrike, the Lectric XP Trike has 40% more battery, dual wheel rear drive instead of single wheel front drive and hydraulic brakes. And, it costs $1,000 less.It’s unclear if those cargo baskets come with the bike or if they’re added accessories. If they do come standard, then it’s an even more killer deal, as those baskets will cost you over $100 to add yourself. Many companies hold those back behind a paywall. Of course the Lectric XP Trike also has some downsides. It doesn’t have suspension. It doesn’t have a larger tractor seat saddle like the RadTrike or some others. It seems to have a bit of a wiring mess, though that might be due to the prototype nature of what is presumably the first model that we’re looking at in the picture.But there’s no way around it, this is a crazy deal for anyone who needs a trike due to mobility or balances issues. Or anyone who just wants a trike.In fact, I’ve been riding the RadTrike around for an upcoming review this week (that Lectric just kind of spoiled by pre-empting with this crazy unveil … thanks, Lectric), and it’s an awesome way to get around even as a healthy, able-bodied 33-year-old. You don’t have to be up there in years to enjoy a trike, though older folks are definitely a major part of the electric trike market. I’ll be tuning in for more details and following this Lectric XP Trike launch very closely.",ebikes
2023/01/08,"Prices in the electric bike industry spent years with relative stability until the pandemic’s many ripple effects wreaked havoc on the industry. Over the last few years, we’ve watched prices rocket up and then plunge back down again in a matter of months, only to repeat. Many riders had hoped to see 2023 bring with it a return to normalcy in the industry. Based on the several recent price changes across many companies, that doesn’t appear to be the case.It looks like while some manufacturers are dropping prices, others are seeing major increases.For example, ONYX Motorbikes just launched a special sale to kick off the new year, with prices reduced by up to $1,000 on some of the company’s most popular models.The RCR electric moped, which is admittedly closer to light electric motorcycle specs than true electric bicycle territory, sees the largest discount of the bunch. The street model dropped from $5,479.99 to $4,479.99. The pricier dirt model dropped from $5,922.99 to $4,922.99.The company is also reducing prices on its LZR series, which are the company’s true electric bicycles that were just unveiled earlier this year. Those get $600 price reductions, with the LZR Standard 500W dropping from $2,299 to $1,699 and the LZR Pro 900W dropping from $2,799 to $1,999. ONYX has limited the discounts to just 50 models of each style, so it’s unlikely that this pricing will last long, and unfortunately, it probably doesn’t represent a larger industry trend.Other companies haven’t reduced prices in 2023 but have kept some of their impressive Black Friday and holiday sales running into the new year. San Diego-based Ride1Up has multiple models of city, trail, and cruiser electric bikes with sale prices close to or matching the company’s best holiday sales from 2022.That’s another trend we noticed near the end of last year, that the often too-good-to-be-true Black Friday deals from many e-bike companies extended well into the holiday seasons and even into the new year in some cases, instead of being quickly reset to standard pricing as we’ve seen in past years.On the other side of the price flipping sit several e-bike companies that have already announced price increases.The largest electric bicycle company in North America, Rad Power Bikes, increased its pricing on several models. The RadRover 6 Plus spent a long time at $1,999 before recently being bumped past the $2K mark to $2,099. That still isn’t Rad’s most expensive e-bike, though, as the newly released RadTrike took that title with its $2,499 MSRP.The RadRunner Plus is now up to $1,999, and the recently released RadExpand 5 has a new price of $1,649.Rad has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in VC funding over the last few years, and some believe that the company may be feeling pressure from its investors to demonstrate healthier profit margins. The company has also invested significantly in new product developments too, with R&D spending likely seeing an increase as well.SUPER73, another highly visible electric bike company, has also announced price increases for 2023.Unlike Rad Power Bikes which operates on the more value-oriented end of the e-bike spectrum, SUPER73’s e-bikes offer higher power and punchier performance that has helped drive prices higher.The company has one of the most dedicated communities of riders, though, fueled by a culture of customization and riding culture that has brought motorcycle club vibes to the e-bike world.The company announced that its SUPER-73RX Mojave e-bike would increase by $300 to $3,995. The SUPER73-R Brooklyn bumped its price by $200 to $3,695, while the midlevel SUPER73-S2 increased by $300 to $3,295. Even the company’s more affordable SUPER73-ZX saw a $200 jump to $2,395.In addition to inflation and other factors that have been blamed for the rise in e-bike prices over the last year or so, sky-high freight costs from Asia played a major role in the soaring cost of e-bikes.However, we’ve seen those ocean freight prices plummet in the last few months, which fueled hope that e-bike prices would catch a break as well.Despite some small downward movements we’ve seen in the industry, reduced prices haven’t become a larger trend. Most e-bike companies have either stayed stable or slowly walked their prices up, even as shipping prices have reduced.Of course, other factors, such as a rising and falling exchange rate between the US dollar and the Chinese Yuan, have also played a role in the roller coaster ride of e-bike prices.With only a week into 2023 and no stability in sight, don’t expect to count on this being the year that prices drop back to normal for good.",ebikes
2023/01/06,"Vietnam-based electric car maker VinFast showed off more than just electric SUVs and crossovers at CES 2023. The electric automaker surprised us with four new electric bike concepts on display.The company already has a fairly eclectic offering of EVs that spans electric cars, electric scooters, electric buses, and clean energy solutions.But the electric-assist bicycles represent a new direction for VinFast.All four bikes were listed as “concepts,” and there’s no word on whether they’ll actually make it to production.But since VinFast is already producing seated electric scooters, it wouldn’t be so far-fetched to see the company drop down a weight class or two and produce electric bicycles.The four models, seen below in photos taken by Electrek’s Scooter Doll, represent a wide range of e-bike styles for diverse riding scenarios.Two of the bikes feature mid-drive motors and two feature hub motors, but they’re each uniquely adapted for a different style of riding.The forest green model is a hybrid-style commuter bike with a centrally-located mid-drive motor, a rigid fork, a forward-tucked geometry and what appears to be frame-integrated LED lighting.Next to it sits a blue electric mountain bike that uses a similar style frame outfitted with a short-travel suspension fork. The bike isn’t quite as rugged as most hardtail eMTBs we’ve seen, underscored by the frame’s rather diminutive seat stay tubes. But considering that these are concept e-bikes, that frame could certainly change by the time it reaches production.The company also showed off a mini-bike electric bicycle with rear hub motor that seems to invoke some serious SUPER73 vibes. The bike uses an open moped-style frame with a stubby bench seat that covers an underslung battery. A pair of 20″ diameter knobby fat tires and a dual crown suspension fork seem to imply that the bike might have scrambler-esque aspirations for both on and off-road riding.Lastly, VinFast also showed off a narrow-tire folding e-bike with a rear-hub motor. The small e-bike seems designed to fulfill a commuter-type role. Such e-bikes have proven popular for commuters that need to carry the e-bike onto a bus or subway and for drivers who like to keep a small folding e-bike in the trunk of their car to extend their reach into a city.VinFast’s electric bike concepts seem to be fleshing out the company’s product line ahead of a possible IPO. The move also highlights a growing trend we’ve seen in the auto industry of automakers partnering or innovating their way toward micromobility vehicles like e-bikes and scooters wearing the automaker’s badge.Many such automakers have either white-labeled or otherwise teamed up with e-bike makers to produce a two-wheeler bearing the company’s name. That’s how Polestar wound up with its own bike, and others such as Hummer and Jeep pulled similar moves to create a branded e-bike model. Ducati and BMW also used a similar strategy on their path to e-bikes and e-scooters.Other companies have actually developed their own two-wheelers in house from the ground up. Harley-Davidson famously spent years designing its popular electric bikes that were eventually spun out as independent e-bike company Serial 1. GM developed a custom-designed electric bike with a much lauded design, though it met an untimely demise in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Porsche has a number of interesting e-bikes as well, as does Peugeot. Now it looks like VinFast could be set to join that second group if it eventually brings these e-bike concepts to fruition.",ebikes
2023/01/05,"CAKE has just unveiled its latest heavy duty electric two-wheeler at CES 2023. But unlike the company’s electric motorcycles and scooters that came before it, the CAKE Åik is an electric bicycle complete with pedals. But don’t think that this e-bike isn’t ready for some hard work.This isn’t your typical electric bike. It’s part of CAKE’s “:Work” line of heavy-hauling utility vehicles on two wheels.The CAKE Åik is similar in concept to the CAKE Ösa electric motorcycle that has been described as a “workbench on wheels” thanks to its highly modular work platform. And just like the Ösa, it’s another model that I’ll have to hunt around my keyboard to be able to type each time.The Åik may be a street-legal electric bicycle, but it’s like no e-bike we’ve covered before. That’s because it’s actually built for heavy duty utility and work jobs. The aluminum frame is designed to be ultra modular to fit a wide range of utility accessories. The bike comes with an impressive gross vehicle weight rating of 441 lbs (200 kg). Subtracting out the 78 lb (35.5 kg) weight of the bike and a single battery, that still leaves 363 lbs (165 kg) of cargo capacity.You might want to use some of that extra capacity to mount a couple spare 12 pound (5.5 kg) batteries. A single battery offers a range of up to 74.5 miles (220 km), but the Åik can actually support three batteries (sold separately) that boost the range up to 223 miles (359 km) on pedal assist. The 750 Wh batteries use 21700-size cells and also function as powerbanks that can be used to power devices and tools.Throttling around instead of helping pedal will certainly net you less range than that lofty 223 mile figure, but with 2.25 kWh of battery you’re still looking at all day operation.If you do choose to ride by throttle assist, you’ll be able to hit a maximum speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) without your feet doing any work. The top speed without electric assist? That’s listed as “as fast as you can pedal.”The drivetrain uses a 1,000W peak mid-drive motor with a nominal rating of 500W and a 100 Nm torque rating. It is paired with a chain drive but is belt drive compatible. All the press photos show a belt drive, and that seems to be the nicer choice.Both the belt and chain drives dump the motor’s power into an Enviolo Extreme CVP hub that functions as a continuously variable transmission (CVT). It includes automatic shifting, meaning riders can enjoy the smoothness and low-maintenance of a belt drive while still getting effortless shifting. It also means that the bike can shift at a standstill, which is useful for cargo e-bikes that carry heavy loads.The CAKE Åik rolls on 20″ x 3.0″ tires and features Tektro Auriga four-piston hydraulic disc brakes on large 203 x 2.3 mm rotors. There’s no suspension to be seen, so those 3-inch tires are going to be doing the brunt of the shock absorption. The frame is a single size step-thru model that is recommended for rider heights from 150-195 cm (4’11” to 6’5″), so basically everyone.The bike features a USB-C charging port to power your personal electronics and includes surround LED lighting.For connectivity, the CAKE Åik features a telematics unit with GPS, Bluetooth, and GSM connections that is compatible with the Cake App, Cake Fleet Management App, and external API integration. To keep the bike yours, anti-theft features include a GPS-activated alarm and tracking, as well as security screws for both wheels and an anti-theft seat clamp so no one walks off with your saddle.If you’re thinking, “Well this looks great, but surely it’s expensive,” then you don’t even know the half of it. The CAKE Åik starts at a healthy US $6,470 with a single battery and without the extra “:Work” series accessories. Extra batteries cost US $780 each, plus another couple hundred bucks for the docks and wiring to run them in parallel (though you could also just swap them in one at a time). If that seems pricey, well, it is. But it’s also probably not meant for you. CAKE is largely targeting commercial customers with its “:Work” line, as the company’s CEO Stefan Ytterborn explained:With Åik joining the :work series lineup, we’re now offering a complete assortment of electric two-wheeled solutions for any business in need of a transportation solution. Our range is optimized for artisanal needs, from the fastest deliveries in town through to surveillance work in the backcountry.Nice, we're starting to cross over the 2 kWh ebike threshold. Since legally, there's not much more room for power and speed, battery capacity was the only way to go up.It’s great to see CAKE expanding its product line so widely, from full motorcycles to mopeds to kids e-bikes and now adult utility e-bikes. But hot damn is that an expensive bike!Sure, you’ve got that European design and manufacturing. But where is the rest of that cost coming from? They saved a few bucks with the lack of suspension, though I can see the argument that a rigid frame will be much more durable over the years. Price tag aside, it really does look like a great bike. For a business that uses a vehicle for eight hours a day, five days a week and 52 weeks a year, a high quality e-bike is necessary to withstand that kind of punishment. It’s like the difference between the truck your neighbor bought to do grocery shopping and the truck a towing company buys. Without seeing the Åik in person yet or testing it myself, I can’t say for sure that it’s built to that level. But that certainly seems like the target CAKE is aiming for here. Here’s to hoping they put one under me so I can give it a test. Perhaps I need to sign myself up for DoorDash soon…",ebikes
2023/01/04,"It seems like there’s an electric version of just about every type of bicycle out there. There are eMTBs, e-cruisers, e-folders, and even e-road bikes. But somehow, BMX bikes missed the electric memo. Or at least they had until SWFT came along with an old-school classic sporting a new-school take. And at just $999, the SWFT BMX won’t break the bank.We’ve occasionally seen some e-bikes get close, but none have carried quite the same skatepark nostalgia as this one.The bike seems to check most of the classic BMX boxes. It’s all there with a short frame, tall bars, 20-inch wheels, rigid fork, front and rear pegs, single-speed drivetrain and flat black paint job.Of course, there’s more than just meets the eye, and that includes a complete Class 2 electric bicycle drivetrain hidden in the SWFT BMX.The rear hub houses a 350W motor that can be controlled using either the handlebar-mounted half-twist throttle or pedal assist. A cadence sensor at the wheels helps measure pedaling speed if you want to get your pedaling on, or the throttle makes it easy to sit back and relax while the bike speeds off at up to 20 mph (32 km/h).There’s a lithium-ion battery built right into the frame’s downtube that is said to offer a maximum range of 35 miles (56 km). But considering it’s just a 36V 7.5Ah battery with a mere 270 Wh of capacity, that 35-mile range estimate is starting to sound a bit lofty. If you plan to throttle around at a higher speed often, there’s a decent chance you’ll cut that range in half or more. Still, the small battery and lower power motor help keep the weight down to just 39.7 pounds (18 kg). I say “just” because that’s quite lightweight compared to most electric bicycles. And remember that the SWFT BMX comes with heavy components, like a steel fork, steel handlebars, four foot pegs, and thick 14mm axles. So that sub-40-pound weight is fairly admirable, all things considered.Considering that you’ll have to bring the entire e-bike inside to charge due to the lack of a removable battery, it’s a good thing it’s fairly lightweight.In addition to the usual suspects, there are a few extra parts you won’t find on most old school BMX bikes, like the rear disc brake, front LED headlight, or even the kickstand. But then again, while this may look like a classic BMX bike, it’s not really meant for going totally wild. Before you snag that saddle between your knees and go for a double barspin, know that the company isn’t suggesting you really push it too far with the stunts:Because of throttle and display wires, the handlebar cannot spin 360 degrees. This e-bike is in the BMX style, but not designed for professional tricks or stunts.The SWFT BMX likely won’t be heading for the X-Games any time soon, but the launch video still shows it getting some pretty decent air (for an e-bike) in a skate park.Considering that the bike is likely designed for those who grew up on BMX bikes and just want a similarly-styled, lightweight, and maneuverable ride with the benefit of electric assist, that’s probably good enough.The SWFT BMX has just launched and is already shipping. It’s priced at $999 on SWFT’s website, but you can actually score it for an even better price of just $735 on BestBuy’s site.Yes! This thing looks awesome! Sure, it’s low power and low battery capacity, but that’s not really the point of a bike like this. If you’re looking for a BMX-style bike, then you obviously aren’t afraid of spinning a pedal or two. So the modest assistance is going to feel like a major upgrade to the BMX from your younger days.And when it comes to just having something simple that you can ride to the park and back before tossing in the corner of your garage or back of your truck, this is hard to beat. With few parts to wear out (no suspension, no shifter, only one brake), there’s just less to fuss with or worry about. This certainly will be a niche product for a certain type of rider, but it’s cool to see that it exists (and that it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg).",ebikes
2023/01/01,"Single-piece bike frames aren’t new, but it’s rare to see a full-suspension folding e-bike built on a one-piece magnesium alloy frame. That didn’t stop Heybike from chasing that dream and coming up with the Heybike Tyson folding electric bike.The new e-bike was just unveiled ahead of its first public showing at CES 2023. It joins a number of other Heybike electric bicycles that the company has debuted over the last few years.Unlike the other models in its family tree, the Heybike Tyson has a completely new design and structure.The unibody construction of the bike is claimed to be a first in its category, but this isn’t just about setting records. The design is also said to help reduce weight while increasing the durability of the e-bike. Based on recent reports of e-bikes suffering in the durability department, anything that can be done to increase longevity is likely a prudent investment.Heybike cofounder William Li discussed the advantages of the bike ahead of its upcoming public debut:We’re very excited to launch Tyson during CES 2023. We designed this product to give riders the ultimate in aesthetics and convenience while delivering a riding experience like none other. Tyson is not only gorgeous, it’s also strong thanks to the innovative one-piece magnesium alloy construction. As with all Heybike products, riders can feel the superior quality and durability in every aspect of the product. Tyson’s unique frame geometry and folding unibody provide strength and aesthetics while also allowing the bike to be smaller and easier to fit into small spaces. All this, plus a powerful 750-watt motor makes Tyson the perfect balance of form and function.The mag wheels are spokeless to reduce maintenance. The rear wheel hides away a small format 750W hub motor behind a 7-speed gear cluster.We don’t yet know if the bike will be limited to Class 2 speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) or if Heybike will allow it to reach Class 3 speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h). It will come with a thumb throttle, though, which will keep the bike in step with the rest of the Class 2 e-bikes in the company’s lineup.The Heybike Tyson will also include a 48V 15Ah battery with 720 Wh of capacity. The company claims a maximum range of 55 miles (88 km) on pedal assist, though we haven’t been able to independently confirm those figures.The 77-pound (35 kg) electric bike is still quite heavy, so it’s not clear how much weight was saved by going with a unibody design (and, of course, the rear swingarm adds a second frame segment, not to mention the heavy suspension components). Despite that heavy weight — or perhaps because of it — the bike is said to be able to carry a maximum weight on the rear rack of 120 pounds (55 kg). With that much weight capacity on the rear rack, it could likely also do double duty as a family bike for dropping off kids at school. (Child seat not included.)Those who would prefer to get a bit wilder on the bike and hit the trails will be happy to see that the Heybike Tyson includes both front and rear suspension. That front fork is apparently a hydraulic suspension fork, so it should actually be fairly decent and not like the cheap springer forks we often see on budget e-bikes. The rear suspension doesn’t look quite as fancy, so don’t expect to jump this bike off a loading dock and walk away unscathed.Between the suspension and the four-inch fat tires, though, the bike should float over most terrain imperfections better than a typical hybrid or leisure e-bike.Hydraulic disc brakes also come standard on the e-bike, making sure riders can stop quickly and safely.There’s no word yet regarding what they’ll charge for the bike, but we’d expect to see the Heybike Tyson on the company’s site soon, price and all.What do you think of the Tyson? Let’s hear about it in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/12/30,"America has an SUV problem. Or rather, just a big vehicle problem in general. The land of SUVs and pickup trucks has somehow been tricked into thinking you need a 4,000-pound vehicle to carry 20 pounds of groceries home from the supermarket.But there’s a better way, and it’s called an electric cargo bike. It will save you money. It will save you time. It will make you more attractive. And it will make you happier. I all but guarantee it.Now let’s be clear about something. When I say “You don’t need an SUV,” I’m speaking in general terms. It’s true – generally – for most people reading this article right now. Sure, there are some of you that regularly transport seven people across vast distances on highway and interstates. But most of us don’t. It’s a simple numbers game. Most people in the US live in cities and urban centers. And that’s why you don’t need a massive SUV. And even for those that do “need” an SUV for certain specific tasks, you don’t need it most of the time. I’d bet dollars to donuts that most people reading this right now who own an SUV do most of their trips in it with just one or two passengers.For those that really need a car, you probably only need a small hatchback or sedan. But I’m going to make the case for why you probably don’t even need that, or at least not for most of your trips. Especially when you consider just how far electric cargo bikes have come.Twenty years ago, a cargo bike was a nifty invention and fun to look at, but they cost a fortune and lord help you if you ever had to pedal one up a hill.But electric bikes have come to the rescue. Electric motors now allow e-bike builders to make cargo bikes that are easier to pedal up hills (or that don’t require any pedaling at all in the case of throttle-enabled electric cargo bikes). Prices are also quickly dropping, meaning you can get a great cargo e-bike for a song. Instead of buying an expensive second car, you can probably get away with one car and one cargo e-bike.There are two main styles of cargo e-bikes: front-loaders and longtails. (Technically there are also cargo e-trikes as well, but we’ll leave three-wheelers for another discussion soon.)Front-loaders have a big cargo area in the front and are generally more expensive due to the funky frame and complicated steering linkage that front loaders require.Longtails look more like a normal bike but have loooooong rear ends that are stretched to give more rack and seat space behind the rider.Front-loaders are a bit more advanced and can take more time to get acclimated to, as the rider is much farther from the front wheel than they’re probably used to. If you’re new to cargo bikes, a longtail is probably a better place to start. Both offer great cargo space, they just do it differently.Okay, so cargo e-bikes sound neat and all. But c’mon, can they really replace cars and trucks? Yes, for most people they can. And you might balk at that, but there’s a reason why I’m confidently correct here. It’s true because most people don’t use their SUVs to explore to the Amazon. They use them to go buy the stuff they can’t find on Amazon.Picking up groceries. Dropping off a kid or two at school. Driving to work. These are all normal, everyday tasks that for some reason people think requires heavy machinery. Which is as ridiculous as it is depressing. If you live in a city and you drive a massive car, then you’re probably in the wrong. Unless you’ve got several dozen 2×4’s hanging out the back of that truck or the entire starting lineup from little Jimmy’s T-ball team in your SUV, then you don’t need that massive vehicle.I’ve actually used cargo e-bikes to carry construction material before, including bags of cement and dimensional lumber. It’s just not that hard.And I’ve carried multiple passengers on them as well. Three people on a cargo e-bike is pretty standard, though it helps when one or two of those extra souls are also children.A reddit commenter in a walkable cities advocacy group recently put it best. As the redditor explained, “Are there viable bikes that can replace the true power and utility of an SUV? Not even close. Are there bikes that can replace what 99% of drivers use their SUVs for 99% of the time? Absolutely.”Now again, there are going to be those people who say, “But I need my truck, I use it for XYZ that a bike can’t do!”And I get it. There are some big jobs out there. My sister runs a furniture refinishing business and regularly hauls dressers, desks, and other big things around town.But then again, maybe you’re just still stuck in that “I need a car to do this” mentality. Did you know there are actually moving companies that work entirely by bicycle? They’ll move your apartment without getting trucks involved.When there’s a will (and a cargo bike), there’s a way.Not only can cargo e-bikes do most of what most people use their SUVs and trucks for, but they do it cheaper.The hundreds of dollars per month that your truck or SUV burns in gasoline would equate to probably less than a dollar of electricity to power an electric cargo bike. If you do some serious mileage then you might be looking at as much as two dollars of electricity per month. And don’t forget the hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of dollars you’ll save each month on parking, insurance, car payments, maintenance, and all the other costs associated with car ownership.Even the purchase price is usually 10x less. If you go nuts with the best electric cargo bikes out there from the highest dollar manufacturers, you could be looking at expensive $8,000 e-bikes. But if you are more reasonable, there are great options in the $4,000 range and still very good options in the sub-$2,000 range.Heck, you can even get close to $1,000 if you really try. Take for example the $999 Lectric XP 3.0. It’s not a cargo e-bike (but rather a fat-tire folding e-bike), though it turns into a cargo bike when you add the $110 cargo package. Or add the $74 passenger package to easily carry a second adult rider on the bike.Other affordable e-bikes like the Rad Power Bikes RadRunner 2 (or RadRunner Plus shown in the video above) are purpose-built for carrying passengers and offer a comfortable way to bring a friend or loved one on back. You can even fit two riders on the back of a RadRunner as long as they’re fairly small.Why drive to dinner in a massive car when you and your wife could zip there on an e-bike built for two? Add a little excitement and adventure into date night!Let’s get real: Most people could do most of their daily travel needs in a city on an e-bike. But because of the world we live in, that doesn’t mean that a car can be totally replaced all the time.For some people, that means not owning a car and occasionally using a car sharing service for the once-in-a-while Ikea trip or other car-related journey. My wife and I did that for years. If we needed a car for a couple hours here and there, we rented a car for a couple hours. It was waiting on the street corner and that’s where we left it when we were done. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. That is quite a statement. In my state the vast majority live in suburban areas where bikes are not only not practical but often outright dangerous. Maybe if there was a separate infrastructure for bikes it would be ok but there are a lot of 45+ mph roads with no bike lanes.For others that still use a car somewhat frequently, perhaps that means having one family car but getting an e-bike instead of a second car. And of course, that also means trying to use the e-bike for as many trips as possible.If you live at the end of a 3-mile private driveway that connects to a 70 mph six-lane highway, then an e-bike probably can’t be your only vehicle. But you also don’t exist because that’s a silly made-up scenario that the anti-anti-car crowd tends to think is all too common. In reality, of course there are people that an e-bike won’t work for and of course there are still some cases where a big vehicle may be necessary. But those people and those cases are much fewer and farther between than most will realize. Sometimes it just takes looking at the problem from another angle.The cargo e-bike angle.",ebikes
2022/12/28,"Denver grabbed headlines earlier this year when it launched an ambitious program to help city residents replace cars with e-bikes. Now the city is struggling to ensure it can provide sufficient cycling infrastructure to support the influx of electric bikes.The program initially offered generous rebates from $400 to $900 off the price of a new e-bike depending on the style of bike, with cargo e-bikes receiving higher incentives. Low-income city residents were offered even higher incentives of $1,200 toward the price of an electric bike.Unlike mail-in rebates or e-bike tax credits, Denver’s program used point-of-sale rebates that were applied instantly, making it easier for new riders to afford what can often be expensive electric bikes.The goal of the program was to help get more of these car-replacing electric bikes out onto Denver’s streets to cut down on traffic and reduce emission-spewing vehicle use.Nearly 5,000 electric bikes have been purchased as part of the program, with around half of those e-bikes going to low-income riders.It’s been widely praised as a successful model for increasing the adoption rate of low-impact alternative vehicles. But it’s also shined a light on another issue surrounding personal EVs like e-bikes and e-scooters: that they require investment in infrastructure to make riders feel safe using them.E-bikes can usually travel at speeds of 20-28 mph (32-45 km/h), which makes them better able to keep up with cars.But not all riders want to mix it up with traffic in the roadways. Bike lanes help encourage commuters to use bikes, scooters, skateboards, and other light vehicles by providing a safer environment away from the heavy machinery regularly used by car drivers. Denver poured millions of dollars into its e-bike rebate program, successfully putting thousands of new e-bikes on the road. Now the city is working on building enough bike lanes to help those riders feel safe and protected while using their new wheels.The city already had nearly 200 miles of bike lanes when Mayor Michael Hancock outlined a plan to install another 125 miles of bike lanes in 2018. Denver is now nearing completion of that pledge with over 300 miles of bike lanes spread across the city.The problem is that not all bike lanes are created equal. Some keep riders safer than others.Much of the current cycling infrastructure is classified as “unprotected” bike lanes, which are usually just a painted line designated the road shoulder for bike. Several dozen miles of the city’s bike lanes have been installed with physical barriers such as poles and other devices separating bikes from the main traffic lanes of major roads and creating protected bike lanes.While unprotected bike lanes are a step in the right direction by demarcating part of the road for bikes only, many riders including Denver Bicycle Lobby member David Mintzer feel they don’t go far enough. As he explained to The Denver Post:“My biggest issue with the 125 miles of bikeways that the city is touting is that most of them are unprotected and they’re still having bicycles mix with traffic. As they stand now, they are not comfortable for new riders.”Many locals agree and have been pushing the city to install more protected bike lanes, with the e-bike rebates creating a renewed push for improved cycling infrastructure.The city seems to be taking notice.According to City councilman Chris Hinds:“We are in some ways a victim of our own success in our bike infrastructure. We wouldn’t have had these questions if not for the e-bike rebate program that has put a lot of e-bikes in our bikeways. It is time to take a look at that infrastructure.”I actually see this as a good thing. Sure, we all want cities to proactively install proper cycling infrastructure. But without a mass of riders to demonstrate the need, it can be hard to make the case in a way that those who control the purse strings can truly understand. It’s a chicken and egg, but sometimes they need to see either the chicken or the egg to get something rolling.In Denver’s case, now that there are suddenly thousands of more e-bikes riding around, and that seems to be making an impact on city officials. The time has come to not just speed up the pace of bike lane installation, but to plan ahead for protected bike lanes that make everyone safer. The more comfortable people feel riding, the more they’ll ride. And the more they ride, the more everyone wins. Yes, even car drivers win too.",ebikes
2022/12/27,"HeyBike has built a name for itself over the last year or two with a growing number of low-cost electric bikes. And while the brand can’t hope to compete on reputation with the US market’s major players, it sure can compete on price. Meet the $1,299 HeyBike Cityrun electric bike.You may be surprised by just what you get from the HeyBike Cityrun.It doesn’t come with the name recognition of other famous city e-bikes, but it has some pretty darn nice features for the price.Components like hydraulic disc brakes, turn signals, hydraulic suspension, and a sturdy rear rack add value to the bike by offering features normally reserved for higher-dollar e-bikes or held back as add-on accessories by other brands.Take a look at my video review below to get an up-close look at my test-riding experience on the HeyBike Cityrun. Then keep scrolling for my complete writeup.Compared to some other major city-inspired electric bikes out there, the HeyBike Cityrun has a lot to offer.Many of the components on the bike are a cut above what I’d except at this price range.It’s not strange to see suspension on a $1,299 e-bike, but the bike’s decent hydraulic suspension fork is a bit of a surprise when many other brands use cheaper spring forks.Disc brakes are pretty much standard on almost all e-bikes these days outside of a few lightweight exceptions, but you’ll usually see mechanical disc brakes at this price point. The Cityrun ups the ante with hydraulic disc brakes that provide higher stopping power with less hand fatigue. They’re also a maintenance boon, in the sense that you don’t really have to do any maintenance on them. Regular mechanical disc brakes will eventually need adjustments as the cables stretch over time, but the hydraulic fluid in juice brakes like these keeps them perfectly tuned until you’ve finally worn down the brake pads.The commuter trifecta of LED lighting (with automatic headlight), included fenders, and a robust rear rack (with 120 lb. or 54 kg weight rating) are great to see, especially since many companies hold back racks and fenders behind a paywall (and some don’t even include lights!). But the HeyBike Cityrun adds a fourth member to my usual commuter trifecta, including a horn as well.Technically there’s a fifth member too if you count the turn signals, though I tend to think turn signals on e-bikes are a bit of a gimmick since they are usually so close together that drivers and other cyclists often don’t realize they are turn signals. I still use hand signals, which are much clearer.One other note about the horn: It’s kind of nice to have it, but I don’t like that it completely replaced a bell. I think it is still important to have a bike bell on e-bikes because pedestrians are fairly well trained to recognize a bike bell’s signature sound. An electric bike horn is foreign to most people, but everyone knows the “ding ding” of a bike bell means get out of the way if you don’t want to take a handlebar to the kidney. Chargers are often an overlooked component on many e-bikes since we take for granted that they all come with any old charger. But the HeyBike Cityrun includes a higher-power 4A charger that will reduce charge times to around four hours, which is faster than most e-bikes.The decently large 48V 15Ah battery offers 720 Wh of capacity, which should get you around 30 miles (48 km) or so of throttle-only riding if you’re moving quickly, or a bit more if you’re throttling around at less than the bike’s 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed.They claim a 55-mile (89 km) range, which may be possible on the lightest pedal assist level, but most people aren’t going to keep the bike in a low enough power level to find out.The 500W rear motor strikes a nice balance between power and efficiency. It’s got decent pickup, but it’s not so powerful that it drains the battery quickly. A good 30+ miles of honest range (and more if you’re riding slower) is respectable.At 62 lb. (28 kg), this certainly isn’t a lightweight e-bike, though it also supports a healthy 350 lb. (159 kg) payload capacity. But you’re getting lots of nice features that have the unfortunate side effect of adding weight. Heavy parts like the rack, suspension fork, 7-speed transmission, large battery, and decently peppy motor don’t help the e-bike out on the scale, but they do make it a nicer bike to ride.And you even get some other features that don’t add much weight at all, such as a Bluetooth connection to allow use with the HeyBike app that tracks rides and lets you monitor your bike’s stats.So while the HeyBike Cityrun isn’t the nicest e-bike out there, its $1,299 price is a surprisingly fair offering for such a well-outfitted electric bike. There are lighter and more powerful options in the market, but the bang-for-your-buck is strong with this offering. I can find faults on the HeyBike Cityrun, but I can’t fault them too hard at this price.",ebikes
2022/12/23,"Electric bicycles are more popular than ever before, helping drivers become riders and replacing car trips along the way. I’m proud to have helped build Electrek into the No. 1 source for electric bike news, and so now it’s time to take look back at the biggest e-bike news stories of 2022. These stories garnered millions of views from around the world, helping to spread e-bike awareness along the way.Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine was sure to be one of the leading stories of 2022. We never thought that would spill over into the e-bike world, but that just means we underestimated Ukrainian ingenuity.The brave fighters in Ukraine’s defense forces teamed up with Ukrainian electric bike manufacturer Delfast to create battle-ready e-bikes that could out-maneuver the Russians. Not only were these fast and powerful electric bikes capable of covering rugged terrain in near silent operation, but they were also outfitted with tank-destroying NLAW rockets (Next Generation Light Anti-Armor Weapons). Those rockets are specially designed to allow a single operator to destroy an enemy tank.The weapons are intended to be human-portable and carried by infantry, but the 28-lb. (12.5 kg) rocket is much easier to haul over long distances when carried on the back of an electric bike.Such portable anti-tank weapons proved to be a game-changer in Ukraine’s fight to defend its sovereign territory from a Russian takeover, but their use isn’t without significant risk. They expose the operator’s position and make them vulnerable to immediate return fire. But when outfitted with a 50 mph (80 km/h) motor, the soldier can quickly fire the weapon and then exfiltrate, significantly reducing the risk.E-bikes are normally tools for good, helping riders get exercise, fresh air, and avoid traffic. But when called upon to face evil, they answered that call in Ukraine. Of course not all news is good news, as was the case with Bolt’s abandonment of thousands upon thousands of shared electric bicycles and scooters in cities around the US.The shared micromobility provider used a model similar to Lime and Bird, where free-floating e-bikes and e-scooters could be rented by the minute using a smartphone application.The idea is solid, though the economics have proven tougher to crack — especially with so many competitors in the field.When Bolt Mobility folded operations in most of cities seemingly overnight, these vehicles were left abandoned. We caught up with the original manufacturer that supplied the e-bikes to Bolt Mobility to hear how they were trying to help. Element LEV, the e-bikes’ manufacturer, was seeking out municipalities in each area where Bolt abandoned its equipment. The manufacturer, which was able to unlock the vehicles, began working with each city individually to find a solution, whether that was through taking the e-bikes public as part of a city-owned program or finding alternative solutions.The iconic motorcycle company Indian teamed up with the equally iconic electric bike manufacturer Super73 back in the spring of 2022 to build an Indian-themed e-bike known as the eFTR Hooligan 1.2.No motorcycle license necessary, since this new electric two-wheeler was legally classified as an electric bicycle.The eFTR Hooligan was largely based on Super73’s well-known S2 electric bike. Electrek’s publisher Seth Weintraub and I had the chance to put some serious miles on that bike when we Eurotripped it across Germany last autumn.We haven’t had a chance to test the Indian version in the eFTR Hooligan 1.2, but that’s high up on our list. As Indian explained, the bike was modified by adding an inverted front fork, mid-height moto-style handlebars, a unique LED headlight with an FTR-inspired wind deflector, and more aggressive tires. The eFTR Hooligan 1.2 also ditched the stock front and rear fenders, lowered the battery to the downtube (which likely resulted in improved balance), and added a gold chain to give it that authentic Indian Motorcycle look.That proposed national e-bike tax credit might have faltered before the finish line, but Oregon stepped up to the plate with its own statewide e-bike rebate.A new bill known as Legislative Concept (LC) 1994 was proposed by outgoing Oregon State Representative Karin Power to help provide rebates to e-bike buyers. It was recently passed off to Representative Dacia Grayber to sponsor the bill in the upcoming session.We don’t know for sure yet whether the rebate will make it into law. But if it does, it will offer up to $1,200 off most electric bikes and up to $1,700 off cargo electric bikes.There are a few other small rules for qualification, such as that the bikes have to cost at least $950, but there aren’t any income restrictions or other major hurdles to access.Oregon could soon join other states such as Vermont and New York that have either implemented or are in the process of creating their own statewide electric bicycle rebate programs.NIU is better known for its wildly popular smart electric scooters, which have taken off in Asia and continue to post strong sales in the European and North American markets. But the company’s tech has also been making its way into a wider range of lighter electric vehicles. Earlier this year NIU launched an electric bicycle that turned heads in the e-bike industry.The NIU BQi used a step-through design, though it did so without falling back on a Dutch bike design or something that looks like a classic “women’s bike.”The U-shaped frame made the bike easier to mount and easier to handle when the rear rack gets loaded down with heavy cargo or kids. Another advantage of that unique frame was a unique way to store batteries. Yes, “batteries” as in plural. While the vast majority of all e-bikes use a single removable battery, NIU’s unique frame design made it easy to fit two batteries. And it managed to stuff in dual batteries without looking bulky or disproportioned.The bike eventually launched at a price of $1,999, putting it in the higher end of the value e-bike category.Those were the five biggest e-bike news stories of the year for 2022, but who knows what we’ll see next year. As the electric bicycle industry continues to grow, we could have a whole host of new designs, new technology, or even new scandals awaiting next year. Here’s hoping for more of the first two!

2022/12/22,"When people think of electric trikes, they tend to conjure up images of traditional delta-style trikes with two wheels in the back. But tadpole-style trikes, also known as reverse trikes, are much more stable in turns. They’ve generally been quite pricey, but the recently unveiled TerraTrike Charge is helping pull those prices down to more affordable territory than the bike store recumbent e-trikes that cost several thousand dollars more.This isn’t TerraTrike’s first e-trike, not by a long shot. The company was one of the first on the scene with an electric trike back in 2014.More recently, TerraTrike’s EVO recumbent tadpole trike made waves in the industry. That e-trike uses a stable and maneuverable platform with a reclined seating position for ultimate comfort. But the sophisticated design and Bosch drivetrain kept the price fairly lofty at around $5,000.Now the company has revealed the new TerraTrike Charge at a much more attractive price of $3,249.The Charge still uses a recumbent tadpole trike design, letting riders make quick and agile turns without feeling like they’ll tip over. But the Charge also adopts more price-conscious design notes like a rear hub motor to replace the pricier Bosch mid-drive setup.It may look like a fun little three-wheeled go-kart, but don’t expect the 57-pound (26 kg) TerraTrike Charge to fly off the line or take the checkered flag. That 250W hub motor from Promovec carries a modest 43 Nm torque rating, which is far from the highest performance we’ve seen in e-bike motors. The 374 Wh battery is also on the lower end of the scale for battery capacity. There’s no word on official range, but the lack of a hand throttle means that efficient pedal assist is your only option and should result in decent range. The 8-speed transmission should make pedaling pretty easy, as will that electric assist motor.The trike’s design puts recreational and leisure riding front and center, meaning the humble performance is in line with the type of riders seeking out recumbent tadpole trikes.As TerraTrike sales and marketing director Marshall Randall explained:This new Charge is going to open doors for so many riders wishing to extend their riding range with the addition of e-assist and the comfort a tadpole trike brings. We’re seeing a number of new offerings in the more upright delta style e-trikes, where you have two wheels in back, which is great, but we’re confident that riders wishing for a bit more comfort, stability and performance will fall in love with the benefits of the Charge.A major advantage of tadpole recumbent trikes is that they are designed to be comfortable for all body types, and especially for those riders that don’t enjoy the prospect of sitting on a small bicycle seat with an upright ride posture. In fact, the seating position of the Charge puts the rider closer to the center of the wheel axle and lowers the overall center of gravity of the bike/rider combo, helping to increase stability over upright e-trikes. Compared to delta trikes with two rear wheels, the tadpole design with two front wheels is much more stable in corners and helps reduce or remove that tipping feeling when turning sharply.And while tadpole trikes normally cost a pretty penny, Randall is proud of the Charge’s lower entry price compared to the rest of the industry.I’ve never been so proud of a price-point trike. People of all ages and abilities can now enjoy the comfort, safety and just the pure fun of an e-assist trike at a lower cost of entry than we’ve ever been able to offer.Electric trikes are coming into their own this year as several new models hit the market. Addmotor recently upgraded its M340 electric trike and Rad Power Bikes entered the market with its first-ever consumer-facing electric trike, the RadTrike. Wilder designs like sidecar e-bikes are even making electric trikes fun and edgy for younger audiences.E-trikes are of course not a new format, as evidenced by TerraTrike’s work in the space since 2014. But electric trikes are now finally getting the attention they’ve long deserved as alternative e-bike platforms that offer advantages in stability, cargo capacity, and accessibility.",ebikes
2022/12/21,"Have you been riding an e-bike all year and now are wondering if you can keep it up even into the cold and dark months? Don’t worry, it’s certainly possible to ride an e-bike all year round. But since the winter months throw extra challenges our way, you’ll want to take a few extra steps to be prepared. We checked in with several leading electric bicycle manufacturers to get the best tips for riding e-bikes in the winter.The most important component on your e-bike is the battery. It’s also the most expensive and the part the requires the most care. That care is especially critical in cold temperatures.The most important thing to remember is to not leave your battery outside in the cold for lengthy periods of time. One night sitting outside won’t kill your battery, so don’t freak out if you forget it. But it’s not good for its long-term life cycle to make a habit out of letting it sit in cold, wet environments. It’s also critical to note that you should never charge the battery when its temperature is below freezing (32ºF or 0ºC).Electric bike company VanMoof explained that a “battery can’t charge below 32ºF or 0ºC. That’s why it’s even better to store your bike inside at room temperature when temperatures outside hit an extreme low — it’ll charge better and take you farther on those winter rides.”Of course if your e-bike has a removable battery, you can just bring the battery inside. If there’s space though, your entire e-bike will appreciate coming in from the cold, harsh winter weather. If you’ve got an e-bike with a built-in battery that isn’t quickly removable, it’s extra important that you bring the entire bike inside.If you’re one of those people that end up riding less in winter (or not at all), you’ll definitely want to store your battery inside during those long winter months. You should avoid storing it with a full charge though, as it’s not as healthy for the battery. Experts still debate the optimal storage voltage for batteries (usually claiming something in the 40-80% state-of-charge range), but it is generally accepted that a half charge is a good storage level. That’s exactly what e-bike manufacturer Juiced Bikes recommends.As the company explained:Ideally, you want to keep your charge at about 50% capacity when storing. Now, the battery will self-discharge over time – so if you’re not riding for two months or more, be sure to check the charge every so often and charge back up to 50% when needed.VanMoof also says that it’s important to wipe down your e-bike after riding to remove salty mud or snow. Most e-bikes use rust-resistant components, but there are still many areas that can corrode if left with a salty glaze.Again, you don’t have to go crazy with your routine.  But occasionally adding some soap into the mix can help better remove the nasty things that winter likes to stick to your bike. As VanMoof explained, “If you ride every day, give your bike a weekly wipe-down with some water and soap.”I’ve been testing out the Muc-Off “Clean – Protect – Lube” kit for e-bikes, and it’s got a nice set of cleaning and lubrication products to keep your bike looking good and lasting through those rough winter months. I even included it in my e-bike lover’s stocking stuffer gift guide yesterday.Juiced Bikes also recommends starting slow with rides, especially if this is your first winter on an e-bike.As the company continued:Riding in the winter is NOT like riding during other seasons. When you go out on your first winter ride, it’s essential to start off slow and acknowledge your experience level. Newbies should take a test ride without the motor on at first, just to get a feel for the terrain. No matter what, drive more slowly than you would in the summer and always give yourself more time for braking. You never know when you may hit a patch of black ice!Ice can be a serious issue for e-bikes. While cars simply spin, e-bikes don’t have the advantage of four-wheel stability. Losing traction on ice usually means going down hard.To avoid that, Juiced Bikes recommends choosing winter tires based on the type of riding you do:Change your tires to studded models for hard-packed snow and ice or fat knobby tires for softer snow. You may even want to heat-shrink your cable connections and LCD screen for extra protection from rain and snow. Canadian-based electric bicycle company Biktrix’s founder Roshan Thomas described to Electrek how fat tires are probably your best option when riding in loose snow.The increased air volume allows riders to run lower tire pressure, which work better for loose terrain like snow, sand, and loose dirt.As he explained:A common 26″x4″, or 26″x4.8″, or 27.5″x4″ fat tire works amazing in the snow because you can run these at very low pressures. I find that 5-20 PSI makes the rubber just float on the snow. For riding conditions where there is underlying ice, it’s best to get these tires studded.Rad Power Bikes described how the short days and limited visibility in winter can mean that bike lighting is more important than ever.As the company explained:In high traffic areas or roadways that require boosted lighting – such as trails absent of lampposts – additional brightness may help you navigate the winter months.Most e-bikes come with LED lighting that runs off the main battery, but adding stronger lights can be a good idea.Rad offers more powerful e-bike lights with twice the lumens that can be swapped out for the basic lights that come with each bike.Other companies also offer higher-power light upgrades, so it’s worth checking if your e-bike has that option. If not, some powerful mountain bike lights are a good idea. I’ve also tested the RedShift Arclight pedals as well and those are amazing for good lighting at night, winter or summer. They’re pricer at $140 but 100% worth it.Rad Power Bikes also points out how important it is to dress for the weather:Ever biked in cold temperatures without gloves? Pro tip: don’t. Frostbite is a real condition that can happily be avoided with water-resistant gloves, apparel, and shoes.Your hands are exposed to the air rushing around the handlebars, quickly chilling fingers to the bone. Even good gloves can get chilly after a while. When I ride a bike with a thumb throttle in the winter, my thumb often starts to freeze since it is held down below the bars and away from my fist. Even with the warmest options for gloves, you have to pay the price of big and bulky hands that can make it hard to operate the brakes and shifters.Bar mitts are a great alternative option. They mount on the handlebars and protect your hands from the rushing cold air. That means you can get away with wearing normal, lighter gloves like you’d use on a normal day when not riding. Rad offers their own version that has extra-wide hand holes to better accommodate the sleeves of your coat.Don’t forget to protect your neck too! An old-fashioned scarf works well, but a tube scarf/neck gaiter or even a balaclava are better options. Both can protect the lower half of your face better than a typical scarf, and the balaclava can pretty much cover everything. Or you could go full bank robber with a ski mask.If you want to keep riding your e-bike throughout the winter, then go for it! It’s definitely possible, but you’ll want to make sure you consider these important tips to take care of your e-bike and yourself.Stay safe out there this winter and happy trails!",ebikes
2022/12/20,"Ikea is no stranger to embracing efficient technologies that help reduce the brand’s carbon footprint. The latest big move from the Allen-wrench-included furniture maker sees the company using three-wheeled electric bikes with solar panels for a home delivery pilot.The testing has been part of a program run by the Delft Ikea store in The Netherlands.The pilot included a bright yellow and blue IKEA-branded electric trike used for deliveries in urban areas around the store.According to a release from the company, the success of the pilot program has led IKEA to expand the use of e-trikes for home deliveries around the world:After evaluating the pilot, the worldwide IKEA franchisor (Inter IKEA Systems B.V.) now has decided to scale up and give all IKEA retailers around the world the possibility to add a more sustainable, accessible and cost-effective alternative to their home delivery fleet within their market.You might be wondering just how many of IKEA’s large products can actually fit into a cargo e-trike’s storage box.As it turns out, the vast majority of the company’s product line is compatible with the bike.As explained by Helene Davidsson, Sustainability Manager, Inter IKEA Systems B.V.:This Sunrider bike can accommodate roughly 90% of the IKEA product range and emits 98% less CO2 than modern diesel vans. For IKEA, it’s important to explore new ways to improve the service offer for the customers, both from a more sustainable, affordable and accessible perspective. The solar-powered cargo bike does all that.The electric cargo trike, known as the SunRider, has a range of around 100 km (62 miles) per charge. The solar panels surely help with that range, though the side-mounted panels might not be in the optimal position for peak energy generation.The e-bike is no lightweight, rated for carrying a payload of up to 150 kg (330 lbs.). It was also piloted in Vilnius, Lithuania, though there IKEA customers were limited to orders weighing up to 30 kg (66 lbs.), presumably to ensure multiple orders could be delivered in a single trip.The bike itself looks to feature a front hub motor, which is common among value-oriented electric trikes. Mid-drive motors are more popular in European cargo trikes, though they significantly increase the price of the vehicle.In the US, electric trikes with front hub motors are starting to come into their own. Multiple companies have unveiled updated models that provide a more stable platform for riders that have trouble balancing or for those that want a three-wheeled setup for hauling heavy or bulky cargo.The RadTrike is one of the most well-known of recent e-trike launches, marking the first major manufacturer in the US to tackle electric three-wheelers. Until then, most other e-trikes were either produced by smaller boutique brands or imported by lesser known Asian e-bike companies.When it comes to true heavy-duty cargo e-trikes that are designed for commercial use, the Europeans still seem to take the cake. We’ve tested some massive cargo e-trikes in Europe before that feel more like trucks on bike wheels. Those types of heavy-duty cargo e-trikes are proving popular among delivery companies and other commercial customers.What do you think of IKEA’s cargo e-trike? Check it out in action in the video below, then let us hear your thoughts in the comment section at the end of this article!",ebikes
2022/12/18,"The FREY CC Fat is the latest evolution of FREY Bike’s popular CC model. What started out as a full-suspension commuter bike gained fat tires earlier this year to turn into a dual-use commuter and trail bike. But this is no ordinary full-suspension fat-tire bike. Instead, it comes loaded with high-quality parts and a ridiculously powerful motor.We’ve seen plenty of fat-tire full-suspension e-bikes before. They’re usually in the $2,500–$3,500 range, though we’ve been lucky to see a few budget options slip under the $2K mark.The FREY CC Fat is nothing like those other e-bikes. And the price reflects that. Coming in at just under $4,500 at its current sale price, the FREY CC Fat is a high-end e-bike that brings comfort riding to the trails with the proper parts to match.Take a look at my video review below to see what this e-bike can do on and off the dirt. Then keep reading for my in-depth written review.FREY’s reputation precedes it, with the brand being known for building quality full-suspension electric bikes that rival those from big name companies, yet at half the price.There are two main differences though. Despite FREY bikes using many of the same components, they’re made at the company’s factory in Jinhua, China, instead of at some European facility. And they’re much, much more powerful. I toured FREY’s factory in 2019, shortly before China closed off to outsiders. There I was able to test many of the company’s models including the recently released original version of the FREY CC. These guys know how to build top-notch e-bikes, so don’t think you’re getting something second-rate here.The second difference between FREY’s e-bikes and their high-quality European counterparts is that FREY’s models are much, much more powerful.They use Bafang M620 mid-drive motors, which are rated at 1,000W continuous power but actually peak closer to 1,500W of power.That means that the bikes can climb like a billy goat. When they aren’t using that incredible power and torque (peaking at 160 Nm) for climbing, they’re using it to go fast. I’ve hit as much as 36 mph (59 km/h) with this motor, though the bikes come limited to street-legal settings that can be modified in the color LCD display.The mid-drive motor with its torque sensor makes for a great pedaling experience, which isn’t the case on many fat-tire e-bikes that are basically light electric motorcycles with pedals. You can actually have a great experience pedaling the FREY CC Fat, making it both a powerful e-bike for ripping around on trails and a good exercise/fitness e-bike when you want to take it slower and keep it in a low-power mode.As a commuter bike, the FREY CC Fat’s fast top speed on throttle or pedal assist is a big part of its safety, meaning you can take the lane and keep up with city traffic.When you’re on the trails, the power helps overcome obstacles and climb steep terrain. I rarely get going much faster than 25 mph (40 km/h) or so off-road on the Frey CC Fat simply because it’s hard to get going that fast on rough, twisty terrain. The few times I can find a straight stretch of trail to do it sure results in a fun ride, but you also have to be mindful of whether you’re sharing the trails with other people, especially on multi-use trails.The high-end RockShox suspension comes into play when you do take the bike up to higher speeds and hit obstacles like roots and pot holes. Between the fat tires and the full-suspension, you’re going to be able to hit rougher trails and roads at higher speeds than you could on other e-bikes.And the suspension is also a big part of the bike’s comfort, though that’s also due to the geometry. Because the FREY CC was originally designed for commuting, it’s a much more upright ride than FREY’s more mountain-focused e-bikes. I actually prefer a more upright ride and so the FREY CC Fat feels like a nice compromise to me. It’s upright enough to enjoy it recreationally but still gives you good control when you do hit the trails.Now the downside of the fat tires is that the bike isn’t nearly as nimble as others. I’ve taken the FREY CC Fat on the same single track trails that I sliced and diced with the FREY EX Pro. The latter is a dedicated electric mountain bike that is closer to the downhill mountain biking end of the spectrum. And the experience was night and day. The FREY CC Fat’s heavy tires just can’t cut through quick switchbacks the same way. They’re not as responsive on technical terrain. And they just generally feel more sluggish than mid-range mountain bike tires.But that seems okay to me, since the bike isn’t really meant for technical riding. It’s more of a rails-to-trails nature ride type of e-bike. It’s something you can cruise the bike lane with in the city, hop into the car lane in the suburbs, and then hit the nature trails at your local trailhead.In addition to the comfortable but less responsive fat tires, the motor is one other component that comes with both advantages and disadvantages.That powerful motor constantly reminds me that I have to be extra careful with my shifting when using high power modes. FREY outfits the bike with the best chains they can, but no bicycle chain is truly meant for putting 1,500 watts of power through it on a constant basis. So you’re undoubtedly going to wear through chains fast if you use high power and a lot and there’s a real chance that you’ll break a chain if you’re trying to stay in too tall of a gear too often. If there was a way to make this a belt drive e-bike, that’d be the single best improvement to the bike that I can imagine. It would mean that you wouldn’t have to worry about chain stretch or wearing down gear teeth. But I’m not sure there are transmissions out there that can handle it. A nice Rohloff internally geared hub may work, but you’re talking about adding a potential $2,000 or more to the price. Some Rohloff hubs cost $1,500 just for the parts, let alone the belt drive and any markup that would have to follow.So since belt drive doesn’t seem to be on the horizon, I know that I just have to keep proper shifting techniques in mind. That mostly means not shifting under load and not staying in high gear when I don’t need it. It’s tempting to forget those basics when you’re having so much fun and focusing on the trails around you, but it’s important to keep shifting in mind. With plenty of range from a 48V 21Ah battery with 1,008 Wh of capacity, the bike has what it takes to manage the trails or the streets.It’s a well-made, high-quality e-bike with excellent components. It may be heavy at 36 kg or 79 pounds, but it feels much lighter when you’re riding it. If you ever needed to lift it onto a bike rack though, lord help your back.All in all, I’m super impressed with this e-bike. I could have appreciated a fender set or a rear rack, but both can be tricky on full-suspension fat-tire e-bikes. And I’ll ding them for not including LED lights. But the bike is still a blast to ride. It’s got the power and speed of a light electric motorcycle, yet in a fun-to-pedal electric bike. The FREY CC Fat may be expensive, but it’s worth the price. In fact, I’d say it’s worth even more.",ebikes
2022/12/12,"The Eunorau G30 Cargo may not stand out that much from many of the other cargo e-bikes on the market, at least not at first glance. But check out just how many nice little hidden features you get here for the price!I try not to compare everything to Rad Power Bikes, but since they’re the most prolific e-bike maker in the US, sometimes it’s inevitable.If we ignore the small fact that their RadWagon 4 was recalled for a tire and rim issue, then its $1,999 e-bike is basically the most well-known value-level electric cargo bike.Not only does the $1,699 Eunorau G30 e-bike significantly undercut that price, but it also comes with a bunch of nice parts we don’t find on the RadWagon 4.Check out my video review of the G30 e-bike below to see what I mean, then keep reading for my in-depth write-up.All right, let’s break down all the stuff you get here.First, the bike comes with those wooden running boards. That’s a great place to strap on some extra grocery bags or let your kids rest their feet. And that’s usually a $50-$100 added accessory on most other electric cargo bikes. Sometimes a wooden deck on the rear rack makes it a bit harder to lash things down since it covers some of the exposed frame members that can be good for tying rope or hooking bungee cords. But in this case, you still have a number of exposed frame rails on the sides that should be good for tie-downs. Next, there’s a suspension fork. That’s also a rarity on cargo e-bikes.Now to be fair, it’s usually a rarity because most suspension forks just aren’t rated to take the kind of punishing loads that fully loaded e-cargo bikes see on a daily basis.The Eunorau G30 Cargo is rated for 440 pounds (200 kg) of payload, and I don’t know if that fork can handle that much weight for years of use. So maybe that’s a downside in the long term, but it’s certainly a comfort upgrade in the short term.Next, there are several battery options. The standard battery is 48V 14Ah (672 Wh), which is pretty much the industry standard at this point. But you can upgrade it to a 48V 20Ah (960 Wh) battery for more range or even add a second battery to double your range. Some cargo e-bikes have a second battery option, but most don’t.Moving on, we’ve got a top speed of 25 mph (40 km/h)! That’s fast, especially for a cargo bike! Now, is it wise to let people take a bike that could conceivably carry 440 pounds of stuff and souls up to 25 mph? I’m not sure it is. But this is ’Murica, and we do what we want!It should be noted that the out-of-the-box speed is just 20 mph (32 km/h), though there’s a setting in the display to unlock the extra five miles per hour of fun.To mitigate the potential super fast and super heavy scenario I painted above, the Eunorau G30 Cargo also comes with hydraulic disc brakes. Those give it extra stopping power and, frankly, are an important safety consideration on cargo e-bikes, in my opinion.That’s a lot of nice features that are often left off other cargo e-bikes in the market. And considering that the $1,699 price is below most of those other cargo e-bikes, you’re actually getting more for less here. That’s been a hallmark of many of Eunorau’s value-minded electric bikes lately.In terms of the actual ride, the bike is what I’d call “good, not great.” It’s just fine, but it’s not like a comfort cruiser or anything. It sure rides well, and you can get a good pedal stroke, though, thanks to the conventional layout and bike saddle. For those that like to get their workout in, that will be important.Me? To be honest I throttled around a lot during my testing. I wanted to pedal, and I certainly did sometimes. But on a long, heavy bike like this where you’re spending a bit more mental energy keeping track of where your cargo and passengers are, having the throttle is a really nice option. The seven-speed drivetrain will be a boon for those that live in hillier areas, but I basically left it in seventh gear all the time. In flat Florida, it just wasn’t necessary to switch gears very often. When I wanted to pedal from a stop, a slight throttle blip got me moving quickly and meant I only had a few pedal rotations in high gear, which was barely worth downshifting for.With regard to value, I really can’t complain about this e-bike. Sure, it doesn’t come with the massive customer support team you’d get with a larger company. And who knows what happens a year or two from now if you need a new battery (though it’d be easy enough to lop off the battery connector and add your own if you needed one).But for pure bang for your buck, I still can’t believe you get this much cargo e-bike with nice features like suspension and hydraulic disc brakes for just $1,699. That’s a great deal!",ebikes
2022/12/12,"Sure, we’d all love a new e-bike for Christmas. Or for Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa, Chinese New Year, Las Posadas, Boxing Day, or did I miss any other good winter holidays? The point is, an electric bike would be great, but it’s those other small accessories that can really help make the ride even better. So here are some of the smaller but no less important pieces of cycling gear I’ve been testing this year, which just might make a great stocking (or latke) stuffer for the cyclist in your life.If you’re looking for an actual e-bike to give as a gift, we’ve already got a great roundup over here.And just a note, this list includes around a 50/50 mix of gear I’ve bought for testing and gear sent to me for free from the companies. If I bought something, I’ll say it. The rest were media samples. We get sent a lot of crap all year. Only the stuff that’s actually good shakes out in the end to land on this list.So let’s get this party started!The Topeak Ratchet Stick is probably my favorite bike tool of all time. It doesn’t have every tool in the box, but it has most of the hex driver sizes you’ll need for common tasks (adjusting brakes, saddles, racks, etc.), and then the second plastic holder that snaps onto it carries even more drivers that you probably don’t need as often (mostly the Torx drivers). To be honest I don’t even know where the second plastic holder with the other drivers is anymore, I’ve probably long since lost it in the bottom of my bike parts bin. That’s how infrequently I need any of those extra bits. The five drivers that fit in the handle are all that I use on a daily basis.The main part of the tool without the extra bits is a godsend. Not only do you have all of your common drivers in one place, but they fit into a ratchet tool that makes it super easy to install bike parts. Instead of trying to spin an Allen wrench 20 degrees for 100 repetitions until you finally tighten down a bolt, it’s so much easier to use a ratchet. No more pulling off your Allen wrench, resetting it, then turning. The ratchet does it all for you. And the quick direction change lever has you going from tightening to loosening in a second. It’s a bit pricey at $54, but so, so worth it if you are wrenching on your bikes as often as I am.I bought this tool specifically to have the smallest collection of common bike tools possible. It’s perfect. It fits into the watch pocket of my jeans so I forget it’s there, but it’s ready in a second when I quickly need a 5mm Allen or a Phillips head screwdriver. I don’t use the Torx bit much, but it’s great to have that Phillips there in addition to the common metric hex sizes.In fact, it’s not even a bike tool. This is a camera tool meant to be used for adjustments on tripods and other filming equipment. But universality is the whole point of metric bolts, and so whether those bolts are holding a camera quick-release plate or a bike headlight, the tool still works! And it’s just $20, making it a great deal for a tool that puts all of the most common bike drivers in something the size of your thumb.The big flat thing is mostly for screwing in the 1/4-20 tripod plates used in photography, but I often use it as a pry bar. I’m thinking of filing down the end to make it a bit narrower and work as a smaller flat-head screwdriver as well.The Barrage backpack is a cyclist’s dream. The rolltop, waterproof design means you can get caught in a downpour and not worry about your stuff getting wet. The 18-22 liter size (depending how rolltop you get with your rolltop) makes it good as an everyday bag, though sometimes I wish it was a tad bigger.When I do occasionally need to cram more than 22 liters of stuff in the bag, there’s an outer net with adjustable straps for adding bulkier items like a jacket or a helmet. And there are side pockets that are perfect for water bottles, U-locks or other quick-grab items.The orange interior is amazing for trying to find small things you drop inside as it offers an ultra-high contrast background. Never lose your sunglasses or wallet again!There’s even a laptop sleeve that fits up to a 15″ computer. There are a pile of color options to choose from, so you don’t have to go with boring black like me. Each will set you back $160, but good backpacks don’t come cheap. These are well made and come with Chrome Industry’s lifetime guarantee.To be fair, this isn’t really a cycling backpack at all. But I use it as a combined cycling and travel backpack. In fact, it’s the best travel backpack I’ve ever owned and I don’t say that lightly.The high-quality manufacturing, sheer wealth of pockets (both internal and a second smaller front external pocket), and the interior dividers make it a useable daily backpack. It’s got a rain cover for when the sky opens up. It’s got a breathable mesh liner to keep your back from getting (as) sweaty. It’s got handles on the tops and sides in case you need to toss it or carry it like a duffel. At 35 liters, you can start losing stuff in a big backpack. But the Allpa’s dividers make it easy to keep track of small and larger things. That makes the bag perfect for daily bike rides and cross-the-world trips. When you’re biking, it’s got good straps that synch down against you so the bag isn’t bouncing. When you’re traveling it fits as carry-on luggage (and slips under the seat in front of you on most planes that aren’t little regional jets).I’ve had mine in eight countries this year. I’ve had it on countless bikes, scooters, and motorcycles. Hell, I even tied it to the back of an electric street-fighter motorcycle this summer. This bag has been through everything and has yet to complain once. It’s $200 and it’s worth every penny. You can even save $10 by getting the version that will be mystery color (they use production surplus material so each one is unique).And if it helps, I can tell you I’ve actually had mine for over three years and it’s in almost as good condition as the day I got it. A post shared by Micah Toll (@themicahtoll)ABUS sent me their Alarm Box 2.0 vibration alarm and I’m pleasantly surprised by how much I like it.It’s not cheap and plastic-y feeling like many of these bicycle alarms out there. It’s got good metal construction, mounts securely, and is a loud impediment to any thief getting away with your bike. I wish I had it installed before I had a bike stolen earlier this year, but at least I have it now!It’s priced at $78, which doesn’t even feel that expensive for what you’re getting. Just be sure to keep your key handy since it’s an annoying thing to disengage if you’re fumbling for the key when you accidentally set off your own vibration alarm.These are the coolest bicycle pedals I have ever seen in my entire life. Hands down. They’re also quite expensive, so prepare yourself. But trust me, they’re awesome.You swap these in place of your existing pedals and then – boom! – you’ve got headlights and tail lights that move with you. Each pedal has two removable LED lights, one facing forward and one facing backward. But you don’t have to make sure you get the orientation right, since they have some sort of witchcraft in them to automatically tell which way they are facing and light up with the correct color. I’ve tried flipping them quickly to trick them, but they always instantly change color to keep white facing forward and red facing the rear.Plus there’s a 5th LED module that mounts on your seat post for a standard tail light. It’s wild!And the fact that the pedal lights are moving in a circle makes them even more obvious to drivers. The only thing that stands out more at night than a bright LED light is a bright LED light in motion.The set of pedals costs $140, which is not cheap, but then again they’re not just smart lights but also a good set of pedals. For another $40, you can get that fifth module to mount on your seat post.You can see the pedals and tail light in action below. That bright headlight isn’t part of the kit though –that’s the next light below.This little thing is a beast. It throws light like a much larger tool, yet is the size of a chapstick. If you just saw it on a table, you’d think “$40 for that?!” But as soon as you turn it on, it’d make sense.It’s technically not a bike light, but I use it as one because it’s easy to pop on and off the handlebars on a cheap $8 mount allowing it to serve double duty as a headlight and a pocket flashlight. And since it recharges on USB, you never deal with batteries.The video above with the RedShift pedals has the Fenix E09R mounted, which is what is throwing that big beam way out of in front of the bike.The cool thing about these Traveler Light units is that instead of some annoying, hard-to-reach clicky button that forces you to cycle through a number of flash-pattern programs to find on and off, these lights use a spinny-knob.I’m not sure spinny-knob is the industry term, but basically you just turn the entire unit like a rotary switch. That lets you choose from different flashing programs and light intensities. They’re also held on by magnets that let them separate from the rubber mounting base so that you can just yank them off easily and toss them in your pocket if you don’t want them stolen when parking outside (or for when you occasionally need to bring them inside to charge on USB).These are also pretty pricey at $70, but they sure do work well!Amazon tells me that I’ve bought seven Triple Eight helmets. That’s some serious commitment. I’ve mostly bought their cheaper model, the Sweatsaver, since I like the way it looks and it’s a minimalist helmet for my videos. As perhaps the most prolific e-bike reviewer on the internet, I try to take safety seriously to set a good example. And that means always riding with a helmet (outside of a few extenuating circumstances). But I don’t want a big, bulky, funky-looking, nerdy bike helmet to ruin my shots. So I use Triple Eight’s helmets since they look cool and disappear into the shot with their plain design. But since their Sweatsaver helmet is really more of a skateboarding helmet and doesn’t have any safety certification, I recently upgraded to their Dual Certification MIPS helmet. It’s a much safer alternative but still looks great!To be fair, I don’t normally use this helmet when I’m not filming. I have other helmets for those (see below). But as far as a good-looking and also safe helmet, this is my go-to whenever I’ve got a camera pointed at me. Not bad for a $79 helmet!You can see the helmet in action in the video below.The Abus Pedelec 2.0 helmet is one of my new favorites for all of my leisure rides. It’s got great ventilation (something the Triple Eight MIPS helmet above lacks), yet still looks pretty minimalist too.And I LOVE that it has a built-in rear LED light. Cyclists already wage a losing war to be seen by car drivers. At night, that can be an uphill battle. Having a built-in red tail light in the back of your helmet is a great way to put a big flashing notice of your presence right at drivers’ eye level.This is definitely one of my most common helmets for riding, day or night. And at $110, it’s reasonably priced for a safe and well-lit helmet.This is one of two things in this list I haven’t personally tested, at least not exactly. I’ve had multiple visits at Electric Bike Company’s factories in Newport Beach, California. There I’ve seen firsthand how they build their electric bikes locally, and I’ve even tried my hand at painting a bike frame in their custom paint shop. But recently they added a new item to their product catalog: custom-painted bike helmets. You can choose your paint color, your trim color, your strap color, and you even get front and rear LED lights!Since they already have a huge professional paint facility, they can now do custom helmets that match your bike or are any paint scheme you want. It’s a pretty awesome-looking setup and I want to try one of these things out the first chance I get!For a quick clean job after a trail ride, I’m not against just aiming a hose at my bike and letting rip. But occasionally I try to give my bikes a deeper clean that actually helps protect them and keep them in better shape for longer.I’ve been playing around with the Clean Protect & Lube kit from Muc-Off, and I’m quite happy with it, especially for the modest $32 price. The pink cleaning spray helps cut through nasty dirt and grime, which is especially useful for city commuter bikes that get a whole other level of urban crap caked onto them. The MO94 is like WD40 except better, and not harmful to some bike parts the way WD40 can be. Plus it’s actually got some lube in it, whereas WD40 is just a water displacer, not a real lubricant. But for a serious lube job, the kit also includes ceramic lube. Muc-Off has both wet and dry ceramic lube, so you’ll want to choose the best for your application. The dry stuff is good for me since it doesn’t rain very much where I do most of my riding in Tel Aviv. If I was in Florida though, I’d opt for the wet lube. The other day I noticed my EDC knife’s hinge was getting a bit tight and I happened to have the Muc-Off dry ceramic lube nearby. Two drops later my knife’s hinge works better than the day I got it.The kit also has a nifty expanding sponge that probably isn’t much different than any other good quality sponge, but hey, it’s pink! And the kit also came packaged with an e-bike drivetrain tool for me, though I didn’t get to test it because my mid-drive e-bike uses a belt-drive. But if you have a mid-drive with a chain, you stick the tool in the chainring and it basically momentarily defeats the freewheel in the crank, allowing you to spin your chain backward and clean the chain more easily. Most people just accomplish this by shoving an Allen key in the chainring, but Muc-Off’s tool is a slightly more elegant way to do it that won’t scratch your bike up the way an Allen key would. But let’s be honest, you could carefully accomplish the same thing with any hunk of metal like an Allen key.I bought this little power station to be able to top-off my e-bike batteries when I’m in the field. It’s small and easy to carry. It’s fairly lightweight at around 7 pounds, and it can store around half an average e-bike battery’s charge.That means I don’t use it as a primary charging source, but rather just as a way to get some more energy back into my e-bike. For example, if I’m stopping for lunch for an hour, I can spend that time recharging my e-bike, not just my stomach.It wouldn’t make a great primary charger due to it only holding around 300 Wh (and costing a whopping $299 for that small amount of energy). But when you’ve set up a base camp in the middle of nowhere, it’s much more effective than trying to plug your charger into a tree trunk or a picnic table.Peak Design is probably better known for their camera mounts and other gear, but they’ve recently gotten into phone mounts too. And they got me with their clever marketing. I received their phone case for free at an event earlier this year. And the case is fine, no complaints there. But the magic is really in their quick release mount built into the back of the case. If you’re familiar with other quick release cases like QuadLock, it’s kind of like that, but better. And so I bought their Universal Mount so I could make use of the cool case. The Universal Mount is actually on my scooter right now, but I can just as easily switch it back onto my bicycle or motorcycle. It’s easy to use and makes it so I can see my GPS directions. The whole idea of the Peak Design mount is that it is super secure yet releases in an instant with a single finger. What’s not to like? Well, the price, for one. The case (which I got for free) costs most people close to $50. Then the universal bar mount, which I bought, was close to another $50. That’s a lot just to mount your phone to your handlebars. But if you’re on and off your bike (or scooter, or motorcycle, or whatever) several times a day and you use your phone for navigation, it’s a beautiful system that makes it easy to go back and forth.If you want a MUCH cheaper option though, check my next suggestion below.I have bought three or four of these things now, some for me and some for family members as gifts.When it comes to a truly universal phone mount for bikes, this is the one. It stretches to fit literally any phone and literally any handlebar.And it’s surprisingly strong. It’s meant for holding your phone on a bicycle bar, but I often use them when traveling for on-site motorcycle test rides. I bring them because of the simple fact that they stretch to fit anything. And they’ve had no problem holding my phones to motorcycle bars while battling 80+ mph winds. The phone dances around a bit at that speed since it isn’t a super rigid holder, but it is strong enough to withstand it. So you better believe it’s going to work on your mountain bike or commuter bike.And at less than $10 (marked down from $12!), this sucker is the most affordable thing on this list!Having a manual air pump is important as a backup, but these days I keep electric pumps around because they’re just nicer to use. They take a few seconds longer (especially on fat-tire e-bikes), but I don’t even need to be there while they work.I just set the PSI, push the on button and let them go to work. They’re loud and annoying in that sense, but they get the job done almost effortlessly. And they even turn off automatically when you reach your desired pressure.This Xiaomi model was my first electric pump and still a great buy. There are cheaper models out there, but this one at $50 is worth it. I bought it almost on a whim, not expecting much and just hoping it would be decent. It turned out to be a huge addition to my e-bike tool bin. I love this thing and I can’t believe I was hunched over a floor pump for so many years without it.I haven’t actually done an inflate-deflate-reflate test to see how many flat tires I could fill on a charge, but based on how often I need to charge it, I’d guess I get around 8-10 smaller bike tires and 3-4 fat tires per charge. That might not sound like much, but how often do you fill up that many tires in a row?I have one of these CYCPLUS CUBE pumps on the way from the company as a media sample but haven’t had a chance to test it out yet. So I can’t tell you how well it works, but I can tell you that I’m excited about the idea. Basically, it works just like my bulkier Xiaomi pump above, but it’s small enough to fit in my pocket.Because it’s so small, I will only be able to get a tire or two out of it – this isn’t for filling 10 tires in a row. But as a small emergency pump, it’s a cool piece of kit that I’m looking forward to testing. They’ll be running a crowdfunding campaign for it soon, but if you don’t like the risk of crowdfunding then you might want to wait until you can buy it retail.Is there anything I missed that you think I should check out? Let me know what your favorite piece of bike gear is in the comments section below. I’m always looking to waste spend my hard-earned money on new bike gadgets!",ebikes
2022/12/11,"Electric bike maker MATE is perhaps best known for its compact folding electric bikes. But much like the automotive world, this e-bike company has bigger aspirations. And in the case of the upcoming MATE SUV electric cargo bike, those aspirations are pretty darn big.The MATE SUV e-bike is designed to haul so much that it needs an extra wheel, turning it into an electric trike.But unlike most delta trikes we’ve seen (the kind with two wheels in the back), the MATE SUV is a tadpole trike with two wheels in the front.That offers a double whammy of making the e-bike more stable and also offering a huge front cargo bucket that’s perfect for loading up with gear or kids.Designed for the European market, the e-bike comes with European-level specs such as a 25 km/h (15.5 mph) top speed. Unlike in North America, most European countries have stricter e-bike regulations that result in lower top speeds.And the MATE SUV is European through and through, as the company explained:Reimagined in Denmark, inspired by the Danish biking culture and engineered together with multiple award-winning Germano studio Zanzotti Industrial Design, this is the alternative that will change the way you move. The MATE SUV will redefine your journey and propel forward a movement of people who want to take back the streets.That’s exactly the type of job that this e-bike is designed for: taking back the streets from cars. And to do so, the MATE SUV was designed to be both functional and versatile.That resulted in an e-bike that serves multiple roles for carrying everything from groceries to passengers.As the company continued:Imagine the feeling of moving freely through the static obstacles of traffic. Imagine making the run for groceries fun again or taking the ride with your kids to a whole new level. Imagine never paying a parking ticket ever again. Imagine a vehicle that, for once, can challenge the way we move without selling out of the comforts of short commutes. Imagine if we together could ignite a movement of people who change how we get form A to anywhere. Imagine a carrier that can change to fit the purpose of many different needs. Imagine a vehicle that will move more than your goods. This is the SUV reimagined.The e-bike, which is built with a frame that uses 90% recycled aluminum, is designed to fit a wide range of rider heights from 160-210 cm (5’3″ to 6’10”). The front bucket is intended to carry either two children or one adult. If your precious cargo consists of things instead of people, the bike can fit up to 210 L (55.5 gallons). And a set of hydraulic brakes helps bring all of that mass to a stop quickly and safely.For visibility, an LED light bar in the front and rear of the cargo area helps make sure other road-users see the e-bike and its occupants.That mid-drive motor with built-in torque sensor better be powerful to move all of that cargo around, and it certainly looks up to the task with a 90 Nm torque rating. It may come with a 250W sticker on the side, but that’s just for regulations. This sucker is definitely putting out way more peak power than it’s letting on.The included battery is also rated for up to 100 km (62 miles) of range per charge, meaning riders likely won’t be stuck pedaling without the support of electric assist.In addition to building an effective cargo e-bike, MATE’s CEO Thomas Vuillez explained that it was just as important to build something that would be both cool and fun to ride:We wanted to bring something exceptional to the market as it is in our DNA to make e-biking cool and fun. The MATE SUV is something that was born out of our curiosity about how we move and to challenge the known ways of running errands and making short trips. The reliance on a car is considerable and reducing that is a growing need of the day.The MATE SUV isn’t in production yet (and it’s unclear if the company has any real prototypes or if these are all just digital product renderings). But that hasn’t stopped MATE from taking pre-order reservations.Riders can already reserve their spot in line to purchase the MATE SUV for €49 (approximately US $52), which also grants them a 20% discount on the expected price of €6,499 (approximately US $6,850). If MATE sticks to its current schedule, the company expects to begin delivering the e-bikes to customers in Q3 of 2023.",ebikes
2022/12/08,"Prices for full-suspension electric moped-style e-bikes have been dropping over the last few years, but the Fucare Libra is now pushing them to all-time lows. At just $1,299, does this full-suspension e-bike have what it takes? That’s exactly what I wanted to find out, so I tested one myself.The Fucare Libra falls somewhere between a typical step-through electric bike and a moped-style electric bike. We often consider moped-style e-bikes to have small diameter yet wide tires, long bench seats, higher top speeds and less-than-optimal pedaling geometries. The Fucare Libra checks the boxes for moped-style wheels, rear bench seat, coilover rear suspension and high speed. But it still has a traditional bike seat and actually feels decent for pedaling.That puts it somewhere in the gray area between e-mopes and e-bicycles. But whatever you call it, the Libra offers some serious bang for your buck with higher performance and a modest $1,299 sticker price.Check it out in full living color in my video review below. Then keep reading for the complete details.*Note: The Fucare Libra’s battery has been upgraded to 48V 20Ah (960Wh) since this review was posted.This is one seriously fast e-bike, though it’s not quite as fast as it claims. Sure, you can get it up to 31 mph (50 km/h) based on the display (though that requires unlocking the top speed in the settings). But the speedometer on the Fucare Libra seems to run a tad bit fast, on the order or 2-3 mph high at the top end.That means that you’re probably doing closer to 28 mph instead of an honest 31 mph. While that’s a bit of a bummer, it means the bike might slide in under questionably legal Class 3 operation (if we pretend like the throttle doesn’t get it up to full speed by itself, which it does). So perhaps there’s a silver lining in there somewhere.Even if you lose a couple of mph compared to the displayed speed, it’s still darn fast for an e-bike. Zipping along at 28 mph (45 km/h) is thrilling for just about anyone. And as we’ve often discussed, many people actually feel safer at higher speeds since they can keep up with traffic instead of getting passed by it.The powerful rear hub motor puts out 1,000 watts of peak power, meaning you’ll have good hill climbing in addition to just a high top speed. And with 80 Nm of torque coming out of that motor, no one can accuse this bike of looking more powerful than it is.The 720 Wh battery isn’t particularly large but rather somewhere around average for these types of e-bikes. A couple of years ago, I might have said that was a pretty big battery, but these days, it’s par for the course on fast moped-style e-bikes.You’ll get an honest 25 miles (40 km) or so from the Fucare Libra’s battery on throttle-only operation, and you can eke out even more range if you feel like pedaling. Don’t expect to see their advertised 60 miles (95 km) of range unless you’re planning to do most of the pedaling yourself, though. At least it’s comfortable to pedal, in case you wanted to try for that 60 miles!The Fucare Libra’s surprisingly comfortable pedal operation was great to see, and of course, it will be important if you plan on being part of the power generation. But since most people will probably make ample use of the throttle, I’m not sure that will be a huge concern for many riders.The bigger comfort priority is likely the suspension. The rear suspension is nice to have, but I found the front suspension fork to feel kind of cheap. It had a bit of flex to it when applying hard front braking, which is a telltale sign of a lower-budget fork. The last Fucare e-bike tested had a higher quality suspension fork, though it was also a more expensive hardtail model.When you’ve got a nearly 30 mph e-bike priced at $1,299, I guess you’ve got to save money somewhere.Another area for savings appears to be the brakes. They work fine, but they aren’t hydraulics. Instead, we’re looking at typical mechanical disc brakes. For a fast and heavy e-bike like the Fucare Libra (a whopping 80 pounds or 36 kg), I generally like to see hydraulic brakes that offer stronger repeated stopping power.The only other complaint I had was that the frame area surrounding the battery is a bit wide and I would occasionally rub my ankles on it depending on how I had my feet positioned on the pedals. It’s the kind of thing where I’d certainly get used to it if the bike were my daily driver, but hopping from one bike to another makes it noticeable. You can see what I mean in my video review at the top of the article.Aside from the heavy weight, slightly wide frame, and lack of hydraulic brakes, I find it hard to nitpick at much else. I mean, this is a rocket of an e-bike with full-suspension for just $1,299, for crying out loud!I’d have loved to see some passenger pegs included so I could actually comfortably carry a kid on that padded rear rack. But I’ll just go ahead and say “thank you” for giving me that padded rear rack at all, especially at this price!Being able to throttle up to fast speeds in a cool-looking bike with multiple color options just isn’t something we see very often in this price range. And there’s even the added cool factor of Fucare offering a limited-edition “Chameleon” color, which is basically a sparkly light blue. (It’s the bike in these pictures.) It sounds odd, but it looks really good. It’s only an extra $100, but it is limited to 50 units. Each one comes with an individually-numbered plate on the side to designate which of the 50 units it is. I’m not saying these are going to become collectors units worthy of Leno’s garage one day. But it’s still pretty neat having an individually numbered vehicle as part of a limited edition run. And even when those are out, the yellow and gray colorways aren’t bad either.So in closing, while I could have used some slightly higher quality components on the bike, it’s really hard to complain about much of anything at this price. The Fucare Libra offers seriously good performance for a budget-level price. It doesn’t have the amazing community of a SUPER73 or the monster power of an Ariel Rider, but it’s got something the others don’t: affordability.",ebikes
2022/12/07,"I’ve always enjoyed multi-seater electric bikes, which bring passenger-carrying utility to small-format, easy-to-produce vehicles. But I never thought I’d see the concept taken this far. At least not until I stumbled upon a six-seater electric bike that has me all kinds of jealous.It’s no surprise where this custom e-bike originated. If you want to see the most creative and ingenious transportation solutions in the world, you have to head over to Asia.The Chinese often get a lot of credit for some of the more wacky vehicles popping up on Alibaba, but India usually takes the cake with some of the coolest auto and motorcycle innovation on the planet. And that’s exactly where this impressive six-seater bike comes from, where it was hand-built by Ashhad Abdullah from Lohra in eastern India.Abdullah seems to have caught my recent Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week entry for a three-seater electric bike and said “Hold my lassi.”Instead of a three-seater, Abdullah doubled the capacity to six seats. His stretch-limousine electric bike looks like it wears a scooter fork on front complete with drum brake, off-road lighting kit, and even a motorcycle horn. The rear seems to hold a hub motor wheel in a swingarm supported by dual coilover shocks. There’s a battery box mounted just in front of the swingarm, though how much capacity he’s rocking seems to be a mystery. Bridging the two ends of the bike is a bespoke ladder frame with six seats, six handlebars, and six pairs of foot pegs.There’s no word on the turning radius, but we’d wager it’s somewhere around the width of the state of Bihar.Abdullah created the custom-designed bike after climbing fuel prices made petrol-powered motorcycles less appealing. In total, he says the bike cost him around 12,000 INR (US $150) to build.He explained that it gets a range of around 150 km (93 miles), though we can’t independently verify that range claim. He also added that it costs around 10 INR (US $0.12) to recharge. I’m not sure if this is technically an e-bike, at least by electric bicycle standards. It certainly looks like a tandem-style bicycle setup with bicycle seats, but the lack of pedals means it would be classified more like an electric scooter or motorcycle.But whatever you call it, the six-seater bike has received a warm reception around the world.The novel creation went viral on Twitter after a video of it in action was reposted by Anand Mahindra, the chairman of Mahindra Group, one of the largest automakers in India (and similar in size to GM).With just small design inputs, (cylindrical sections for the chassis @BosePratap ?) this device could find global application. As a tour ‘bus’ in crowded European tourist centres? I’m always impressed by rural transport innovations, where necessity is the mother of invention. pic.twitter.com/yoibxXa8mxIt’s unlikely we’d see an awesome ride like this in the West, where safety regulations and an unhealthy aversion to two wheels would likely make this six-seater dead on arrival.I’ll admit that it’s hard for me to argue with the safety concerns, especially when seeing six helmet-less heads and a few bare feet as well. There are some good alternatives available in the US, at least if you’re alright with just two-seater e-bikes. But with options like a $999 Lectric XP 3.0 or a $1,499 RadRunner helping put more riders on smaller electric vehicles, the chances for sharing the fun on e-bikes are growing, even in laggard countries like the US.We may never get six bodies on one bike, but even two would be a good start!via: TimesNowNews",ebikes
2022/12/06,"Seattle-based electric bicycle manufacturer Rad Power Bikes has just unveiled its latest model, the RadTrike. Expanding upon Rad’s extensive line of diverse two-wheeled electric bicycles, the RadTrike offers a new three-wheeler option designed to open the door to a wider range of riders.Priced at $2,499, the RadTrike might not sound very budget-level when compared against the company’s other bikes starting at nearly half that price.But compared to most electric trikes, it’s a deal. I was recently riding a $3,100 electric trike, and my sister’s electric trike that she uses to tote around her kids costs an even pricier $3,800. Don’t even get me started on the fancier options that can easily range from $5K–$8K.But not only is the new RadTrike perhaps the most affordable electric trike available from a major manufacturer, but it’s also finally offering what it says is “the single most requested model in Rad’s history.”The model has been a long time coming, as Rad Power Bikes founder and chairman Mike Radenbaugh explained:The journey to the RadTrike began with one of my first customers who couldn’t ride a traditional bike due to health issues. Since that early interaction, I’ve had countless conversations with customers looking to Rad for more solutions. Fast forward to now, we’ve honed our expertise to create a high-value, purpose-built three-wheel option that will popularize another micromobility category. The RadTrike is the next big acceleration in our mission to make transportation energy efficient, enjoyable, and accessible to all.Rad Power Bikes has long been a favorite among returning riders – those that enjoyed riding bicycles decades ago but have since given it up due to the exertion required.Electric bicycles make it easier to ride thanks to an assist motor that lets riders use less pedaling effort (or no pedaling effort if they elect to use the hand throttle).But for riders who lack not just the strength to pedal by themselves but also the balance required by a two-wheeled bike, electric trikes can be the perfect solution.That was a big part of the inspiration behind the RadTrike, as Rad Power Bikes senior product manager Sarah Bruce Courtney explained:To some, two wheels is daunting and prohibitive. That’s why we created RadTrike. It was engineered specifically for comfort and stability but designed for fun and adventure. It was thoughtfully crafted so those who simply haven’t ridden a bike in a while, struggle with balance, or face mobility challenges can ride Rad with friends and family. Now, these individuals can ride to the grocery store, cruise around their neighborhood, or pursue new outdoor activities.But the RadTrike isn’t just for older riders or those with mobility issues. As Mike Radenbaugh explained on a call with Electrek, he envisions the three-wheeler being used in a number of roles ranging from leisure to utility. And with the ability to load up baskets on the front and back of the trike with heavy cargo (and not having to balance that tippy load on just two wheels), e-trikes have the added benefit of serving as ultra-stable cargo platforms.The RadTrike is designed with that stability in mind. When looking at early pictures of the bike, I commented to Mike that it seemed to be wider in the rear than other e-trikes I’ve seen. He explained that they designed it to be as wide as possibility for stability while still fitting through a standard exterior door.The 18″ wheels also offer a compromise between the compactness of 16″ wheels and the better ride quality of larger 20″ wheels.Speaking of compactness, the RadTrike is designed to fold. That makes it easier to store in a tight space or transport in a vehicle. It can fold in half like a typical folding e-bike, but if riders only need to get it into the back of a minivan or SUV, then the handlebars can be folded down to lower the height of the bike during transport.Other familiar e-bike parts that we’ve seen on other Rad bikes are the five levels of pedal assist as well as throttle control. Though on the RadTrike, pedal-assist level 1 is designed to be extra slow and match an average walking pace. That allows someone riding a RadTrike to pedal along while still keeping pace with their walking partner.The single-speed setup is optimized for a more typical trike speed or around 8-12 mph (13-20 km/h), though the bike can reach a top speed of 14 mph (22.5 km/h). That might sound slow compared to the rest of Rad’s 20 mph (32 km/h) e-bikes, but trust me when I tell you that everything feels faster on a trike. In fact, everything feels tippier too, which is why the speed is lower. Slowing down for turns is an important part of riding a trike to ensure that all the wheels stay firmly planted on the ground. The extra wide design of the RadTrike combined with the smaller wheel size create a lower center of gravity that helps increase its stability, but that still doesn’t mean anyone should try to turn this thing at 20 mph.Some other unique parts on the RadTrike are a reverse feature, a 750W front wheel motor, a parking brake (since the lack of a kickstand means it could theoretically roll away if parked on a hill) as well as a coaster brake in the rear. An updated design is implemented for the 48V 10.4Ah battery pack, including a more precise 10-segment state-of-charge readout on the battery case.There’s no suspension on the bike, but it’s also designed for smoother paths. This certainly isn’t an off-roading trike with fat tires — it’s a bike lane trike. Plus the steel frame has more flex than rigid aluminum frames, which should add a bit more absorption on bumps.The removable battery is said to offer a range of 20-35 miles (32-56 km), and the comfy seat with backrest should make those miles quite pleasurable as well.With a payload capacity of 415 pounds (188 kg), the RadTrike can fit both larger riders and a pile of cargo. It is also compatible with a large amount of Rad’s existing accessory line, including many of the cargo basket accessories, so riders will be able to haul around groceries and gear right from the start.They won’t have to wait long either, as the RadTrike is already available to order for $2,499 with inventory ready to ship out in mid-January. Those wanting to take a test ride can find the RadTrike in stock at Rad’s flagship stores in Seattle; Brooklyn, NY; Huntington Beach, CA; Salt Lake City; and soon in St. Petersburg, FL.Yes, sign me up! I know it might sound strange but I actually love electric trikes. I see them as the pickup trucks or the SUVs of the e-bike world (without the egregious waste of resources of those actual vehicles). They take bicycle parts and combine them into something that can comfortably haul around so much more.I think that 15 mph is plenty fast for a trike. I also would like to mention that having a parking brake is a must and I'm glad that they included it. I really think that a enclosed Basket in the back with a locking lid would make a lot more sense than what I've seen on here. The fact that it Folds in half and also that the handlebars fold down is awesome. I would like to see them make it so that you could stand it up on the back wheels as well and save even more room in your garage. The fact that it's a front hub motor seems kind of primitive. Right now I consider a really high value trike The Buzz tricycle. It has a lot of features for the price. Mine got delivered for a thousand less than this bike I'm very happy with it.Rad is being very careful to shy away from calling the RadTrike a kid-carrying vehicle, which I understand from the liability side. But at the same time, that’s going to be a HUGE feature for something like this. Where I live in Tel Aviv, it’s common to see parents riding an e-trike for school drop-off with two or three kids on a bench on back. I’ve even seen four kids with a dad on an e-trike (the smallest child was on a front-mounted child seat). Around here e-trikes are just treated as an obvious choice for a second vehicle. If one parent is already out with the family car, then the other parent can do after-school pickup on the trike.Obviously you have to ride extra safely when you have kids on board, but in that sense the RadTrike could be a huge opportunity to legitimately replace a second family car with an e-bike (err, e-trike).And of course when you factor in all that cargo space for grocery runs and other gear-intensive trips, this thing is a no-brainer.So while it’s definitely going to be a nice option for the elderly and balance-impaired, don’t count it out as a totally normal e-bike for those that just want a bigger pedal vehicle for carrying more stuff. Like I said, the RadTrike is the SUV of the e-bike world.",ebikes
2022/12/04,"California allocated $10 million for a rebate program to help make electric bikes more affordable. But hang on there; it’s not active quite yet.The move is part of a years-long effort to help reduce the price of expensive electric bicycles for state residents. The ultimate goal is to make it easier for commuters to switch from car transportation to e-bike transportation.It makes sense when you consider the long list of benefits. From cleaner air to reduced traffic and improved health/fitness, electric bikes solve many of the problems plaguing California (and the rest of the country).But the path toward a statewide incentive program to reduce e-bike prices hasn’t been quick or easy.California has earmarked over $1 billion this year as incentives for electric cars and charging infrastructure, according to Streetsblog. That’s in addition to the billions already put into electric car incentives.Back in 2019 electric bikes finally got the attention they deserved from lawmakers when California’s S.B. 400 was passed, which included a section that permitted electric bikes to be included in future clean air vehicle incentive programs.That paved the way for the possibility of statewide e-bike rebate programs, but it didn’t actually create any.Last year California got one step closer to that goal when it included a $10M allocation in the state budget for an e-bike rebate program. As Assemblymember Boerner Horvath said at the time:Making e-bikes more affordable is one of the most effective ways to get Californians out of their cars and reduce emissions. I’m thrilled that the full funding I requested for purchase incentives, education, and training is included in the budget we approved. This program represents a priority shift in the right direction and, once implemented, will help folks from all backgrounds choose a healthier, happier way to get around.That was another huge step in the right direction, but it hasn’t yet resulted in an active program. That’s expected to begin in early 2023, with a number of key guidelines for California’s first statewide e-bike voucher program already laid out.According to the California Bicycle Association, the program will create a $750 voucher for a standard electric bicycle and a $1,500 voucher for a cargo electric bicycle. There will be additional incentives for anyone whose income is under 225% of the federal poverty level (FPL) or who lives in disadvantaged communities.But in order to qualify for the voucher, participants’ household income must be below 400% of the FPL, which amounts to $51,000 for a single person and $106,000 for a family of four at current figures.The program will include Class 1 electric bikes (pedal assist up to 20 mph or 32 km/h) and Class 2 electric bikes (pedal assist and/or throttle up to 20 mph or 32 km/h), but will NOT include Class 3 e-bikes (pedal assist up to 28 mph).Qualifying bikes must also either be purchased at a local bike shop in California, or online from a company that has “a business location in California.”The move could see California align with other states that have created or already implemented electric bicycle incentives. Vermont became the first state in the US to offer a statewide e-bike rebate program. Oregon is also working on creating an e-bike incentive program that could soon become law, as New York attempts to do the same. Many cities such as Denver, Colorado, have also implemented their own local programs, though the funding is usually much smaller than statewide programs.",ebikes
2022/12/01,"Calling all e-bike aficionados and internet sleuths: Rad Power Bikes is teasing a brand-new model of an electric bike and has released a teaser image full of clues.The image was just sent out to the company’s email list and shared on social media.In the image – which is with “Some big news is right around the corner. Stay tuned!” – is a dimly lit profile view of an e-bike.The cropped image is obscured by the text “COMING 12.6.22” (which the rest of the world outside of ‘Murica should know means four days from now, not this past summer).The image also includes the teaser text, “Our most requested model. Ever.”The “most requested” should be a big clue. Rad Power Bikes, the largest e-bike company in North America, has often stated that its RadRover is the company’s best-seller. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the fat-tire adventure-style electric bike is its “most requested.”Perhaps “most requested” refers to a budget-level e-bike, which would make sense considering recent clues that Rad could be replacing its most affordable model in its lineup.With strong pressure from other budget-oriented electric bike brands, a new entry-level model could make sense.But the most revealing clues come from the image itself. Sure, you can barely make out anything from it… until you play around with the image. We usually toss teaser images into photo-editing software and then lighten the crap out of them until they’re an ugly mess that reveals whatever is hidden in the shadows. That’s how we discovered early-on that SONDORS would unveil a motorcycle, and this time it helps us get a few more clues about this upcoming Rad bike.A few things are obvious when we take a look at the lightened image.We’re of course looking at a step-through frame. The battery is positioned on the downtube, which is pretty standard for many Rad Power Bikes models, though is a departure from the RadExpand and the recently replaced RadMini models that mount the batteries along the seat tube.There’s an obvious lack of suspension, and there’s also what appears to be a folding mechanism just forward of the bottom bracket where the pedals are mounted.The tires look wider than a typical metro tire like we saw on the RadMission, yet they have an obviously street-optimized tread pattern. These certainly aren’t meant for trails.There are also tall bars like we’d find on the RadRunner 2 utility bike.My projection is that it's an ETrike. Trikes are wonderful as cargo carriers. They have advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that when you stop you don't have to put your foot down. Another is they are great for people with balance issues (and Rad likes to market to boomers). Some shortcomings of trikes are with three wheels on the ground you require more effort, and the bike tilts with the slope of the road which is usually steaply crowned at the bike lane. This makes for an uncomfortable ride that takes getting used to. If it is a trike I'd like to see a basket that has a secure locking top door cover (I have a homemade one on mine) By the way my current favorite for a High Value trike is the Buzz, it has a mid-drive motor and pressure sensing, built in lights, large display, and more. Many of these signs seem to point toward a street-optimized folding bike, perhaps something like a RadRunner-lite. The RadExpand is sometimes referred to as a folding RadRunner, but perhaps this could be a more city-optimized folding RadRunner. Or maybe it’s a more scaled-down folding e-bike designed to compete with the Lectric XP Lite, which has surely frustrated Rad with its $799 price tag.One thing is for sure: We won’t know exactly what Rad Power Bikes is working on until the big reveal on December 6. In the meantime, let’s hear your guesses in the comments section below! And be sure to check back here on the 6th for the big news!We’ll tide you over during the wait with our most recent Rad review below.",ebikes
2022/12/01,"Swedish electric automaker Polestar has toyed around with two-wheelers before, but the company looks set to embark on its most ambitious bike project yet with a new electric bicycle model.The company’s CEO Thomas Ingenlath recently announced that Polestar will expand an ongoing partnership with Allebike to create a new electric bike.That partnership previously led to a pedal bike, but Polestar appears set to bring batteries into the equation for the latest model.At the same time, Ingenlath seems to strike a distinction between Polestar and other automotive companies that white label their way to an electric bike.It’s a move we see all too often, where brands leverage the value of their logo by shopping it out to e-bike companies that hope to make a quick buck off of the name recognition.Remember that Hummer electric bike? What about the Jeep e-bike? Same goes for Ducati’s electric bikes, BMW’s electric scooter, and countless other electric two-wheelers that borrowed big automaker or motorcycle brand names.Though to be fair, there are plenty of car and motorcycle manufacturers that have honestly developed their own two-wheelers from the ground up. Harley-Davidson famously spent years designing its popular electric bikes that were eventually spun out as independent e-bike company Serial 1. GM developed an in-house electric bike with a lauded design, though it met an untimely demise in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Porsche has a number of interesting e-bikes, as does Peugeot. The list goes on.Polestar seems to pride itself on avoiding the easy route on the path to its own electric bike, despite announcing that it will in fact team up with Allebike again to produce the Polestar e-bike.Polestar has partnered its way to other two-wheeler projects in the past. We saw the company join forces with Swedish electric motorbike manufacturer CAKE multiple times, including in the unveiling of a special edition Makka electric moped designed to be charged while towed behind a Polestar electric car. In that case, CAKE did the heavy lifting, lending a largely finished electric moped design to the partnership.The project strikes a new direction for Polestar that goes beyond four-wheeled transportation solutions. As Ingenlath explained to The Verge, he supports a multimodal approach to mobility: “I’m absolutely for the plurality of mobility. I hate as much that people would say, ‘Oh, we don’t need cars.’ I mean, of course we need cars. I love to own a car. But I would love to not use it every day. I’d like to use it when I’d like to use it.”It’s great to see the CEO of a car company coming to the realization that his products aren’t necessary or useful for a large swath of the population. Seeing a car company reach that level of awareness is a beautiful thing and makes me think that mankind might just have a couple more generations left on this planet than originally thought.Dark? Sure. Accurate? Also yes.That being said, Polestar stickers on an Allebike electric bicycle aren’t really going to move the needle. And considering that the last bicycle produced from the partnership – a non-electric off-road Polestar snow bike – is priced at $9,999, I shudder to think of the price tag on a Polestar electric bike.More rich people toys for the great white outdoors isn’t exactly going to revolutionize transportation for those that actually need a cost-effective and non-destructive way to commute around cities.Nonetheless, car companies making smaller vehicles than cars is a trend I can get behind. Or on top of.",ebikes
2022/11/30,"SUPER73 has never shied away from unique or far-out custom electric bike builds. It’s kind of their thing. And while this isn’t the flashiest-looking of the e-bike brand’s custom projects, the name “Wall of Death” seems to make up for the lack of shiny colors and added bling.If you’ve never seen a Wall of Death ride before, you’re missing out. They featured a circular wall reminiscent of a large barrel that allows daredevil motorcycle riders to ride continuously around the inside of the wall at a 90-degree angle to the ground. They were popular as carnival sideshow attractions in the first half of the 20th century, though few working Walls of Death remain today.Those that do still delight onlookers as the riders seemingly defy gravity while whipping around the inside of the Wall of Death.Of course, physics is a cruel mistress that allows no cheaters, and so it’s ultimately a delicate balance of friction and centrifugal force that permits riders to suspend themselves in the air. Get either wrong and you’ll quickly find out where the wall gets its name.Daredevil rider Marvin Prinssen regularly performs on a Wall of Death, and he recently teamed up with SUPER73 to create a custom e-bike designed for the feat.That meant swapping out key components for higher strength that could resist the forces on the wall as well as a few electrical and comfort upgrades.As the company explained to the LEVA:We decided to create an electric bike that is custom-made for the wall of death in every way. One that Marvin and his crew could incorporate into their shows. The spokes were reinforced and strengthened while a rigid front fork keeps the bike sturdy when battling against the intense g-force. An extended seat upholstered with anti-slip material helps keep the riders stuck to the bike. The bike was changed to single speed and a throttle added to allow the riders to get up to top speed as quickly as possible. The goal here was to create something that would not only catch your eye but be able to take whatever the wall could throw at it. A stark copper paint job gives the frame that SUPER73 pop while the relocation of the battery keeps it safe from any spills amongst the thrills.Marvellous Marv, as the Dutch daredevil is known, performs in Europe where throttles are not allowed on conventional e-bikes. But since the Wall of Death bike is about as far from a road-use bike as possible, the inclusion of a throttle helps make the stunt safer.And with nothing to protect his head other than a glorious blond mullet, Marv could use all the help he can get.The electric drive surely makes for a nicer experience for onlookers as well. The viewing gallery is directly above the wall, where curious spectators hang their heads right over the wall’s edge. Gas-powered motorcycles that typically perform Wall of Death rides create a rising cloud of exhaust that is inhaled by the audience, but the SUPER73’s electric drive keeps fumes out of the performance.To see Marv in action riding the SUPER73 e-bike on the Wall of Death, check out the video below.Oh, and even though it probably goes without saying, please do NOT attempt this at home.",ebikes
2022/11/29,"Electric bicycles are quickly proving to be one of the best ways to get drivers out of cars while still providing fast, efficient personal transportation. And rebate programs that help reduce the cost of expensive e-bikes are now making them more affordable than ever before.While a national electric bike subsidy looked likely last year, it faltered before the finish line and failed to be included in the Inflation Reduction Act.Individual cities and states have since picked up the slack. Vermont launched the first state incentive program in the US. Denver, Colorado, also launched an incredibly popular e-bike rebate program that repeatedly sold out, and New York is now flirting with its own e-bike rebate.Now Oregon could become the latest US state to offer a generous electric bike rebate.A new bill known as Legislative Concept (LC) 1994 has been proposed by outgoing Oregon State Representative Karin Power to help provide rebates to e-bike buyers. It is now being passed off to Representative Dacia Grayber to sponsor the bill in the upcoming session.The proposed bill provides a rebate of up to $1,200 off the purchase of an electric bike (non cargo) or up to $1,700 off the purchase of an electric cargo bike. In order to qualify, the e-bike must have a minimum retail sales price of $950, which precludes the cheapest e-bikes on the market.The buyer is required to retain ownership of the e-bike for one year — no flipping allowed.Bike accessories purchased within the same transaction, such as a helmet or lock, can also be covered by the rebate.There are no income minimums to qualify for the rebate, but individual e-bike retailers must first register to become part of the program. Upon acceptance, they will be able to provide point-of-sale rebates to customers and then will be reimbursed by the State of Oregon within 30 days.The bill allocates $6M for the program to cover both the cost of the rebates and general administrative costs of running the program.With the 2023 session of the Oregon Legislature beginning in early January, we’ll be keeping an eye out for news of the bill’s advancement. This is exactly how money should be spent. If you want to invest in your state, in improving roads, in improving health, and in improving the lives of everyone who moves around your cities, then you need to invest in alternative transport like electric bikes, scooters, etc.I recently (September '22) grabbed a Tern GSD to do my daily drop-off and pickups of my kids (daycare and kindergarten), I wonder if this would qualify under this program.I will say having the e-bike has been a game changer, as I pass the cars hunting for parking during drop-offs and take the short cut to the daycare.Way faster than driving, its pretty nuts that everyone is driving 1 mile to the elementary school.My commute is only about 3 miles round trip x2 (drop-off and then pick-up), I've been doing it rain or shine (I skipped one day so far, because it was snowing. I draw the line at snow and ice.)I wish my neighbors would get the cargo bikes and drop their kids off instead of driving, maybe this will help me convince them.I think an income cap would have been a good idea to include here though. Wealthy folks have a much easier time buying a $1,500 e-bike than those who are already struggling to make ends meet and just need their own private form of transport aside from waiting for the bus.I find the $950 minimum retail price interesting, as it removes the ultra cheap e-bikes. Those are often (but not always!) lower quality and tend to be thought of as “disposable e-bikes” as they don’t last very long, frequently turning into bulky e-waste.Lastly, I’m not sure how they plan to enforce the requirement that owners keep the bike for one year. There’s obviously room for abuse here with people buying a $2K cargo e-bike for $300 and selling it on eBay to riders in other states. But hey, even if that happens, then it still means someone is riding an e-bike instead of a car… it’s just that Oregonians footed the bill.via: Bikeportland",ebikes
2022/11/27,"Black Friday returned with a bang this year, especially in the electric bike and e-scooter markets. Companies are fighting over consumers to out do each other with impressive sales. Some companies are offering nearly a thousand dollars off major e-bikes, while others are helping consumers save hundreds of dollars while also throwing in hundreds of dollars of free gear and accessories. Now that we’ve got Cyber Monday to look forward to, the sales just keep on coming. All of these awesome e-bike deals below (and some e-scooter deals, too) are already live and running!This list will be constantly updated in the days leading up to and through Cyber Monday. So be sure to check back for the revolving list of new electric bike sales!Rad Power Bikes started early with its Black Friday campaign in late October.One of the highlights of the Seattle-based e-bike company’s ongoing sale is that you can pick up a RadRover 6 Plus for a $500 discount. That’s a great off-road and trail bike for exploring outside of the freshly paved path. There’s also a $300 discount on the RadCity 5 Plus, which would make a great commuter bike when you’re sticking to the asphalt.The RadRover 6 Plus is one of Rad’s newest e-bikes and introduced a number of novel features for the brand, including dual digital displays and upgraded hydraulic disc brakes.The RadRunner 2, which is one of the leading utility e-bikes and has inspired countless imitators, is marked down $250 to $1,249. That’s the best price we’ve seen on this updated model. The RadExpand 5 is also on sale for $100 off, which makes the new folding utility bike even more accessible to riders.Phoenix-based Lectric eBikes recently launched a highly upgraded version of its best-selling electric bike: the Lectric XP 3.0.This folding e-bike is one of the best bang-for-your-buck electric bikes on the market right now, hands down. It offers speeds of up to 28 mph (though comes programmed for 20 mph out of the box, with the user able to unlock the higher speed via the on-board display). There are two battery options available for extra range, and the bike even includes a new motor and expanded rear rack for carrying a second rider.The Lectric XP 3.0 carries an MSRP of $1,099, but is currently on sale for $999. That sale includes a bundle of free parts, such as a free lock, headlight upgrade, bigger and more comfortable seat, and a suspension seat post.The cargo package and the passenger package are both marked down as well, so here’s a great chance to add those to your order if you want to save some big bucks.It’s also a good time to check out the Lectric XP Lite as well, which is priced at just $799 and includes a number of extra accessories for free as part of the Black Friday Bundle.Juiced Bikes has some awesome deals running already on nearly every bike the company makes. It’s worth checking out the sales page to see what might interest you.Some of the showstoppers include the popular RipRacer e-bike being marked down to a mere $999 and the HyperScorpion marked down to just $1,999. Both of those deals save you hundreds of dollars on some high-performance electric bikes.Juiced is known for making e-bikes with higher power levels for more entertaining rides, and both of these bikes are guaranteed to bring a huge smile to your face. Have fun picking the bugs out of your teeth!Ride1Up has plenty of e-bike sales going on across almost its entire line of urban electric bicycles. You can check out the entire list here. But if you’re looking for some of the best deals, you should check out the $250 off the 500 Series offer, which brings the bike down to $1,145, and $400 off the Ride1Up LMT’D, which brings that model down to $1,495.Saving $250 on the now $895 Roadster V2 is also a steal of deal, as is the $250 discount on the $945 Core 5.And if you want a fast yet comfortable cruiser-style electric bike that can carry a second rider, don’t overlook the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser, which is on sale for $350 off, bringing the price down to $1,245.We’ve reviewed nearly every e-bike in Ride1Up’s lineup, and the company’s overarching theme is quality, high-performance urban electric bikes for several hundred dollars less than you’d expect to find at pretty much any other major retailer.Biktrix has sales of up to $1,000 off some of the company’s popular electric bikes.This Canadian electric bike company has proven popular across North America for a series of commuter and fat tire electric bikes. With both budget-minded hub motor e-bikes and more powerful mid-drive options, Biktrix has an e-bike for just about everyone.Aventon’s OG e-bikes are currently having a $300 off sale as part of the company’s Early Black Friday festivities. The Aventon Level V1 is marked down to just $1,499 (compared to the next-gen model at $1,949). The Aventon Soltera now starts at just $999 for the single-speed version, which is a great way to get a high-quality commuter e-bike for a song.We’ve long been impressed with the build quality of Aventon’s e-bikes. While they’ve added some awesome features such as frame-integrated lighting and new app support to most of their bikes, the OG models are still every bit as good as we found them to be when we first reviewed them, and they can save you some serious cash.Another lightweight and awesome-riding folding e-bike is made by Carbo, which has a $500 off deal with free shipping going on now for Black Friday.Electrek’s own Seth Weintraub tested an earlier model of the Carbo and came away impressed with the bike’s performance, especially considering its lightweight package.While many e-bikes these days tend to look like cookie-cutter versions of each other, Carbo has innovated with their own unique design that is immediately apparent when you hop on the bike. Himiway has a number of sales that take between $200 to $300 off many of the company’s popular fat tire electric bikes.My wife and I just tested out the Himiway Big Dog, which is a moderate-sized cargo bike (though I’d call it more of a utility bike) and found it to be a fun bike for cruising trails and gravel roads. The big rear rack makes it perfect for carrying gear with you too. We’ve got a full review of that bike coming in the next few days.Be sure to check out some of the company’s other models too from fat tire adventure bikes to speedy moped-style bikes.ModBikes is running a big bundle sale that can save you some serious money on accessories and even a big e-bike rack for hauling your favorite ride on your car.Buying one bike gets you the company’s Essentials Bundle that includes a rack bag, lock, phone holder, and more. But if you buy two e-bikes, you get two bundles plus a free Hollywood electric bike rack, which we recently reviewed.ModBikes has a pile of interesting electric bikes to choose from, though my favorite by far is the Mod Easy Sidecar that makes it a snap to carry kids, dogs, or cargo along with you for a three-wheeled adventure.I absolutely love this hilarious little electric micro-bike.Technically it’s more of a scooter, but it rides and feels like a throttle-enabled electric bike due to the larger 20″ bicycle wheels and the bike-style handlebars/saddle.Not only is this fun little 20 mph runabout priced at just $999, but the company’s Black Friday bundle also includes a spare battery and a cargo box for free!Propella’s electric bikes are easily recognizable thanks to their iconic blue on black color scheme, narrower commuter wheels and lightweight designs.The company is offering huge sales that are taking as much as $300 off their already low-priced e-bikes.The $799 deal for the Propella 4.0 SS or Propella Mini are awesome deals that offer those high value e-bikes at prices we’ve never seen before. Snatch these up while the prices are this good!Blix Bikes makes some very nice riding Dutch-inspired electric bikes across a number of categories. From metro commuters to folders to cargo bikes, they’ve got a slick-looking collection.In fact, the companies newest model known as the Dubbel is particularly interesting since it also has the ability to carry a second passenger on back.I love when e-bikes can turn into multi-passenger vehicles since it greatly expands their utility as car-replacers.Blix’s sale is taking up to $300 off many of the brand’s most popular models. Check it out before it’s gone! Don’t think we’ve only American brands taking part in the Black Friday festivities. Estonian e-bike maker Ampler also has some cash-saving deals going on now.These high quality European-manufacturer e-bikes look great and ride even better! I recently toured the company’s factory in Tallinn and saw just how they build these lightweight, sleek-looking e-bikes.The company is having what looks like its best sale ever, taking $400 off the latest generation of it’s e-bike models and $500 off its previous generation bikes. These stealthy e-bikes definitely deserve a second look!Gocycle’s premium electric folding bikes combine exotic materials with sophisticated engineering from former McClaren designer and company founder Richard Thorpe.I’ve tested multiple versions of Gocycle’s e-bike models over the years, but the Gocycle G4 is one of my favorites.The bike is normally priced at $3,999 but has been discounted a whopping $1,000, bringing it down to just $2,999. For a premium e-bike like this, that’s a steal of a deal.It isn’t going to compete on power or range compared to some of the massive folding e-bikes we’ve seen before, but it’s lighter, easier to ride, quicker to fold, and will likely last years longer.Shoutout to the folks at Area 13 who reached out to let us know that they’ve got some great Black Friday deals running too.There are a pile of different e-bikes on sale with savings of up to $700, marking one of the steepest discounts we’ve seen so far.In addition to e-bikes, the company also has a number of accessories and e-bike carrying racks on sale too. It’s all worth a look!Speaking of scooters, if you’re on the hunt for a more traditional standing electric scooter, then you’ll want to check out the Black Friday Deals over at Miami-based FluidFreeRide.There’s a bit of everything, from $450 lightweight commuter scooters to several thousand dollar high-speed and ultra-high power off-road and highway-capable scooters.I’ve personally tested numerous scooters from FluidFreeRide and even visited the company’s headquarters to meet the team. Everything about the company I’ve seen has always been positive, so it’s a definite recommendation for anyone searching for an electric scooter deal right now.I had the chance to meet the Apollo team recently after having spent years testing their scooters.From lighter commuters to all out speed machines, they have just about everything. They also put a ton of effort into ground up designs that pack in more innovation by eschewing off the shelf components in favor of custom scooter designs.This year there are several deal to choose from on the company’s Black Friday Sales page, including chances to save hundreds of dollars on the Apollo Air, Apollo City, Apollo Ghost and more.This is a sale you won’t want to miss! It’s (obviously) still quite early, and so we fully expect more premature Black Friday sales to be announced. We’ll be sure to update this post continuously as we find them, so it’s probably a good idea to check back regularly over the next few weeks.",ebikes
2022/11/25,"Yeah, I thought the same that you did when I first started covering the Babymaker 2. Here’s a new e-bike from some bike bros that’s got more of a provocative name than actual substance. But I was wrong. Because after getting the chance to spin the pedals on the Babymaker 2 and put some good honest miles on the bike, I realized that this is actually a very nice e-bike for a certain segment of the population. And not just the keg stand segment.Black Friday update: it is now priced at $1,499!The Babymaker 2 improves upon FLX’s original Babymaker in several ways.First, there’s a larger battery that gives over 40% more range by boosting the 36V battery from 7Ah to 10Ah. It also comes with a more powerful charger to fill that pack in just three hours.The bike also sports fancy parts like a Gates carbon belt drive, a thru-axle for higher strength wheel/axle and improved longevity, and a set of Magura hydraulic disc brakes, which are probably overkill on a 35-pound (16 kg) bike but are very nice stoppers to see included.There’s a more complete spec list below, just after my video review. And you definitely want to watch my video, right…?It’s hard to look past the name, but let’s try. Because there’s a lot to like here.The Babymaker 2 is so light and easy to ride that you’d swear it is more powerful than the 350W motor lets on (and the fact that the motor peaks at 500W might have something to do with it). But even with that tiny motor in back, the svelte e-bike simply hops up to speed easily and quickly. It also does so silently. Every time I hopped on the Babymaker 2, I just couldn’t believe how quiet it was. Between the small motor and the Gates belt drive, there’s just nothing to make any sound. I could barely hear the bike. I went back and replayed some of the video clips I had recorded while riding, and the only thing I could hear was wind noise. As far as stealthy bikes go, this is it. If a ninja needed an e-bike, this is the one he’d choose.And speaking of that Gates belt drive, that thing is a beauty. It’s so smooth, so quiet, so simple, and just so perfect. I never have to oil it. I never have to clean it. I can just forget about it and it always works perfectly. For a commuter bike that I use everyday and want to know I can rely on it even if I’m not the best about keeping up with maintenance, it’s hard to beat. And when you add in those Magura hydraulic disc brakes, the low-maintenance design of the bike is further underlined. The only downside of the belt drive and rear hub motor combination is that it turns the bike into a single-speed. There’s no such thing as a deraileur for belt drives. To switch gears you’d either need an internally geared hub (which you can’t have with a hub motor — usually), or you’d need a front gear box, which is a super expensive piece of kit. Even so, I found that I didn’t miss the gears. To be honest, I usually just leave my e-bikes in the highest gear anyway. I mostly ride in either Florida or Tel Aviv, which are both known for the flat terrain and elevations that can be measured in the single digits. If you live in a hillier area, then the lack of a low-gear option might be more noticeable. But remember that the electric assist usually makes up for the lack of a low gear by helping you power through those first few pedal rotations that can be a doozy without motor assist.The front wheel also uses an actual thru-axle instead of a quick release skewer. It’s still quick release so you can remove the wheel without a tool in a snap, but it’s a stronger axle with a better-quality design normally found on more expensive bikes.Keep in mind that this is a Class 3 electric bike without a throttle, so if you’re used to throttles, you’ll be disappointed. As much as I love my throttle e-bikes, I must say that I still had a ton of fun riding around on the Babymaker 2 and pedaling up a storm.If you’re even reasonably fit, then a medium level of pedal assist will be sufficient. For those that haven’t pedaled in a while, the higher level of pedal assist will help make acceleration and hill climbing much easier. And for cyclists who are used to doing all the work, even just pedal assist level 1 will give you a nice little tailwind all the time.Just remember that you’re not going to get anywhere near the advertised range if you don’t keep the bike in pedal assist level 1. They say you can get up to 70 miles (112 km) of range, which is maaaaaaaybe true in level 1 where you’re doing most of the work. But few people will ride this e-bike in the lowest pedal assist power level. If you’re using the higher levels, it wouldn’t be surprising to cut that range in half.But that’s par for the course with e-bike companies. Most advertise the best-case-scenario range when operated in low power, and very few give you realistic real-world range data for every power level.The bike now also comes with a ‘logo delete’ option that removes the giant Babymaker 2 name printed on the frame. I don’t have any evidence for this, but I’m guessing they offered that option because there was enough demand from folks that wanted the bike but didn’t want the name plastered on the side for everyone to see.One last thing I love about the bike that has nothing to do with its nice ride and its surprisingly decent power are the options you get for size and colors. Most e-bikes, especially at this price level, come in a single size. The ones that offer multiple color options usually give two choices. If you’re lucky, there’s a third option. But the Babymaker 2 gives you four color options and two sizes to choose from. For a bike that will be pedaled 100% of the time, multiple size options are important to ensure you fit the bike as closely to optimal as possible.Does that make up for the lack of included fenders and lights? Ehhh, I’m not sure. As a commuter e-bike, I always feel like those parts should come standard. Even if not the fenders, then the lights should be included as mandatory safety equipment. You can add the company’s “touring package” to get lights, fenders, a rear rack, a bottle holder, and a phone holder – but it’s going to be an extra couple hundred bucks (and the lights don’t even run off the bike’s main battery). So that’s a bummer in my opinion.But for $1,749, you’re still getting a lot of good parts here. That Gates carbon drive isn’t cheap. Neither are Magura hydraulic disc brakes, as Magura is one of the highest-quality brands on the market. On the other hand, the low-power Aikema motor and small 360 Wh battery actually are pretty cheap, at least in terms of what they cost the company. And so I could have seen the bike costing a bit less.When it pre-launched at $1,222, that was a great deal. At the current sale price of $1,749, it’s still a pretty good option, but nowhere near as tempting as that launch deal. Black Friday update: now at $1,499!Even so, there just aren’t too many e-bikes out there in this category of lightweight belt-drive commuter e-bikes. So if that’s what you’re looking for, the Babymaker 2 is still a good option to consider.",ebikes
2022/11/22,"Here at Electrek we cover all sorts of electric vehicles, from cars and trucks to planes and trains. But one type of electric vehicle outsells all others combined many times over: the humble electric bicycle.And yet, for some reason, electric bicycles have been plagued by a running misconception that switching to an e-bike means a slow decline into sedentary demise. In reality, that couldn’t be further from the truth. The simple fact is that switching to an e-bike is one of the best things you can do to get more exercise. Don’t believe me? See why, below.First, let’s set the stage with some quick definitions. Electric bicycles are nearly the same as pedal bicycles, except for the inclusion of an assist motor and a battery pack. They use the same pedals, wheels, seats, tires, handlebars, etc. An e-bike is just a pedal bike with a helper motor. There are multiple types of e-bikes, with the main two groups being pedal assist (where you have to pedal to engage the assist motor) and throttle-enabled (where you usually have the choice of using pedal assist like the first style or alternatively using a hand throttle that doesn’t require pedaling).Both types are capable of offering great exercise, since both include pedal assist functions where you only get motor assistance when you’re also pedaling. But keep in mind that if you’re exclusively using the throttle on the e-bike instead of pedaling, you’re not getting much more exercise than you would on a horse. The good news is that as long as you’re using pedal assist, switching to an electric bike means you’ll be getting more exercise and living a healthier lifestyle.“But switching from what?” you may be thinking. Oh! Now you’re asking the right question! For some godforsaken reason, the e-bike argument is often reframed as electric bikes versus pedal bikes. It’s not uncommon to see comments on e-bikes articles to the effect of “Just what a country with 40% obesity epidemic needs. Less exercise.”But that’s the wrong way of looking at it, and the numbers prove it.When someone “switches to” an electric bike as a form of transportation, they are almost always switching out of a car. Sometimes it’s a bus or a train. But it’s almost never switching from a pedal bike to an e-bike. And do you know why? It’s because almost no one rides a pedal bike. If you’re a pedal cyclist then you’re surely scoffing right now. I’ll give you a minute. But then climb down from your high saddle, come back to me and look at the numbers. Surveys vary, but nationwide studies from 2019 found that around 0.6% of the US commuters used a pedal bike. That’s not nothing. It’s around 760,000 people, actually. But out of 130 million commuters in the US, that’s almost nothing.To be fair, bicycle commuting numbers grew after the COVID-19 pandemic amid a renewed interest in cycling, but we’ve still barely broken into integers here in the US. (Side note: Europeans, your numbers are much higher. That’s awesome. Keep doing you.) But the fact remains that somewhere between 75-90% of all commutes in the US occur by car (numbers vary widely depending on the city and whether ride-hailing/taxis/car-sharing are included).So if someone is switching to an electric bicycle, they’re almost guaranteed to be switching away from a larger vehicle like a car, truck, bus, or train.And when that’s the case, which it almost always is, they’re essentially guaranteed to be getting more exercise.Study after study after study has reported the health benefits of e-bikes for exercising. Boosted cardiovascular health. Better fitness test results. Improved mental health. Lower BMI from weight loss. The health benefits of e-bikes are long documented. They probably make you better in bed too. I have no study to cite for this but think about it: a healthier body and mind surely aren’t going to hurt in the bedroom.Most Americans find it hard to fit 30 minutes of moderate exercise into the day. And that’s fair – we all live busy lives. But a quick 15-minute e-bike commute to work gets you that 30 minutes per day without forcing you to set aside a specific block of daily exercise time. And many people cite e-bike exercise via commuting as a convenient level of exertion that gets your heart pumping without being so strenuous that you arrive at work sweating and in need of a shower.In fact, I’ve heard the same story over and over again from new e-bike converts: They bought an e-bike to get to work but found it to be so enjoyable that it turned into a recreational activity too. Their e-bike is a daily commuter vehicle and a weekend pleasure ride.Can you get most of these benefits from riding a pedal bicycle? Of course! And if you can make it happen on a pedal bike, that’s great! If you can walk to work, that’s great too! But you know what? You probably won’t. It’s nothing against you, personally. It’s just a numbers game. Due to the exertion required (and that resulting “sweaty at work” situation from pedal bikes), there are just so few out there that the odds of you being one of them is miniscule.If you ARE a pedal bike commuter or a walk-to-work person, that’s awesome and I applaud you. But you’re in a teeny, tiny minority. To be honest, I don’t even know how you found this article. You’re practically an endangered species at this point. Screw the pandas. We need bumper stickers that say “Save the cyclists!”So sure, I’m not saying pedal bikes aren’t great for exercise too. But again, that’s not the argument here. That’s reframing the whole idea incorrectly. Pedal bikes are great for the 1% of folks who ride them to work. For the rest of Americans, e-bikes could be the fun, fast, and efficient form of exercise that gets you out of the glass box and into the world, experiencing your city around you while improving your health.I completely agree. Four years ago, I got a regular bike to ride around the neighborhood. Next I started commuting to work a few times a week. Then I commuted every other day. Then four days week, my  goal was to beat public transportation. I achieved that then got an ebike to make my commute times both ways consistent. I haven't turned back. My commute was 12 miles one way. I have since moved and now my commute is 6 miles one way. It's peaceful way to get a workout in and to integrate fitness into your lifestyle. I'm less stressed and in better shape. I lost 50 lbs and my insulin injections have decreased 80% from when I first started. Now I work on getting a better commuter bike and am selling one of my motorcycles. I don't own a car and have lived in Denver and Albuquerque.With more cities improving their cycling infrastructure (one of the top reasons commuters often cite for not cycling to work), it’s becoming easier than ever to leave the car in the garage and hop on an e-bike. To be fair, the US has a long way to go in building safe, protected bike lanes. But progress, however slow, is headed in the right direction. Many advocacy groups and individual bike/e-bike commuters alike are making their voices heard, with more cities listening and installing better bike lanes.That’s important progress, but it shouldn’t stop those who already can bike from considering making the switch today. The “I live on the side of a 50 mph highway and can’t bike to work” crowd get a pass, but please understand you are also the minority. For the rest of you that live in a city, consider how biking, e-biking, walking, skipping, kick-scootering, or any other form of active personal transportation could improve your commute, your health, and your life.And for those of you that are dead set on never leaving the comfort of your SUV, just understand that cyclists help you too. The next time you see one zip by you while sitting in your captain’s chair, realize that you’re waiting in a little bit less traffic because of them. You’re welcome.",ebikes
2022/11/21,"The Himiway Big Dog is a new “cargo” bike from Himiway, a popular electric bike brand that has expanded its product line considerably over the last year. While I’m not sure this bike qualifies as a true cargo bike by most definitions, it’s definitely a fun little utility e-bike that cruises more like a mini-moped.My wife and I had a blast testing out a pair of Himiway Big Dogs on a recent trip to Vermont, where we soaked up the fall weather and enjoyed cruising on powerful electric two-wheelers.Check out our experience in the video below:We only had the bikes for a couple days, so I wasn’t able to do as in-depth testing as I normally do, but even in just a few days we still got to really enjoy these e-bikes and get a sense of what they’re made of. And while these aren’t high-end e-bikes like fancy $4,000 electric cargo bike options, there’s a lot to like.Sure, there are pros and cons to the Himiway Big Dog just like most e-bikes. But there are enough of the former to outweigh the latter in most cases.Let’s get those downsides out of the way first. The bike is quite heavy, weighing in at a hefty 79 pounds (36 kg). And it’s not just they’re heavy — the bike is also bulky. I only had to carry the two Himiway Big Dogs up three or four steps each day, but it was a doozy. The bikes are fairly long and the big hub motor puts that weight quite rearward. It’s doable, but it’s not at all like picking up a smaller e-bike.Next, the pedal assist is quite surge-y. I’m not sure if that’s the best word to describe it, but it really comes on with quite a surge of power. In fact, that’s why I consider these to be more of a moped-style e-bike. With that hand throttle at the ready and plenty of power on tap, it’s hard to fight the temptation to ride them like a moped where the pedals are largely for resting your feet. If you do want to pedal, you certainly can. But just be prepared that the cadence sensor isn’t forgiving, so the bike really takes off with just a bit of pedal spinning.Those were the two things that ruffled my feathers about the bike. After that, the Himiway Big Dog testing was pretty much all downhill from there, and lead to several days of smile-filled riding.The bike is quite powerful with a 750W motor. You can no longer unlock the 30+ mph speeds that Himiway used to give you, but 25 mph or so is still possible. Since my wife and I were mostly pleasure riding, we didn’t really use the top end of the speed range too often. It’s there if you need it though, and I know several of my readers are speed demons so there you go.The bike is also quite comfortable to mount, especially for shorter riders. My wife is 5’3 (160 cm) and she enjoyed how the seat can be set much lower than most other e-bikes that I try to force her to test out with me. It still raises up higher for taller riders, but the step-through design and low seat height option give the bike a wider range of rider heights.I’m also a big fan of that big rear deck. The wooden platform looks slick, though it’s not quite as utilitarian as if it had more exposed bars for lashing down cargo or hooking bungee cords. Still, a flat platform is often better for boxes and other flat cargo, so some people will likely prefer it. Plus there’s the whole “ooooh, wood is prettyyyyy” effect, too.Again, I’m not sure I’d call this a cargo bike like Himiway does, though the rack is certainly larger than we’ve seen on other utility-style bikes. And the Y-style double kickstand is also a nice addition for a “cargo” bike since it makes things more stable when you’re loaded down with cargo or kiddos on back.The Kenda tires aren’t anything special, but they’re nicely knobbied for the gravel-style riding we were doing. If you want to hit nature trails, the tires and front suspension will both have you set. And those mag wheels mean you never have to worry about spoke issues. Plus, they look pretty cool too.Front and rear LED lights as well as included fenders make it a great commuter option, though even having lights on a bike you may use purely for recreational is still a nice safety feature.That massive 48V and 20Ah battery means you can ride for a really long time. We didn’t even charge the bikes throughout the two days we used them — there was just no need. If you’re pedaling too or just going easy on the throttle, you’ll get several days of use on a single charge. I don’t think we’d ever see the 80 miles (130 km) that Himiway claims as the max range, but I also don’t think that 40 miles (64 km) would be a problem at all with reasonable speeds. With pedal assist, 50 miles (80 km) is also within reason. I’m glad to see parts like hydraulic disc brakes included, though they’re pretty much mandatory at the MSRP of $2,099. Even at the current sale price of $1,999 knocked down to $1,799 with code BF200 (or currently $1,799 on Amazon), if you try to sell me a utility e-bike without hydraulic brakes then that’s going to be a hard pass from me.I’d have loved to see some type of passenger package option for the rear. Bikes like the RadRunner and Lectric XP 3.0 have those, and they are super useful features for tossing a kid or even a small adult on back. But I guess you can just do like my wife and I and get two bikes. Not the most economical solution, but it sure does make for a fun afternoon ride with your cycling partner on the bike lane of life!",ebikes
2022/11/17,"A new electric bike has just been unveiled that is sure to turn nostalgic riders into the coolest big kid on the block. Meet the FLX Menace, which has an unmistakeable resemblance to a certain classic bicycle from the 1960s.The company surely can’t come out and say it, but there’s no mistaking that the FLX Menace is based on the timeless Schwinn Stingray bicycle.First debuted in 1963 and produced through the mid 1980s, the Schwinn Stingray brought motorcycle coolness to grade school kids all over the country.The FLX Menace carries over many of the same design stylings such as the swooping frame, banana seat with sissy bar, and the tall ape hanger handle bars.As the company explained:True classics never go away. They just come back even better. Our new electric bike, “The Menace”, has all the throwback charm mixed with a modern touch. Get ready to experience a modern take on an old familiar bike.The Stingray was originally launched as a single speed, though multi-speed variants followed in later years. The 3-speed “Stik Shift” version is a highly sought after classic that has become exceedingly rare after being banned due to an ill-placed shift lever that left a few unlucky teenagers forever singing in the boy’s choir.That shouldn’t be a problem on the FLX Menace, which appears to be a single-speed design using a rear hub motor to make up for a lack of changeable gears.Based on early renderings of the bike just released this morning, the FLX Menace looks to use a belt drive instead of a chain drive. Together with a hub motor in the rear, that setup precludes the option for multiple gear ratios.While we can glean a few other tidbits from the images, such as a pair of Magura hydraulic disc brakes, a set of rear pillion pegs for a passenger, and a rigid frame design, we don’t yet have any tech specs.The bike is likely to do at least 20 mph (32 km/h), and may even allow class 3 speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). It looks to have a large enough battery hidden under that banana seat to allow higher speeds or longer range riding. But until FLX decides to share tech specs with the world, we’ll have to guess at what the bike will be capable of.For now, the company is taking reservations of $100 towards an estimated price of $1,999. The bike won’t be ready to ship until summer 2023, so anybody tossing down a Benjamin will have a while to wait at the front of the line.That’s a pretty penny higher than the 1963 Schwinn Stingray’s $69 price tag. Though the FLX Menace is testament to the fact that even though the times (and prices) have changed, style doesn’t have to.This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a retro take on a modern electric bike.Harley-Davidson’s e-bike brand Serial 1 is known for eye-catching custom designs based on the brand’s high quality electric bikes. One of the most interesting was a retro-inspired design that looked straight out of the Stingray lineup.Compared to Serial 1’s higher prices though, the FLX Menace is likely to roll in with a much more affordable price tag.",ebikes
2022/11/17,"Fat tire electric bikes are all over the place these days. Full-suspension fat tire e-bikes are a bit rarer. But full-suspension fatties that can hit 30 mph (48 km/h) on throttle-only riding – that’s a unicorn right there. But that’s exactly what the KKBike K26S offers.Despite the unfortunate name that puts too many Ks way too close together, the bike itself is actually quite awesome.It’s something of a no-name brand, in that KKBike is one of many newcomers to the e-bike scene. That means I wasn’t expecting too much from the bike. But despite the bar being low, the K26S hurdled so far up and over it that I can just about look the other way on the name.To see what I mean about this surprisingly high-performance electric bike, check out my review video below!The KKBike K26S is not one of these weak-sauce fat tire e-bikes that looks like its built for off-road but is really meant to stick to the bike lane. This is an e-bike that can actually handle the trails.Of course it’s not going to work great on super winding, technical trails with tight turns and switchbacks. It’s just not a nimble enough bike for that due to the large 4″ wide fat tires. But the large volume tires that allow you to run lower air pressure make it great for cruising on dirt trails, fire roads, nature paths, packed sand or grassy fields. In those settings, this thing can really rip.The combination of a powerful motor and full-suspension give it exactly what you need to actually handle rough terrain. If it was just powerful but not comfortable, it’d shake you to pieces. I’ve ridden fully rigid electric fat tire bikes before. On rough fire roads they can get a bit dicey. And if it had nice suspension but no power, it really wouldn’t be much fun since you couldn’t blast through the rough stuff. But fortunately the KKBike K26S has both comfort AND power, which is what makes it such a hoot on the trails.Granted, the suspension isn’t top shelf stuff. This is a $1,999 e-bike that’s on sale for $1,799. You’re just not going to get amazing suspension at this price. But you still get some pretty decent stuff that’s fine for this type of recreational riding.The hydraulic disc brakes are plenty grabby with what seem like overbuilt calipers. Plus they’re candy apple red, which surely adds a good few extra pounds of braking force. And to make that braking force even stronger they come with 180 mm rotors, which is a nice thing to have on a fast e-bike like this. More on that in a moment.The rest of the components on the KKBike K26S are all “good enough,” too. The 8-speed Shimano shifter is basic yet acceptable (though bike snobs will surely pan it for being rather entry-level). The tires are simple Kenda fat tires, but they work just fine, even if they don’t have the same puncture protection as something higher-end. The headlight is perfectly adequate and even comes with a rock guard. And the touch points are decently comfortable. Again, not amazing stuff, but it’s all fine for the type of recreational and leisure riding I was testing it with.The plastic fenders aren’t my favorite and tend to flop around a lot, but I can live with it. If you don’t ride in wet stuff very often, you might even want to leave them off. I often leave plastic fenders off when they seem like more trouble than they’re worth.The color screen was a nice addition, and it was actually quite visible in daylight — something that isn’t true of many color screens.Yes, the KKBike K26S hits 30 mph (48 km/h) top speeds. And to answer the next question, yes it can do so on throttle alone.That’s not strictly legal for road use in many states in the US that rely on the three-class e-bike system. Class 3 e-bikes can only reach 28 mph (45 km/h), and they can only do it on pedal assist.But if you’re mostly getting this bike for off-road use, then it doesn’t really matter. It’s a free country and you can ride however you like on private land. In practice, I rarely found myself actually needing to get up to those speeds. Even with the suspension, doing 30 mph on dirt or gravel trails is a recipe for disaster. I don’t really want to wrap myself or the KKBike K26S around a tree, and so I was usually in the teens or twenties when I was keeping the bike on the dirt. I’m not racing here, I’m just having fun.The $1,999 price feels reasonable to me. The bike is solid, has a decently large battery and good power, and it even has full-suspension.At the current $1,799 sale price (with $100 coupon that is clipable on the Amazon page), that seems like a seriously good deal. We’ve seen plenty of e-bikes that cost more and deliver far less.There’s nothing super high-end about the KKBike K26S, but it does an excellent job at giving a taste of full-suspension off-road riding. I wouldn’t take it to Whistler, or really to any bike park with actual jumps, but it’s more than enough for little bunny hops on your local trail.And for anyone hoping to soak up a few potholes on their way to work, it’ll handle that just fine too.What do you think of the KKBike K26S? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/11/16,"Electric bikes, which provide motor assistance to make pedaling easier, have seen surging popularity over the past decade as a fun and efficient alternative form of transportation. One of the biggest successes of the e-bike movement has been creating new riders out of drivers that wouldn’t have otherwise considered switching from a car to a pedal bike. Now, a new study is showing just how much more efficient (and fun) e-bikes are than pedal bikes.The study, titled “It’s electric! Measuring energy expenditure and perceptual differences between bicycles and electric-assist bicycles,” was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Transport & Health.The researchers compared pedal bikes to electric assist bikes from a bike share program with one-hour rides on each bike, finding that e-bike riders used 13% less energy than pedal bike riders and had 21% higher enjoyment.Participants in the study first underwent a bicycle maximal fitness test and then had body composition assessed.They were provided with a pedal bicycle and an electric assist bike from a bike share program to perform two one-hour rides in a park circuit.The participants’ heart rates as well as the bicycles’ speeds were continuously recorded throughout the rides. Perceived exertion levels were reported by the participants at four intervals during the ride. At the end of the ride, participants reported their enjoyment, difficulty, and tiredness levels.The study used paired T-tests to compare differences between the pedal bike and electric bike rides.The results likely won’t surprise anybody: Riders on the pedal bikes used more exertion and energy with a resulting higher average heart rate. According to the heart monitors, pedal bike riders reached a higher mean percentage of maximum heart rate (69.6%) than the e-bike riders (61.5%).Measured on a 1 to 5 Likert scale, e-bike riders reported a higher mean level of enjoyment (4.6) than pedal bike riders (3.8).Additionally, both perceived exertion and tiredness were higher for the pedal bikes than the electric bikes.The study’s results, while interesting in their own right, should also be viewed within the limits of the study.A small sample size of just 15 individuals is well below what most statisticians would consider reasonable for drawing broader conclusions.The study also doesn’t provide details on the type of electric bicycle used or its power level.And perhaps most importantly, the study used a rather simplistic form of energy consumption analysis based on heart rate data.Even so, it’s hard to argue with the general conclusion that electric bicycles make it easier and more enjoyable to cycle compared to a traditional pedal bicycle without electric assist. They require less exertion (resulting in lower average heart rates), which contributes to the “I don’t arrive at work all sweaty” benefit of e-bikes compared to pedal bikes.It seems like a no-brainer that they are more fun. Riding a bike is just plain fun, and on an e-bike you don't even have to work (or at all, on throttle-equipped bikes) for the fun.For a roadie like me the suffering is the point, but most people aren't into that.Electric bicycles have been the subject of an increasing number of scientific studies in the last few years.Such studies are helping correct misconceptions and reveal interesting new data about electric bikes.For example, it is a common misconception that electric bicycles don’t offer exercise benefits, despite many studies showing the opposite.Some studies have even shown that electric bicycles offer even more exercise than pedal bikes because riders often end up riding longer than they would on a pedal bike.",ebikes
2022/11/14,"It’s a tale as old as time, humans finding ways to boost the speed of their rides. Cars get chipped. Motorcycles get aftermarket sprockets. Hell, back in the day horses probably got fed “the good carrots.” Now one of the latest forms of speed hacking has targeted electric bikes, and Amazon is getting raked over the coals for helping provide the goods to illegally hot-rod those e-bikes.The issue of modifying e-bikes for extra speed is most commonly found in Europe, where strict electric bike laws limit electric bicycles to a sluggish 25 km/h (15.5 mph).Considering that even an out-of-shape cyclist can surpass that speed on a rusty old Schwinn, some European e-bikers are understandably eager to find workarounds for more speed.To get around this low software-limited top speed of electric bicycles in Europe, a cottage industry of e-bike speed hacking kits have emerged. Solutions range from electronic modifications or “chipping” that can remove digital speed limits, to hardware hacks that trick the bike’s speed sensors into thinking it is going slower than it truly is, allowing for more speed.As The Times recently pointed out, a kit for hacking Bosch e-bike motors is currently an Amazon Bestseller in the UK.The product, which carries a price of around £150 (approximately US $175), boldly claims to be able to unlock Bosch e-bike motors to a speed of 45 km/h (28 mph). Hidden farther down the page is a small disclaimer explaining that unlocking an e-bike’s top speed above legal limits may be against the law in some areas.Policy director of Cycling UK explained that these kits are illegal to use on public roads in the UK because they change the classification of the e-bike:Illegal adaptations, where you no longer need to pedal or where the motor is overpowered or goes faster than 15mph, aren’t just a risk to the rider and others, but mean you’re riding a motorbike. You would therefore be committing a criminal offense riding one on UK roads without insurance, license plates, and a motorbike helmet.The ready availability of illegal conversion kits online is a concern. While buyers should do their research, there should also be a burden of responsibility on online retailers to make sure they’re doing their due diligence and only selling legal equipment with all necessary warnings about how to fit these kits safely and legally.People can go much faster than that using pedals and the only factor that should count is whether the rider is speeding.  I've never gotten pulled over for speeding on a bicycle, but a car once got pulled over for trying to pass me.  It was a mechanical bike with no speedometer so I can't say how fast I was going, but it's easier for the cops to ticket a car, and a speeding car can do more damage. Amazon, for its part, claims that these devices are sold by third-party vendors using its platform. Unlike items sold directly by Amazon, third-party vendors take orders via Amazon but often fulfill those orders independently.The company explained in a statement:Third-party sellers are independent businesses and are required to follow all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon policies when listing items for sale in our store.This type of e-bike hot-rodding is much less common in the US, where e-bikes are permitted to operate at speeds of up to 45 km/h (28 mph) in many places.Several e-bikes are known to achieve even higher speeds than 28 mph, and police departments in much of the US often aren’t yet well enough versed in electric bikes to differentiate between legal and illegal use of e-bikes on public roads.",ebikes
2022/11/09,"The Evelo Omega is the most technologically advanced electric bicycle I’ve tried in over 10 years. Other bikes are faster, throw out more power, or load up with IoT gadgets, but the Evelo Omega pushes the boundaries of eBike tech by removing the gear shifter from the handlebars entirely. At first glance I wasn’t completely comfortable with this idea, but some 10 miles later, I began to love it. While I can’t for certain say I’d buy this bike for myself, I can say that I know people who would.The cooks at Evelo have made a fantastic dish, with some very ambitious ingredients, but it comes together in a wonderful finished product. Many other companies wouldn’t dare make a bike without a shifter, but Evelo has the gumption to take a risk, and experience to make it pay off. As an overview, Evelo has combined a custom programmed 750w torque-sensing mid drive motor with an automatic shifting rear hub that maintains a preset pedal rotation speed. After turning on the bike one only needs to pedal and brake, and the motor power and automatic transmission will do the rest all on its own.At the heart of the matter is the rear hub made by Enviolo – a model called the Automatiq. Finally, we can say there is a fully automatic transmission for a bicycle. For some years we’ve heard bikes that “feel” like they shift themselves, including other products from Enviolo, but this time the training wheels come off, and the system is ready to operate like an automatic car transmission, axing the shifter entirely. Here’s how it works.The rear hub connects to a smartphone app where the user can set their desired pedal rotation speed (cadence), and the transmission will do the rest. Furthermore, it will remember this setting, so that after a few rides and testing, the user can hone in on the most comfortable number and never need to change it again. Uphill, downhill, stop or start, the rear hub will automatically adjust to the conditions and maintain the pedal speed that was set. My first few miles on the bike were familiar in some ways. I had to put aside my many years of shifting habits, and train myself to “let go.” I’ve had this feeling before, when my first car was a stick shift, and my next was an automatic. In a very similar fashion, I held onto my pride saying to myself “I can shift better than this doggone car can,” telling myself that I had more fun with a stick, and got better fuel efficiency. While this was true, it wasn’t until later in my life that I realized what I was missing: The peace and comfort of an automatic frames the world in a new way.The Evelo Omega is very similar. While approaching a stop, I would let off the pedaling, and the transmission would work internally, sensing the speed. When I started up again, the gearing was ready for me, and as I pedaled the first few yards it kept up with the perfect tension to maintain my desired cadence. Not having to shift, I put bike riding skills aside and just began to soak in the surroundings. My mind would drift from the peace of the river trail, the wind across the trees, what I was having for dinner, or the social and religious cycles that sprout from ancient and modern cultures across the globe.So far we’ve spent a lot of time talking about the pedaling movement, but there is a lot to be said about the way it flows with the rest of the bike, particularly, the motor. Between the geared hub and motor the Omega is using a gates carbon belt drive to make things smooth, strong, clean, and maintenance free. We’ve talked about belt drives a lot on this site, and in brief they make a bike much more classy and nice of a ride, and are usually found on high end bikes, like the Omega. Right in the center of it all is the motor that really checks all the boxes. The 750w torque sensing mid-drive motor has torque sensing engagement, and a throttle option for smooth pedaling power on the flats, and a jolt of power for the hills. With so many options and power, all smooth as silk, you’d be hard pressed to find a place this bike doesn’t feel like your personal magic cloud.The pedal assist levels can be changed on the fly, and don’t affect the Automatiq transmission, excepting for increased speed making the gears internally change faster. The Automatiq can really keep up with high speed starts and sharp brakes. I tried to “trick” the system a few times, but found it was always ready.The rest of the bike deserves some credit, too, as Evelo is one of the OG electric bike companies in the US, and they have been making amazing builds like this that other import companies can’t touch with a 10-foot pole. The tire and wheel combo is super plush, with tons of air volume in the eBike-specific 26” x 2.8” tires. The riding position is relaxed and comfortable, in part thanks to Evelo custom building their own high rise stem. In line with their astrology theme, it’s called the Star Gazer Stem. Complementing the full coverage fenders is a set of integrated front and rear lights. The rear light also functions as a tail light, flashing when the handles are squeezed.One thing that wasn’t all that great was the seat. Since the Omega puts riders in a relaxed position, more of the rider’s weight rests on the seat, and it was uncharacteristically stiff. After some more time it might wear in, but the hard seat was in contrast to the otherwise comfortable bike. Fortunately, bike seats are one of the easiest things to change.The Omega is coming in at $4,699, a hefty price for a comfort commuter electric bike. There are other electric bikes using the same automatic gearing, however they are nearly 2x the price, take months to ship, and use a 250w motor. If you wanted to spring for the plug-and-play dual battery rack, that will cost you an extra $400. By the way, you can enter this coupon code for $100 off an Evelo order: REF-4Q1DYKZ39397O5If you’re getting into cycling for the first time in a few decades, and you just want the power and simplicity of riding with 10-year-old legs, this is the bike for you. The ease of use, the power delivery and relaxing riding is simply the best I’ve ever tried. If you’re a seasoned cyclist, then this bike would be an incredible experience worth trying out, but the benefits are most felt by the newcomer. Other parts on the bike are really good, but the automatic shifting/motor combo is the standout reason for getting this bike.",ebikes
2022/11/04,"The Morfuns Eole X is a folding e-bike that offers a bit more than you’d expect from most barebones options. Instead, the Eole X has better parts like hydraulic disc brakes, throttle-enabled riding, and even rear suspension. Actually, make that psuedo-suspension.You might expect a rear suspension electric bike to have a spring shock in the rear, or perhaps even nicer oil-damped rear suspension.Instead, the Eole X comes with what I’d describe as a more passive form of rear suspension. There’s an elastomer stopper like you’d find on the end of a pinball plunger, though in this case it’s designed to absorb a shock instead of transferring one.That bright red rubber bumper may not provide the cushiest ride compared to true rear suspension, but it does help reduce the shock of hitting a pot hole edge.To see what I mean, check out my video review below, or keep reading if you’re more into the written word.Earlier this year I reviewed the Morfuns Eole S, which has a similar-looking setup but used a carbon fiber frame instead of the aluminum alloy frame on the Eole X. The Eole S came with a torque sensor but didn’t have any rear suspension like the Eole X, though I’m starting to think that might have been a less than equal tradeoff.The cadence sensor on the Eole X here isn’t much to write home about. It works just fine, but it doesn’t give the same quick feedback that the torque sensor on the Eole S provided.The saving grace is that the Eole X comes with a throttle, or at least the North American version that I reviewed does.That allowed me to blip the throttle while I was getting up to speed while waiting for the cadence sensor to kick in.The throttle is a bit of an odd design. It’s still a thumb throttle, but not of the conventional type. It’s a smaller paddle throttle. It works fine, though, and it even saves space on the bars compared to the typical wider thumb throttles.The Shimano Altus 8-speed derailleur isn’t anything special, but it allowed me to run through the gears and always find a good pedal cadence for the bike. The Eole X only gets up to 18 mph (30 km/h), so it’s not like it needs a particularly high gear ratio. If you get the European version of the bike, you’ll have an even slower 15.5 mph (25 km/h) top speed.The bike comes standard with a 360Wh battery, though there’s an option to upgrade to a 540 Wh battery if you’re so inclined. The base model’s smaller battery is still likely good enough for 20 miles or so (32 km) if you’re easy on the throttle and maybe a solid 30 miles (48 km) if you can add in some healthy pedal assist. If you need longer ranges, that larger battery might be a good idea.The battery is stored in the seat post, meaning you can remove the seat when parking outside to take the saddle and battery inside with you, all in one action. Of course if you don’t spring an extra $60 for the locking seat post clamp, then you’d better bring the battery in with you or it’d be easy pickings for thieves.The Eole X isn’t particularly fast, but they still give you solid hydraulic brakes. The extra stopping power isn’t really necessary for a bike that only gets up to 30 km/h (18 mph), but the low maintenance benefit is appreciated!At 19 kg (around 42 pounds), the bike is modestly lightweight compared to many other heavy folding e-bikes, but still isn’t a featherweight. It folds up nice and small, though, so it’d be easy to stash somewhere out of the way in your small apartment, or hide it in a cupboard somewhere at the office. It’d probably even fit under your desk or work table, and you could charge it right there, too.At a price of €2,199 (approximately US $2,199 – wow it’s convenient how close those are now), the bike feels a bit overpriced for what I’m getting. When it debuted on Kickstarter at $1,298, that felt like a much more realistic deal.Don’t get me wrong. I love a nice lightweight folding e-bike with grippy low-maintenance hydraulic brakes and in a small yet nimble package. But with the low power, low battery capacity and low top speed, the performance just isn’t going to wow anyone.Compared to premium folding e-bikes with this performance level, yes the Eole X is a better deal. But it’s still a lot of money for just not that much e-bike. I’d say for someone looking for a light and low power folder, it’d still be a good option. But for less than half the price I could grab a Lectric XP Lite that can do much of the same type of riding. Yes, it wouldn’t have that elastomer suspension or juice brakes like these, but it’d be a hell of a lot cheaper.So I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the Eole X. It’s a nice bike. It’s just pricey for what you get.",ebikes
2022/11/03,"One thing I love about e-bikes is that you have to put them on bike racks less often. Since they propel you significantly faster and farther than an acoustic bike, you are more likely to just ride to the bike path rather than carry the bike there on your car.That being said, there are definitely times when taking an e-bike on a car rack is needed, and the extra weight and different geometries of an e-bike make them impossible or dangerous to mount with traditional bike racks. That’s where a new breed of bike racks that blur the lines between bike carriers and motorcycle carriers come in. Today we are looking at the Hollywood Destination E-Bike Rack which comes in at a solid $699.99 price point. First off, the Hollywood Destination E-Bike Rack comes almost completely assembled in the box and only requires a few minutes to tighten some screws and attach some belts. It fits into the 2-inch trailer hitch which I installed on my Tesla Model Y. While it doesn’t offer any pass-through lighting (nor is it legally obligated to) it does offer a myriad of safety features that will keep you from pinching off a finger. The main thing I notice here is the quality, heavy duty parts, but it is also nice to see very eco-friendly packaging with only a few plastic zip-ties and baggies. With only a few parts to assemble, it becomes less daunting to put it together, and my teenage son and I had it attached to the car in 15 minutes.You’ll really notice the extra heft vs. a traditional bike rack, even a four-slot acoustic bike rack. At 46lbs, it isn’t trivial to insert into the trailer hitch, but probably my favorite part about this hitch and the biggest upgrade vs. my previous bike rack is the patented “no wobble hitch system.” That is a fancy term for bolt tightener, and it made a big difference vs. my old bike rack, which would wobble when we drove. The kit also includes an easily storable ramp for getting heavy e-bikes off and on the rack. Below, I am putting the Luna X-2 (which weighs about 42 lbs) on the rack.To be honest, I’m not going to use the telescoping ramp because I’m able to lift most e-bikes the three feet off the ground onto and off of the rack, but I imagine smaller folks could find this useful. It would also be useful to me with something like a Sur Ron, though technically the rack is only rated for two 70lb bikes. I unofficially tried with two 100lb Juiced e-bikes, and everything seemed fine. But I’d stick to the specifications on medium to long trips. The tie downs are super easy to affix, but it was extremely tight getting them around those 20-inch, 4-inch wide fat tire ebikes. I don’t think the small radius of these tires was considered in the design, and I hope to see a future bike rack with either closer clamps or longer belts. While the tie downs would easily keep the bikes on the rack, the Hollywood Destination e-bike Rack comes with two pole clamps that really keep the whole thing still. I particularly like these because they really allow just about any shape and size of bike to work. However, if you have a carbon bike, like the Luna X-2, you’ll want to affix the clamps to the seat post or some other non-carbon part of the bike. Like I said before, the “no wobble hitch system” came in clutch here. Together with the clamps, it really made the ride smooth, and it was easy to forget we were hauling heavy e-bikes. Knowing we’d lose some mileage, we drove slower than usual and only incurred about a 10-ish% range hit vs. our normal trip up there. Hollywood also offers keyed-alike locking frame and seat post clamps locks that give extra peace of mind when stopping at a restaurant on a trip. When bikes aren’t being driven, the rack folds flat agains the back of the car and also folds out easily for access to the back of the car. Of course, the Hollywood Destination Rack also works great with acoustic bikes, even XL 29-inchers like the Trek Session 8 downhill bike we use in Vermont. It only takes a minute to pop this thing on there and you are ready to hit the mountains. I know there are some sleeker bike racks out there from Thule and Yakima which cost up to $1000. But the Hollywood Destination 2 E-Bike Rack really inspires confidence at $699 and features a very sturdy, foldable system and smooth travel with the “no wobble”. If that’s too rich for your blood, they offer $599 and $499 models as well. ",ebikes
2022/11/02,"Rad Power Bikes is the largest electric bicycle company in North America, meaning that when they make moves, the industry responds. And the latest move we could soon see from the Seattle, Washington-based e-bike manufacturer may be the introduction of a new low-cost electric bike to replace the RadMission.Here’s why.The current entry-level electric bike model from Rad Power Bikes is the RadMission. The RadMission is a no-frills e-bike that eschewed fancier features like digital screens and multiple gears to hit the market at a more than reasonable $999 when it was introduced in the summer of 2020.The price managed to walk up to $1,199 over the years, but the bike still offered great specs for an entry-level price. Hitting 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle and pedal assist with a 500W motor made it a fun e-bike for the city, and a range of between 20-40 miles (32-64 km) cemented its place as a bare bones, but well-made, commuter e-bike.I got one of the first RadMission e-bikes ever produced and have ridden it hard ever since, including using it as an out-of-character gravel bike for off-roading – a job it was never meant to do.Now there are several clues that this crowd favorite could soon be replaced.The RadMission was announced in June of 2020, right in the thick of the blossoming COVID-19 pandemic. In e-bike time, that’s like a million years ago. Rad’s own product cycle often refreshes e-bikes after around two years, as we saw with the RadRunner 2 that followed 28 months after the original RadRunner was announced.How long has it been since the RadMission was unveiled? 28 months. I’m not trying to go all Da Vinci code on you guys, but c’mon!With the RadMission surpassing its two-year anniversary this past summer, the time is ripe for an update. And considering that low-cost electric bikes are rather simple to iterate thanks to their no-bells-and-whistles designs, it won’t take the company all too long to develop a replacement. At least not as long as a more complicated bike like Rad’s flagship RadRover 6 Plus, for example.As I mentioned above, the RadMission usually sold for between $999 to $1,199. It occasionally saw brief sales of $899, which caused us all to fawn over what a great deal it was.But last month, Rad shocked the entire industry when it abruptly dropped the RadMission’s price to just $499. Jaws hit the floor so hard around the country that orthognathic surgeons are probably on boat-buying sprees right now.It was crazy. It was wild. I already had a RadMission, and I was half ready to get another one as a spare just because the deal was that good.Why on earth would Rad sell an e-bike for so little? That price has to be darn near at-cost for the company. The only two reasons I could think of at the time were that the RadMission would soon be replaced and thus they needed to burn through existing inventory, or that the company massively overbought during the height of supply chain uncertainties and were now left with a warehouse full of bikes. But now the new evidence below makes it seem like the first option was correct…Perhaps the most damning evidence that the RadMission is being replaced is that Rad Power Bikes almost comes right out and says it. Or at least they’ve revealed that the RadMission is finished. Kaput. Down for the count.Now the company’s RadMission page has been updated to not only show that the bike is out of stock (that’s what a $499 sale will do!), but also that the bike will not be restocked.Could they simply be sunsetting the RadMission? Maybe.But Rad doesn’t retire e-bikes very often. Though to be fair, it’s not unprecedented. That RadMini was recently deep-sixed when the RadExpand was unveiled as its replacement; but that was the exception at Rad, not the rule.Generally speaking, Rad is known for pumping out new and improved versions of its e-bikes every few years, tacking on a new number. Meet the RadWagon 4, the RadRunner 2, the RadCity 5 Plus, etc.That’s the question: What’s next?Perhaps Rad really is saying goodbye to the low-cost RadMission and instead wants to focus on its higher-end electric bikes that likely come with cushier margins. Maybe low-cost competitors like Lectric eBikes have been eating Rad’s lunch on that end of the market, and the brand is tired of it.But Rad doesn’t seem like the type of company to shy away from competition. They’ve got an e-bike in just about every e-bike space: fat tire adventure e-bikes, folding e-bikes, cargo e-bikes, commuter e-bikes, utility e-bikes, etc. Just about the only thing they don’t do is a dedicated road e-bike, but that’s because its such a high-end niche that Rad doesn’t really want to touch the lycra crowd.Instead, my best guess is that a RadMission 2 is coming. It’s just too awesome of a platform to abandon, and it opens the door to so many new riders that want a full-size electric bike without paying a full-size price.But then again, this is all merely conjecture. Only the folks on NW 52nd street know the real answer, and so far they aren’t talking.",ebikes
2022/11/02,"More than just little red wagons, Radio Flyer has spent the last couple of years upping its electric bike game. The company puts an emphasis on quality production while retaining an affordable price, and the new Flyer Folding Cargo Electric Bike certainly tracks with that design ethos.In the past, we’ve reviewed Radio Flyer’s midtail cargo bike with larger wheels and a bulkier frame.But with the new Flyer Folding Cargo Electric Bike (which doesn’t exactly have the most creative name), the company is focusing on shrinking the bike’s size while still retaining proper cargo qualities.The 53-pound (24 kg) bike uses an integrated rear rack that is part of the actual frame, increasing strength and rigidity.It’s a similar move to one we saw yesterday on the new Lectric XP 3.0 e-bike, which added the rear rack directly into the bike’s frame to offer up to 150 pounds (68 kg) of cargo capacity in back.The Flyer Folding Cargo Electric Bike doesn’t come with quite the same heavy-duty weight rating, but it still lets you carry kids on the back with its 80-pound (36 kg) rack weight limit. The bike has a maximum rider weight capacity of 220 pounds (100 kg), resulting in a total payload capacity of 300 pounds (136 kg).The bike features a 350W continuous-rated rear hub motor and a removable 48V 10Ah lithium-ion battery with 480Wh of capacity.The battery dock behind the seat post also has a small, discrete compartment designed for hiding an Apple AirTag or other similarly-sized tracking device.That’s a move we’ve seen other companies like Juiced and Wing Bikes employing as well, making it easier to track your bike if it gets stolen.Radio Flyer says its battery can power the bike for up to 40 miles (64 km) of range on a single charge, though that’s when using the lower few of the five pedal assist power levels. If you’re rocking that thumb throttle hard, then you’ll find the range will be lower.Stopping is accomplished with a pair of mechanical disc brakes using 180 mm rotors.LED lights, an LED handlebar display with a USB charging port, a dual leg kickstand, and a fender set are included as standard equipment, though Radio Flyer’s range of cargo baskets are add-ons that will require you to fork over some extra cash on top of the bike’s $1,699 purchase price.Radio Flyer is focusing on differentiating itself through quality manufacturing. The company highlights its quality control and safety standards as key aspects of its design and production.The Flyer Folding Cargo Electric Bike conforms to UL2849 for its electrical systems, UL2271 for its li-ion battery, UL1310 for its battery charging, and ISO4210 for its frame and fork testing.The e-bikes also undergo rigorous inspection and testing before leaving the factory. As the company explained:All components of Flyer™ eBikes undergo robust quality control inspections, and a multi-point inspection process throughout the bike assembly process ensures the highest standard of quality. In fact, every Flyer™ electric bike passes 50 quality checks on the assembly line. 100% of bikes are ride tested after assembly to ensure safe and proper function. Packaging is designed to meet the ISTA 3A standard to ensure no damage to the bike or components during the shipping process.Radio Flyer is offering its folding cargo e-bikes in four different color options of black, red, white, and green.There’s only one frame size, but the company says it can fit riders from 4’11” to 6’4″ (150 to 193 cm).What do you think of Radio Flyer’s newest electric bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/11/01,"Phoenix-based electric bicycle brand Lectric eBikes has just unveiled its newest model, the Lectric XP 3.0. Full of new features and updated components, it’s set to likely become one of the best-selling electric bikes in the country.That’s because the Lectric XP 3.0 is now replacing the Lectric XP 2.0, and it’s upgrading a number of key areas on that bike while retaining the same low $999 sale price. There’s also a long-range version with 40% more battery for just $1,199. And for a limited time, that promotional price includes free upgrades, including a premium seat, suspension seat post, free lock, and free upgraded headlight.From the bike’s new brakes to dual passenger support and upgraded electronics, the new e-bike is chock-full of interesting new additions.The company was kind enough to invite me out to Phoenix in early September and offer me the first-ever test ride on the model, which you can check out in my video below.But then keep reading afterward to learn all about the new upgrades on the bike.We’ll start off with what remains unchanged, which is essentially the foundation of the bike.It’s still a folding e-bike with throttle operation up to 20 mph (32 km/h) or pedal assist up to 28 mph (45 km/h). We’ve still got those fairly fat tires at 20″x3″. We’ve still got a full LED light package, rear rack, and included fenders, which is basically the commuter trifecta. And it’s still priced at the more than reasonable $999 that the previous XP 2.0 sold for. Plus the bike shows up at your door fully assembled, meaning there’s not much to do other than pull off the packaging material and start riding. No long assembly process needed!So the best parts are still there, but the upgrades are where the real interesting features are lurking.First of all, there’s an integrated rear rack instead of a bolted-on rear rack. That means it’s part of the bike’s frame and is thus extra strong. The rear rack comes with a 150-pound (68 kg) weight rating and is the key to making this a two-passenger e-bike.With the passenger package accessory (and an extra $75), owners can add a padded rear bench seat, a set of foot pegs, and a handlebar that mounts on the seat post and gives rear riders something to hold on to. If you and your buddy aren’t waist-hugging close, then that will likely be a much-appreciated accessory.Lectric eBikes cofounder and CEO Levi Conlow took me out on an XP 3.0 so we could test the passenger package together. He got us up to around 25 mph or so (40 km/h) with me on back, and then I got to take the reigns and shuttle him along for a ride too.There’s also a “passenger mode” that can be selected via the display to limit the speed to 10 mph (16 km/h) for anyone who isn’t comfortable carrying a second rider at high speeds. It’s a good idea if you’re not used to carrying the extra weight or if your passenger is of the extra flailing variety.To better handle the extra weight of a second rider, the Lectric XP 3.0 received an upgraded motor with extra torque and a higher current controller.That increased current essentially translates into more peak power, which can be helpful on hill climbing and when getting rolling with a heavy load. The Lectric eBikes team took several XP 3.0 bikes to San Francisco to prove them on the steepest hills in the city, ensuring that the bike will work just about anywhere.They’ve also made it even easier to pedal at those higher speeds by increasing the highest gear ratio. The 14t sprocket on the rear has been replaced with an even smaller 11t sprocket, meaning your feet won’t be spinning quite as fast at top speed.And as Levi explained, “You can get up to 28 mph really freaking fast.”Other improvements include upgraded touchpoints, such as nicer hand grips and a more comfortable saddle. And as Levi again explained in his elegantly blunt way, “The seat just cups your butt better, there’s no better way to describe it.”The bike also sports improved disc brakes with 180 mm rotors and 20% more travel in the hydraulic suspension fork.A number of new accessories were launched as well, such as food boxes and platforms for delivery riders, Yepp seats for carrying kids, a brighter “Elite” headlight option (which is included for free as part of the Black Friday deal at launch), a new bike cover, and waterproof panniers for carrying gear or groceries.As I was riding the streets around Lectric’s Phoenix headquarters, I couldn’t help but feel like I was on a much nicer e-bike than what you’d expect to get for under a thousand bucks. That’s been a hallmark of the company ever since they launched their original Lectric XP back in 2019: low prices and getting more than you bargained for.There are, of course, other e-bikes out there with much nicer parts that weigh less or that offer more precision-engineered drivetrains. But they compete in completely different categories.The Lectric XP 3.0 didn’t feel like a $3,000-$4,000 precision machine, but it felt like more than I would ever need for my everyday commuting and leisure riding, that’s for sure.While I can always nitpick at the bike compared to the more expensive e-bikes I’ve tried, any complaints feel like potshots.Sure, it’s fairly heavy at 64 pounds or 29 kg, but that’s what you get with a folding fat tire e-bike with just about every included accessory thrown onto it.And yes, the parts aren’t terribly high-end. You’re looking at basic Shimano shifters, mechanical disc brakes, etc. But it’s all just fine stuff. It may not be fancy, but it’s name-brand stuff, and it also keeps the bike affordable. For the $999 price, I simply can’t think of another e-bike that offers this much bang for your buck. And when you consider that the long-range version with 40% more battery costs just $1,199, this is a legit steal of a deal.I’ve got no doubt that the Lectric XP 3.0 is going to quickly become one of the best-selling e-bikes in the country, and it very well may sit at the top of that list.",ebikes
2022/10/31,"The massively excessive GMC HUMMER EV is known as a “supertruck,” and now the automaker is announcing a “super e-bike” to go with it. The newly unveiled GMC HUMMER EV ALL-WHEEL DRIVE EBIKE will serve as a companion vehicle for the massive electric truck. The new GMC HUMMER EV e-bike is a hardtail fat tire electric bike that features a pair of Bafang hub motors to provide all-wheel drive.Each motor is rated at 750W continuous and 1,200W peak, meaning the bike puts out 2.4 kW of power at full tilt. That allows it to reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). Fortunately, the bike also includes a pair of four-piston hydraulic disc brakes to bring it back down to reasonable speeds.A maximum of 1 kWh of battery will supply those power-hungry motors, and the battery is removable for charging off the e-bike.For those keeping score at home, that means the GMC HUMMER EV will have a 200x larger battery than the GMC HUMMER EV ALL-WHEEL DRIVE EBIKE.Priced at around $113,000, the four-wheeled version is also around 28x more expensive than its $3,999 two-wheeled companion.GMC will have the e-bikes available at its dealerships but will also offer the e-bike direct-to-consumer for online ordering.Despite the throttle and pedal-assist e-bike offering all-wheel drive, there are actually three drive modes that let riders shut off one of the motors. Cruise mode engages only the rear motor. Traction mode engages only the front motor (and must be named ironically based on how quickly you’ll start spinning that front tire in loose terrain). Adrenaline mode kicks in both motors at once for true all-wheel drive operation.As you might have guessed, the bike wasn’t actually developed by GMC. Instead, the company partnered with an e-bike brand known as Recon Power Bikes.As GMC’s marketing director Rich Latek explained:GMC is excited to collaborate with Recon as they develop the GMC HUMMER EV AWD Ebike. With design cues and inspiration taken directly from the GMC HUMMER EV Supertruck, this Ebike further expands customer’s ability to explore different off-road trails – whether in the vehicle or out on the bike.Recon’s president, Jeff Fuze, added:The Recon Team is thrilled to be the officially licensed partner producing the GMC HUMMER EV AWD Ebike. We are honored to partner with GMC on this unique world-class AWD Ebike that parallels HUMMER EV’s unrivaled reputation as the leader in EV off-road adventure.Pre-order reservations are now open for anyone who missed the chance to get an early electric HUMMER but who doesn’t want to make the same mistake on the e-bike version.Oh boy.Here’s the thing: I love electric vehicles, but I hate everything there is to the HUMMER EV. It’s an abomination. The egregious waste of resources alone is an affront to humanity, let alone the questionable ethics of putting that much power in a 9,000-pound (4,100-kg) bulldozer that could literally crush pedestrians without the driver even knowing it.The GMC HUMMER EV ALL-WHEEL DRIVE EBIKE, on the other hand, feels like a step in the right direction. It’s still excessive but at a level that is at least reasonable. And the rider is sure as hell going to know if he or she hit someone.I’m sure it’d be a fun off-roader and would even handle a city commute as well, though that’s not what it’s built for.I half wonder if the bike was a response to some of the outrage directed at the GMC HUMMER EV from much of the pro-not-getting-crushed-by-cars community. It would have been pretty easy. It’s not like GMC had to do much work here. The magic of licensing agreements meant that some money changed hands and a GMC sticker went on a Recon e-bike.Whether or not this e-bike is worth $4,000 when you could find other similarly capable e-bikes for less is something I’ll leave up to my educated readers.And let’s all hope that GM’s second attempt at an electric bike goes more smoothly than its first.",ebikes
2022/10/30,"The G-FORCE ZM electric bike is one of those e-bikes that borrows heavily from motorcycle styling while maintaining its street-legal status as an electric bicycle. But the motorcycle influence doesn’t just run skin deep; it’s also got a powerful ride to match.Want to watch me take this e-bike on a series of test rides? Check out my video review below!Everything about the G-FORCE ZM screams moto, not bike. I’d call it a fairly true-to-form electric moped, even if it technically fits into the e-bike classification.Yes, it’s a class 3 e-bike in the US, but it rides more like a moped that has vestigial pedals for resting your feet. You could pedal it in the event of a dead battery, but the 85-pound (38-kg) bike isn’t going to be a pleasure to pedal at anything more than around 4-5 mph (8 km/h). And lord help you if there’s even a small uphill section on your pedal ride back home.But with the option for a 48V and 20Ah battery (or a smaller 13Ah battery if you want to save some cash), you should have plenty of range for a day trip. And since the $1,899 entry-level model with the 13Ah battery is only $100 cheaper than the 20Ah version, I don’t know why anyone wouldn’t want to spend that extra Benjamin to get 50% more range.In addition to decent range, the G-FORCE ZM is also fast and peppy with a 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed. The 750W Bafang motor is actually putting out closer to 1,300 watts of peak power, and the bike has good acceleration under my 150-pound (68-kg) load.The dual suspension setup makes for a comfortable ride, though I don’t know how the suspension would fare under the max 400-pound (181-kg) weight rating (or if the acceleration would be nearly as peppy).The 110mm-travel suspension fork is adjustable, but the rear suspension is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of situation. It’s fine for me and makes for a good ride, but it’s not exactly going to handle a downhill mountain bike trail. Speed bumps are a little more its pace.Which also begs the question, why did they give the bike knobby tires? The four-inch fat tires in a 20-inch diameter size are great for street riding, except that the knobbies don’t give quite as much traction as I’d like on asphalt. You could theoretically go off-roading with these tires, but the suspension isn’t really designed for anything more than a shortcut across a fairly manicured grassy field. I’d have preferred to see street tires instead of all-terrain tires, but tires can of course be swapped at home or by your local bike shop.I really like the tires that Specialized showed off on its low-cost utility bike, which featured a street-optimized center patch with knobbies on the edges for better turning off-road. That would have been a decent compromise here.Another upgrade I would have liked to see on the G-FORCE ZM would have been larger disc rotors. The hydraulic disc brakes seem fine, but the smaller 160mm rotors are definitely going to heat up quicker when repeatedly stopping this heavy bike from higher speeds. It seems to me that 180mm rotors would have been a better choice. The G-FORCE ZM still scores several points in my book though, even if I would have liked to see some brake and tire upgrades.The bright and colorful LCD screen is easy to read at a glance and looks much nicer than the displays we often see on similarly priced e-bikes.The motorcycle tank-shaped battery is a neat feature that adds to the fun vibe of the bike, though I can pretty much already guarantee you that there are going to be armchair physicists in my comment section below educating us on the travesty of having that weight higher up on the frame. In practice, the rider’s center of mass, which is around 15x heavier than the battery and much higher up, is going to have way more of an effect on the bike’s handling. And for a bike that is going to spend most of its time riding straight in a bike lane or making easy 90-degree turns on city streets, the higher center of mass from that tank battery just isn’t going to be very noticeable. So for me, I’ll enjoy the fun motorcycle-styled design.It’s true that a lower-mounted battery would technically be better. But having ridden the bike and also having ridden others with lower batteries, I can tell you that the difference is simply quite small, all things considered.There are other nice features that often get left off these moped-style e-bikes, such as a 7-speed Shimano transmission and a USB charger built into the handlebar display. The massive LED headlight and included LED tail light make the bike plenty visible, which is important for commuter-style riding at night.While I can nitpick about the G-FORCE ZM’s smaller brake rotors and tire choice that doesn’t quite make sense, there’s a lot more here that I like than that I don’t.The full-suspension setup normally jacks the price up quite high, but a starting cost of just $1,899 feels reasonable for a Class 3 e-bike with dual suspension, hydraulic brakes, and some nice added features.A pair of footpegs are just about all that is missing to turn this into a pretty awesome urban cruiser, giving motorcycle vibes in an e-bike price class.It may not have the gravitas of a SUPER73 or other big-name moped-style electric bikes, but it sure offers a fun and reasonably priced ride!",ebikes
2022/10/28,"Remember when Black Friday came right after Thanksgiving? Me neither, and it’s apparently a distant memory for the electric bicycle industry too. But the breakdown in calendar awareness at least means big savings for e-bike riders, as many e-bike brands have launched Early Black Friday deals in late October.Some of these sales are specifically listed as Early Black Friday deals, while others are just end-of-season sales.But just like Juliet’s rose, the deals smell just as sweet no matter what they’re called.Below are some of the best money-saving e-bike sales we could find, but we’ll keep updating this article as we discover more deals.Rad Power Bikes has already had some impressive sales as part of an extended Early Black Friday campaign.Unfortunately, you’re a bit late to snag their RadMission at its $499 price, which was likely the most amazing deal we’ll see all year. But you can still pick up a RadRover 6 Plus for a $700 discount!The RadRover 6 Plus is one of Rad’s newest e-bikes and introduced a number of novel features for the brand, including dual digital displays and upgraded hydraulic disc brakes.The fat tire e-bike is perfect for adventure riding, though plenty of people actually use it for city commuting. The fat tires may be off-road optimized, but that same plush ride helps smooth out potholes in urban jungles too.Juiced Bikes has a pretty amazing deal of up to $900 off the original CrossCurrent X electric bike. Designed for slicing through the city, this e-bike maxes out the legal limits for power and speed, bringing you right up to 28 mph and making quick work of your commute.It also comes with lights, a rear rack, fenders, and pretty much anything else an e-bike commuter could need.The bike’s MSRP of $2,399 has been slashed to just $1,499 for the step-over and step-through versions.Aventon’s OG e-bikes are currently having a $300 off sale as part of the company’s Early Black Friday festivities. The Aventon Level V1 is marked down to just $1,499 (compared to the next-gen model at $1,949). We’ve long been impressed with the build quality of Aventon’s e-bikes. While they’ve added some awesome features such as frame-integrated lighting and new app support to most of their bikes, the OG models are still every bit as good as we found them to be when we first reviewed them, and they can save you some serious cash.Ride1Up has plenty of e-bike sales going on across almost its entire line of urban electric bicycles. You can check out the entire list here. But if you’re looking for some of the best deals, you should check out the $250 off the 500 Series, which brings it down to $1,145, and the $300 off the Ride1Up LMT’D, which brings that down to $1,595.We’ve reviewed nearly every e-bike in Ride1Up’s lineup and the company’s overarching theme is quality, high-performance urban electric bikes for several hundred dollars less than you’d expect to find at pretty much any other major retailer.Gocycle’s premium electric folding bikes combine exotic materials with sophisticated engineering from former McClaren designer and company founder Richard Thorpe.I’ve tested multiple versions of Gocycle’s e-bike models over the years, but the Gocycle G4 is one of my favorites.The bike is normally priced at $3,999 but has been discounted a whopping $800, bringing it down to just $3,199. For a premium e-bike like this, that’s a steal of a deal.It isn’t going to compete on power or range compared to some of the massive folding e-bikes we’ve seen before, but it’s lighter, easier to ride, quicker to fold, and will likely last years longer.It’s (obviously) still quite early, and so we fully expect more premature Black Friday sales to be announced. We’ll be sure to update this post continuously as we find them, so it’s probably a good idea to check back regularly over the next few weeks.",ebikes
2022/10/27,"The Malibu-based electric bicycle company SONDORS recently submitted filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating that it seeks to go public, which would make it the first e-bike company in the US to do so. But in addition to revealing some interesting new future products, the filings shined some light on past missteps and gave customers who claim that the company misleads the public ample ammunition.We’ve seen several electric mobility companies go public in the US recently, including Harley-Davidson’s electric motorcycle brand LiveWire, Taiwanese battery swapping giant Gogoro, and Texas-based electric powersports company Volcon.But SONDORS would become the first electric bicycle maker to hit the US stock exchanges. The company shot to stardom back in 2015 when it debuted a $500 fat-tire electric bicycle in a massively popular crowdfunding campaign.In the years since, SONDORS has continuously added to a rapidly expanding electric bicycle product portfolio, as well as branched out into a light electric motorcycle known as the Metacycle and a perpetually stalled three-wheeled electric “car” project.The company recently submitted an S-1 filing, which is a federally required form that any company seeking to go public must file with the US SEC. SONDORS’s filing gives us never-before-seen insight into the company’s operations and financial standing.Most privately owned electric bicycle companies like Rad Power Bikes and Lectric eBikes are purposefully opaque about their business metrics. We have to rely on publicly available import data and industry whispers to extrapolate information like annual sales data, with both of those companies estimated to sell e-bikes in the six-figure volumes annually.But looking through SONDORS’s prospectus document shows deeper insight into the company that also reveals some unflattering information. For starters, while other major e-bike companies like Rad and Lectric are assumed to be well into profitability at this point (despite their exact financials not being known to the public), SONDORS’s financial reports in the filing that cover the previous two fiscal years show that the company operated at a net loss in both 2020 and 2021.The financial documents reveal that both years actually saw positive gross profits on products sold, with between $12M to $16M in revenue and $3.5M to $4.5M in gross profits. But the company spent between $2M to $3M in marketing and between $2.4M to $4.8M on general and administrative expenses, which typically includes items like salaries, rent, maintenance, office expenses, interest on loans, insurance, etc. That resulted in net losses of $745,000 in 2020 and $4.9M in 2021.The financial documents also reveal a high liability to asset ratio of over 1, which would indicate that a company currently has more liabilities than assets. That could mean that if a company doesn’t raise additional funds or increase revenue, it could eventually be unable to meet its current financial obligations.The S-1 filing submitted by SONDORS states this explicitly, with the company writing that, “Our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to complete this offering. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding from this offering or in the future, or if we are unable to grow our revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.” A going concern is MBA-speak for a business that can meet all of its financial obligations.In this case of SONDORS, the financial reports indicate that the high liability to asset ratio is mostly due to a large amount of customer deposits associated with pre-orders for products. These are recorded as a type of liability until the products are delivered. Out of the company’s current $22.9M in liabilities, as stated in the financial reports ending in June 30, 2022, approximately $19.4M is made up of customer deposits. That compares to the total current assets of $18.5M for the same period, consisting mostly of $5.2M in cash, $4.8M in inventory, and $7.95M in prepaid expenses.However, these figures are only current as June 30, 2022. They don’t include any financial events that occurred in Q3 or the beginning of Q4 of this year that could impact the company’s financial outlook heading up to a potential IPO, so we don’t have a current snapshot of the company’s financials for comparison.The filing also revealed more information about the stalled deliveries of SONDORS Metacycle electric motorcycles.We reported in the past that the lightweight electric motorcycles have taken a circuitous path to delivery. The bikes finally began deliveries in the past few months but were only limited to pre-order customers located in California. Now we’re learning that a licensing issue may be related to the slow rollout.As the company explained in the filing, “In the second half of September 2022, we determined that we had inadvertently delivered a limited number of MetaCycles to some of our customers before we had obtained all necessary licenses. As a result, we have ceased delivering MetaCycles and are in the process of applying for and obtaining such licenses and we will commence deliveries of our MetaCycles once we obtain the requisite licenses. We expect to obtain our dealers license in the State of California by the early part of November 2022.”However, it should also be noted that the language in these S-1 filings is purposefully skewed towards a conservative statements to avoid any potential claims of misleading investors. Thus, companies often go to extremes to explicitly describe worst case scenarios. Such language similar to the above quote can also be found nearly verbatim in numerous other S-1 filings.The document also raises questions about the true number of electric bicycles that the company has delivered since its founding.For example, SONDORS writes in the filing that they have “played a critical role in creating the e-bike category by developing, manufacturing and selling one of the first e-bikes at scale both domestically and internationally and have delivered over 51,000 units in 72 countries since 2015.”However, the company has repeatedly claimed much higher sales volume in marketing material and to the press, such as on this page of the company’s website that claims to have delivered more than 250,000 electric bikes and marketing from late last year that claimed, “We’ve put 200,000 SONDORS riders on the road!”Update: A SONDORS representative responded to a request for comment, explaining that SONDORS has had several corporate entities since the original crowdfunding campaign. The specific entity that is going public which is listed in the S-1 filing has sold over 50,000 units.A number of interesting operational and planning details were also revealed in the documents.The company stated that it currently has around 11,000 pre-orders for the Metacycle, and gave further insight to future vehicles that could follow the Metacycle.“We are currently designing an electric all terrain vehicle (ATV), an electric dirt bike, a larger version of the MetaCycle, MetaCycle-stylized e-bikes and other e-mobility products. These planned product offerings are in the design and prototyping phase at our California-based engineering facility and are being designed with a focus on our core tenets of industry leading style, exceptional performance and affordability.”Electric ATVs is a sorely underdeveloped market with few entries available. If SONDORS could bring a product to market and introduce it with the company’s signature low entry pricing, it could be a major boon for the market.Additional larger electric motorcycles like a scaled-up Metacycle or even electric bicycles and mopeds styled after the Metacycle could also be interesting additions to the market.First of all, there are many questions that have been raised here that SONDORS deserves the right to respond to. We reached out to the company for comment before publishing and will update if and when 8we receive a response. *The company responded, and the update regarding production numbers inserted into relevant section above.We wouldn’t have known any of these details had it not been for SONDORS submitting its S-1 form in anticipation of going public. But now that we do, there are many questions left unanswered. SONDORS has done an impressive job building a diverse range of e-bikes and becoming the first e-bike owned by many riders. The Metacycles that have already been delivered are also great rides — I recently tested one myself (and I’ll have the review finished and posted here on Electrek soon).But the questions regarding the company’s financial and operational health as well as potentially misleading marketing do worry me, both as a consumer and as someone who advocates for the electric bicycle industry as a whole. The undeniable potential of e-bikes and light electric vehicles to serve as clean, efficient, healthy, and fun alternative forms of transportation is critical to improving cities around the world. As a major player in that industry, I hope that SONDORS has the capacity to succeed, both in fulfilling its commitments and in positively contributing to the industry.",ebikes
2022/10/26,"Electric moped-maker NIU has spent the last few years expanding into a wider range of two-wheeled electric vehicles, including new e-bike and e-scooter models. Now the company is finally launching its highly anticipated BQi-C3 Pro electric bicycle.We’ve been following the BQi-C3 Pro for well over a year now as the design progressed through prototype to production.Well, today’s the day, folks! E-bike fans can finally order the novel-looking electric bike, which comes with a $1,999 sticker price.The Class 3 e-bike has a 750 watt peak-rated rear motor and two riding modes of throttle or pedal-assist (or a third if you count muscle power alone). The BQi-C3 Pro can hit speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h), and the dual batteries mean that it can actually maintain those speeds for more than a few miles.The pair of 460Wh batteries offer 920Wh of capacity and a combined range of 62 miles (100 km), which should be more than enough for most riders.A Gates Carbon Drive setup replaces a chain with a carbon fiber-reinforced belt to transfer pedal power to the rear wheel. That helps reduce maintenance and offers a smoother pedaling experience.The bike is outfitted with NIU’s signature halo headlight, which is the same style you’ll find on most of the company’s electric scooters and mopeds. It’s the same one I’ve got on my NIU NQi GTS scooter. There’s also a tail light and brake light mounted under the frame-integrated rear rack.At one point it looked like hydraulic disc brakes might be included on the NIU BQi-C3 Pro when it eventually reached the market, but now we’re seeing that the bike will come with mechanical disc brakes. Large 180 mm disc rotors help offer more stopping power though with their wider than typical diameters.The bike also comes with puncture-resistant tires that include a 1.5mm KEVLAR ARAMID fiber lining.Fenders are included standard to help keep riders dry, and the bike’s IP45 waterproof rating ensures that getting caught in the rain won’t leave you any worse off than some wet clothing. The motor has a higher waterproof rating at IP65, and the batteries are even more protected with an IP67 rating.A handlebar-mounted TFT color display offers battery and ride statistics, riding mode readout, trip time, distance travelled, and more.The NIU BQi-C3 Pro is a single-speed electric bike with a 50t front pulley and a 22t rear pulley. The gear ratio isn’t particularly high, so it will be interesting to see what it is like to pedal at higher speeds.The 27.5″ tires are 2.4″ wide, striking a balance between efficient urban riding while still maintaining enough air volume for a more comfortable ride than most electric road bikes.The 70.5 pound (32 kg) e-bike is rated for a maximum payload of 287 pounds (130 kg), with the rear rack alone rated for 66 pounds (30 kg) of load.The $1,999 NIU BQi-C3 Pro is currently available for pre-order with three colors available: White, Gray, and Black. Shipping to US customers is expected to begin in early November 2022.",ebikes
2022/10/25,"The Van Raam Balance may not look that different from afar, but upon closer inspection you’ll see a novel-looking frame that, among other features, helps the Netherlands-based company tout it as the safest two-wheeled electric bike in the world. The biggest difference between the Van Raam Balance’s frame and that of any other step-through bike is the depth that the frame plunges to and the steep seat angle allowed by the design.The idea is that not only can riders easily step through the bike to mount it with two feet flat on the ground, but they can still keep their feet flat on terra firma even while seated.Many riders with limited range of motion in their legs and hips find it difficult to swing their leg up and over a tall bike’s rear wheel. Others with balance issues can have trouble coming to stop while trying to tip-toe on one side of the bike.The Van Raam Balance tries to solve both problems at once with its unique frame design.As the company explained, the seating position also has other benefits:The great advantage of the Balance is the unique ergonomically designed seat. Wrists, shoulders and neck are hardly burdened while cycling. The more forward pedaling motion ensures that you use the power of your legs better than in case of conventional bikes. The lower centre of gravity makes the cycling easier and more comfortable. This bike is much safer than a normal low step through bike because you do not have to get on and off the saddle at a stop.The company recently released several new updates to the Balance, including widening and lowering the entrance through the frame, moving the wheel lock from the front wheel to the rear wheel, sturdier injection molded chain guard, and new colorways.There’s a non-powered version of the bike (or rather human-powered) that starts at €1,627 (approximately US $1,606). For the e-bike version though, you better not be on a pensioner’s budget. That model will cost you closer to €3,950 (approximately US $3,900).For that extra cash, you’ll get a front-mounted hub motor with a rear-mounted 490 Wh battery pack. With just a 25 km/h (15.5 mph) top speed and no throttle option (it’s pedal-assist only), the company claims an impressive average range of 82 km (51 miles).Whether electric-assist or not, all of the Van Raam Balance bikes include 24″ wheels, hydraulic rim brakes, adjustable handlebars, rear wheel lock, on-bike lighting, and a five-year warranty on the frame.With another popular step-through e-bike recently grabbing headlines for frame-snapping issues, that five-year warranty should offer some added peace of mind.As electric bikes grow in popularity among older riders and those returning to the joys of cycling they remember from years past, safer and more accessible bikes that offer riders more confidence could play a major role.It’s a bummer to see how expensive the e-bike version is (and the pedal bike version too, to be honest), but many electric tricycles cost just as much or more. I guess these niche bikes with smaller markets have to make their money somewhere.What do you think of the Van Raam Balance e-bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/10/23,"Last week we reported on Fiido’s latest e-bike frame recall, which saw yet another one of its models demonstrate a propensity to break in half after several months of riding. Now the company is stepping up with a redesign and a $10,000 promise to make Fiido T1 e-bike owners feel more secure about their rides.If this gives you déjà vu, you aren’t alone.Earlier this year we covered another one of Fiido’s e-bike models that broke in half, triggering a massive recall.Now the T1 is doing the same thing, but Fiido has again been quick to respond.Within a day of our original report, the company began addressing the problem in owner’s groups, quickly following up with an online tool to allow Fiido T1 e-bike owners to determine if their frame was on the list of affected models.The company explained that the issue was related to a design flaw in the downtube and immediately released design drawings and images showing a new reinforcement that had been added to the frame on Fiido T1 models currently in production (seen above).In addition to the exterior reinforcement, Fiido also explained that an interior reinforcement had been included inside the frame tube as well.To further appease owners, the company added a few other upgrades to the bike, including hydraulic disc brakes to replace the previous mechanical disc brakes.Fiido also released videos showing T1 frames undergoing accelerated cycle life testing in its frame lab, as you can see below. Both reinforced and unreinforced frames appear on various apparatuses. But the two most significant guarantees made to owners of the redesigned model are an extended five-year warranty and a $10,000 guarantee that future e-bikes will remain in one piece.As the company explained:1. All T1s (including those in stock and the replacements) will enjoy a 5-year warranty from Fiido for the frame from now on.2. We promise that if any of the new T1s suffers from a frame-breaking issue under normal use conditions, Fiido will compensate the customer with $10,000. No questions asked. We are confident in T1 and are sure that no one will have the need to claim this. But feel free to bet against us.Fiido is now sending out new T1 electric bikes to owners with affected frames, though without the battery and charger. Owners are being asked to save their original battery and charger to be used on the new replacement bike.According to emails from Fiido sent to T1 owners, the replacement e-bikes are expected to arrive in the US by November 7, 2022, and to begin reaching most customers by November 15, 2022. The company says that they expect to have all affected e-bikes replaced by the end of the year.This is obviously a disaster scenario for riders and the e-bike company, but I must say that Fiido seems to be handling it as well as anyone could have hoped.They’ve made it easy for owners to determine if their e-bikes are affected, they’ve redesigned the bike and plan to have replacements in owners’ hands less than a month after the problem was reported (including shipping from halfway around the world), and they’re putting their money where their mouths are by offering a $10,000 guarantee against future T1s breaking.I would have loved to see them include all of their future e-bikes in that $10,000 guarantee, though, as that would make them extra sure that any new e-bike gets sufficiently tested on the way out of the factory.But as far as crisis response goes, Fiido seems to have done quite well.",ebikes
2022/10/22,"One of the best parts of riding an electric bike for leisure or recreation is sharing that experience with others. But what if your friends don’t have their own electric bike to join you on rides along the beach or through the park? Well then you might need this awesome Chinese three-seater bike I found online, which is perfect for this week’s entry in the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week column.I know that tandem bikes often get a bad rap for being divorce makers, but I think that this one solves the problem. Yea, two people on one bike could be a recipe for disaster. But you know what the solution is? Add one more person!With three people, now we’re having a party. That’s one bike but endless possibilities!Take the kids to school and make them contribute to the pedaling effort! Pick up the buddies after the shift bells sounds and everyone hits the bar together! Invite the wife and her boyfriend out for a pleasant Sunday afternoon ride together! There are just so many options here, people! This awesome three-seater bike comes with a bunch of fun features, like that candy-striped sun shade with tassels, three water bottle holders, a sturdy extra-wide parking stand, and even suspension seats for a cushy tushy.Now my rather astute readers may have already noticed that despite this being a weekly wacky electric vehicle column, today’s three-seater bike is distinctly non-electric. That may be true, but we can easily fix it. All we need is to get a bit handy with an e-bike kit, which is something I’ve been known to do from time to time.We’ll just have to add a simple $280 e-bike motor kit, slap on a $220 e-bike battery, and then we’ll have ourselves a three-seater electric bike for just over a thousand bucks total!It may not be a very powerful e-bike with just a little 350W motor up front, but three dudes cranking on those pedals will more than make up for the diminutive e-bike motor.The only thing that worries me is that no amount of extra riders will fix a few fundamental issues I see with this bike.For one, we’ve got weak little rim brakes on a bike that is supposedly built for three adult riders. Then we’ve got what appears to be a two-post canopy, which would put that support directly in the middle rider’s face. And there’s the water bottle placement that seems to leave the poor front rider thirsty and the last bottle on the back of the bike out anyone’s reach.Then there’s the whole issue with two people have no discernible control and being at the whim of whatever hooligan happens to be up front piloting this thing at the moment.Ok, so maybe a three-seater electric bike isn’t the brightest of ideas. But you have to admit, it does look pretty cool. It might not make it into my own electric bike collection any time soon, but I’d love to see one of these in action one day!",ebikes
2022/10/21,"The Lectric XPremium mid-drive folding e-bike still holds the honor of the highest-value mid-drive electric bike on the market today. With a powerful mid-drive motor, dual batteries, and other impressive features, it’s going to be hard for any other e-bike to compete in this space and at this price point for a long time.We’ve occasionally seen slightly more affordable mid-drive e-bikes on the market, but usually with low-power motors and low-end components.The Lectric XPremium, on the other hand, shovels in the value with more power, more range, better parts, and an overall better experience.It’s a heavy bike at 75 pounds, which is one of its only downsides. But it has so many other redeeming qualities that I’ve found I can look right past the weight, especially since I don’t really need to lift it up stairs or onto a car rack.To see my real-world testing of the Lectric XPremium e-bike, check out my review video below. Or if you’re more of the reading type, continue reading for my full written review. Or heck, try ’em both. I won’t tell anyone.Here’s the thing: You get so much value with this e-bike, from extra components to pre-installed accessories, that I still don’t know how they get away with charging a price similar to run-of-the-mill e-bikes from other companies.Let’s start with the motor. Mid-drives are expensive and they are rarely found on e-bikes under $2,500 or so. You usually have to approach $3,000 before you start seeing them as standard.But the Lectric XPremium comes with an 800W peak-rated mid-drive that gives you all the benefits of mid-mounted motors. That means you get to enjoy power delivery through your bike gears for more efficient riding on hills and varied terrain, better weight balance in the center of the bike, and more responsive pedal assist with the included torque sensor.Next, you get hydraulic disc brakes. They’re only 160mm rotors, and I would have liked to have seen 180mm rotors on an e-bike that can hit 28 mph (45 km/h) at full speed, but the brakes work just fine as-is and I don’t see any issue there. The hydraulic nature of the brakes also means you won’t have to spend time tuning a finicky mechanical cable every few weeks like on cheaper disc brakes.The Lectric XPremium features front suspension with 80mm of travel in a hydraulic fork (and if you really want extra comfort, I recommend adding the Comfort Package with its suspension seat post and cushier saddle).There’s a 7-speed transmission with a shift sensor that helps you avoid jamming up your gears by accidentally shifting under load. It cuts power for a brief second while shifting, though ideally you’d already be doing that yourself. Just like you wouldn’t shift gears in a manual transmission car while holding down the gas pedal, you shouldn’t do it on a bicycle either.For long-range riding, the bike comes with not one but TWO batteries. Both are lockable and removable, and each has 500Wh of capacity. Together, that’s a kilowatt-hour of lithium underneath you. Lectric eBikes has performed real-world range testing with the values shown below. They say you’ll get between 50-100 miles (80-160 km) depending on how you ride. If you’re sticking to a reasonable average of 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle-only operation — which is how many people will use the bike — you could get around 50 miles of range. But if you’re willing to put in some effort and pedal along, you could bump that range up to 100 miles.Not too shabby!And we’re not even finished with all the nice add-ons you get in the Lectric XPremium. There’s an included rear rack for carrying extra gear with you, though may want to consider the cargo package if you’ve got a lot of stuff to carry on a regular basis. That will add a front and rear basket to turn the bike into something of a cargo e-bike.There’s included front and rear LED lighting. You get built-in metal fenders instead of cheap plastic fenders. The bars are 25″ wide to give you better control and leave more room for adding accessories like phone holders, speakers, bags, and more.And of course the entire bike folds up to fit in the back of a car, to stow on a boat, or to slip in anywhere that space is limited.As usual, I still have a few complaints, even if the Lectric XPremium is largely a winner.First of all, the 75 lb. (34 kg) e-bike is heavy. If you’re regularly carrying it up stairs as part of your daily commute, it’s going to get old quickly. Definitely look for an elevator if possible.If you have back problems then you might not want to be regularly lifting it onto a car’s bike rack or into a truck bed. Consider a ramp.But if you’re like me and your bike wheels stay on the ground nearly all the time, then you likely won’t notice the added weight.Next, I found the basic Shimano Tourney derailleur to be adequate, though it arrived with a bit of tuning necessary due to it tending to skip between the middle gears while riding. A few seconds of fiddling with the barrel adjustment had it working better, and it was a tool-free job. But if you don’t know how to adjust your derailleur, then $20 would be well spent at your local bike shop having a professional do it. As it stands, derailleur adjustments are just something you have to do from time to time, but generally e-bikes should arrive perfectly tuned from the factory unless a bit of jarring around in the shipping box knocked things slightly out of whack.The only other thing that I wasn’t a huge fan of were the 4″ tires. Sure, they can be fun when you’re off-roading, but after the Lectric XP 2.0 switched from 4″ fat tires to 3″ diet-fat tires, I found the smaller size was a great compromise. They still offered enough air volume and surface contact to get the fat tire experience, but weren’t as heavy or bulky as larger 4-inch-wide tires.At the bike’s reasonable price of $1,899 though, I can’t really complain about much here. You can find hub motor e-bikes with a fraction of this battery capacity and cheap mechanical brakes for more than this. So the fact that the Lectric XPremium comes with a mid-drive motor as well as dual batteries and so many included features for under $2K still blows my mind.If you’re on the lookout for a folding e-bike that has a quality mid-drive, tons of range, and enough power and torque to climb your local hills with ease, then the Lectric XPremium is a no-brainer.",ebikes
2022/10/19,"Last month we covered the unveiling of a new Ukrainian light electric motorbike known as the Delfast California. Now the bike has officially launched for pre-order.Calling an e-bike “California” might seem like a strange move for a Ukrainian-based company like Delfast, but it comes with an interesting origin story.One of Delfast’s designers was touring the company’s new California headquarters earlier this year when Russia began its brutal invasion of Ukraine’s territory. Unable to immediately return home, the designer was stuck on the US West Coast with nothing to do but observe the local micromobility culture. He immediately began drawing up a new electric moped that relied on influence from the local two-wheeler scene. He then worked with dozens of his colleagues back in Ukraine to quickly develop the company’s newest model, the Delfast California.The full-suspension electric bike comes in two versions. There’s a higher-power model for US customers that features Bafang’s heavy-duty M620 Ultra mid-drive motor. That drivetrain puts out a claimed 750W, though the motor is widely known to peak at much higher power levels than the 750W figure seen on the spec sheet.For European customers, there’s a detuned model with a Bafang M410 motor that comes with a paltry 250W rating, though similarly to the powerful M620 motor, the true output is likely a bit higher.The US version can reach speeds as high as 28 mph (45 km/h), while the European version is limited to EU-regulated speeds of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). The two motors are quite torquey, with the US version outputting 160Nm of torque and the EU version still posting a respectable 80Nm of torque.Both bikes come with tri-spoke mag wheels and a 48V 20Ah removable li-ion battery that offers 960Wh of capacity.Checking the spec sheet shows a claimed 100-mile (160 km) range on the US version and a 200 km (121 mile) range on the EU version, though those figures are perhaps a bit optimistic. Delfast says that the 100-mile range comes at a pedal assist speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), but that still sounds like the rider is putting in some serious effort on their own to reach such dramatic ranges. Most e-bikes with batteries of this size claim ranges of just over half this much on pedal assist.When it comes to pedaling, the 66 pound (30 kg) e-bike isn’t exactly the lightest two-wheeler on the road, though it’s a good bit slimmer than Delfast’s larger and more powerful e-bikes.Delfast has launched the new e-bike on Indiegogo, offering an early-bird promotional price of just $1,999 despite a higher MSRP of $3,999. Deliveries are estimated to begin in July of next year.We always advise caution on crowdfunding campaigns since buyers are actually “backers,” and aren’t exactly buying a product as much as they are contributing funding for a product to be produced. The end result is usually that the backers receive the product they “backed,” but some crowdfunding campaigns have left backers high and dry in the past.In this case, Delfast has been in operation for years and has delivered thousands of e-bikes to everyone from private customers to police departments and even the Ukrainian military.What do you think of the Delfast California electric moped? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/10/17,"It’s been a tough six months for Fiido, a Hong Kong-based electric bicycle company whose e-bikes have proven popular in the US as well as other markets. The company’s futuristic-looking Fiido X electric bike was recalled in April after Electrek received reports that the highly engineered frame had a tendency to break in half. Now it looks like another model known as the T1 is suffering a similar fate.The Fiido X’s undoing was the result of a magnesium frame that was highly engineered with a sleek and minimalist design. Unfortunately, that design proved to be a bit too minimalist near the folding mechanism, causing the bikes to eventually crack in half due to repeated stress-induced micro-fractures of the frame.Electrek has now reviewed multiple reports that another Fiido model, the Fiido T1, has also suffered cracks or complete breakage.The images below were provided by a Fiido T1 owner who explained that the bike simply snapped in half while he was riding at around 8 mph (13 km/h) on a flat road. He added that he was not a heavy rider, that he had never taken it off-road, and that the bike had never been in a crash.The pictures show that the aluminum frame appears to have cracked several inches above the lower reinforcing tube in the step-through section of the bike.The rider was uninjured, explaining that the bike essentially crumbled beneath him and he just ran it out, remaining on his feet. But he added that if it had happened on his next ride, he would have had a child on the back.Another Fiido T1 owner provided an image of his bike with what appears to be a large crack that formed a few inches lower on the same frame tube. The rider says he hasn’t ridden the bike in a month due to an unrelated issue with the bike, but recently discovered the crack and worries that it could have grown or even led to a complete failure of the frame if he had been riding over the last month.The Fiido T1’s step-through frame isn’t outwardly unique, and uses a similar design to many other step-through utility bikes. However, small differences in aluminum alloy composition, tube wall thickness, welding quality, tube length, joint angle, and other frame geometry variations can have vastly different impacts on the ruggedness of the resulting frame.The 36.2 kg (80 pound) Fiido T1 comes with a 200 kg (440 pound) load rating, divided to 120 kg (265 pounds) on the saddle and 80 kg (176 pounds) on the rear rack.The bike can hit speeds of up to 45 km/h (28 mph) and carries a one-year frame warranty.Electrek has reached out to Fiido for comment, but has not yet heard back. [Update]: A Fiido representative responded to my request for comment shortly after this article was published:“Since the recall of the Fiido X, we have conducted inspections on every single one of our products and have discovered that a certain type of welding defect could be found in a small number of our T1s caused by an error in our production process. We started working on an upgraded design when we discovered the problem, with the goal that the design is immune to any mishandling during production. The new design has already been put into production, and we will replace every single product within that batch. The first shipment of the replacements is already on the way and will arrive 20 days later at our U.S warehouse. We expect to have finished the replacements for all the users affected by the end of November.”When the Fiido X’s frame defect was first discovered, the company quickly issued a recall and followed up with a resolution plan that included offering owners either another model of e-bike, or an updated version of the Fiido X that would include a re-engineered frame.The company recently began shipping that updated version, which also includes other updates such as a 7-speed Shimano shifter, upgraded handlebar display, more comfortable saddle and handlebar, and of course a beefier folding mechanism that (hopefully) won’t break in half.A Fiido representative recently explained to Electrek that the company tested the new design extensively, applying 20% more load to it than what is specified by the EN15194 testing standard and raising the number of test cycles to double the amount specified by the testing standard.The company also shared detailed images showing the upgrades to the frame.",ebikes
2022/10/14,"Trek has just unveiled its lightest electric bike to date, the Trek Domane+ SLR. The stealthy e-bike is designed to slot right in alongside non-electric bikes without sticking out.Weighing in at a mere 11.75 kg (25.9 pounds), the Trek Domane+ SLR is the company’s lightest electric road bike to date.It follows the company’s growing line of ultra-lightweight electric bikes, such as the Trek e-Caliber electric mountain bikes.The Domane+ SLR’s lightweight design was made possible thanks to a combination of an ultra-lightweight carbon frame, a minimalist electric motor, and a small battery pack, among other gram-saving design choices.The Domane+ SLR is the first Trek bike to take advantage of the company’s highest-level 800 series carbon frame, previously only used on the manufacturer’s pedal bikes. That frame is said to have saved 700g compared to the frame used on Trek’s previous Domane+ e-bike, or around 6% of the bike’s overall mass.The bike employs the TQ-HPR50 e-bike drive system, a lesser known but sophisticated e-bike drive powertrain developed by the German TQ Group. It puts out 50 Nm of torque, which isn’t exactly gear melting but should be sufficient for the type of electric gentle assist riding that most road bikers are seeking.The motor is capable of speeds of up to 45 km/h (28 mph) when integrated into e-bikes destined for the US market, and it appears the Trek will allow the Domane+ SLR to take advantage of that higher speed in the US. In Europe, the bike will still be limited to 25 km/h (15.5 mph) to comply with local regulations.The bike will sport a 360Wh battery, which the company says should be sufficient for 100 km (62 miles) of assisted riding. That range may be possible in the lowest power mode, but riders taking advantage of the higher end of the bike’s 300W output will likely achieve lower range figures per charge. The bike’s three power modes can be selected using shifter buttons on the bar hoods, allowing riders to keep their hands in place while adjusting the motor’s assistance level.Trek also offers a 160 Wh range extender battery that fits in the water bottle cage and can add nearly 50% more battery capacity to the bike. That auxiliary battery option, which costs an extra $599, could prove popular for riders who enjoy bikepacking or simply want to push harder and farther on their fitness rides.While the Domane+ SLR is designed as a road e-bike, its allowance for tires up to 40mm wide could offer decent utility as a gravel e-bike as well. We’ve seen that with other top-end electric road bikes like the Specialized Turbo Creo SL, which has been known to serve double duty as an electric road bike and gravel e-bike, depending on the loadout.The bike’s integrated battery and hidden bottom bracket motor make the bike largely indistinguishable from many pedal bikes, at least at a quick glance.One of the few giveaways of the bike’s electric nature is the digital display built into the upper surface of the top tube, which helps keep the handlebars free of digital clutter.The Trek Domane+ SLR starts at US $8,999 (£8,890, €9,599) with a Shimano transmission, though the price increases to US $12,999 (£12,900, €14,499) for the higher-end version with a SRAM Red eTap transmission.",ebikes
2022/10/12,"Earlier this year, we first reported on the Specialized Globe line of electric bicycles, which the company announced would see the high-end bicycle manufacturer launch a new series of more affordable electric utility bikes. Now, we’re getting our first look at the premier model known as the Globe Haul ST.Specialized’s Globe Haul ST was teased earlier this year with a heavily obscured photo showing the e-bike carrying a pile of cactuses. At the time we could tell that it would be a step-through utility e-bike, but that was about it. Now we’re getting two new photos that finally show off the bike without teaser cactuses covering all of the best parts.Check out the first image below to see the first glimpse of the upcoming Globe Haul ST.As the company explained as part of the new photo release:In 2022, Globe introduced a series of super fun high performance everyday bicycle models with enough power, range and modularity to enable riders to finally leave that car dependency behind. Although the Haul ST looks small, it’s been known for its huge personality.While we are finally getting our first look at the new bike, the company hasn’t exactly been generous with the tech specs.We know it will have an aluminum frame and a rigid steel fork, but that’s about it for the hard details.From the pictures, we can glean a few more nuggets of information. There’s obviously a rear hub motor, but we don’t know the power rating. There’s a decent chance it will be one of these “250W” situations where those quotes do some heavy-lifting to imply that the bike will be legal in 250W-limited countries, while actually offering higher power that North American customers are more familiar with.We can see that the Globe Haul ST carries a fairly large battery, a set of fenders with built-in lighting, a telescoping seat tube for a wide range of rider heights, a step-through frame for easier mounting (especially when you have large cargo or kiddos on the rear rack), and of course that cargo-ready rear rack.It’s not clear if there’s a throttle or not, but an extra wire terminating on the right handlebar could indicate an included throttle – or it could just be a remote with buttons controlling additional functions.The large tires feature a hybrid street/trail tread with a slick patch in the center and knobbies on the edges for cornering in looser terrain.A seven or eight-speed transmission offers a range of gears, and hydraulic disc brakes should provide plenty of stopping power for a loaded-down utility e-bike.The last major piece of information we’re missing is the price. Many of Specialized’s electric bikes start at nearly $4,000, and the prices increase significantly from there. The Globe Haul ST should be cheaper, likely in the low to mid $2,000 range or even upper $1,000 range, if we’re lucky.We’ll have to wait for more information before judging the value of the e-bike, but it is clear that Specialized is hoping to horn in on some that sweet RadRunner-type action in the value-priced electric bike market.What do you think of the Specialized Haul ST? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below.",ebikes
2022/10/06,"Rad Power Bikes, the largest electric bicycle company in the US, is currently running a major sale with some of the best prices it has ever offered on many of its popular e-bike models.We’ve seen some impressive sales from the company in the past, but this recently launched promotion seems to top any previously published sales on record.The most affordable model for sale is the RadMission, a single-speed urban e-bike designed for city riders.The RadMission normally carries a $1,199 price tag, but it is currently on sale for just $499. That’s a whopping $700 off!The bike offers a 500W motor, has a 500Wh battery with around 20-40 miles of range on throttle or pedal assist, and hits a top speed of 20 mph.It’s a no-frills bike because of its lack of a shifter, suspension, and even a kickstand. But it has everything else most urban riders need, including decent power, good city tires, built-in LED lights, and a choice of several colors across two frame styles.Despite being the “simplest” e-bike in Rad’s lineup, it’s one of my favorites. Check out my review to see why.For urban riders who want to add a bit more to their bikes than the RadMission offers, the RadCity 3 Step-Thru and RadCity 4 Step-Over e-bikes are both marked down from $1,599 to $1,399. Both these models hit the same 20 mph top speed as the RadMission but add in suspension, gears, fenders, a rear rack, and an LCD screen, giving riders more features as standard equipment.These are the last bikes in Rad’s lineup to offer the larger direct drive motors, as the company has switched all of its other models to geared motors.If the RadMission sale wasn’t so good, I might say this was the headliner event. And it may still be. The RadRover 6 Plus is normally priced at $1,999 but is marked down to $1,299 during the sale.That makes this 750W fat tire electric bike with dual displays, hydraulic disc brakes, front suspension, and 7-speed gearing one of the best-priced fat tire e-bikes in existence right now.When you add in the included semi-integrated battery, fenders, lighting, and more, this is one heck of a sweet deal.Buried somewhere in this super sale saga is a burning question, “What’s going on at Rad?”No company does things purely altruistically, even as much as Rad is pursuing its goal of replacing more cars with e-bikes. So where’s the rub? How is the money talking?My two best guesses are that we’re either looking at an overstock issue — perhaps as a result of heavy purchasing during the springtime parts uncertainties — or that some new models are coming and Rad is moving out the old stock.The RadCity 3 and RadCity 4 are already fairly old, so those make sense. The RadMission is over two years old now too, so that one could stand a refresher. The RadRover 6 Plus bikes aren’t really that old, though, so those really surprise me. What’s the reason for such a generous sale? Could they be that overstocked, or is there something else going on?",ebikes
2022/10/05,"Micromobility America returned to the San Francisco Bay Area earlier this month to showcase the latest micromobility products, highlight new releases, offer test rides, hear from insightful company leaders and politicians, and basically nerd out about electric mobility. From new e-bikes and e-scooters to innovative electric roller skates and even electric micro-cars, there was a bit of everything under the sun.And with a combination of company meet and greets, test rides, and speakers, the event had a wide range of engaging activities for anyone interested in the latest forms of micromobility and the policies that surround those devices and companies.The event included some of the most interesting, innovative, and eye-catching mobility products out there, and I was on-site to take it all in over two days. Here’s a collection of some of the coolest stuff I saw, listed in alphabetical order to avoid choosing favorites. (That’d be like asking who your favorite child is!)The team from Apollo was on site to show off their latest innovative electric scooters, including their newest models of the Apollo City and the Apollo Pro. Both of these scooters employ more of a ground-up design than we’ve seen from most electric scooter companies.Instead of throwing together a bunch of à la carte parts, Apollo designs its scooters itself, ensuring they not only have the most unique e-scooters out there but that they also address the ever-growing mass of community feedback they receive from their tens of thousands of electric scooter customers.I made sure to take a spin on the Apollo City Pro, having previously reviewed the slightly lower spec Apollo City. Both are fast and comfortable e-scooters that employ the company’s variable regenerative braking, meaning you can basically forgo touching the mechanical brakes entirely, instead relying on the motor’s regenerative braking to slow and stop the scooter. The Apollo Pro’s fancy features like wireless phone charging and surround lighting make it a standout in the industry — even before you consider the 43 mph (70 km/h) top speed!I’ve seen a lot of different types of micromobility products but never anything quite like this. While still a prototype, the Airglide electric cargo scooter was on site to show off what could be possible with a seated cargo e-scooter. In addition to offering plenty of space for cargo in the front bucket, the patent-pending scooter is designed with a saddle for comfortable seated riding and even collapses down into a cart that can be wheeled around through a grocery store to do your shopping.Don’t expect to find this one in stores this year, but the future could see big things for a small-yet-mighty folding e-scooter like this.Vespa vibes without the Vespa price! The Aventura X electric scooter has all of the old-timey charms of a classic Piaggio-style scooter, yet with a $3,300 price tag that is around half the cost of a Vespa Elettrica electric scooter.I had the chance to test ride one, which you can see in my video from the event above.The scooter isn’t the fastest out there, maxing out at just 30 mph (48 km/h). But it’s a fun, smooth, and easy-to-manage ride that will have you enjoying the slower pace of life.It’s just so much fun that you’re not thinking “I wish this thing went faster.” Instead, you’re mostly wishing you had a beautiful girl on back en route to a picnic in the Italian countryside.I’m not sure it will rival a CSC Monterey, but it gets close.Bo’s electric scooter looks like the designers threw out the conventional Chinese electric scooter that everyone seems to build these days and, instead, drew up their own idea of how e-scooters should be built.The head tube is basically as tall as the stem, giving them a much wider spacing between steering bearings and resulting in a much stiffer and safer-feeling scooter.The body panels give it a sleeker appearance too, making it look as good as it feels.Big props to the designers on this one!I had a blast meeting the team behind Boaz Bikes, and it was quite obvious that their passion for their product and service really shines through.The takeaway message that they kept coming back to was safety. They operate as a rental service, but they also sell their micromobility vehicles to people that enjoy the unique form factor and want to own instead of rent.Despite the name, these “bikes” are actually scooters. They have a low seating position that allows riders to feel stable, with a low center of gravity, and easily put both feet on the ground if they need to quickly regain their balance. With suspension, baskets, lights, fenders, and disc brakes, the little scooters have basically everything a rider needs in a small utility scooter. Plus, the max speed of 30 mph on the private version makes these a fast urban vehicle that can easily replace a car.I didn’t get a chance to hop on one of these at the show, and now I regret it. They look so awesome – I really need to try one out. Maybe I’ll get lucky after they read this, and they’ll want me to do a review on it in Florida. Fingers crossed!The Eli electric micro isn’t a car at all, but rather is listed as a quadricycle where it is already sold in Europe. That puts it in a class of vehicles that fall somewhere between motorcycles and cars, enjoying the more lax regulatory environment of the former and the enclosed weather protection of the latter.In the case of the Eli, it drives around at a max speed of around 25 mph (40 km/h) and offers a carlike interior, complete with a micro-trunk in the back for a couple of backpacks or other small cargo.The Eli was definitely one of the largest electric vehicles at Micromobility America, but it was still quite small compared to real cars.Interestingly, the glass doors give it a larger interior feeling than it deserves, making the cramped interior feel much roomier.I had the chance to give one of the first Eli vehicles a quick test drive last year in Milan, which you can see in my brief video below.These Escend Blades are absolutely wild and push the lower end of the micromobility size spectrum even further.The concept is simple. They’re like roller skates – but electric. That’s it. Small, light, effective. They use electric skateboard parts, including an e-skate controller to wirelessly communicate with the skates. That gives riders a thumb-controlled throttle and brake dial in their hand, without requiring a tether or wired connection.It seems like there are dedicated boot versions and also naked skate platforms like those old-school roller skates that strapped onto kids’ shoes from the 1950s. Faction was at Micromobility America with its driverless Arcimoto designed as an autonomous delivery vehicle.It’s pretty trippy to look inside and realize that both seats have been replaced by a giant, open area for cargo and goods.The Arcimoto FUV platform is already quite striking, but a robotic version is straight-up SciFi if you ask me.More “normal” Arcimoto FUVs were also at the show, including one that the company let me borrow for a couple of days to use as my wheels while I was in San Francisco. Flying over the bridges at 80+ mph and getting looks from drivers around me was definitely a highlight of the trip, but I’ll have more on my few days of driving an Arcimoto FUV soon.Portuguese electric skateboard startup Hunter Boards showed off its latest highly-engineered electric skateboard at Micromobility America.The board uses what appears to be a modified double wishbone suspension system that is more at home on large four-wheeled vehicles than skateboards.It looks like a mechanical engineering student’s dream and gives the boards a futuristic yet still mechanical vibe.Combined with the high performance and removable batteries, the design helps make these Hunter electric skateboards memorable in the industry.The JackRabbit brings a smile to my face every time I see one.Referred to as a micro-bike, these are technically seated electric scooters due to the lack of pedals.They may look funny with that short wheelbase, but they have pretty good performance.They get up to 20 mph and have ranges of over 10 miles, despite their tiny batteries, meaning they’re great for short city commutes when riders want the stability of a bike but the size and lightweight design of a scooter.I had the distinct pleasure of reviewing one of these earlier this year, where I learned just how much fun this micromobility device can be.You can check it out in my video review below. Trust me, you’re going to want to see me ride this thing. It’s not a circus bear on a tricycle situation, but it’s not the farthest thing in the world from that either.This is another one of those “What is it?” type of micro-EVs. The Nimbus One falls somewhere in the Velo-bike/micro-car/leaning e-trike trifecta. It’s another example of a vehicle that pushes the limits of what we consider to be micromobility.The enclosed design makes it great for inclement weather that would cause many people to leave their bikes in the garage. But the narrow size and leaning design mean it operates more like a bike than a car, which should appeal to car-shunning cyclists.And of course, the electric drive makes it easy and, more importantly, environmentally sustainable, which everyone should appreciate.I can’t say for sure what it’s actually like to pilot. But I can agree that it’s fun to look at!These guys say they’re the third largest battery suppliers in the micromobility business.Frankly, based on the list of e-bike companies they rattled off as their customers, I’m surprised they aren’t in the first or second spot.They were on-site to show off their wide range of batteries for electric bikes, scooters, and other micromobility devices.It seems they make just about every type of battery under the sun. And bonus points, they’re fans of my videos! From now on I’m going to tell people, “Yeah, well you may not have heard of me, but I’m big in China!”Tons of companies offer shared electric scooters or e-bikes. Lime and Bird at the big ones for many people, but dozens of other companies compete in the space.No one has a two-seater e-bike quite like Veo though, who just rolled out the Veo Apollo in a debut at Micromobility America.The Class 2 e-bike has a 750W motor in the rear wheel and gets up to a top speed of 20 mph.It makes it easy to avoid calling for an Uber or Lyft – instead, take a friend with you on the back of a shared micromobility device. Right on!Sorry, WAU, you guys really screwed yourself when it comes to alphabetical order, getting left near the end of this post. That’s a shame because your bikes deserve to be at the top of so many lists.Between the slick-looking battery case (with a 100-mile range battery!) and the neat frame-mounted rear lights, these are some awesome e-bikes that I really want to test out.Those taillights even do double duty as turn signals and brake lights, and they are actually large and wide enough to serve those roles well, unlike many tiny gimmicky turn signals we’re starting to see on other e-bikes.Last but definitely not least on the list is Weel, an innovative e-bike that offers something akin to Tesla Autopilot, but for e-bikes. It’s designed to help riders who lack the skills or confidence to safely ride a bike and uses a steering tube motor to help adjust the steering for riders and keep the bike stable. Computer vision helps riders stay on course by tracking the edges of bike lanes and avoiding obstacles.The bike is also designed to remove as many traditional hardware components from the bike as possible. For example, instead of a typical moving brake lever, the Weel bike’s brake lever is fixed and uses a strain gauge to measure how hard it is pulled.It’s a wild and completely novel design. Time will tell whether or not the bike will be commercially viable when it eventually hits the market.Make sure you check out my video of the event, embedded below. There, you’ll see all of these companies up close, plus even more!And if you live across the pond, keep your calendar marked for June 8-9, 2023, when Micromobility Europe returns to Amsterdam!",ebikes
2022/10/04,"As if we needed any more evidence proving how tech-integrated the latest generation of e-bikes are, look no further than the OKAI EB50. The company has just released an over-the-air (OTA) update that lets users significantly increase the top speed limit of the bike.Originally launched earlier this summer as the OKAI Ranger, the 1,000W fat tire OKAI EB50 electric bike arrived with a rather mundane top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h).That kept the bike legally designated as a Class 2 e-bike in the US, meaning it had a throttle-operated top speed of no more than 20 mph, and could masquerade its 1,000W motor as a 750W continuous-rated motor to comply with the Class 2 e-bike limits.But a recently released update to the OKAI smartphone app that pairs with the bike has given owners more than just a fancy new skin or rounder icons. This time the update came with serious performance increases.The app provides the option to unlock the top speed to a higher 28 mph (45 km/h). Interestingly though, OKAI itself has confirmed that users are actually seeing speeds as high as 31 mph (50 km/h) with a fully charged battery. Unlike many larger electric vehicles that regulate their voltage for smoother performance, most e-bikes power their motor controllers and thus motors directly from their pack voltage. That means higher motor RPMs are available at higher states of charge, with an e-bike’s top speed then slowly tapering down as the battery discharges.The new update also appears to unlock that new high speed on throttle-only operation, meaning that riders don’t need to pedal as well to engage speeds above 20 mph. Generally speaking, Class 3 e-bikes require pedal assist to engage motor power between 20-28 mph. An e-bike that can hit the Class 3 top speed limit of 28 mph but on throttle-only isn’t technically considered Class 3 eligible anymore.This could have regulatory implications that see the $1,999 OKAI EB50 e-bike falling outside of the three designated e-bike classes that are adopted in much of the US. In practice, most police departments don’t yet understand the nuance of e-bike classes and thus aren’t out there patrolling for e-bikes that look like they’re going slightly over 20 mph without pedaling.Even so, slipping outside of designated e-bike regulations is a dangerous game to play, as it could subject such e-bikes to motor vehicles laws that the three class e-bike system is designed to exempt them from.The OKAI EB50 electric bike’s extensive app — complete with OTA updates to adjust the bike’s performance — isn’t the only tech-centric feature on the bike. The EB50 also comes with an NFC-enabled key card to give riders a secure way to lock and unlock the e-bike, though the app can also be used to unlock the e-bike over Bluetooth to avoid carrying a key card.Many e-bike companies are doubling down on feature-rich apps and other tech-focused features as a way to differentiate their products from competitors. This is especially true of companies that rely largely on OEM components that are found on dozens of other e-bike models. Hardware innovations are often much more expensive and labor intensive to innovate, but software innovations may only require a few computer science interns and bargain basement wages.Could OKAI’s move be a sign of what’s to come in the industry? Will there be more common performance unlocks available as simple and easy downloads? Or will e-bike companies go the way of Zero Motorcycles and offer upgrades as downloadable content to be purchased in the future? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/10/03,"Yamaha Power Assist Electric Bicycles, the e-bike division of Yamaha, has unveiled two full-suspension electric bikes in the YDX-MORO line.Two years ago, Yamaha wowed the eMTB industry with the Yamaha YDX-MORO line of electric mountain bikes.The new models featured the company’s proprietary and eye-catching dual-twin frame that included a split frame setup on both the top tube and the down tube and the latest mid-drive motor at the time, the Yamaha PW-X2.Now that the e-bike maker has a newer PW-X3 top-of-the-line e-bike motor, it’s only fitting that it should work its way into the high-end YDX-MORO eMTB range.And thus, the new YDX-MORO 05 and YDX-MORO 07 models were born.As the company explained:The new YDX-MORO 07 and YDX-MORO 05 models bring impressive range efficiency, higher torque, more advanced component technology, and the smoothest assist delivery ever felt on a power assist bicycle in a lighter and more powerful complete package.The PW-X3 motor is said to offer a major performance boost to the new e-bikes with its updated specs. The mid-drive motor has a maximum torque of 85 Nm and comes with a continuous power rating of 250W. However, the company says it is actually capable of putting out 500W of peak power in its highest power operation mode.Those ride modes include Eco, Standard, High, MTB, Extra-Power, and Automatic-Mode, as well as a Walk-Assist mode. Yamaha’s Automatic Mode lets the bike intelligently select the power mode based on the rider’s climbing, descending or braking behavior, thus allowing the rider to focus entirely on the trail.The YDX-MORO 05 and YDX-MORO 07 both offer assist up to 20 mph (32 km/h), maintaining Class 1 e-bike designation in the US and thus ensuring access to as many trails as possible.Yamaha’s quad-sensor technology claims the most intuitive pedal assist feedback and allows for immediate torque delivery from the instant that force is applied to the pedal.Yamaha power assist bicycles’ sales and marketing manager Drew Engelmann discussed the motor’s upgrades even further:The PW-X3 drive unit is 10% lighter and 20% smaller, while producing more torque and the most ‘Pure Ride’ feeling of any e-MTB on the market. Yamaha’s passion for performance is driven by our racing heritage, and the YDX-MORO 07 and YDX-MORO 05 are true thoroughbreds for the next generation of e-MTB riders.Both new models come with Yamaha’s 3-year warranty and share many similar mountain-ready components such as Maxxis tires in 27.5×2.6 tubeless Minion DHF (front) and REKON (rear), as well as TranzX 30.9mm dropper seat posts for saddle height adjustments on the fly.The YDX-MORO 05 is priced at $5,799.99 and will include Magura MT30 hydraulic disc brakes on 203 mm rotors, Shimano DEORE SL-M6100-R shifter, Shimano DEORE RD-M6100-SGS rear derailleur, Shimano SLX CS-M7100-12 12-speed (10-51T) cassette, RockShox Revelation RC front fork with 160mm of travel and a RockShox Deluxe Select+ rear shock with 150mm of travel. The bike is expected to become available early next year.The YDX-MORO 07 is priced at $6,399.99 and will include Magura MT5 hydraulic disc brakes on 203 mm rotors, Shimano XT SL-M8100-R shifter, Shimano XT RD-M8100-SGS rear derailleur, Shimano XT CS-M8100-12 12-speed (10-51T) cassette, RockShox Super Deluxe Select+ rear shock with 150mm of travel, and a RockShox Lyrik Select front fork with 160mm of travel.Rob Trester, Manager of Yamaha’s Smart Power Vehicle Division and the Yamaha Power Assist Bicycle group in the US discussed how Yamaha’s long history in e-bike development has culminated in its new top of the line rides:As the company that created the world’s first electrically power assisted bicycle nearly 30 years ago, Yamaha is recognized as one of the world’s leading innovators in e-bike technology. We’re doubling down on the growing e-MTB market with the new MORO 07 and MORO 05 and offer our ‘Pure Ride’ feeling and race proven innovation to even more e-MTB riders.",ebikes
2022/09/28,"If the name “Delfast” rings a bell for you, it’s probably for the company’s larger electric bikes that are essentially electric motorcycles with pedals. But now the company has unveiled a smaller electric moped known as the Delfast California that should offer slightly more modest speeds and power ratings.Unlike the Delfast Top 3.0, which is a favorite among police departments, Ukrainian soldiers, and really anyone who wants a high-power e-bike and doesn’t really care about legal ramifications, the Delfast California is designed to be street legal from the get-go.In the US, it slots into Class 3 electric bicycle designation. That allows it to have a 750W rated motor and a max speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).But in the case of the Delfast California, the Ukraine-based company is sticking to its guns by running as closely up to those legal limits as possible.For example, the mid-drive motor used on the bike may be called a “750W nominal” motor, but it’s actually a high-powered Bafang M620 motor that puts out at least 1,000W of peak power. It also features 160Nm of torque. If you’re not up on your torque conversions, that basically means it could climb a tree if the tires were sticky enough.The company has paired that powerful motor with a 48V and 20Ah removable li-ion battery that offers 960Wh of capacity.Checking the spec sheet shows a claimed 100-mile (160 km) range, though that’s perhaps a bit optimistic. Delfast even claims that the 100-mile range comes at a pedal assist speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), but everything I know about pedal assist over more than 10 years in the e-bike industry tells me that you’re going to need a serious a tailwind to see 100 miles of range with that battery at 20 mph, even on pedal assist.I’m not about to say it’s impossible, but I’ll believe it when I see it. Even if it ekes out a modest 60-70 miles of range on pedal assist, that will still be pretty far for an e-bike or e-moped these days. We just don’t see many models with 960Wh of battery, so Delfast has certainly gone above and beyond in the battery department.The Delfast California features a U-shaped full-suspension frame, yet somehow manages to bring it in at just 66 pounds (30 kg). That’s made even more impressive considering that the bike carries that heavy motor and battery combo.The frame is said to fit riders from 5’0″ to 6’3″ (152-190 cm), but the short seat post adjustment makes me wonder how well that works in practice.The low step-through frame will certainly be a favorite among shorter riders, and the smaller 20″ wheels with tri-spoke mag wheels help keep the bike’s heft in check.Also adorning the frame are integrated LED lights powered by the main battery, hydraulic disc brakes, and a color LED display.The bike includes built-in location tracking to recover a stolen e-bike (something I wish my e-bike had last week), plus customizable alarms, remote immobilization, and other neat tricks to head off thieves at the pass.If you’re wondering about the new e-moped’s name, there’s an interesting story there too. Apparently one of Delfast’s designers was touring the company’s new Los Angeles headquarters at the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Stuck away from home for a period, the designer spent the time working on a new California-inspired electric moped.As the company explained:How do you cope when you’re stuck outside of your war-torn country and feel unable to help? Design an e-bike that represents more than yourself. With the help of the California team, and 30 employees working from the heavily bombarded Kyiv, he dreamt up quite possibly the best commuter e-bike ever built.The Delfast California is a symbol of resistance in Ukraine with the help of the United States. It’s not only the most intelligent, powerful, classically beautiful commuter e-bike ever designed. A percentage of Delfast California revenue will help the Ukrainian resistance.Delfast will be launching the California with an upcoming Indiegogo campaign. The standard MSRP of $3,999 will apparently be cut in half during the pre-order period on Indiegogo, putting the price at just $1,999. The bike is expected to arrive next June or July and will include a two-year warranty.We generally don’t cover Indiegogo campaigns from brand-new startups, but in this case, the company has been around for years. We’ve watched Delfast deliver a number of different models of e-bikes, so we know the Ukrainian-based company isn’t some fly-by-night operation.What do you think of Delfast’s latest electric bike design? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/09/26,"After having previously tested out Tenways’ first single-speed electric bicycle last year, I was excited to give the brand’s newest model a try. Now that I’ve spent some good saddle time on the Tenways CGO800S, here’s what I think about this new ride.First of all, there’s definitely a lot to like in the Tenways CGO800S. It’s not all perfect, and there were a few misses, but it’s largely a very nice offering.This is absolutely an urban-oriented e-bike though, so don’t expect to turn this into your hybrid trail rider or anything like that. It’s also a pedal-assist e-bike fitting in the Class 1 designation in the US, so you’ve got to go into this review knowing that this is an e-bike made for cyclists. This is not a motorcycle with pedals.With that frame of mind in place, let’s dive in here. You can start with my brief video review below, then keep reading for the rest of my thoughts.As I mentioned, this isn’t one of those “motorcycle with pedals” types of electric bicycles. This is a relaxed e-bike that feels much more like a standard city bicycle, albeit one that doesn’t make you work very hard if you don’t want to.The upright ride with tall handlebars gives a comfortable body position and the modest 250W motor doesn’t feel overpowered. It still has some nice acceleration in higher-power pedal assist modes, but no one will accuse the Tenways CGO800S of being too much bike to handle. It just isn’t going to knock anyone’s cycling socks off, so to speak.That means it is better suited for someone who already enjoys cycling, but wants a nice boost added to their usual ride. And perhaps they also want the other advantages that come with nicer e-bikes. For example, the included torque sensor makes the pedal assist smooth and intuitive feeling. When you press harder on the pedals, you get more power from the motor. It’s as simple as that.There’s no throttle to feather; everything is foot-controlled.Well, not everything. You’ve still got those hydraulic disc brakes at your fingertips. But there’s no shifter to mess with, since this is a single speed. That can go in either the pros or cons column, depending on whether you like the simplicity of a single-speed or prefer the gear ratios that come with a multi-speed transmission.For me, single-speeds are great, lightweight, and simple solutions. But I also live in a flat city, and so your mileage may vary.Speaking of mileage, the company says you’ll get up to 100 km (62 miles) of range from the Tenways CGO800S. That’s probably a bit higher than most people will get, but it really depends on what pedal assist level you keep it in. If you’re blasting around in the highest power level, you’ll be lucky to see 35-40 miles. If you keep it in level 1 all the time, you could realistically reach 62 miles of range. But since most people don’t have the self-control to only use the lowest (and slowest) power level, don’t expect to ever really see 62 miles of range.Even so, the rest of the promises check out. The speed really gets up to 20 mph (32 km/h). The bike comes with included accessories like a rear rack and a fender set. The LED lights work and they work well. Though on that note I’ll say that the turn signals feel a bit gimmicky to me. They’re barely distinguishable on the rear of the bike since they are built into the single tail light. You’ve got to be really close to make out that one turn signal is on and realize what it is. Sure, having turn signals is a nice addition. And I may use them from time to time. But I’m definitely still going to use hand signals too. I wouldn’t rely on those little rear turn signals – and of course the lack of front turn signals also makes hand signaling a necessity.Another nice addition that is almost a bit overkill is the screen. Don’t get me wrong, it’s beautiful. But there’s just so much going on, especially when you get into the settings. I turned off the password feature since it was a bit annoying to me. But password protecting your e-bike is a neat idea, and some riders might enjoy the extra security. I’ll go with a beefy lock any day of the week, but the feature is still a nice addition, in theory.And I can’t deny that the screen is quite attractive. It’s nicely designed and the colors pop. So nice work there, Tenways.For $1,999, you’re getting a lot of nice parts like those hydraulic brakes and Gates carbon belt drive. Even so, the lower power and limited top speed don’t quite match the price, if you’re looking for bang-for-your-buck performance-wise.So in this case, I’d say that it’s worth it if your main requirements are the quality construction and easygoing ride. But if performance is more your thing, you can find bikes with bigger motors and batteries for less cash.",ebikes
2022/09/25,"Huck Cycles, a North Carolina electric moped maker, is finding that its off-road-optimized electric moped is actually proving quite popular for city riders as well.It’s a surprising finding, considering the bike was originally designed for hunters, campers, and other outdoor enthusiasts that wanted a powerful but (relatively) lightweight electric two-wheeler.The bike was inspired by the classic Honda Motra, itself a popular recreational mini-bike from the 1980s.Far from a heavyweight electric adventure bike, the 145-pound (65 kg) Huck Overland is a smaller and more nimble ride. It comes with a 3 kW nominal and 6 kW peak-rated motor, and carries a 3 kWh battery rated for 40 miles (64 km) of range.As founder and CEO Brett McCoy explained to Electrek, it’s not just hunters and fisherman that have taken to the Overland:I’ve been shocked at how many people in larger cities like NYC, LA, and Miami have jumped on this model as a daily commuter. Apparently, the rugged Mad Max look is in for city riders too.Like Huck Cycles’ other models, the Overland is street legal and comes with a VIN and manufacturer’s certificate of origin. That’s one of the advantages of handling manufacturing locally in North Carolina, starting from welding up the bare frames and handling every step of the assembly. As the manufacturer, Huck Cycles can ensure regulatory compliance.Not everyone will need to register the bikes, as they have a speed-limited “moped mode” that lets them classify as a 49cc scooter or moped in many states. In other states, a motorcycle endorsement may be required, and the bikes may need to be registered as motorcycles. In that case, unlocking the higher-speed capability lets riders make the most out of the bikes after registering them as full motorcycles.It’s a move we’ve seen other companies like ONYX explore as well, making it easy for riders to stay legal and operate their bikes responsibly within the confines of varying state laws.With multiple speed modes, Huck’s bikes can hit speeds of “45+ mph,” with that plus sign likely doing some heavy lifting. Owners have reported exceeding that 45 mph figure with room to spare. As urban rides, these approximately $5,800 machines offer a legal upgrade over 28 mph electric bicycles without entering full heavyweight electric motorcycle territory. They’re essentially a re-imagination of the 1970s heyday of 50cc mopeds.As popular as the Overland has proven for city riders, the Huck Rebel remains the company’s best seller after debuting several years ago.With a more traditional moped design, it uses a top-tank style frame with the contents of the “tank” being replaced by a 3 kWh battery. The more recognizable styling is likely better suited for riders that aren’t seeking out that Mad Max vibe offered by the Overland.The $5,400 Rebel actually has footpegs instead of pedals, meaning many of my more pedantic readers will be blowing up my comments section soon to chastise me about misusing the “ped” part of the word “moped.” As it happens, most states have moped laws that include what we sometimes call “nopeds,” or bikes like these that are moped-sized but feature pegs instead of pedals. And thus the word moped has grown and evolved over time, now largely used for a class of vehicles between heavyweight e-bikes and lightweight electric motorcycles, with or without pedals.Whatever you call them, Huck’s electric two-wheelers certainly capture the classic moped charm while applying a 21st-century twist.But for those that want something a bit bigger, the Huck Stinger pushes the brand into light electric motorcycle territory with a larger and more capable bike. Expected to be priced in the $6,500 to $9,500 range depending on the loadout, the Huck Stinger will be arriving in Q4 of this year.",ebikes
2022/09/23,"Here at Electrek, I’ve had the rough job of testing literally hundreds of electric bicycles over the past few years (ok fine, it’s super fun). I’ve seen everything from bargain basement models to several ultra high-end electric bikes with cutting-edge materials and advanced production processes.Sometimes the cheapest electric bikes leave me wanting more, while the super expensive e-bikes offer more than an average rider can afford. As usual, the sweet spot is usually somewhere in the middle. Here’s a list of what I consider to be the best quality electric bikes I’ve tested on the market today that still slip in under the coveted $1,000 mark.The Rad Power Bikes RadMission is the epitome of a no-frills urban electric bike. It offers (almost) everything you need and nothing you don’t.From the 500W motor to the 500Wh battery, the performance specs are plenty for average riders looking for a 20 mph (32 km/h) electric bike.The city-oriented e-bike may lack a few fancier options like suspension or an LCD screen, but it’s well made and gets you in the door with the support and peace of mind of the largest electric bike company in the US.It even comes in two frame styles, mid-step and high-step. I’m a fan of the mid-step, partly because it’s more comfortable to mount and partly because I think that the orange color (which only comes on the mid-step) is the best one of the bunch.While the RadMission is often priced at around $1,200, it’s currently on sale for an impressive $899. At that price, it’s a steal of a deal.Check out my full review if you want to get all the nerdy details on this awesome model.Or take a gander at my short review video below for a quick dive into this popular model.If the RadMission above is a bigger bike than you’re after, then the small and folding Lectric XP Lite might be a better fit. This bike can origami itself into a much tighter package, fitting in the trunk of your car or the back of your closet.It still offers quite useful commuter specs though, such as a peak power output of 720W and a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h).It even comes with built-in LED lights, though it lacks features like fenders or a rear rack, which must be added as optional accessories. You do get free Slime anti-flat compound pre-installed in the tires though, which means you won’t even realize that you didn’t get that flat tire one day that you would have suffered from without the pre-installed Slime.Even without the included accessories that I would have liked to see on a commuter bike, the $799 price makes this a great deal for a solid folding electric bike that combines good power output with modest range.Definitely take a look at my first ride experience on this e-bike to see what makes it such a potent yet affordable commuter e-bike.Update: The new Lectric XP 3.0 replaced this e-bike and it’s even better!For those that still want a folding electric bike but need more power and speed, upgrading from the Lectric XP Lite to the Lectric XP 2.0 is the way to go.This fat tire folding e-bike offers a 750W motor that peaks even higher, has a larger battery, and perhaps most critically, hits class 3 speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h).You’ll pay for that higher performance in extra weight (and in extra dollars, since the price is $999), but you get a lot more too. You even receive an included rear rack and full metal fenders, which are often up-charge accessories on most e-bikes.Lectric eBikes recently launched a new larger battery pack that bumps the capacity from 460Wh to 672Wh, but that also bumps the price up by a couple of hundred bucks. It’s worth it, in my humble opinion. But if you stick with the stock battery, you can keep the price under $1,000.See my review of the Lectric XP 2.0 to get a sense of what this e-bike can do.This one is a bit out there but stick with me, you’re going to find this cool. The JackRabbit is something of a hybrid between an e-bike and an e-scooter.It has 20″ bicycle wheels and stubby bicycle handlebars that help it ride like a bike. But the shorter wheelbase makes it feel a bit more scooter-ish.And of course, the lack of pedals is another notch in the scooter column.It may not have a very big battery, boasting just 10-12 miles of range (16-20 km). But it can still get up to a sprightly 20 mph (32 km/h), which makes it great for city commuting. It also weighs a mere 25 pounds (11 kg) and is easy to pick up and toss in the back of a car or carry onto a subway train.It’s an ideal solution if you’re on the hunt for something small and convenient for a short city commute and need an e-bike that takes up a very small portion of your apartment or garage.Yes, I know it seems strange. But it works so well that you get past the odd look quite quickly.At $999, it’s pricier per watt or per mile, but it’s also the lightest and most convenient model on this list.See my in-depth review to learn more about the JackRabbit, or watch my video below to get a sense of this odd-yet-awesome model’s proportions.Propella’s smallest electric bike, which features 20″ wheels and a minimalist frame, weighs in at a svelte 33 pounds (15 kg).It features a single-speed drivetrain, so don’t expect to turn this into a San Francisco hill climber, but the smaller wheels actually offer better torque and help it handle climbs better than you’d think.The 400W peak-rated Bafang motor gives it some real giddy-up to its top speed of 18 mph (30 km/h), and the 250Wh battery offers a range of 15-25 miles (25-56 km).That’s some great performance for an e-bike that is currently on sale for $849!There’s no throttle, making this a pedal-friendly electric bike. If you’re not in the market for a Class 1 e-bike that requires pedaling, you should look elsewhere. But if you’re into doing a bit of the work yourself, the Propella Mini is an awesome option for a lightweight and effective urban commuter e-bike.For more info, check out my full review of the Propella Mini.I know that this list is supposed to be only sub-$1,000 electric bikes, but I hope you’ll forgive me for including the Ride1Up Roadster V2. It starts at just $1,045 (though goes up to $1,095 for most color options and frame sizes). At that price though, it is a highly effective commuter e-bike with some serious bang for your buck.I had to include this one on the list because I just love this bike so much!Not only is this the only belt-drive e-bike on the list, but it’s also the only one that can hit 25 mph (40 km/h) without surpassing 33 pounds (15 kg). The rim brakes might seem old school, but having tested the bike myself, I can confirm that they’re high quality and bring the bike to a quick stop. And you can always upgrade to the Gravel version of the bike if you want true disc brakes.With 500W of peak-rated power in a lightweight urban e-bike setup, the Ride1Up Roadster is definitely worth a look if you’re in the market for a Class 3 e-bike without a throttle.You can read my review of the Ride1Up Roadster here, or check out the video below.",ebikes
2022/09/22,"The Vässla Pedal has just launched as the Swedish mobility startup’s latest futuristic-looking electric bike, complete with high performance parts like torque-sensing pedal assist functionality.The Swedes have never been one to shy away from bold two-wheeler designs, and the Vässla Pedal isn’t about to change that tradition.The design is both minimalist and striking, lacking exposed wires or buttons and using a single frame tube instead of a conventional front triangle.The new launch also comes just in time for World Car Free Day, as the company explained:On September 22, World Car Free Day encourages people around the globe to replace their cars with green mobility for one day. The day gives a great opportunity to demonstrate how our cities can look and feel without cars, and how much pollution affects our lives. As Vässla’s mission is for every day to be a car free day, they announce their latest addition to their fleet – the Vässla Pedal, encouraging more people to replace heavy non-environmental friendly vehicles with light electric bikes.The Vässla Pedal is said be designed as a unisex frame for nearly all rider heights, with the goal of allowing an entire household to share one e-bike.The 24″ wheels are smaller in diameter than traditional 26″ or 700c wheels, making the bike more comfortable for smaller riders. At the same time, the company says the bike features an “ergonomically designed seat for a comfortable sitting position without putting too muchpressure on wrists and neck.”Vässla claims the bike’s removable battery is sufficient for 100 km (62 miles) of range. That might sound lofty compared to most throttle-powered e-bikes we typically see in the US, but the pedal assist nature of this e-bike makes it more efficient and helps that battery last longer.Since throttles are typically not allowed on electric bicycles in the EU, pedal assist is the motor activation method of choice across Europe. In the case of the Vässla Pedal, a torque sensor helps measure accurate rider pedaling force and apply an efficient, responsive motor assist level based on the rider’s own pedaling force.The rear hub motor is rated for 250W of nominal power — another legally capped performance level — but offers a healthy 45 Nm of torque, which is rather high for small hub motors. The bike features a belt drive with single-speed operation for ease of use and reduced maintenance. The hydraulic disc brakes will also help reduce the maintenance checklist, keeping riders riding instead of wrenching on their bikes.The Vässla Pedal includes IoT connectivity and comes with an app for digital unlocking, real-time tracking, alerts of theft attempts, and history of bike rides.The Vässla Pedal is available for pre-order (Sweden only, for now) at a price of €2,990 with deliveries expected to begin March 2023. Vässla Pedals will be available for subscription in Stockholm, Paris, and Madrid already this autumn, with plans for monthly, half-year and yearly subscriptions starting at €79.What do you think of the new Vässla Pedal electric bike?

2022/09/19,"Generally speaking, folding electric bikes are usually on the smaller and lighter end of the spectrum. They tend to prioritize compactness over performance, which makes sense for a folder. At least that was until the Wallke H6 came around and flipped the script, saying “Screw your compactness. We’re a crazy fast e-bike that just happens to fold in half!”The Wallke H6 doesn’t pull any punches. It may have smaller diameter 20″ wheels, but this is still 90 pounds (41 kg) of e-bike coming at you fast.And that’s not hyperbole. This thing gets up to a claimed 32 mph (51.5 km/h) – though I clocked it with GPS at 31 mph (50 km/h). Either way you slice you slice it though, that’s pretty darn fast. And it doesn’t take very long to hit those speeds either.It’s a big bike with a lot of attitude. But it’s also got a lot of interesting parts on it too, from a powerful motor to a pair of long-range batteries.Check out my testing of the Wallke H6 folding fat tire e-bike in my video below, then read on for the entire scoop!I’m no stranger to folding e-bikes from Wallke, but this one takes the cake when it comes to excess.The powerful motor gets paired with a powerful controller that takes full advantage of that big battery capacity to offer impressive acceleration.Whether you’re rocking the throttle or pedal assist, high power is available at your fingertips (or toes).But just as important as a high-power e-bike that gets up to 30+ mph speeds is a bike that can also stop. And these hydraulic disc brakes on what look like motorcycle disc rotors accomplish that goal with flying colors. Add in that bright and colorful LED display between the hydraulic disc brake levers, and you’ve got a very nicely outfitted cockpit.I will say that the bars felt a bit higher for me than I might have liked. They weren’t ape hangers, but they definitely had a cruiser-esque feel to them with my hands up higher than I normally like. I got used to it pretty quickly though. In fact that whole bike feels bigger than it looks, and it puts you in a nice, upright seating position that gives you a tall view of the road ahead of you.With both front and rear suspension, there’s a lot of moving parts down beneath you that help lift that frame up and give you a bit of height. For shorter riders, keep in mind that the suspension seat post limits just how low the seat can go. I’m 5’7″ and I had no problem with seat height, but shorter riders than me could start to run into issues. Wallke recommends a minimum rider height of 5’4″, for reference.The star of the show here (and part of what contributes to the extra heft of the Wallke H6) is the pair of batteries. Adding up to 1,680Wh, there’s a ton of battery capacity on this bike.They humorously rate the bike for 170 miles of range. Except that figure isn’t quite so laughable when you realize that works out to nearly 10 Wh/mile, which is a reasonable consumption level for a fit rider using pedal assist.Call me crazy, but I’m guessing most people who buy this bike aren’t going to shoehorn into this “fit rider” classification, at least not the type of rider that can pedal an e-bike for 170 miles.So if you’re rocking throttle-only riding, then expect a range of likely 50-75 miles depending on how fast you go. That’s still a super long range for a throttle-controlled e-bike, and is only possible thanks to that massive amount of battery spread across two large battery packs.So what kind of rider would choose this e-bike?The Wallke H6 is a bit of an enigma. It’s a folding e-bike, but it’s not particularly transportable. It’s freaking heavy, and it’s a bulky e-bike even in its folded form.That being said, the ride it offers is definitely more of a moped-style ride than a typical folding e-bike ride. This isn’t just a city commuter, this is an urban assault e-bike.To me, that means this is an e-bike that fulfills something of a Super73-type role, but with an e-bike that could conceivably fit in a large car’s trunk. It may be heavy, but it still folds in three places to take up less of a bulky block than a typical non-folding fat tire e-bike.At the current sale price of $2,499, you’ve got to shell out a significant amount of dough for the Wallke H6. But is it worth it?When you look at the specs, you actually get a lot for that price. This is an e-bike that exceed class 3 speeds, comes with an 8-speed transmission and big ol’ hydraulic disc brakes, a color LED screen, full-suspension (with a third suspension point in the seat post) and a bench seat for a passenger. Oh yeah, and two massive batteries.I’d have loved to see some good passenger foot pegs and a torque sensor at this price, but even so, this is a lot of bike with a lot of performance.This is probably still more bike than most people need. But if you’re in the market for a high-performance, fast, and powerful e-bike that can fold into a bulky block, the Wallke H6 will get you there. And it will do it quickly.Just remember to lift with your legs.",ebikes
2022/09/17,"Urban electric bikes designed for quickly navigating the city are the perfect solution for drivers that want to switch to a more efficient and more fun transportation alternative. And the Aventon Pace 500 Step-Through has just what commuters need all in one package.Anytime we get a chance to throw a leg over the Aventon Pace 500 Next-Gen, it’s a good day to ride. That’s because this e-bike offers up exactly what urban e-bike riders are looking for, combining good performance with excellent value.For starters, the e-bike is fast and efficient. Riders can easily hit 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist. It’s perfect for the morning commute when you want to keep up with traffic on larger roads and then fly right past traffic by using the bike lane when you get into the city.For anyone who doesn’t feel like pedaling, the left-side thumb throttle makes it easy to reach speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h) while cruising around effort-free. That’s great for the end of the day when you’re just tired and want to get back home to take a load off. When you do want to be active though, the pedal assist is a nice balance between exercise and fun.See what we mean in the testing video below!Sure, 28 mph speeds are fun. But a big battery that can take you the distance is just as important. And the 614 Wh battery can carry riders up to 30 miles (48 km) on throttle-only or 47 miles (76 km) on pedal assist.You’ll be riding in comfort the entire way too, thanks to a pleasantly upright design that includes a Selle Royal comfort saddle, ergonomic grips and an adjustable stem to dial in the handlebar height just where you want it.The slight rearward curve of the bars offer a bit of a cruiser vibe and bring the bars in to prevent you from riding all hunched over, making the bike that much more comfortable on long rides.The Aventon Pace 500 Next-Gen also emphasizes safety, as demonstrated by the grippy hydraulic disc brakes and the integrated lighting. The rear tail lights are beautifully built into the rear frame, making them visible from the back and sides of the bike. They light up as tail lights but also engage when you pull the brakes, giving functional brake lights too. A front headlight on the handlebars rounds out the light package.The handlebar display is bright and visible too, offering a full-color screen for all of your important ride data. It even integrates with the smartphone app to let riders dial in the bike’s settings, record rides and participate with the rest of the Aventon community.Aventon’s line of accessories help deck out the bike for commuter roles too. We tested it with the rear rack, which is perfect for adding a storage crate or panniers. As you can see in our testing video, the bike is excellent for grabbing several days of groceries, despite still being a small-format comfortable city bike – not an extended cargo bike.At a price of $1,699, the Aventon Pace 500 Next-Gen offers huge value. Anyone currently paying off their car knows how much traditional transportation can cost. In addition to car payments, consider how much a month of gas, insurance, parking and routine maintenance cost. That can easily add up to more than the cost of this bike in just one month!With two frame styles (step-through and step-over) available in multiple sizes and colors, it’s easy to find the right size and style of e-bike for you. Unlike many other value-oriented e-bikes that have a single frame size, Aventon’s bikes aren’t made in a one-size-fits-most format. Instead, they actually try to better fit each of their riders, resulting in a better cycling experience.There are a lot of commuter e-bikes out there, but the Aventon Pace 500 Next-Gen’s quality build and excellent performance mean this one should be at the top of your list to check out. We sure had a blast testing it out!",ebikes
2022/09/15,"Veo, which touts itself as the first profitable shared micromobility company, has just unveiled its latest light electric vehicle known as the Apollo. But unlike typical e-scooters or e-bikes, this one isn’t just a two-wheeler. It’s also a two-seater.The Apollo (not to be confused with Canada’s premium electric scooter maker Apollo), is a class 2 electric bike designed for city commuters.Unlike many shared mobility operators that use third-party electric bikes and e-scooters, Veo designs its vehicles in-house. It’s a strategy that the company has employed since as early as 2017. That means it worked to build the Apollo e-bike from the ground up.Featuring a pair of seats, the 750W Apollo can be used either for transporting a passenger on back or for hauling more cargo than you’d fit on a typical shared e-bike or e-scooter found on most street corners. With 400 pounds (181 kg) of weight capacity, the bike is certainly built to handle the extra weight.That dual purpose design is meant to increase the e-bike’s utility, giving it a better chance of displacing more car trips by providing a functional alternative that isn’t limited to a singe rider with a backpack’s worth of belongings.Cofounder and CEO of Veo Candice Xie explained further:As the micromobility industry continues to grow, we must expand our vehicle offerings to address unmet market demands. The Apollo was developed in direct response to insights from rider surveys, feedback from municipalities, and global research that indicates the immense need for safe tandem riding and cargo hauling. By opening up micromobility to new riders and new trip types, we can reduce car dependency and help cities advance their ambitious climate goals.Most shared electric bike operators use class 1 e-bikes that lack throttles. Instead, the motor is engaged by the rider’s pedaling action, meaning that the user still has to supply some of the work. But throttle-controlled e-bikes can be operated more like a motorbike, with the pedals used largely as static foot rests.The Veo Apollo is a class 2 e-bike and thus sports that throttle, which the company positions as a great way to help on hills. In practice, it’s likely to be used on more than just hills.In fact, Veo’s own shared micromobility data shows just how much more popular throttle-controlled e-bikes are. The company has both throttle-controlled and pedal-assisted e-bikes in its lineup already, though both sport just a single seat. Veo says that its throttle-controlled e-bikes see 4x as many rentals as its purely pedal-assisted e-bikes.And in the case of the Veo Apollo, the throttle doesn’t exactly turn it into a high-power motorcycle. The 750W motor may have decent pep, but the bike is limited to a reasonable 15 mph (25 km/h) top speed, which is likely a good idea for a passenger carrying e-bike designed specifically for semi-infrequent riders.Veo’s cofounder and president Edwin Tan spoke further about the importance of a dual seat e-bike that was also cargo capable:If we want to get more people out of cars and into the bike lane, micromobility must accommodate rider needs for varying trip types and purposes. A second seat and cargo-hauling capabilities make the transition to micromobility realistic for more people.For the past five years, Veo has led innovation in the shared micromobility industry, bringing more vehicles and safety technology to market than any other company – including the industry’s first seated scooter – and we’re just getting started.Those that are excited to see Veo’s new Apollo electric bike on their own streets will have to wait a bit longer. The new e-bike won’t start rolling out until early 2023.In the meantime, there are plenty of other two-seater e-bikes that are hopping on the multi-seated bandwagon.",ebikes

2022/09/14,"I’ve been an Aventon fan for a long time, having been routinely impressed with the quality of each new electric bike the company has released. And so I went into this review of the new Aventon Level.2 with a fairly high bar for the company. Fortunately for everyone, Aventon largely cleared that bar with room to spare, delivering a Level.2 that is truly worthy of the label “flagship commuter e-bike.”Right out of the box, there was a lot of new stuff to take in here.Like all of Aventon’s new e-bike launches and e-bike updates lately, the Level.2 inherited the upgraded Aventon color LCD display that integrates with the company’s smartphone app. A solid Bluetooth connection pairs the bike to the phone, letting you record rides, make speed adjustments, connect with the larger Aventon community, and more.But it wasn’t just software that was new, the Level.2 comes with a bunch of new hardware, too.The biggest take home is the new torque sensor, which gives much nicer and more responsive pedal assist. The sensor allows the bike to respond quicker and provide a more natural-feeling ride. The harder you pedal, the more assist you get. That’s exactly how an e-bike should function.When you’re not feeling like putting in some good effort yourself, the thumb throttle makes it easy to kick back and fly along at up to 20 mph (32 km/h). Aventon used to have a longer delay with the throttle, but they’ve tuned it nicely so that you get good throttle response. That used to be a critique that I would throw at Aventon with each new bike, but they’ve really done a nice job at making the throttle responsive without feeling like it’s dumping all its power at once.Even with that nice throttle, I find that I still really like using pedal assist. I rarely bump up to level 5 since that’s the most powerful level, and I don’t really need that much assist. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fun to fly along at 28 mph (45 km/h) with your feet flying fast and the trees going by even faster. But more often I’m somewhere in the middle, cruising in pedal assist level 2 or 3 and enjoying modest assist that still leaves me doing some good ol’ honest pedaling.The bike is even decently light for a well-spec’d commuter e-bike, at a hair over 50 pounds. Many commuter e-bikes are significantly heavier. With parts like front suspension, a nice seat, hydraulic disc brakes, an 8-speed transmission and a big battery, the grams quickly add up and turn into kilograms. But Aventon kept the weight reasonable, and I applaud that.The last major hardware addition that I really love is the new taillight setup. We get frame-integrated taillights that are built right into the seat stays on the back of the bike. They illuminate both sides of the bike and are visible from the rear and side angles.Not only are they clear and bright taillights, but they serve double duty as brake lights. I’m a bit surprised that Aventon hasn’t been interested in giving them a turning signal function yet, but maybe that’s something for the future.As a commuter electric bike, lights are key. They’re important for night riding, but they’re still important during the day too in order to make you even more visible. The bright front headlight is sure to be noticed, as are the taillights.Other nice commuter features are the included fenders and the included rear rack. I love when companies give us these important commuter features and don’t hold them back behind a paywall. Nice work there, Aventon!That brings me to the cost. The Aventon Level.2 is priced at $1,949, which feels like the only bummer here. It’s not a miss. They didn’t swing and whiff it like some companies do. But they didn’t connect quite as solidly as I had hoped.If this was say, $1,799, I’d be over the moon. But as it stands, $1,949 is still a pretty good price. You do get a lot here for your money. And the price is fair – don’t get me wrong. But if the original Level was $1,599 two years ago when I first reviewed it, I would have hoped that these upgrades wouldn’t have pushed the bike up another $350. And again, I keep going back and forth with myself here. A lot has changed in two years. Parts are scarce. Shipping is expensive. The whole world has change drastically in just two short trips around the sun. And so maybe I’m being too harsh. As it stands, there aren’t really any e-bikes that can challenge the Aventon Level on specs for price when you consider that torque sensor. Even the best from Rad and Ride1Up don’t have torque sensors, and so they can’t really compete directly.The one potential comparison perhaps is the Lectric XPremium, which is a great bike with arguably better performance for slightly less cash. But it’s also a fat-tire folding e-bike and is thus a very different animal. For anyone who wants a lighter-weight e-bike with full-size 27.5×2.1″ wheels like this, the Aventon Level.2 is likely the ticket.All told, I’m immensely happy with the new Aventon Level.2. This is an e-bike that can perform nearly any commute, anywhere, and for anybody. With a well-made frame, visible lighting, high-performance motor and battery, and included commuter package of fenders and rear rack, the Level.2 is everything you would ever need in a commuter electric bike.You’d be hard-pressed to find a better collection of parts from a reputable company like Aventon for a better price. If it’s out there, I just haven’t found it yet.",ebikes
2022/09/13,"Aventon has been updating all of the brand’s popular electric bicycles to include upgraded features like improved frames, built-in LED lighting, and full-color displays that feature Bluetooth connectivity. Now the Level is getting the upgrades with the release of the Aventon Level.2 commuter e-bike.When I first reviewed the original Aventon Level nearly two years ago, my summary was basically “please, take my money!” Now that we have the new Aventon Level.2, the bike is even better and more commuter-ready than ever. I have had the chance to spend the last few weeks testing out the new e-bike ahead of its launch. I’ve got a full review coming up shortly, complete with a video of my testing experience.  Look for that in the next few days. But first, let’s see what’s new with the updated Aventon Level.2.A major new update to the bike includes how the motor is activated. The bike is powered by a 500W continuous-rated rear hub motor that helps it get up to 20 mph (32 km/h) under throttle control or 28 mph (45 km/h) with pedal assist.Speaking of pedal assist, it’s better than ever thanks to the inclusion of a new torque sensor. A torque sensor, unlike the lower cost cadence sensors, measure how hard you’re pedaling instead of how fast you’re pedaling. That allows the bike to provide much more responsive and intuitive pedal assist that better mimics your own power delivery.The inclusion of an eight-speed drivetrain makes that pedaling even nicer and lets riders dial in the best gear ratio for their speed and terrain.A frame-integrated 48V and 14Ah battery offers 672 of Wh. With modest pedal assist, riders should be able to squeeze a solid 40 miles (64 km) or so from that battery. Riding around on throttle will drain the battery faster, but a reasonable 25 miles (40 km) is still likely within reason.The battery on the Aventon Level.2 is lockable within the frame but removable for charging off of the bike if riders need to leave the bike locked outside.That frame features Aventon’s signature smooth welds, making it a rolling piece of art that I wish other manufacturers would better imitate. It’s rare to see such nice-looking manufacturing at this price point. And, speaking of frame-integrations, check out those tail lights. Just like on Aventon’s other popular electric bikes, the company brought the tail lights right into the seat stays on the rear of the frame. That means you get good visibility from the rear and side angles at night. The front head light is handlebar mounted, allowing it to turn with the bars as you steer around a corner.A pair of hydraulic disc brakes offer powerful stopping with a maintenance-free design. Unlike mechanical cable disc brakes, hydraulic brakes basically stay in tune until the pads finally wear out. Depending how much you ride (and brake), it could be a year before you eventually need to perform maintenance and have the pads replaced.The Aventon Level.2 rolls on 27.5 x 2.1″ tires, and the bike comes equipped with a full fender package to prevent them from throwing water and mud all over you. A rear rack adorns the back, ready for commuters to strap on their panniers or an extra cargo box for carrying gear.The bike comes in both a step-over frame (54 pounds or 24.5 kg) as well as a step-through frame (52 pounds or 23.6 kg). There are four colorways available, including Polar White, Himalayan Pink, Glacier Blue, and Clay.Priced at $1,949, the new Aventon Level.2 is now available on Aventon’s website.",ebikes
2022/09/12,"Colorado-based electric bicycle company Optibike has a new high-power electric motor that it says can best any other e-bike motor in its weight class. The motor is called the Optibike Powerstorm MBB, or Motorized Bottom Bracket. Like many other mid-drive motors, it is mounted in the location of a typical bottom bracket on a bicycle, right where the pedal cranks meet the frame.The 4 kg (8.8 pound) motor interprets the rider’s pedal input and outputs significantly more assistance to help riders power up and over tough off-road obstacles.In this case, the Optibike MBB claims a peak power output of 2,500 watts, or around 3.3 horsepower. Even the continuous power rating of 1.75 kW or 2.3 horsepower is industry-leading in the electric bicycle market.Perhaps even more importantly than just raw power, the motor claims to avoid overheating issues as well. The company says it can maintain 1,750 watts of continuous power draw while climbing up steep hills in hot weather without overheating.The new Powerstorm, has the highest power to weight and volume of any e-bike mid-drive motor in the world. The compact and light weight design results in e-bikes that handle better and have larger batteries.Larger batteries sound about right, as you’d want some serious battery capacity to feed this power-hungry motor. For example, the battery on Optibike’s R22 electric bike measures in at an astounding 3.26 kWh. That’s around 5x more battery capacity than found on an average electric bicycle.Each MBB is assembled locally at Optibike’s Colorado facility, where the housing, internals, and gears are machined from solid billet 6061 aluminum. The motor and gear box use no castings, increasing the overall strength.As Optibike founder and CEO Jim Turner explained:Our new Powerstorm MBB represents the culmination of over 25 years of E-Bike design experience and shows the American creativity is alive and well.Bikes like the Optibike R22 tame the motor’s 190Nm of torque with a Rohloff Speed 500 internally geared hub featuring 14 gear ratios. In highest gear, the bike and motor combo are said to offer a top speed of 36 mph (58 km/h), making the R22 an off-road-only e-bike as far as US laws are concerned.Electric motors in US-market electric bikes have often played fast and loose with regulatory concerns, sometimes pushing well past the maximum allowable 750 watts.In the case of motors like the Optibike MBB, the off-road designation means that it doesn’t actually have to conform to the 750 watt limit. In many cases, e-bikes with high-power motors have limiters that allow riders to cut the power back to legal limits for on-road use. Other electric bikes have crossed into moped territory and even offered VINs with manufacturers certificates of origin (MCOs) that allow riders to register the bikes as mopeds or motorcycles at their local DMV.Most riders prefer to maintain electric bicycle status with legal power limits to avoid the hassle of licensing, registration, and insurance that come with moped and motorcycle-class vehicles.Would you ride a high-power electric bicycle with several kilowatts of power on tap? Or are you happy with street-legal electric bicycle motors? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/09/09,"The Spectre-ST is yet another step forward for the once small e-bike company EUNORAU. Somehow, they managed to make a very stable step-through electric mountain bike with a great deal of equipment weight while keeping the price reasonable. I do have one qualm with the bike (and regular readers may know already), but overall, it’s very impressive to see the steady improvements continue in the EUNORAU brand. The Spectre-ST is a far cry from the “heavily inspired by another bike” offerings we’ve seen in the past. At first glance, you make think by the shape and name, that this is just a step through version of the regular Spectre S. But the truth is, this is the next evolution in a sense that this also houses a dual-battery setup as well as full suspension. Combine that with the amazing 1000W motor, and you’ve got a serious contender on your hands.The frame itself seems to be made of pretty decent quality construction, which is likely due to the high class facility Eunorau makes these in. The frame is svelte, so you would be forgiven if you missed the fact that this does indeed have a rear suspension. That’s right, the rear suspension is somewhat hidden under the seat post tube. When you take that into consideration along with the hidden battery chamber, this really gives off an integrated and sleek impression.Electrically, the standard battery is set for a sturdy 48v 15ah configuration. If you like, there is a battery upgrade to take it to 17ah, or you could get the dual-battery setup, which I have here. I would estimate that the dual-battery setup should easily grab you 60 miles of range on a full charge. This setup is paired with a powerful 1000w torque sensing mid-drive motor… and boy, can this thing really move! This combination made hills a problem of the past. It was so strong and fast, it really made them a problem of the far distant past, if you catch my drift. I was able to hit 30 mph easily, and it was so much fun to see how this bike could handle anything I threw at it like a piece of cake. The fun also extends to the mechanical side as well – the suspension in both the front and rear are air suspension setups. This made it feel like a pogo stick at times, but I honestly mean that in a good way. I had so much fun with the 140mm front suspension fork, I had to slow down to catch my breath from giggling. 11-42 tooth cassette in the rear, combined with that 1000w motor really made it feel like I could climb a telephone pole if I had the balance for it. The tires here are great, too. These are not your typical fat tires, like on the regular Spectre, but 3” wide tires. These are my personal favorite for mountain biking and cruising. I think because they offer a great balance of control, grip, and tread.Is every bike perfect? No, never. I mean, this one has a seat post that is pretty short (probably because of the hidden rear suspension), the saddle is just “meh,” and the brakes may be good for the street, but I would definitely upgrade them I was going on a trail. When it’s all said and done though, I love this thing. None of those little things matter, and my smile is as wide as the tires, the whole ride through. I think the Spectre ST is an amazing top of the line internet-order bike. My professional estimate would see a comparable bikes set at the $8,000 mark, when this one starts off at just $3,799. I mean, even if you went all out and got every single upgrade, warranty, and accessory available, it would still only put you at $5,289. For a serious eMTB, that’s not bad.",ebikes
2022/09/08,"Electrek will be on site at Micromobility America in the San Francisco Bay area next week, checking out all the latest and greatest updates in the big world of little vehicles.Micromobillity America is described as an “immersive two-day celebration of small electric vehicles and their power to radically reshape our cities.” From electric bikes and e-scooters to velomobiles and three-wheeled EVs, there will be a bit of everything at the show.Over a thousand attendees are expected to cram into the Craneway Pavilion to meet companies, speak with policymakers, test out light electric vehicles and network with movers and shakers in the industry.I’ll also be hosting a panel on the “ABCs of DTC, Subscription and Retail”, where I’ll be talking with the CEOs of Zygg, Unagi and Arcimoto about the advantages and pitfalls of the different ways people buy light EVs.

2022/09/08,"Adding to its expanding lineup of high-end electric bikes, Bianchi has just unveiled its new flagship electric gravel bike: the Bianchi e-Arcadex.The Bianchi e-Arcadex was designed around a full carbon frame with a geometry that the company says will “guarantee you are able to pedal comfortably on some of the harshest surfaces the world has to offer.”The new gravel e-bike can roll on tires as wide as 700x45c and the frame includes eyelets to add racks, fenders, or other accessories. With the ability to carry up to 20 kg (44 pounds) of extra gear on the frame, the e-Arcadex is a gravel bike designed for bike-packing and other gear-intensive rides.To help smooth out those rides, an 80mm stroke dropper seat post with 40mm-travel suspension keeps things comfortable when the trail starts to fight back.The Bianchi e-Arcadex includes a 500 Wh battery mounted in the downtube that can be easily removed for charging off of the bike.Charging takes four hours and a fully charged battery can provide 115 km (71 miles) of range.Power comes from a Bosch Performance Line CX mid-drive motor with a strong 85Nm torque rating. That motor has a 250W continuous power rating, but is well known to put out peak power of over twice that figure.The Bosch drivetrain uses a Kiox color display mounted on the handlebars to give quick access to ride data like speed, power level, and battery charge level.A 13-speed Campagnolo EP EKAR shifter powers the drivetrain and integrates with the Campagnolo brake levers.The Bianchi e-Arcadex comes in three colorways of Glacial (blue), Forest (green), and Desert (tan) and in five sizes of XS, S, M, L, and X. Pricing starts at €6,249 (approximately US $6,260).The bike also comes in a touring version that includes integrated racks and fenders, as well as built-in LED lighting, making it more appropriate as an everyday commuter e-bike. It also comes with slightly lower spec Shimano shifters and brakes, helping reduce the price to €5,349 (approximately US $5,360).Gravel e-bikes like the Bianchi e-Arcadex have remained a popular and quickly growing segment of the e-bike market.Yamaha recently updated its own popular gravel e-bike with the Yamaha Wabash-RT. Yamaha’s flagship gravel bike also offers a similar drop-bar setup, dropper seat post, and tire-width compatibility up to 45c.The bike uses Yamaha’s own PWseries ST motor and somewhat lower-spec Shimano brakes and transmission, helping drop the starting price by around $2,000 compared to Bianchi’s more high-end model.Bianchi hasn’t just stuck to gravel e-bikes, though. This summer the company released two other city and touring electric bikes known as the T-Tronik C-Type and T-Tronik T-Type.In a nod toward affordability, those e-bikes use Shimano E6100 mid-drive motors with a maximum of 60Nm of torque and include 417 Wh batteries produced by the major e-bike battery manufacturer Phylion. With the Bianchi e-Arcadex now adding to a wide range of Bianchi electric bicycles designed for mountains, trails, cities, and touring, the company is well-positioned in the European electric bicycle market.

2022/09/08,"Volcon Powersports, maker of off-road electric motorcycles and e-UTVs, has officially entered the electric bike market with its first street-legal EV, the Volcon Brat. The news follows the company’s slow drip campaign that teased its launch over the last few weeks.The moped-style electric bike may look a bit like a scaled down Volcon Grunt motorcycle, but it’s actually a fully-legal electric bicycle.The Volcon Brat uses the same exo-arch frame as the Grunt, creating something of a baby brother to the fat tire off-road electric motorcycle that launched Volcon’s start several years ago.That similarity is the goal, explained Texas-based Volcon Powersports CEO Jordan Davis:While our brand was built on the dirt, we have a passion for all things performance and the Brat meets our expectations. We set out to enter the market with not only a high-performance machine, but a bike that had style as well. The e-Bike market is saturated with lookalike products, and we believe the Brat stands out from the crowd in both looks and performance. We believe the strong growth in the segment is a unique opportunity to offer a fresh product, grabbing the attention of on-road e-Bike enthusiasts. The proverbial leap from the Brat to the Grunt isn’t far. If you can ride the Brat, you can ride our Grunt, meaning as your riding style changes and experience progresses, we’ll have the product for you.When it comes to performance, the 86 pound (39 kg) Volcon Brat is technically a Class 2 electric bike that offers speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h) with either throttle control or pedal assist – at least that’s the case when you stick to the first three power modes.There are four power models available, though, with the highest one unlocking a top speed of 28+ mph (45+ km/h) that is intended for off-road riding only.How much higher than 28 mph? We likely won’t know until the first bikes hit the dirt and/or road, as most electric moped-style bikes that can surpass the legal on-road limit of 28 mph don’t actually list their true top speed for liability reasons.The same is likely true for the “750 watt” motor found in the Volcon Brat, which looks like it could surely put out more than 750W of peak power.The Volcon Brat also includes a 750Wh battery mounted fairly low in the frame. The company claims a maximum range of 70 miles (112 km) in ride mode 1, but good luck ever seeing that figure. Unless you’re sticking to low-power pedal assist, the true range will be much less.The faux-tank on the top tube isn’t there to hold gas. Rather, it is actually a lockable storage area akin to a glove box, something we rarely see on electric bikes. There’s also a USB charge port inside that box to keep your phone or other devices charging.The bike rides on an inverted front fork and rear mono-shock, offering a full-suspension frame to smooth out rougher trails and streets. Combined with the 20×4″ tires, the Volcon Brat likely offers quite a smooth ride.Other interesting components include a full-color LED display to provide ride data directly on the handlebars, hydraulic disc brakes, a long bench seat, and a Shimano transmission to let pedal-curious riders run through the gears.Volcon is currently taking reservations without a deposit, letting riders get in line for no-money down. Once the bikes become available to ship in November, they’ll cost you $2,799.I’m definitely interested in this one. Sure, it’s Volcon’s take on a Super73, but it’s an interesting take, nonetheless. And compared to a Super73-RX, it’s about a thousand bucks less. I’m not surprised to see Volcon move into the e-bike space. It’s the next logical step for a company that already builds electric powersports products and now has a pile of stockholders to keep happy (something that has proven difficult based on the downward trajectory of its stock price over the last year).After recently undergoing a restructuring that included a series of layoffs as well as moving production of its vehicles out of its Texas-based factory, the new e-bike could help Volcon regain its footing ahead of its upcoming Volcon Stag UTV launch.",ebikes

2022/09/07,"A new full-suspension fat-tire electric bike is promising high performance for a relatively low price. The newly released model is known as the KKBike K26 S.Despite the company’s name putting three K’s uncomfortably close together, the K26 S has some quite intriguing specs.First of all, the bike touts full-suspension with an adjustable front fork and rear shock. The bike is heavy at 73 pounds (33 kg), but the fat tires combined with the full-suspension frame should give a fairly cushy ride.Next, it appears that the KKBike K26 S packs some decent power to move its hefty weight. A Bafang 750W continuous-rated motor sits in the rear wheel. With a claimed peak power rating of 1,200 watts and a torque rating of 85 Nm, that motor should be plenty powerful for the big bike.And it better be, as KKBike tells us the bike has a top speed of 31 mph (50 km/h). It takes some serious power to get a heavy bike like this up to those speeds, but it sounds like the KKBike K26 is designed to deliver.A fairly large 48V and 17.5Ah battery is housed in the downtube on the KKBike K26 S, and is unlockable and removable with an included key.The battery is built with LG cells and carries 840 Wh of capacity. That’s slightly above average for electric bikes these days, which often come with around 600-700 Wh of capacity.KKBike tells us that the battery is sufficient for 40-70 miles (64-112 km) of range, which is probably a bit on the optimistic end of the spectrum unless you’re pedaling pretty hard yourself. Using the included throttle will likely drain the battery much faster, especially at the bike’s higher speeds.Other standard components on the bike include a Shimano 8-speed transmission, LED lights, color LCD display, USB port in the display for charging a rider’s phone, and hydraulic disc brakes. The company also includes a set of plastic fenders, though they look like the flimsy kind that are often more trouble than they’re worth.Priced at $1,999, the KKBike K26 S comes in a fair bit cheaper than many other full-suspension fat-tire e-bikes we’ve seen before. In fact, the price is on par with several hard-tail fat-tire electric bikes we’ve covered.The market for full-suspension fat-tire bikes has been growing lately, with more riders seeking out the increased comfort that comes with dual suspension and high-volume tires like those on the KKBike K26 S.We’ve seen interesting additions to this space, such as the Wallke X2 Pro, which adds a folding mechanism into its full-suspension fat-tire e-bike frame.Aostirmotor’s S18 full-suspension fat tire e-bike may not fold, but we found it to offer an interesting design with a refreshing take on battery placement in the empty space of the front frame triangle.While full-suspension fat-tire electric bikes tend to be quite heavy, riders who don’t need to lift them into a vehicle or up a flight of stairs often find that the extra weight is canceled out by the e-bike’s extra power. As long as the battery doesn’t run out, operating the big bikes is still quite easy with the assistance of the e-bike’s motor.What do you think of the KKBike K26 S? Could you see yourself on a full-suspension fat tire electric bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in our comments section below this article.",ebikes
2022/09/06,"Yamaha is at it again with a new mid-drive motor for electric bikes, this time launching the updated Yamaha PWseries S2 drive unit. It’s everything you’d expect from a new motor update, with more power and torque in a smaller and lighter package.Yamaha described the motor as being developed with a “less is more” philosophy, focusing on dropping the size and weight of their previous motor.We only learned about Yamaha’s previously launched motor, the PW-ST drive unit, back in May of this year. That motor was unveiled as the powerhouse behind two new Yamaha gravel and fitness e-bikes.But now the company is already one-upping itself with the PW-S2 e-bike motor.The claimed 75 Nm of torque marks a modest 7% upgrade over the PW-ST motor. Perhaps more impressive, though, is that the increased torque comes with a 16% weight reduction, dropping the new motor to just 2.85 kg (6.28 pounds). The motor also takes up 20% less volume, meaning there’s less chunky motor mass to catch your eye.The company is understandably proud of the achievement.This highly desirable combination of increased output with reduced mass and a 20% decrease in volume ensures that the new PWseries S2 achieves one of the highest torque-to-weight ratios in the multi-role segment – giving strong, instant and user-friendly performance.Yamaha described the smaller dimensions of the PW-S2 drive unit as offering manufacturers more options and design freedom in creating new electric bike geometries.In addition to Yamaha’s own in-house electric bikes, the company also provides its electric bike drive systems to other OEMs that design and manufacturer e-bikes around Yamaha’s power trains.As the company continued:From an aesthetic point of view the reduced size of the PWseries S2 drive unit also offers Yamaha’s partner bike manufacturers the opportunity to achieve a clean and minimalist look when designing the next generation of Sport and Trail models.It’s not just the hardware that gets an upgrade. In addition to the motor getting smaller, lighter, and stronger, it’s also becoming smarter.The new PW-S2 motor has what is known as Automatic Support Mode, which relies on an array of sensors to help the drive unit automatically select the proper assistance mode for various points in a ride.As the company elaborated:It’s no simple feat to shift gears, adjust seat height, and change ride modes at roughly the same time. The Automatic Support Mode for the PWseries S2 selects the right amount of assist based on riding conditions. Whether you’re starting from a stop, accelerating, braking, riding on a level surface, or climbing a hill, you can leave ride mode changes to the system and focus on shifting and braking.The new Yamaha PW-S2 drive unit is expected to roll out on a number of 2023 model year electric bikes, both from Yamaha itself and other manufacturers that rely on Yamaha’s power trains.While we wait to see which e-bikes eventually get the new hardware, let’s hear your thoughts on the new motor system.

2022/09/06,"I’ve been eyeing the Zugo Rhino electric bike for a while now, especially the version in that trippy color-changing indigo paint job. I finally got the chance to test out not one but two of them when the company let me put some good honest miles on the step-over and step-through variants of the Zugo Rhino.Having spent some fun saddle time on both of them, I can tell you that the bikes give you exactly the type of ride you’d expect just from looking at them – a powerful and fun joyride that is somehow equal parts relaxing and exciting.A big part of the mix of a laid back and yet exciting ride comes from the combination of performance and comfort.With a powerful motor and nice big battery, the Zugo Rhino electric bike has plenty of acceleration, speed, and range. But when you add in the tall bars and long bench seat, you get a bike that is just as comfortable as it is brawny. Those two attributes combine beautifully into a ride that will have you picking the bugs from your teeth after smiling ear from ear.See what I mean from ride video below, where I tested the Zugo Rhinos on some fun cruises. Then read on for my full thoughts.It only takes one look to get a perfect idea of what this e-bike is designed for; this is a moped-style electric bike, through and through. Many people would call this a Super73-inspired e-bike, though of course there are many electric bikes that have since co-opted similar mini-bike stylings that harkens back to the golden age of mopeds, but I would say that the fact that there is both a step-through and a step-over version of the Zugo Rhino is a big advantage.Gone are the days of step-throughs being considered “girl’s bikes.” I actually really like the step-through version as it’s easier to mount and dismount, making it a more comfortable bike. But if you want top tank style moped vibes, the step-over is the bike for you.Both have the same parts and performance, with the single exception of the step-over having a built-in cup holder.The Zugo Rhinos both quickly and easily get up to 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle-only operation, though they are just as much fun to operate by pedal assist. Some moped-style e-bikes can be tricky to pedal, but the Zugo Rhino feels surprisingly comfortable. I’ll call out an e-bike that isn’t comfortable to pedal, but this isn’t one of them. I brought a couple friends with me to try the bikes to confirm, and everyone basically came to the same conclusion: Even though the saddle isn’t adjustable, you just kind of scoot forwards or backwards on the long and comfortable bench seat until you find your sweet spot. We were all between 5’7″ to 5’11”, and I guess I need to find some taller friends, but everyone I asked seemed pretty happy pedaling the bikes. They say that the bikes fit riders up to 6’5″, but I’m pretty sure you aren’t going to feel as good pedaling if you’re right up at the edge of the height limit – just sitting on the bike though and throttling around should be more than fine.The bars also have a bit of up and down height adjustment, though they’re already quite high compared to many other lower bar moped-style electric bikes.The 7-speed Shimano gearing definitely helps make the bikes pedalable, at least with the pedal assist engaged. But if the battery ever runs out, lord help you. You could pedal the bikes with a dead battery, but it’s going to be a serious workout if you want to go faster than about 6 or 7 mph for any extended amount of time. With the big ol’ 750Wh or 1,000Wh battery options, the good news is that you’re not likely to face that scenario very often. The big batteries store a lot of energy, so you should be good to go for a while.There’s also a faster 5A charger option, which is nice for these big batteries that can take a while to charge on a lower power charger. If you don’t need to recharge quickly and get back out in just a few hours, the stock charger is fine. But if you want a couple hour recharge from 20-80% or so, the quick charger option will be your best friend.In terms of speed, you’ll find that the bikes come in Class 2 mode, meaning 20 mph.If you really want to go faster than 20 mph, it’s doable. The bikes can be unlocked up to 28 mph (45 km/h), but that’s on you – out of the box they’ll be set as Class 2 e-bikes that don’t provide any extra assist above 20 mph.When riding with friends, I found the 20 mph limit to be just fine, though commuter use when you’re trying to fly fast through the city will benefit from the higher speed setting.As both a recreational and utility-style electric bike, the Zugo Rhino feels like a winner. The ability to carry a second passenger behind you with the included foot pegs is a major advantage of these moped-style electric bikes.The add-on rear rack gives you the ability to strap cargo directly the back of the bike, or to add your own box or locking trunk for some serious cargo capacity.Then there are all the other accessories like mirrors, horns/alarms, electric tire inflators, you name it! You can really deck the bike out just the way you want it. There’s not much I can complain about here; even the 65 lb (30 kg) or so bike weight feels reasonable for such a big bike. Sliding the battery out makes it even easier to lift into the back of a car or van, which I did twice to get to some nice riding locations. And speaking of sliding out the locking battery, I even like how there are those side panels that cover the battery and hide it from view, further improving the bike’s styling.There’s just a lot going on here. Powerful hydraulic brakes, programmable speed, strong acceleration, comfortable pedaling, upright and relaxed ride style, and one of the coolest paint jobs I’ve seen yet.For $1,999 (the current sale price), you really can’t go wrong with the Zugo Rhino!",ebikes
2022/09/02,"Electric bicycles are one of the most fun and effective alternative transportation methods in existence. And this Labor Day you can save big on a new electric bicycle from many of the leading manufacturers. Summer may be coming to a close, but it’s not over yet! Check out these awesome e-bike deals to get rolling on your own electric bicycle at a steep discount!Be sure to keep checking back, too. We’ll be updating the list as more sales pop up over the holiday weekend!Rad Power Bikes is the largest electric bicycle company in the US, and for good reason. They have a huge selection of e-bikes at modest prices, and they have an equally huge team of Rad employees working service and support.The company is currently running two key sales.The first is for one of my favorite models, and an e-bike that is one of my daily riders. It’s the RadMission, an urban-focused metro e-bike. The 500W motor and 500Wh battery offer a striking balance between performance and cost.At 20 mph on throttle or pedal assist, this single-speed e-bike is great for slicing through the city quickly. It only weighs 44 pounds (20 kg), making it great for anyone that has to carry it up the steps to their apartment.The RadMission is normally priced at $1,199 but is currently on sale for $899. That’s 300 buckeroos of savings! Having reviewed this e-bike extensively (including taking it off-road in riding it wasn’t meant for), I can tell you this e-bike is a real winner.If you’re into a more capable urban e-bike with more power, more battery capacity, more gears, and added suspension, check out the RadCity 4. It’s currently on sale for $1,399, marked down from $1,599. I’ve reviewed that model too, and it’s an awesome choice for those that want more e-bike than the RadMission offers.Juiced is known for making higher power and higher speed e-bikes that start to push the limits of what you might expect from a typical electric bicycle.The company is running so many sales that it’d probably be easier to tell you which bikes aren’t on sale.Here’s a list of their models with all of the sales, which range from $100-$400 off various models.If you asked me for some guidance, I’d steer you toward one of the Scorpion variants if you’re after a moped-feel or the RipRacer if you want a smaller but still quite capable e-bike.The company also has a number of interesting commuter e-bikes and full-size fat tire e-bikes, so there’s something for everyone.If you’ve been hoping to grab an affordable folding electric bike from Lectric eBikes, then now is the time. You can save up to $170 with the company’s Labor Day sales bundles.The bundles combine the company’s popular electric bikes with a pile of awesome accessories.The best savings are on the higher-end Lectric XPremium e-bike with the mid-drive motor and hydraulic disc brakes. But you can still save $100 or more on the company’s more affordable e-bikes.This is a great chance to get some extra gear with your Lectrix XP 2.0 or Lectric XP Lite!If you ask me, Aventon falls somewhere in between Juiced and Rad, both listed above, when it comes to performance and power. The bikes can reach fast speeds and higher power levels, but aren’t quite as over the top as Juiced’s models.Where Aventon beats both companies is in frame production quality and bike connectivity. Aventon has been pushing out new models with the company’s updated e-bike display, which is a thing of beauty. It also connects to riders’ smartphones via Bluetooth for the ultimate level of connectivity.As far as sales go, Aventon is offering between $50-$150 off for every single e-bike model it offers! Some specific model variants even have higher discounts than that. The company is also offering 20% off accessories, so this could be a good time to grab a rack, fenders, or some other accessory you’ve been eyeing for the Aventon e-bike you already own. The sale runs from September 2-5, so don’t miss it!Blix recently launched its Blix Dubbel electric bike, a really awesome step-through utility bike that is designed to combine power, speed, and utility. A big rear rack area does double duty as space for a passenger or for cargo, and two batteries combine to offer 80 miles of range!The passenger kit makes this a great way to carry two people on a single bike (get it, Dubbel?) and really ratchets up the car-replacing potential of this fun-looking e-bike.For a limited time they’ve got it marked down $100 to $1,899.Ride1Up has some of the best bang for your buck in the entire e-bike industry right now, offering great quality e-bikes at reasonable prices every day. But now they’re dropping those prices to… even more reasonable levels? I guess so, based on the Labor Day sales they are currently running.The Ride1Up 700 Series is up to $250 off while the Ride1Up LMT’D is up to $200 off, depending on the color and frame style.I’ve reviewed both of these e-bikes and they are a blast! The 700 series is the ultimate commuter e-bike that is fast and fun, while the Ride1Up LMT’D offers a bit more playful riding that is still great for the city.Both are worth checking out!Propella, the maker of lightweight urban e-bikes that stick with a tried-and-true blue-on-black color scheme, is running a $300 off sale on their Propella 7s e-bike.Dropping from $1,299 to $999, the Propella 7s takes all the best parts of the single-speed Propella, but adds a 7-speed transmission to give you a choice of gears. That’s great for anyone who lives in a hilly city and doesn’t want to be stuck in a single gear ratio.The sale runs through September 5, but it looks like you’ll have to subscribe to the company’s newsletter to receive the discount. Just visit the product page and look for the note about the sale above the newsletter signup link.Biktrix, our Canadian neighbors to the north, are also getting in on Labor Day sales. The company ships both to US and Canadian customers, offering a huge selection of all sorts of e-bike styles and varieties.They’ve got a page dedicated to Labor Day e-bike sales, and you’ll want to check out the huge savings of up to $1,700 (that’s not a typo) on the various models.Bikes like the Stunner and Swift offer high power in seemingly normal e-bike packages, while other models look more aggressive for even more fun riding.Velotric’s Discover 1 e-bike has a huge sale going on, marked down from $1,899 to just $1,299.This 500W comfort commuter e-bike offers a step-through design, a 500W motor, and up to a 60-mile range from a 690 Wh battery.It even includes a fender set, rack, and LED lights, making it a great option for commuters looking to get out of their car and onto an e-bike!And don’t forget about electric scooters! Miami-based Fluidfreeride is one of my absolute favorite electric scooter sources, and they have some great Labor Day sales on a variety of electric scooters.Use the code LABORDAY10 to get 10% off electric scooters across the site. Take a look at their accessories too, because there are some great bundles and sales there as well to get free accessories with your new electric scooter.If you’re looking for suggestions, I’m loving the specs on their lightweight Mosquito electric scooter that they launched earlier this year. I haven’t tried it yet, but it looks perfect for urban commuters that don’t want to sacrifice speed on a lightweight scooter.Fluidfreeride is also a great source for Apollo’s Canadian electric scooters, as Fluidfreeride stocks them in the US.",ebikes
2022/08/31,"I’ve had the pleasure of testing a wide range of interesting non-car electric vehicles. From three-wheeled Fun Utility Vehicles that can hit 75 mph to flying electric boats to Harley-Davidson’s flagship electric motorcycle, it’s been a wild few years.But this summer has been especially jam-packed with fun electric vehicles ranging from electric watercraft to e-bikes and long range electric motorcycles. These are the top five wildest EVs that I’ve tested this summer.The Candela C-8 almost sounds like the idea of an excited child who doesn’t know the technical limits of vehicles.“So it’s like, a boat, right? But no gasoline, it runs on batteries. And it has to go fast. But also far. Oh yeah, and it doesn’t go in the water — it flies above the water. Put a toilet in it too!”If you try to explain it to someone, they probably wouldn’t even believe you. But as soon as you see it, you’re just in awe. The Candela C-8 is the answer to expensive electric boats that typically require a massive battery and super powerful electric motor to overcome the inefficiencies of water travel. The boat uses hydrofoils (basically underwater airplane wings) to lift the hull right out of the water. That uses up to 80% less energy, meaning you can get by with smaller motors and batteries, and thus a cheaper boat.It’s still super expensive, to the tune of €300,000+, but that’s because you also get a lot of boat for your money. The carbon fiber Candela C-8 hits speeds of up to 30 knots, includes luxury features like a day bed and cabin to sleep two adults and two kids, and can even be outfitted with a marine shower or toilet. Then of course there’s the whole flying thing, which makes the ride super smooth. I suffer from seasickness on most boats, but I felt much better on the Candela C-8 because it doesn’t rock in the waves and rather flies above them. I was even able to fly right through the large wake turned up by passing cruise ships in the waterways around Stockholm. The C-8 just soared right through it as if the sea was flat.The computer-controlled flight characteristics constantly adjust to keep the boat flying straight and smooth, and the boat can even steer hard into turns while staying up above the water. It’s a wild experience that you’ll need to see to believe. Check out my review video below.The Italian electric motorcycle company Energica is known for envelope-pushing electric motorcycles. They’ve been the sole supplier of 150+ mph (240+ km/h) racing electric motorcycles for the FIM MotoE racing series for years, after all.But the company’s unveiling of the Energica Experia sport touring bike took the company in a bold new direction. Sure, it’s still fast and powerful to the tune of a 75 kW peak-rated motor and a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph).It’s rare that I need to go faster than that, so it does the trick. But the real takeaway is the ultra-efficient ride paired with the massive 22.5 kWh battery for extra long range.The bike is also the most comfortable of all the different Energica electric motorcycles I’ve tried. As much as I enjoyed riding the sporty Ribelle bike, my previous favorite model was Energica’s EsseEsse9. But that was until I rode the Experia in Italy this summer, winding through the mountain roads of the Dolomites and quickly falling in love with my new favorite Energica.The relaxed riding position, included windscreen, lower pegs, and comfortably raised bars make the bike perfect for longer rides. That’s especially good since the battery can last for up to 420 km (261 miles) in the city or 209 km (130 miles) on the highway.So this one requires a brief backstory. I write a fun, tongue-in-cheek weekly column here on Electrek where I find funny and odd electric vehicles on China’s largest shopping platform, Alibaba, then try to humorously describe what they could be good for.I found this cheap electric pickup truck that is sort of 5/8 scale to a normal pickup truck. It was just $2,000 and I knew I had to have it. So I bought one and imported it from China. It ended up costing a lot more once I added accessories, paid for shipping, and then got bent over a shipping container by customs brokers. But it was totally worth it.Ever since, the thing has turned into a bit of an internet celebrity. Across the several articles and videos I’ve made on the thing, it’s amassed somewhere around 15 million views and counting. Apparently a lot of people wanted to see my electric mini-truck.I’ve been testing it around my parents 10-acre property, which is the perfect fit for it since it is technically not street legal for on-road use in the US. Around their ranch it is mostly used for utility tasks like hauling top soil, moving pallets, making mail runs, and other daily chores.The little thing barely goes 25 mph and has a pint-sized 3,000 watt (4 hp) motor. But it is torquey as hell, which it proved by towing my parents’ 1,800 kg (4,000 lb.) van, despite weighing around a fifth of that.It even has a hydraulic dumping bed, which has been great for yard waste dumps and spreading top soil in planting areas.With a rear view camera, air conditioning, seatbelt (just the one, even though it’s a two-seater), sun roof, and cargo rack, the thing is surprisingly well equipped. It’s been a blast to own and is hands down one of my favorite purchases ever.A post shared by Micah Toll (@themicahtoll)These days it’s starting to seem like most new e-bikes are just copies of each other.Since many companies rely on the same OEMs to produce the same frames, and then outfit them with the same motors and batteries, many e-bikes actually are nearly identical copies.But the Fucare Gemini X was one of those rare e-bikes that went a totally new direction with an interesting frame design.The trellis-style frame doesn’t just make for a neat-looking ride, it also created a perfect place to mount the battery in a protected pocket in the frame. There’s even a second battery mounted in the rear of the frame to double the range up to 130 km (80 miles).For $1,799, it costs a pretty penny. But you’re getting those dual batteries, a fast top speed of 45 km/h (28 mph), hydraulic disc brakes, a bright and easy-to-read screen, included rack and fenders, built-in LED lighting, and a bunch more.I’ve ridden a ton of great electric bikes this summer, but the Fucare Gemini X tickled a serious itch I had for something new and sexy.This is another one of those, “you’ve got to try it to believe it” kind of rides.At around €12,000, it’s unfortunately going to be hard for most people to try it. But short of that, check out my video below and then take my word for it: These are some of the most awesome electric surfboards in existence.They can go well over 50 km/h (30 mph) and a skilled rider can perform all sorts of jumps, stunts, and more with them.I’m not exactly a skilled rider, but even in my first session I had a blast, easily mastering the beginner board and then making a fool of myself on the more advanced board.There’s a learning curve on their more advanced board and especially on their hydrofoil board, which rises out of the water so you’re surfing on a carbon fiber wing. With more time to practice, I’m sure the Vinga hydrofoil board from Awake would have been fun too. But even starting on the beginner board, these powerful and fast electric watercraft had me grinning ear to ear. In my opinion, they beat a jet ski since you can take them to the water in the back of your car instead of needing to tow a trailer. And of course you don’t have to worry about bringing a gas can for fuel or dealing with engine maintenance.This summer has been full of fun and wild electric vehicles from just about every category imaginable. Electric cars are nice and all, but the really fun stuff starts when you step outside of the four-wheeled box.I’m excited to see what else the industry can throw at us. Who knows? Maybe next year I’ll be back with a list that blows this one out of the water. Literally.",ebikes
2022/08/31,"Live in New York and want to buy an electric bike or e-scooter? A proposed e-bike incentive could cut the price in half, saving you over a thousand dollars with a purchase rebate.That’s the idea behind State Senator Julia Salazar’s bill, which would offset 50% of the purchase price of a new electric bicycle or electric scooter. The incentive would be capped at $1,100, meaning any e-bike over $2,200 would still only qualify for a rebate of $1,100.This marks major progress for New York, a state that only legalized e-bikes in NYC two years ago.The one paragraph bill creates what is referred to as the Ride Clean rebate and is modeled after the Drive Clean program for electric cars in the state that has operated for years.The bill is light on details and has no limitations based on area of residence or income level. Included in the rebate are class 1, 2, and 3 electric bicycles that can reach up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with up to 750 watts (1 hp) of power. Electric scooters are also listed as eligible, but no speed or power restrictions are noted for electric scooters. There is also no wording clarifying whether the incentive applies to standing electric scooters (like those used by shared mobility operators such as Bird) or Vespa-style seated electric scooters.The proposed New York rebate comes shortly after a proposed national e-bike tax credit was scrapped from the climate-focused policies included in the Inflation Reduction Act.As Senator Salazar explained:“When the federal government falls short it really does fall on the state to step up and take responsibility.” Vermont became the first state to offer a state-level electric bicycle purchase incentive, and New York could be next.The bill passed in the New York State Senate with a 60-3 vote, but stalled in the Assembly after getting stuck in committee since earlier this year. Some state politicians have expressed hope that the bill will progress in the next session, enjoying the same popular support it garnered when it flew through the State Senate.These are exactly the types of programs that states should be implementing. When the federal government can’t get it done, it should happen locally.Denver also undertook its own e-bike incentive that became massively popular, underscoring just how much demand there is for these types of local e-bike rebates.As someone who travels in my city almost exclusively by two wheels, I’m keenly aware of just how pivotal e-bikes and e-scooters are to changing the transportation landscape. Making them more affordable is the first step to getting drivers out of cars and onto more sustainable, more space efficient and healthier forms of transportation.When an e-bike costs several thousand dollars, it’s easy to ignore it as a viable option. But when that same e-bike gets its price cut in half, the equation is changed for so many more people. Rad Power Bike’s fanciest $1,999 electric bike is suddenly yours for under a thousand bucks. Or an already low-priced $799 Lectric XP Lite e-bike is in your garage for $400. That’s pretty amazing and seriously opens the door to lower income commuters that can’t afford higher e-bike costs.I’ve written extensively in the past about how easy it is to get out of the four-wheeled box and replace many of your local trips with e-bikes.And it’s not just e-bikes, either. Electric motorcycles. Electric mopeds. Electric scooters. Electric skateboards. I own them all and I use them all the time for my own personal transportation. Each one cost me a mere fraction of a Tesla or whatever fancy electric car you’re hearing about today. And each one of them gets me around the city faster, using less energy, for less money, and with a bigger smile on my face when I arrive. This can be you, too. And with more local incentive programs, that will become easier than ever.",ebikes
2022/08/30,"Blix has just launched a new cargo-friendly electric bicycle known as the Dubbel. It’s not just fun to say; it also looks like a fun ride with a long rear rack to carry your friends, kids, pets, or cargo on back.The Santa Cruz, California-based electric bicycle company is calling its Blix Dubbel a “motorcycle-inspired compact utility e-bike built for social adventures, family time, and practical utility use.”It may be motorcycle-inspired in terms of utility, but it still seems to embody the Dutch bike-like charm for which Blix has become famous. Except this time it has both a front cargo mount and a long rear bench to carry just about anything.Blix’s founder and CEO Pontus Malmberg described the Dubbel as fitting a diverse range of lifestyles and needs:Adding more activity and enjoyment into the day-to-day will be crucial for people’s wellbeing in the future. You need products that offer a really great experience for different lifestyles and needs; that combines functionality with compelling design and technology which work seamlessly in the everyday. That’s why we developed the Dubbel.The bike includes a rear 750W hub motor rated for 90 Nm of torque. The 20×3.3″ tires are smaller diameter than those found on most e-bikes, helping to further multiply that torque as well as lowering the bike’s center of gravity and standover height. The step-through design makes it even easier to mount, especially when you have something on the rear rack. There’s nothing worse than accidentally kicking your toddler in the face when trying to swing a leg over a bike.The Blix Dubbel can be put in either Class 2 or Class 3 mode. The former allows it to hit 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle only riding, while the latter offers speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist. The bike’s spec sheet indicates that throttle control up to 28 mph can also be enabled. That’s technically outside of the bounds of Class 3 e-bike designation that requires throttles to cut out at 20 mph, but it’s so awesome that I’m going to pretend like I didn’t notice.The bike also includes the Blix Connect platform that uses Bluetooth to connect to the Blix app and let riders modify parameters or switch e-bike modes from their phones.The bike comes with either one or two 48V 14Ah batteries, offering 672Wh or 1,344Wh of capacity. With the dual battery option, a range of up to 80 miles (130 km) is achievable. The 70 lb. e-bike (31.8 kg) gets 8 lb. (3.6 kg) heavier with the second battery, but the additional 40 miles (64 km) of range is likely worth it for some riders.The bike’s extended rear rack can be used for carrying cargo or adding an accessory bench seat for passengers. Foot pegs in the rear give passengers a convenient place to rest their feet while being shuttled around.The throttle control may be useful for getting rolling with a heavy cargo load or for lazy days, but the 8-speed Microshift transmission will give pedal riders plenty of options for finding the right pedaling gear.Zoom hydraulic disc brakes on 180mm rotors will bring the bike to a quick stop, and are especially important for a cargo e-bike rated for carrying 200 lb. (91 kg) of cargo. That cargo loading breakdown works out to 50 lb. (22 kg) on the front rack mounting points and another 150 lb. (68 kg) on the rear rack.The bike comes standard with LED lights, a full fender set, kickstand and mounting points for optional accessories, which also include the passenger package, cargo-carrying racks, and baskets.The bike comes in three somewhat uninspiring colors of Slate Grey, Bright White, and something called Nü Cream, which is apparently a nicer way to say “tan.” Available for pre-order now, the Blix Dubbel is expected to begin shipping in October. Full retail pricing will be $1,999 for the single battery model and $2,499 for the double battery model. Both e-bikes are currently enjoying a $100 discount for pre-orders placed on Blix’s website.Color me interested! I freakin’ love passenger-carrying electric bikes.If you guys know anything about me, it’s that I feel very strongly about the ability for electric bikes to become true car replacers, becoming a large percentage of the vehicles used in cities in the near future. Single-passenger trips make up the majority of most personal transportation, but two-passenger trips aren’t that far behind. An e-bike that can carry an adult or a couple of kids on back is a game-changer when it comes to utility. I’ve ridden Blix’s cargo e-bikes before, even carrying a few kids on the back, but the Blix Dubbel is a smaller format bike that looks just as capable in a more convenient package.When you add in the Class 3 speeds of 28 mph, the high-quality brakes and nice Microshift transmission here, plus that ultra-long range from the double battery option, the Dubbel is looking like an incredible option for a do-everything utility e-bike. I’ve long been a RadRunner e-bike fan, but the Dubbel looks like what the RadRunner would be after it hit puberty.The one bummer here is the lack of a suspension fork. I get the decision there though. For a cargo e-bike, you either have to have a really high-quality suspension fork (i.e., expensive), or you forgo it in favor of a good but less expensive rigid fork that can withstand the load. And in this case, the 3.3-inch tires are fat enough that they’ll do a decent job of faux-suspension by themselves.All in all, I’d call this a serious win for Blix.",ebikes
2022/08/29,"FLX Bike has a new electric mountain bike coming. The company has shown off a glimpse of test riding on the FLX Weapon X, seen below.So far we have only minimal tech specs for the bike, but what we know points to the Weapon X being a high-performance carbon fiber electric mountain bike.The motor looks like a Bafang M600, which is known to offer speeds of at least 28 mph (45 km/h).That motor can be outfitted for Class 3 specs in the US, meaning it would reach that 28 mph speed on pedal assist alone. The motor can also be unlocked to reach that speed or higher on throttle control as well, which would technically put it outside the bounds of Class 3 designation for street-legal use.Of course in true electric mountain bike fashion, street legal status isn’t a primary concern for many riders — though public trail rules should of course be respected.Graphics on the pre-launch page show an 840 Wh rating for the frame-integrated and removable battery, which would be well above average for battery capacity in the electric mountain bike industry.There’s no telling yet what top speed FLX has planned for the Weapon X, or whether or not the bike will feature a throttle in addition to pedal-assist riding.The company has released a promo video, seen below, showing off a combination of computer renders and riding footage with a prototype FLX Weapon X. We can make out what appears to be a Fox suspension fork and DVO rear shock, but there isn’t enough detail to determine the transmission components. No throttle can be seen on the handlebars of the prototype bike.While FLX offers several other high-performance electric bikes with throttles, going throttle-less wouldn’t be new territory for the company. The popular FLX Babymaker 2, which was released earlier this year, is also a pedal-assist-only e-bike that has seen massive interest, especially from newcomers to the e-bike industry.I’ve been testing a Babymaker 2 for the last few weeks and will have a review on that bike shortly, though the preview is that it’s an awesome and lightweight ride that doesn’t leave me missing a throttle at all.The original FLX Weapon and higher-spec Weapon X were originally teased in early 2021, though production appears to have stalled. This new prototype testing video may indicate that production plans have picked back up and that a launch could be imminent.There’s no word yet on a release date or estimated pricing for the FLX Weapon X, but it will be compete against a wide range of other eMTBs in the category.In addition to the usual suspects of high-end electric mountain bikes, several companies are now offering modestly-priced high performance electric mountain bikes in the US.The Luna X2 uses a heavily modified Bafang M600 motor wrapped in a carbon fiber full-suspension frame, offering up to 2,500 watts of power. That bike sold out immediately upon launch, even with a hefty price tag of $4,200. And that wasn’t even Luna’s first shot at high-end electric mountain bikes.FREY Bike has also produced mid-level priced e-bikes with high-level performance and parts. The company has several models that compete with Luna’s higher end electric mountain bikes, but also just released a new lower cost line known as EVOLVE.The $2,890 EVOLVE NEO uses a Bafang M510 motor to reach 25 mph (40 km/h) and still includes high-quality components from brands like SRAM, Magura, and RockShox.",ebikes
2022/08/26,"California-based electric motorbike maker ONYX, famous for its retro-themed high-power electric mopeds, has just unveiled the ONYX LZR. Available with two different motor options, the ONYX LZR combines the rugged design of dirt jumpers with the power and speed of street-focused electric bikes.We see new electric bike launches all the time. But this isn’t like any other e-bike unveiling we’ve covered recently.The ONYX LZR cuts no corners when it comes to design and manufacturing. A 6061 aluminum frame with Smooth Weld Additive Technology (SWAT) creates ultra smooth weld joints with precision frame tube alignment.100mm of adjustable front suspension for comfort combines with BMX dirt jump hubs for ruggedness, creating an e-bike that can handle flying off a 6-foot kicker in a jump park or a 6-foot loading dock in the city.The duality of the bike highlights ONYX’s design legacy, which began with its ONYX RCR electric moped that lived a double life as an off-road scrambler and an on-road urban runabout. The woodgrain inlay around the minimalist top-tube display also creates a subtle throwback to ONYX’s wood-focused moped history.The ONYX LZR features a 500W Dark Matter mid-drive motor that peaks at 615W, offering a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). The ONYX LZR Pro has a more powerful 900W Bafang M600 mid-drive offering 1,050 peak watts and a top speed of 30+ mph (48+ km/h). Neither models comes with a throttle, as these are pedal-assisted e-bikes designed for a true riding experience – not motorcycles with pedals.Both bikes include a frame-integrated 504Wh battery and provide between 30-70 miles (48-120 km) of range, depending on the mode of pedal assist selected.The two ONYX LZR e-bikes were designed to offer high performance without compromising critical bike geometry that is important for true pro-riding. In fact, ONYX has been undergoing trials with professional riders for weeks, pushing the LZR hard in gravity defying dirt jumps and tough urban sessions with everything from stair hops to wall riding.Check out the one-minute launch video below to see what the bike is capable of, at least in the hands of a professional rider.ONYX is also preparing rider teams as well, expanding their role past just a design and manufacturing company.The goal wasn’t just to build a new e-bike with power or speed, but to build an e-bike that could actually ride as hard as it looks like it should.The ONYX LZR has an MSRP of $2,799 but is available now for pre-order at just $1,999. The higher performance LZR PRO has an MSRP of $3,399 and is available for pre-order at just $2,799.Both of those pre-order promotions are only available for the first 100 units of each model, so you probably shouldn’t dawdle if you want to see one of these in your garage at that price. I’m still kicking myself for not buying one of the first RCRs when I covered ONYX’s launch in 2018, as the RCR launched at less than half of its current price (though to be fair, four years and one global pandemic have passed in that time).The new launch also marks the return of Tim Seward to ONYX. Seward’s design skills have earned him rockstar status in the modern moped design world. He was actually the original designer of the ONYX RCR when it launched way back in 2018. Seward more recently worked for Bird heading up the design of their two-wheeled vehicles before heading home to once again lead design in the company he founded. “Bird would never have accepted this type of product,” Seward explained to Electrek. “But I think this is exactly the direction the industry needs to go.” He continued by saying that he felt electric bicycles simply haven’t progressed over the last few years, resulting in a stagnant market full of many of the same renditions from multiple companies. “This is an opener for a new era of ONYX,” Seward  continued, explaining that the company’s future wasn’t only limited to electric bicycles, and seeming to hint (in my opinion) that other styles of products could be in the works as well.For now though, the ONYX LZR and LZR Pro are certainly the story of the day, showing that ONYX isn’t limiting itself only to electric mopeds like those it recently released. Now the company has hardcore pro-riding electric bikes squarely in its sights.",ebikes
2022/08/25,"DIY solar power projects have always been fascinating to me. I kind of wrote the book on the subject. And since electric bikes have always been a huge part of my life, combining the two has always seemed inevitable. And so with a pair of solar panels and one afternoon to kill, I rigged up a simple solar-powered electric bicycle setup that is easy to build. If you’ve ever wanted to build your own solar e-bike, hopefully this guide can show you how easy it can be!I’ll admit that I had a bit of an ulterior motive for this project. A bigger project I’m currently planning is to add a solar panel onto the roof of my electric mini-pickup truck. The goal will be to offset its daily usage with a solar trickle charger.To plan for that, I used many of the parts first on a smaller electric vehicle: an electric bicycle. I filmed the project as well, if you want to check out my video to follow along.This build was a bit of an exercise to see what is possible, as the end result is likely a bit bulky for many people to use for their e-bike on a daily basis. While some people actual go on long touring rides with solar e-bikes lined with big solar panels, this might be a bit more than the average rider wants to carry around.I also covered the baskets on the front and back of my Lectric XP 2.0 e-bike outfitted with the cargo package, and most people would likely want to add some type of hinge to the panels so they don’t completely block their baskets. But enough with the caveats, let’s get down to business.For solar panels, I actually got two different Renogy 50W panels. I wanted to test the differences, so I chose one flexible panel and one rigid panel.The flexible panel is slightly wider and longer, but is actually less than half of the weight despite the larger footprint.I was able to mount the rigid panel directly to the front basket, but I prepared a particle board support for the flexible panel on the rear so it wouldn’t flop too much during riding and damage the panel.Both panels were easy enough to affix directly to the cargo package on my Lectric XP 2.0 e-bike. If your e-bike doesn’t have front and rear racks, you’ll likely have to get creative when you plan your solar e-bike.I used some two-core 16AWG wire (probably overkill) and a set of MC-4 solar connectors to wire up the panels and connect them to my charge controller.The charge controller is a 400W MPPT unit that can be programmed to the correct output voltage (in this case 54.6V for a 48V 13s e-bike battery). I got mine for about $75 from Grin Technology in Canada. You can find the same one for half the price if you don’t mind waiting a couple weeks for shipping from China for your solar e-bike project.Credit for the suggestion to use this charge controller goes to another neat solar-charging electric bike project I featured recently.I have the phone holder accessory from Lectric eBikes on my handlebars, and it was the perfect size to mount the charge controller. I thought that would make it possible to read the charge controller’s screen while riding, but the screen is so hard to make out in direct sunlight that it’s really only readable when I’m stopped in the shade or can use my hands to block the sun on the screen.With the panels wired into the charge controller’s input and a DC barrel connector wired into the charge controller’s output, I simply plugged the barrel connector into the e-bike’s charge port and the battery began charging as soon as I rolled into the sun. And with that, I had my very own DIY solar e-bike!Many e-bikes like the Lectric XP 2.0 can operate while the battery is also charging, but not all e-bikes have this feature. You’ll want to check to see if your e-bike can do this before starting out on this project. But since mine can, the setup simply starts charging as soon as I hit the sun, and the panels stop charging the battery whenever I pull back into the garage (or when a big cloud covers the sun).Power output is variable, but I’ve found that in midday summer sun I can get nearly 80-85 watts from the pair of 50W panels, which is actually quite good performance. That’s not enough to offer unlimited range, since I’m draining the battery by around 350-700 watts on average depending on how hard I’m riding.But with eight hours or so of Florida sun, it’s reasonable to expect a nearly full recharge of the 500Wh battery each day. Of course that would require the bike being parked outside all day, which it often isn’t. But then again, this project was also partly an exercise to see what was possible.And with a pair of solar panels and an afternoon, it’s definitely possible to setup a simple solar charging rig for an e-bike or any other light electric vehicle.Now just wait until I transfer this setup over to my mini electric pickup truck!",ebikes
2022/08/23,"It sure looks that way, thanks to several new photos posted on the brand’s social media accounts showing what appears to be a Volcon-branded electric bike called the Volcon Brat.The electric bike seen in the images takes on what we often refer to as “Super73 styling,” named after the electric bike company that helped launch the iconic moped-style electric bike several years ago.Major design aspects that are common across these types of moped-style electric bicycles are 20″ fat tires, long bench seats, big headlights, relaxed riding positions, and motorcycle-inspired design cues such as batteries or compartments disguised as gas tanks.The bike shown off in Volcon’s images appears to check all of these boxes and more, as you can see in the image below.The image shows a pair of Volcon-badged electric bikes that feature full suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, and multi-speed pedal drivetrains, in addition to a rear hub motor and large central battery.Volcon of course got its start with the launch of the Volcon Grunt, a fat tire off-road electric motorcycle. We haven’t heard much about an upcoming electric bicycle launch, but digging through the company’s last investor presentation reveals that Volcon has e-bike ambitions set for next year.There’s an e-bike listed in the presentation as the “Volcon Brat” with a 2023 model year designation, meaning we could see it debuted late this year or early next year.The design of the bike matches the one seen in the photograph above, showing that these are likely production prototypes of the Volcon Brat electric bike.The bike is listed as featuring a 750W motor that peaks at 1,200W.A top speed of either 20 or 28 mph (32 or 45 km/h) would keep it legal as a class 2 or 3 electric bike in the US, allowing on-road use.There’s no info about the battery’s capacity, unless the “750W battery” is a typo that should have been “750Wh battery.” A range of up to 30 miles (48 km) is listed, indicating that the battery will be fairly large, likely in the 48V 15Ah or higher ballpark. The psuedo-tank on the top tube appears to be designed as a storage compartment and may also house the USB port that is intended to charge the rider’s phone.There’s no info yet on pricing or production, but those are likely the two main questions on most future riders’ minds. Volcon famously produces its Grunt electric motorcycles in Texas, though that would be a tall order for the electric bicycle as well.Very few companies produce electric bicycles in the US. Instead, most rely on overseas production largely from China or other Asian countries that specialize in electric bicycle manufacturing.However, Volcon could stand to join the ranks of the few companies actually building electric bikes on US soil. If so, that would likely be a major marketing win for the company when it inevitably attempts to snatch up market share in an industry that is already crowded with plenty of other moped-style electric bicycle offerings.What do you think of the Volcon Brat design? Could you see yourself cruising your local roads on one of these? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/08/22,"Ooh la la! France will now pay you €4,000 (nearly US $4,000) to swap your old polluting car for a cleaner, more efficient, and more city-appropriate electric bicycle. That marks a major increase in the incentive designed to improve French cities.Pedal bicycles are also included in the generous incentive package, though e-bikes are contributing to one of the biggest jumps in cycling ever across Europe and much of the world.As reported by The Times, the full €4,000 incentive is awarded to those in lower income brackets that live in low-emission urban zones. Wealthier two-wheel converts will receive a reduced incentive commensurate with their income level. For those looking to buy a new electric bike but not ready to give up their polluting car, a subsidy of up to €400 is available.Some cities have even more generous electric bicycle subsidies. The Socialist-Green council of Paris offers up to €500 toward the purchase of an e-bike or a folding pedal bike. France is working hard to push urban drivers out of cars and towards smaller and more environmentally responsible forms of transportation. In large cities like Paris, reduction in traffic from a switch to bicycles and scooters is perhaps just as important to many residents as the environmental effects.We recently covered the case of an electric bicycle company that is switching from vans to cargo e-bikes to increase the number of electric bikes it could deliver each day. The company’s delivery vans were simply too slow in Paris traffic, and switching to cargo e-bikes will help ramp up deliveries by using smaller, quicker, and more efficient vehicles.In a city like Paris, such e-bike deliveries are proving easier and easier. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has taken an aggressive approach to making the city friendlier to cyclists, pedestrians, and basically every form of alternative transportation.It’s a move that is becoming more common in cities around the world as residents demand more accessible urban planning.The concept of walkable cities that are designed to prioritize the mobility of people over cars has led to calls for changes across much of Europe and the US. In many cases that means repurposing car lanes and on-street parking into dedicated lanes for public transportation or bike lanes, as well as expanding sidewalks and pedestrian streets.Many cities are banning cars in downtown areas or introducing congestion pricing to disincentivize driving in the most crowded urban areas.Europe has also taken a lead in government-sponsored incentives for commuters to switch to two-wheeled vehicle as a way to de-emphasize the roles of cars in cities. Some countries have begun offering tax incentives that essentially pay citizens to cycle to work instead of using a car.Belgium recently made headlines when it increased its bike-to-work incentive to €0.25 per kilometer (approximately US $0.45 per mile), according to the Light Electric Vehicle Association.But Belgium isn’t alone in offering cash in exchange for pedaling to work. The Netherlands offers nearly as much, and the UK offers even more. A mileage allowance of around USD $0.26 per mile is available to British cyclists who use their bikes to commute to work, according to the World Economic Forum.The UK also offers a lease-to-own incentive program that rewards cyclists with discounted bikes and cycling gear.",ebikes
2022/08/21,"Newport Beach, California-based Electric Bike Company has just launched its long-awaited folding e-bike model, known as the Model F. The folder embodies much of the same cruiser vibes and design ethos of the company’s larger e-bikes but in a smaller and more portable package.And just like the rest of the company’s e-bikes, it is built right in Southern California before being shipped fully assembled to customers.The Model F features a low step-through frame and 24″ wheels, which strike a compromise between larger 26″ cruiser wheels and the smaller 20″ wheels we often see on most folding electric bikes.The 3″ wide tires are also a compromise between cushier fat tires and narrower street tires, falling more in the balloon tire category than true fat tires. The smaller diameter tires make the bike a bit more compact when folded but are still large enough to give a more typical cruiser-like ride. The Model F’s hydroformed aluminum frame includes a front suspension fork and uses an integrated battery secured into the downtube. The battery can be locked in place and charged on the bike or unlocked to remove for charging separately. The company claims a maximum range of 50 miles (80 km) from the battery when using pedal assist.Riders that instead rely on the throttle to reach higher speeds without pedaling won’t hit the same 50-mile range but should still likely garner at least half of that figure.With a 750W motor and a top speed of 25 mph (40 km/h), riders pushing hard on the throttle will have some good power and speed at their fingertips.Also at their fingertips are a pair of comfort brake levers connected to hydraulic disc brakes for powerful stopping performance. To get back up to speed, the single-speed pedal drivetrain uses a massive 58T chainring, ensuring the ability to pedal even at top speed.Just like Electric Bike Company’s other models, the new folder comes with vegan leather grips, a wide comfort saddle that embodies the company’s cruiser bike vibes, a color LCD, LED lighting in the front and rear of the bike, corrosion-resistant hardware all over the bike, and an adjustable handlebar stem.The bike is priced at $1,799 and currently comes in three colors: white, red, and black. But Electric Bike Company is famous for its nearly limitless paint color options, thanks to operating its own paint facility in Southern California, so we wouldn’t be surprised to see more colors offered soon. A post shared by Electric Bike Company (@electricbikecompany)I visited the company over the winter and got to see the paint shop firsthand, taking a stab at painting my own Tweety yellow bike frame. I was also able to tour the company’s multiple factories in Newport Beach, meeting the team that actually builds the bikes and getting a better idea of what goes into building these quality electric cruiser bikes.The cherry on top of the trip was getting to test out a few different models, including the more economical Model E and the easily accessible Model Y.You can check out my tour of the company’s e-bike factory in my video below to see how these awesome e-bikes get the local treatment.",ebikes
2022/08/19,"Electric bicycles aren’t just for leisure or commuting, they also make great work tools for commercial applications. And more police departments are now waking up to the fact that light electric two-wheelers can be a huge advantage compared to typical police cruisers.That doesn’t mean police departments aren’t still exploring larger vehicles as well, but electric bikes and other light EVs are proving to be a popular choice for cops on the move.And it makes sense, as there are plenty of reasons why electric bikes actually make better patrol vehicles to supplement a police force’s standard cruiser fleet.Electric bikes are more quickly deployable than police cruisers, and their low cost means there can be more of them on the streets in more places.That allows police officers to respond to calls more quickly.The Menlo Park Police Department recently added to their force Pedego electric bikes outfitted with a police package. The bikes have already proven useful for catching criminals.As the local Pedego dealer Jeff Scanlan explained:Just last week, one of the patrol officers using our e-bike came into the store and shared a story of him catching a bike thief who had just stolen a bike from in front of the Walgreens on Santa Cruz. He said he would never have been able to catch him on a regular bike, and by the time the dispatch could have directed a patrol car to pursue the suspect, the suspect would have escaped.Electric bikes also allow officers to be more visible in the community, covering more ground in less time with the assistance of an electric helper motor.Compared to pedal bikes, officers on electric bikes can rider farther and for longer. During pursuits, they’re less winded and more effective when making an arrest.E-bikes also open the possibility for more police officers to get out of cruisers and onto saddles, even if they don’t have the fitness required for hours of non-assisted pedaling.Importantly for many local residents, when it comes to engagement with the community, bike cops are simply a friendlier image than cops rolling up in a massive police truck.As Menlo Park Police Department Chief Norris explained:This is an excellent example of a police department being reflective of our community in a creative way. Menlo Park is such a bike-friendly city, and our bicycle-passion culture within the police department has grown in a very organic way from within.Fresno, California, has a robust bike patrol program that has seen many police officers on BULLS electric bikes. It’s a model that has also proven popular with the LAPD.In Fresno, officer Dustin Freeman explained that officers generally cover 30-40 miles per day and work in pairs. As Freeman explained, the e-bikes have been a valuable tool for catching criminals:Criminals don’t like it. They don’t know when we’re there. They don’t hear us coming. They don’t see us as easily, and we’re able to observe and act quicker in those interactions.According to The Fresno Bee, the downtown bike patrol unit made 448 felony arrests in 2021.And in case you’re curious what it looks like when bike cops make an arrest, the GIF below shows what was described on Reddit as the “World’s Dutchest way to arrest someone”.",ebikes
2022/08/18,"Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have been standard on cars for decades, and motorcycles have also long enjoyed the added safety of the technology, but bicycles have been the last major ABS holdout. Now Bosch wants to change that with its electric bike ABS that it showed off at Eurobike 2022.We had a front row seat to not only witness the new technology in person, but also get some saddle time to test it out on various riding surfaces. Heading to Eurobike 2022, we knew Bosch was going to show off its upcoming new electric bike ABS setup, but we didn’t know we’d get the chance to really put it to the test.Fortunately for us, we got our hands dirty on a couple of electric bikes outfitted with the new tech.Electrek’s Seth Weintraub opted for a full-suspension mountain bike outfitted with Bosch’s ABS setup on the front fork, while I went bigger with a front-loader cargo electric bike.To see how the bikes fared, check out our testing video below!Both styles of electric bikes are prime examples of when anti-lock braking can be critical.Mountain biking on winding trails involves a lot of hard braking – add in loose dirt or gravel, and you’ve got a recipe for locking up the wheels when riders hit the brakes.Rear wheel lockup isn’t much of an issue, and is often used on purpose to slide the rear of the bike around – however, front wheel lockup while mountain biking can result in a quick trip to ER. When the front wheel locks up in a turn on loose terrain, it can cause a slide that requires skill and experience to recover from; for most people, it’s over in an instant and doesn’t end well. When locking up the front wheel on a straightaway, especially when going downhill, a rider can easily be thrown over the bars when the rear wheel lifts up.Electric cargo bikes are also poised to benefit from anti-lock brakes. A long front-loading cargo bike like I was riding can have less weight on the front wheel when there are no kids or cargo in the front bucket, meaning less traction and more chance for locking up the front wheel. When carrying passengers onboard, the consequence of a braking-induced accident are greatly magnified.In the case of the electric mountain bike we tested, the Bosch ABS unit that controls actuation of the front hydraulic disc brake was mounted to the fork; on the cargo e-bike, it was mounted to the front of the cargo bucket.With such a long bike, getting any rear wheel lift from strong front braking would be a bit disconcerting, but Bosch’s rear wheel anti-lift kept me from lifting up in back or locking the small front wheel.I took multiple shots at getting up to speed and then going full panic braking by grabbing a fist full of front brake lever, which would normally be a one way ticket to a wild ride, but the Bosch ABS kicked in perfectly each time. I played around with the settings a bit to control how strong the ABS feature is, but in a cargo bike, I’d generally err on the side of more aggressive ABS for extra protection.Seth’s mountain bike gave even more room to play with the settings and is a good example of a use case where you might want to dial the ABS back just a bit.You can set it to allow more rear wheel lift without letting you flip over the bars, which more experienced riders will likely enjoy. But here, too, full-on panic braking still didn’t cause the front wheel to lock up.We even took it to a gravel area to see how the system dealt with a low traction environment. Slippery gravel is pretty much the worst case scenario for front wheel braking, but the Bosch ABS system handled it perfectly. As you can see below, hard braking never locked up the front wheel, but instead allowed the bike to come to a controlled stop quickly. Note that during the panic braking exercise, the rear wheel locks up, but the front comes to a smooth and controlled stop.For now, Bosch is only working with Magura on its ABS, but has plans to open partnerships with other brake manufacturers as well.As the technology improves and hopefully finds its way onto more e-bikes in the future, braking accidents could become a thing of the past.",ebikes
2022/08/16,"Earlier this month we covered the bizarre story of the sudden death of an e-bike rental company. The shared mobility brand Bolt Mobility apparently shuttered operations overnight, leaving thousands of e-bikes and e-scooters abandoned in cities across the US. The move was all the more puzzling as these vehicles likely totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment, if not into the millions.It began with five US cities that reported an overnight exit from Bolt Mobility, leaving the deserted e-bikes and e-scooters in its wake.Because the shared mobility vehicles are locked until a user pays to unlock them via Bolt’s smartphone application, they became essentially useless in their abandoned state.The personal EVs may have been abandoned by Bolt Mobility, but its original manufacturer wasn’t about to let them go to waste that easily. It turns out they were produced by Element LEV, a company that manufactures multiple models of electric bikes, e-scooters, and e-mopeds for shared mobility companies. And the manufacturer didn’t want to see the vehicles relied upon by so many commuters end up going to waste. So it sprung into action.We spoke to Element LEV to learn more about what the company was doing to try to help the cities suddenly stuck with hundreds of locked e-bikes sitting on its streets.Element LEV’s VP of strategic partnerships Pete Ballard explained to Electrek that the company was working to reach out to each city to help unlock the bikes with the goal of relaunching them. However, the process isn’t as easy as it sounds, since Element LEV doesn’t have a direct relationship with the cities. It was merely the manufacturer selected by Bolt Mobility, and it is now left trying to help clean up Bolt’s mess.As Ballard explained:As the manufacturer of the e-bikes deployed by Bolt, we hate to see products abandoned and cities and universities left without a functioning shared mobility system. We felt compelled to help and have been in contact with multiple partners across the US. Our team is jumping in to unlock those devices and working hand in hand with these markets to relaunch a healthy system.He continued by explaining that the primary goal is to first secure the e-bikes.That is likely a tricky task as the nature of shared electric bikes means that they are designed to freely float around cities, often being parked on sidewalks and in other public spaces without being physically locked like a typical privately owned bike.Step one is helping to make sure the assets are secure so we are here to talk to any location that needs help.After securing the e-bikes, Ballard explained that the company is trying to ensure that cities have access to the parts and support to manage the bikes. The ultimate goal is to help the cities bring the e-bikes back into operation.Step two is making sure these bikes have the right spare parts to safely operate and we are providing that support too. Lastly, we want to help them navigate bringing their systems back to life, especially at a time when communities rely on shared mobility devices in their daily lives.When I first reported on this bizarre turn of events, I was worried that these abandoned e-bikes were going to either turn into a free-for-all or become a pile of e-waste to be discarded.I’m thrilled to see that the original manufacturer of the e-bikes is proactively trying to help cities solve this problem in a way that actually returns the e-bikes to use instead of just cleaning up after Bolt Mobility’s mess.",ebikes
2022/08/15,"There are lightweight electric bikes and then there are really lightweight e-bikes. But the new Hummingbird Flax folding e-bike is even lighter than those. At just 22 lb. (10 kg), this plant-based e-bike isn’t just friendly to your back – it’s apparently vegan-friendly as well.The company says that the Hummingbird Flax is the lightest folding electric bike in the world. That prize is thanks largely to its novel frame design.Constructed of flax fiber, the e-bike uses a sustainable plant-based design that is ultra lightweight and ultra strong.Plant fiber has seen growing interest in the automotive industry as an even lighter-weight option than carbon fiber. With carbon fiber e-bikes seemingly a dime a dozen these days, flax fiber might just be the big new thing to score those critical buzzword points.The Hummingbird flax isn’t just light on the poundage – it’s also light on the power.The rear hub motor may look large but is only rated for 250W of power. That’s 1/3 horsepower, for those keeping score.The larger size of the motor is due to the inclusion of the batteries inside the case. Stuffing the motor, controller, batteries, and other necessary hardware all into one package helps offer a more streamlined look for the bike. It also means all of the weight is at the rear of the bike, but at least it’s down low!The battery is rather small too at just 158 Wh, but the company still claims a maximum range of 50 km (31 miles). There’s no throttle, so that’s the human-assisted range. With the European-legal top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph), that small battery may just last for the whole 50 km, at least if you’re pushing fairly hard yourself.Some photos seem to show the e-bike with a belt while others give it a standard chain drive. Both could be an option, but it certainly seems that it’s designed as a single-speed either way.A plant-based electric bike doesn’t come cheap, starting at £4,995 in the UK (US $6,050) with a 20% VAT included. For the rest of the world, the bike is priced at £4,162 (US $5,040). Part of that cost is likely due to high-priced components like the carbon fiber seat post with titanium hardware. Of course you could easily spend that much on a normal old-fashioned aluminum e-bike, so whose to say that’s even considered expensive anymore?!Okay, I’ll bite. It’s interesting, though I’m not sure anyone was really begging for plant-based e-bikes. I think an aluminum e-bike is just as vegan-friendly, though I don’t know enough about the supply chain to say which one is less energy intensive overall. Aluminum isn’t exactly ultra-cheap to produce either.Having a super lightweight e-bike is certainly an asset for commuters that have to carry their e-bike on occasion. Whether up the stairs or onto a bus, lifting a 23 kg (50 lb.) e-bike isn’t fun. Something half the weight like the Hummingbird Flax does sound like it would be a lot nicer to carry.That being said, I’m kind of inclined to look more toward a micro e-bike like the JackRabbit, which costs 20% of this price. It may not have all the same bells and whistles, but I can buy five of them for the same price.That’s got to count for something, right?!via: moveelectric.com",ebikes
2022/08/12,"HittRoad is one of several low-cost electric bicycles currently racking up sales on Amazon. The good thing about these $600-$700 e-bikes is that they help bring the fun and fitness aspects of electric bikes to customers who can’t afford models costing several times these prices. But keeping the universe in balance is the bad side, which is that the bikes’ quality usually suffers at that price point.So I took HittRoad’s Safari mountain bike-ish e-bike to my local trails to give it a test on the single track. Here’s how it did.Let’s be honest, for $760 (or $609 when clipping the on-page Amazon coupon), the HittRoad is never going to compare to a higher-dollar electric bike.But odd name aside, it actually has some decent specs for the price, at least if your intention is to use it as a recreational e-bike.This of course is not going to handle jumps or the forces exerted on a typical downhill mountain bike course. This is for leisurely rides on your local nature trails or parks. Think beach path, not black diamond (or black trail, as the case may be in downhill riding).But if you keep in its element, as I did, I think you’ll find that the bike can actually perform well considering its modest price point. Check out my testing in the short video below, then keep reading for the specs and ride experience.The HittRoad Safari is one of those electric “mountain bikes” that is barely in mountain bike territory. Yes, it’s got the basic geometry and slightly knobby tires, but this is more of a dual-purpose hybrid bike. Most people who get it will spend more time in the bike lane than on the trails. It even comes with commuter-ready fenders (though the front fender was so cheap and floppy that I didn’t even bother to install it).But any bike can ride pavement. I wanted to see what this one could do in the dirt.And despite the low price, I was reasonably optimistic. The tires aren’t fancy but had fine grip for light trails. The suspension fork didn’t feel like I could break it over my knee (a resounding endorsement, I know – but that’s not always the case). The disc brakes aren’t branded, but they seem to work just fine. And you even have 21 speeds, which is around 14 more than I feel is necessary, but I guess those in hilly areas might appreciate the granular gear choice.I took the bike to my local parks and single track to see what it could do. And while the acceleration off the line wasn’t peppy with only 500W of peak power from the 50 Nm Bafang motor, it was enough to feel like I was getting a good boost. It’s no rocket, but it does the job.Where the bike surprised me was how nimble it was on single track. It wasn’t quite as responsive as better mountain bikes, but damn if it didn’t hold its own. I could wiggle through the serpentines and hold a half decent line on the HittRoad Safari to a better degree than I expected.Now don’t get carried away here. It wasn’t perfect. The simple spring suspension leaves a lot to be desired, but for relatively flat trails it was just fine. Gravel roads were also quite comfortable, with the 1.95″ tires and the spring fork working together to do what my rigid gravel bikes can’t – absorb the rough road and gravel shock.The range is actually modest as well, at least when I’m helping pedal. I’m not saying you’re going to get the 40 miles that the company claims, but the medium power level of the bike and limited top speed of 20 mph means it can’t pull too much power at once, helping that 375 Wh battery last longer.HittRoad says it was able to get a real-world 40-mile (64 km) range when riding the bike in pedal assist level 2 at 9 mph (14.5 km/h) with a 165 lb. rider (75 kg). That may be reasonable, but I wasn’t about to ride that bike that slowly for four and a half hours straight to find out. Instead, consider that full throttle range without pedaling is likely in the 18-ish mile (30 km) ballpark, and pedal assist will stretch it out farther than that. The battery is lockable and removable for charging either on or off of the bike, and HittRoad even includes a powerful 4A charger (compared to the typical 2A charger that comes with most low-cost e-bikes). That fast charger recharges the battery in around three hours, which is quicker than most e-bikes on the market. If you only use around half of the battery on a ride, a one- to two-hour recharge is possible.The rest of the parts are of similarly decent quality. Nothing fancy, but pretty darn decent. The LED display on the handlebars is large and easy to read. The brakes work well even if they aren’t branded. The saddle is actually decently comfortable. And you even get an adjustable stem to dial in the handlebar height and angle to fit your body type.You’ll notice this review is full of words like “modest” and “decent.” I’m used to reviewing electric bikes that cost 2-3x this much, at a minimum. And so I can’t say that the HittRoad Safari works as nicely or is built as well as those e-bikes. But I can say that I’m surprised that it didn’t feel like some other cheap $600 Amazon e-bikes we’ve tried.I would definitely recommend this e-bike to someone who wanted a full-size electric bike with mountain bike styling. It’s not going to take you off any sweet jumps, but it feels like it will take you through modest trails all day long, and is more than enough to handle an urban commute (though you’ll probably want to add some cheap LED lights first).For just over $600 when you use the Amazon coupon, there’s some serious bang for your buck here.",ebikes
2022/08/11,"Electric tricycles have long been a favorite of parents, older riders, and anybody who enjoys the stability and cargo benefits of three-wheeled electric bikes. Now the Addmotor M-340 electric trike is getting a big update with the brand’s EB2.0 electrical system, including a big new battery.We first learned of Addmotor’s EB2.0 system with the launch of the brand’s E-53 City Pro electric bike late last year.Addmotor claimed a massive range of 125 miles (200 km) from that bike’s 48V and 20Ah battery. The 960 Wh battery would require the lowest power setting to go that far, but the large capacity from the Samsung 21700-format battery cells meant that higher power settings would also yield impressive range results.Now the company is bringing the new setup to the three-wheeled favorite M-340 electric tricycle.The Addmotor M-340 has long been one of the main direct-to-consumer electric tricycles on the market. It offers a step-through frame and foot platforms to make it easy to mount and ride. An included throttle makes pedaling optional, offering speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h) on either throttle or pedal-assist operation.Priced at $2,999, the Addmotor M-340 isn’t a cheap ride. But tricycles have always been a more expensive category in the bicycle industry due to their larger size and more complex operation, not to mention the increased shipping costs that many companies eat as part of “free shipping” guarantees.But that higher price has to be weighted against the higher utility of these SUVs of the e-bike world. For example, this electric trike is designed to carry large loads over less than ideal terrain. The combination of a front suspension fork and all-around fat tires makes for a cushier ride than most electric trikes can offer. And a 350 lb. (160 kg) rider weight rating plus another 100 lb. (45 kg) cargo rating shows that the trike mean businesses when it comes to hauling duty.The 48V electrical system and 750W motor combine to help haul all of that weight, though I’d sure love to see 450 lb. of trike, rider, and cargo climbing a steep hill. If the Addmotor M-340 can handle that test, I’ll sing its praises from the hilltops.The inclusion of a 7-speed shifter will help riders downshift to support the motor when climbing hills. The hydraulic disc brakes will come in handy on the other side of the hill when it’s time to bring that heavy bike to a stop.For now the trike seems to be out of stock on Addmotor’s site, but they’re likely restocking with the new updated model.Electric tricycles hold a special place in my heart. I built my first one back in 2014 using a pedal tricycle and an electric bike conversion kit. Ever since, I’ve loved how they offer a combination of bicycle-like freedom and vehicle-like cargo hauling.In fact, this Addmotor M-340 trike has me wanting to use it as a great foundation for building a solar electric tuk-tuk. Just imagine welding up a frame to go over the top of the trike that does double duty as a shade canopy and a surface to mount 300-400 watts of solar panels. Solar e-bikes are all the rage these days!With fat tires, a giant battery, and enough solar panels to give a nearly infinite range (if you’re pedaling) or around double the typical range (if you aren’t pedaling), that would be the ultimate suburban cruiser. Hmmm, I might just have to build that.",ebikes
2022/08/10,"At Eurobike 2022, I had the chance to test out a number of fun and innovative new electric bikes, and one of the models I was most looking forward to was the Tern Quick Haul. Having covered the bike’s unveiling earlier this year, I knew that I was going to want to test out this new lower-cost model to see if it could maintain the high-quality reputation that Tern is known for.The Tern Quick Haul definitely looks like a Tern. It’s got the company’s signature 20″ wheels matched with a low slung yet slightly elongated frame. Together, those two features create an e-bike with room for lots of cargo that don’t take up much room in your garage or apartment.Cargo e-bikes are great, but they often turn into the SUVs of the electric bike world, taking up way more space than they deserve. Tern has also focused on making right-sized electric cargo bikes that keep the cargo, but shed the bulk.To watch me and Electrek‘s publisher Seth Weintraub put a couple of Tern Quick Hauls through the Eurobike testing circuit, check out the short video below. Then read on for more info!The Tern Quick Haul D8 starts at $2,999 while the P9 starts at $3,299. It’s certainly not an impulse buy, but it’s much lower than some of Tern’s other models with loftier price tags.The bikes still have some very nice equipment, though, even if they’re considered the entry-level models of Tern’s lineup.The bikes include Bosch mid-drive motors, Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, Speedlifter adjustable stems, Atlas racks, and Schwalbe Big Apple urban tires. The D8 is more affordable with lower-tier parts like a Shimano Altus 8-speed deraileur and Bosch Active line motor, while the P9 has a nicer 9-speed Alivio transmission and Performance Line motor.In the US, the D8 can do 20 mph (32 km/h) while the P9 can reach 28 mph (45 km/h). But since we were testing the bikes in Germany and had to conform to EU laws, our models were limited to Europe’s 25 km/h (15.5 mph) speed limits.Even so, that was plenty for the Eurobike test track that pretty well simulated a dense urban environment that these bikes would likely find themselves in.You’d expect a cargo bike to feel fairly heavy, but these 23 kg (50 lb.) e-bikes are lighter than or similar to most non-cargo e-bikes on the market. And yet, they have these awesome rear racks and mounting options for front racks that give them plenty of hauling capacity. The Tern Quick Haul is even rated for up to 150 kg (330 lb.) of weight capacity, so you can really load the bike up if you need to.I tested a model that was outfitted as a pizza delivery bike, with a giant rear box and another smaller basket on the front. I was amazed at how nimble it was, even with that much storage strapped onto it. Seth spent more time on the slightly less loaded bike, and somehow I was able to wiggle through the crowds and tents behind him, despite looking like I was making a delivery for an entire middle school pizza party.The bikes combine Tern’s penchant for easy-riding and comfortably designed cargo bikes with Bosch’s years of experience in electric bike drivetrains. That means the bikes are well powered, comfortable to ride, and offer intuitive pedal assist. You get to enjoy all of Bosch’s perks, like the nicely design displays and app functionality, while letting Tern focus on building a well made bike to house that drive train.The Tern Quick Haul may be lower cost than the rest of the company’s lineup, but it’s still a high-quality bike designed for people that want to use their e-bike daily for rigorous tasks.If you’re looking for a weekend cruise type of e-bike, you can probably skip the Tern Quick Haul; there are other simpler e-bikes out there for that. But if you want to take the kids to school every day and then do shopping on the way home, and you want a bike that you know can handle it for years, then the Tern Quick Haul will get it done.It’s great to see the company expanding their offerings like this to make these higher-end electric bikes more accessible to us average Joes out there.",ebikes
2022/08/07,"The Senate’s passing of the Inflation Reduction Act should be applauded as a major step toward protecting our planet. However, it is important to note that while this agreement offers big incentives for electric cars, it also abandoned on the side of the road a critically important class of electric vehicle: electric bicycles.The Inflation Reduction Act is a cleverly repackaged version of the original Build Back Better Act, whittled down to reach a compromise that could stick.The original BBB Act included wording from the house-backed E-BIKE Act, which sought to offer hundreds of dollars of incentives for the purchase of electric bicycles.Part of that whittling down to create the new Inflation Reduction Act included cutting the electric bicycle tax incentive that could have benefited so many more Americans than an electric car tax incentive.As Noa Banayan from PeopleForBikes explained:The climate- and energy-focused Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 misses a massive opportunity by neglecting to invest in an electric bicycle tax credit and other critical initiatives to promote biking for transportation. This omission leaves us sorely disappointed in the future of climate policy given the significant transportation investments in the bill are squarely focused on electric vehicles. While PeopleForBikes remains supportive of urgently needed climate action and broader policy solutions, we’re sorely disappointed that Democratic leadership axed most consideration of bicycles and active transportation in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.The problem with leaving out electric bikes from the Inflation Reduction Act is that it perpetuates the misconception that electric cars are the solution to climate change.While it is true that electric cars are an improvement over gas-powered cars, they are essentially the electric version of a gas-guzzler compared to electric bikes. Electric bikes not only use a tiny fraction of the energy of an electric car, but they also have a tiny fraction of an electric car’s carbon footprint when considering the entire vehicle’s lifecycle of production, use, and end of life. Not only are electric cars not the solution for climate change, but no car can be considered the solution. The correct answer is to physically reduce the size of vehicles in our cities, thereby reducing the energy demands and total emissions associated with our transportation needs.Then there’s the staggering cost difference. The cost of just a few tanks of gasoline is enough to buy an electric bike. Then you can travel thousands of miles on an e-bike for the cost of a single gallon of gasoline. Buying an electric car is outside the reach of hundreds of millions of Americans, even with the incentive. But buying an e-bike is already feasible for many more, and could be possible for hundreds of millions of Americans with the help of a tax rebate.Some impacts of e-bikes are felt even more immediately. While we can speak academically of emissions reductions, you can walk outside right now and feel the impact of cars in cities. All of that traffic, congestion, honking, lack of parking – all of those problems are car-related. Studies have shown that switching just 10% of vehicles from cars to bikes can cause a 40% reduction in traffic.A few people switching to bikes improves city life for everyone, even car drivers.The Inflation Reduction Act may have missed the mark on e-bike incentives, but that hasn’t stopped cities and states from creating their own massively popular alternatives. Denver’s tax-rebate for electric bikes was so popular that it exhausted its budget in a few days, causing the city to have to scramble to allocate more funding. Vermont’s popular e-bike incentive has taken off as well, serving as a model for incentivizing drivers to switch to more sustainable transportation alternatives like e-bikes.These kinds of incentives aren’t just improving cities and reducing emissions, they’re also helping people live healthier lifestyles. Study after study after study has shown that electric bicycles offer huge fitness benefits. Some studies have even shown that e-bike riders get more exercise than pedal bike riders because they tend to go on longer and farther rides more frequently.The science is clear. E-bikes improve people’s health. E-bikes solve traffic and city congestion. E-bikes reduce emissions and provide some of the strongest impacts on reducing climate change.We have the answer. Now the only thing left is to do something about it.",ebikes
2022/08/05,"Ride1Up’s Core-5 electric bike has received an upgrade to improve its already popular position as a cost-effective $1,195 commuter electric bike.The first major update to the Ride1Up Core-5 appears to be increasing the battery capacity to achieve longer range.Boosting battery size has been a popular move lately, with e-bike companies taking advantage of the wide range of battery cells on the market to opt for more energy dense options; that results in an e-bike battery that is the same physical size and shape, yet manages to stuff in more capacity for longer range.In the Ride1Up Core-5’s case, the 48V and 10.4Ah battery got a boost to 12.8Ah, adding nearly 25% more capacity, and thus, nearly 25% more range. The new 614 Wh battery is still a recessed battery that hides in the frame’s downtube. It is lockable yet removable for charging either on or off of the e-bike.The other main update to the Ride1Up Core-5, which is available in either a step-over or step-through frame style, appears to be the inclusion of a headlight. I’ve tested nearly every electric bike in Ride1Up’s lineup by this point, and I’ve long taken shots at the company over the few models that still don’t have a headlight. Most of the company’s models include LED lighting, but their two most affordable models have lacked that feature. Now it looks like Ride1Up is fixing one of the few complaints I could find on one of the last remaining headlight-less electric bikes it offers. Notwithstanding, Ride1Up decided not to increase the price of the Core-5. The company is still charging the same $1,195 price, despite offering nearly 25% more battery capacity. The move is all the more surprising considering that price increases have become common across the electric bike industry this year.Having tested so many of Ride1Up’s e-bikes in the past, I’ve gotten a pretty darn good feel for the company and its operating style.The San Diego, California-based electric bike company has long been focused on two main strategies: offering a wide selection of commuter-optimized electric bikes with better performance than the competition and doing so at a better price.In this case, the Core-5 is no exception. The 750W continuous-rated motor offers 20 mph (32 km/h) speeds on throttle operation or 28 mph (45 km/h) speeds with pedal assist. The previous range was listed as 20-40 miles (32-64 miles) and is still listed as the bike’s official range on the website, but with the larger battery, we’d expect that to be closer to the 25-50 mile (40-80 km) ballpark now. Ride1Up has also expanded its offerings significantly this year. The company rolled out its first ever cruiser-styled electric bike known as the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser. The bike is certainly more laid back and relaxed than the rest of the company’s lineup, but still takes commuter inspiration such as the fast speeds, sturdy fenders, built-in lighting, and urban tires. There’s even a large rack with a passenger package for carrying friends or kids on back. Check that e-bike out in my video review below that I made during some fun testing earlier this year.The company also added its first mid-drive electric bike, opting for a high quality German-made Brose motor in the Ride1Up Prodigy. It’s also the company’s priciest option in the lineup at $2,295, but those high quality parts would add up to a four-digit price tag starting with a ‘3’ from most other name brand manufacturers.The Ride1Up Core-5 may be the model getting the upgrades today, but with this pace of development, it is anyone’s guess what is coming next from this heavy-hitting electric bike company.",ebikes
2022/08/02,"Porsche hasn’t been coy about its electric bicycle ambitions over the last few years, but now the company is jumping in with both feet as it starts two new electric bicycle companies to expand its reach in the e-bike market.Both are joint ventures founded in tandem by the automaker Porsche and the Dutch company Ponooc Investment B.V. this week.The first of the two new companies will be known as Porsche eBike Performance GmbH and will focus largely on the development of electric bicycle components including motors, batteries, and drive software.Porsche eBike Performance GmbH will likely draw heavily upon the technology developed by electric bicycle drive maker FAZUA, which Porsche acquired earlier this summer.The second venture will be known as P2 eBike GmbH and will use the drive technology developed by Porsche eBike Performance GmbH to produce complete electric bicycles for consumers.Jan Becker, the former CEO of Porsche Lifestyle GmbH & Co. KG, will become the chairman of Porsche eBike Performance GmbH. Moritz Failenschmid, the Managing Director at Focus Bikes, will become the chairman of P2 eBike GmbH.As Porsche AG’s Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board Lutz Meschke explained:We see great potential for Porsche in the eBike segment. This is why we are consistently expanding our activities in this area. Jan Becker and Moritz Failenschmid are proven experts when it comes to setting up and developing forward-looking and customer-oriented ventures. As part of a highly skilled and motivated team, they will prove this in the two joint ventures. As is characteristic of Porsche, it’s all about developing products that inspire people through intelligent design, sophisticated technology and outstanding performance.A statement from the company explained that in addition to continuing to develop the FAZUA electric bicycle drive system, Porsche will now create “powerful” new electric bicycle motors under the Porsche nameplate.In addition to those motors finding their way into Porsche’s e-bikes, the company also plans to provide the technology to other manufacturers around the world.This news is just the latest in a string of e-bike related announcements from Porsche.Porsche has already released several high-end electric bicycles under its own brand. It also purchased a controlling stake in premium electric mountain bike company Greyp last year, which was developed by electric hypercar manufacturer Rimac.Earlier this year, the company began expanding its e-bike reach by investing in a 20% stake in FAZUA before ultimately buying the rest of the electric bicycle drivetrain maker earlier this summer.Now it looks like Porsche has gone all in on electric bikes, seeking not only to build its own e-bikes but also to supply other major manufacturers with the motors, batteries and software needed to build their e-bikes as well.In doing so, Porsche could be positioning itself as a major competitor to e-bike drive makers like Bosch, Brose, Bafang, Shimano, and Yamaha.If anyone needed more evidence that electric bicycles are the next major frontier in the electric vehicle space, let this serve as Exhibits A through Z. It should come as no surprise; we’ve watched as electric bicycle sales in Europe have far exceeded sales of electric cars. And considering they take much less effort and material to produce, they are becoming an attractive target for automakers.Those companies unfortunately only see the dollar signs (or euro signs, in this case). But if that’s what it takes to shove automakers towards smaller and more efficient vehicles, then I’m fine with it.The world isn’t going to be saved by more Porsche Taycans on the road. Hell, it’s probably not going to be saved at all. But at least we all stand a much better chance if we can replace as many cars – electric or not – with lighter personal vehicles like bicycles, e-bikes, kickscooters, e-scooters and e-motorcycles. Why not at least give humanity a fighting chance?",ebikes
2022/08/02,"Faster and farther – those are two of the most common requests from many e-bike riders who rely on their bikes for daily trips. The Lectric XP e-bike is already quite fast at 28 mph (45 km/h), but now it is going farther than ever thanks to a big battery upgrade launched today by the manufacturer.Phoenix-based Lectric eBikes, the fast-growing company behind the mega-popular Lectric XP line of e-bikes, announced the new battery upgrade this morning.The $999 Lectric XP 2.0 folding fat tire bike originally came with a 460 Wh battery. But the new 48V and 14Ah upgrade battery holds a larger 672 Wh of capacity. That marks a major improvement by adding around 45% more battery and thus 45% more range to the e-bike.And perhaps the coolest feature is that it is also backwards compatible with the original Lectric XP 1.0 e-bike, a model that counts tens of thousands of units on US roads already.The bigger battery fits in the same physical dimensions as the standard battery (making it compatible with both Lectric XP 1.0 and 2.0 e-bikes), as it simply packs in more capacity through higher-energy density. It’s all about giving riders more confidence to go farther, explained CEO and cofounder Levi Conlow:Following a survey of Lectric riders, we recognized that there’s this very real appetite from not just prospective customers, but also existing customers for the ability to go on longer rides. We’re all about having people feel confident in their riding experience. I don’t want people to feel concerned that they might run out of battery, so we set out to eliminate that concern by offering this Long-Range battery.The new long-range battery can be upgraded on an existing order at checkout for an additional $200, or can be purchased separately for $500. As Levi explained, that pricing is designed to beat major players in the rest of the industry.The addition of the Long-Range battery is completely in the DNA of Lectric eBikes. When I say that, I mean we’re delivering a tremendous value to the customer. At the end of the day, you cannot get this much battery from anybody else at this price point.A bit of fact-checking proves that Levi is mostly correct. The same size battery from major competitors like Rad Power Bikes and Aventon will set riders back $550, or 10% more. However, Ride1Up sells 672 Wh batteries for between $459-$489 depending on the model. It’s still seems fair to say that Lectric’s new long-range battery is more affordable than most in the industry.Lectric eBikes might still win out in the end though, as the company is offering existing customers a discount of 20% off the price of the new battery, or $100 off. That deal will only be around for a limited time though, and there’s no word yet on how long it will last. At $400 for the new battery during the limited time deal though, that likely puts it squarely in first place for pricing among major e-bike manufacturers.And that’s par for the course, as the company is seen as a price leader among US-based e-bike companies.Earlier this year, Lectric eBikes released the ultra-affordable Lectric XP Lite for just $799. While the bike has a smaller 375 Wh battery, its 48V electrical system still offers good power yet in a smaller and lighter package. We tested the bike in Phoenix earlier this year, and you can see our test ride video here.The company followed that up with the launch of the $1,799 Lectric XP Premium. While higher priced, the Lectric XP Premium features a mid-drive motor, torque sensor, dual batteries, and hydraulic disc brakes, all of which push the price higher. The folding fat tire bike competes against other e-bikes that are well into the $2,500+ range, again demonstrating Lectric’s commitment to value pricing.

2022/08/01,"In another example of reality sometimes being stranger than fiction, electric scooter and e-bike sharing company Bolt Mobility appears to have shut down operations in several US cities largely overnight. In doing so, it abandoned hundreds of thousands of dollars of light electric vehicles on the streets.Bolt Mobility, a shared mobility company founded by Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt, has reportedly ended operations in five US cities.So far it appears that Bolt has ceased operations in Portland, Oregon; three Vermont cities of Burlington, South Burlington, and Winooski; and in Richmond, California.The Miami-based mobility company (not to be confused with Estonian-based mobility company Bolt) does not appear to have given any notice before ending operations in those cities. To make matters worse, city officials have reportedly been unable to get in touch with anyone at Bolt Mobility, including the company’s CEO Ignacio Tzoumas.Bryan Davis, the senior transportation planner for Chittenden County, Vermont, explained to Techcrunch:They’ve vanished, leaving equipment behind and emails and calls unanswered. We’re unable to reach anyone, but it seems they’ve closed shop in other markets as well.Mayor Tom Butt of Richmond, California, confirmed that Bolt has abandoned the West Coast city as well:Unfortunately, Bolt apparently went out of business without prior notification or removal of their capital equipment from city property. They recently missed the city’s monthly meeting check-in and have been unresponsive to all their clients throughout all their markets.Bolt left over 250 electric bikes at hub locations including BART public transit stations and ferry terminals in Richmond. With these electric bikes usually costing companies around $1,000 each, Bolt likely abandoned around a quarter of a million dollars’ worth of equipment in just that one city.That begs the question: What happens to all of this gear?Mayor Butt said that the company is currently devising a plan to deal with the abandoned equipment and requested that the public avoid vandalizing the deserted electric bikes.But the situation will likely need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, with each city deciding how to handle the cast-off equipment.One thing is for sure though: It’s probably not okay to just go out and grab your own Bolt e-bike or e-scooter.It was pretty obvious that many of these smaller shared electric mobility companies would start going tires up, and in fact this exact scenario was one of my industry predictions a few years ago. But I don’t think anyone expected companies to just start pulling up stakes and moving out of town in the middle of the night.I’m hoping that cities will find a way to repurpose the equipment that will be rounded up. Unfortunately the bikes and scooters are likely locked by the operator, but perhaps the OEM like OKAI or other makers of these shared e-bikes and e-scooters can lend a hand in unlocking the software.As a last resort, the e-bikes and e-scooters can likely be parted out. But it’s a shame to see good, working e-bikes and e-scooters either dismantled or destroyed simply because a company couldn’t manage its operations.",ebikes
2022/07/29,"The first time I saw the Fantic ISSIMO electric bike on a trip to Milan last year, I instantly fell in love with the design. And now that the company is offering a 45 km/h (28 mph) version that maxes out the legally allowable speed, I’m even more head over heels for this eye-catching electric bike.The ISSIMO 45 shares the same frame as the original ISSIMO, which is designed like a truss bridge on wheels.Not only does that make for a strong and rigid setup even with a low step-through design, but it opens the door to fun customization options like colorful side panels.But the real takeaway here is of course the performance of this fun little electric moped.It sports a Bafang M600 mid-drive motor, which puts outs a whopping 120 Nm of torque. That crushes essentially anything built by German manufacturers like Bosch or Brose that typically lead the European e-bike market.The motor is listed as a 500W continuous-rated unit, but there’s obviously a lot more power in there than meets the eye – or the label.The motor is paired with a 600 Wh removable battery, though riders can opt for a second battery to double the range from 50 km (31 miles) to 100 km (62 miles).An ENVIOLO Heavy Duty continuously variable transmission in the rear hub provides the bike’s gearing. That hub and its wheel get wrapped in a 20″x4″ fat tire with urban tread. Between the 80mm front suspension fork and high-volume tires, this should be a fairly cushy ride on both manicured and rough roads. As a speed pedelec in Europe, the ISSIMO 45 includes a side view mirror, type-approved motor vehicle lighting, and a license plate holder in the rear. The speed pedelec designation means it has to be registered like a motorbike, but the advantage is that it also gets to use a hand throttle – unlike most electric bicycles in Europe.And when it’s time to come down from those high speeds, the Radius hydraulic disc brakes should bring the bike to a stop quickly.The ISSIMO 45 offers serious performance and functionality, but it comes at a cost. Pricing in Europe is set at €3,590, which equates to around US $3,670. That’s not cheap, but it may compare well to a number of 45 km/h (28 mph) electric bicycles like those from SUPER73 and other high-performance moped-style electric bike makers.I love the look and the performance of the ISSIMO 45. Fantic did a great job there with the design.It’s a bummer that the bikes require registration and can’t be used in bike lanes, but them’s the laws in Europe.As it stands, it’s still a really cool design that mixes conventional electric bike parts with a more moped-style build. And the fact that you can customize it with all of those colorful accessories is icing on the cake. Gone are the days of one color for everyone!What do you think of the Fantic ISSIMO 45 electric bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!via: Visordown",ebikes
2022/07/27,"Colorado-based Optibike is one of the oldest electric bicycle companies in the United States, and so they know a thing or two about building high-performance e-bikes. But the new Optibike R22 Everest seems to go above and beyond what anyone could have asked for, claiming to have enough battery to climb Mount Everest on a single charge.There may not be any good charge spots at the summit, but that should be fine. It’s all downhill from there.Just how big of an e-bike battery does it feature?There’s a whopping 3,260 Wh of lithium-ion cells stuffed into the carbon fiber full-suspension frame of the R22 Everest. The battery is designed in two packs that are removable from either side of the bike.To put that in comparison, 3.26 kWh of battery is more than 6x the capacity of a common low-cost electric bicycle in the US. Of course the $18,900 R22 Everest also costs around 27x the price of that $799 low cost e-bike, so I’m not sure these things track linearly. But if your goal is to climb up Mount Everest on an e-bike, price probably isn’t your first concern. If it were me, riding across those ladders might be higher on my “big worries” list.But let’s face it: Most people aren’t going to be climbing up the world’s highest mountain on this e-bike.Instead, the R22 Everest is designed for exploring rough terrain and accessing far-off destinations that other e-bikes wouldn’t be able to make. And climbing more reasonable mountains than the highest one in the world.As Optibike founder Jim Turner explained:The R22 Everest is the result of my 25 years of designing and building E-Bikes, the R22 is my dream bike, born and bred in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. This bike sets a new standard for E-Bikes.The company claims that the bike’s massive battery can do 24,000 feet of elevation gain on a single charge. Or for folks who like to measure their rides by horizontal distance instead of vertical, the R22 Everest boasts 300 miles (510 km) of range in pedal assist mode at 15 mph (25 km/h). But you better have some high-endurance legs to keep up 20 hours of pedaling for 300 miles.For those that would rather give their legs a break, there’s also a half-twist throttle to operate the electric bicycle more like an electric motorbike, pedaling optional.It may not actually scale the real Mount Everest, but it looks like it’d make it pretty darn far up there before being swallowed up by a crevasse. The bike makes uses of Optibike’s proprietary 1,700 watt PowerStorm mid-drive motor with a crushing 190Nm of torque. That motor ties into a Rohloff Speed 500 internally geared hub with 14 gear ratios. In highest gear, it is said to offer a top speed of 36 mph (58 km/h), making this an off-road-only e-bike as far as US laws are concerned.With a dual crown front suspension fork and 200 mm (8 inches) of rear suspension travel, this e-bike is designed to keep going when the trail has long disappeared. Each R22 Everest is hand-built to order at Optibike’s Colorado facility. That sounds about right, since at nearly $19K, they definitely aren’t pumping these out on some cheap assembly line!",ebikes
2022/07/26,"Oregon-based Arcimoto, better known for its three-wheeled 75 mph (120 km/h) FUV electric vehicles, has shown off a new version of its Mean Lean Machine (MLM). The newest update to the still-under-development electric bike-class vehicle sees new suspension and other structural as well as functional upgrades.The original MLM prototype was first unveiled in February. Arcimoto presented it as an evolution in bicycles, pushing e-bikes further with more stability and utility.But this wasn’t any old electric trike. It used a drive by wire system where the pedals activated a generator. Instead of a chain or belt like a typical bicycle, electricity flowed via wires from the pedal generator to the motor, making a pit stop at the battery and controller along the way.We’ve seen pedal generators on e-trikes before, and we’ve also seen e-bikes that can recharge themselves when used on a trainer and engaging their regenerative braking. But we’d never seen anything like what Arcimoto built in the MLM prototype.Arcimoto’s design for the original MLM prototype also made heavy use of tilting technology likely gleaned from Arcimoto’s acquisition of Tilting Motor Works last year.Now we’re getting our first look at Arcimoto’s second MLM prototype, known as the Cybertrike. The  company revealed that this new e-trike will be the mid-level model as part of a three-tiered product strategy.According to the company:“The base model ‘Sidewinder’, mid-line ‘Cybertrike’ and high end true ‘Mean Lean Machine’ will offer customers a range of capabilities at key e-bike market price points.Arcimoto founder and CEO Mark Frohnmayer explained further while praising the design team behind the MLM:The MLM team has really outdone themselves with this Cybertrike Edition prototype. The team has continued to refine the ride experience, dial in the industrial design of the chassis, as well as provision for best-in-class carrying capacity, and it will provide us with invaluable testing and marketing data as we push towards the release of the first Mean Lean Machines later this year. I remain confident that this product will be in a field of its own, while also opening up the bicycle class to a much wider audience.Key differences in the Cybertrike include major improvements in the suspension, the first packaging study of Arcimoto’s MicroFutureDrive, and carbon-fiber wheels. The company says that it plans to build copies of this prototype iteration for on-road marketing and testing purposes.While we’re getting a better look at the updated design on a prototype that looks closer to a retail product than the first model we saw, there are still many unanswered questions.We know each of the three wheels will have a hub motor and that it will allow the MLM to offer torque vectoring, something that is also currently being tested for rollout on Arcimoto’s larger FUVs. But we don’t know how much power each motor will offer in the MLM, nor do we have any hard specs on speed, range, battery capacity or other key e-bike figures.We’ve previously heard that the company is targeting a massive range rating of 200 miles (322 km), though that will supposedly require additional auxiliary batteries to be installed on the trike.We also don’t know what the vehicle will weigh, though the carbon fiber wheels seem to indicate that Arcimoto is attempting to drop the weight as much as possible.For now, those already interested in getting on the waiting list for the MLM can plop down a refundable $100 deposit toward the yet-unknown purchase price.As we wait to learn more about the MLM and hopefully see a production version soon, let’s hear your thoughts on this wild new vehicle in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/07/25,"If you’ve ever explored Trek’s electric bike families before, you’ll know that the companies offers nicely made yet high-priced e-bikes. You get what you pay for, though you pay handsomely. But now Trek has just released two e-bikes – the Dual Sport+ and the FX+ – that are helping bring down prices for everyday riders.Both of the bikes are targeted more towards that quickly growing group of everyday riders.While Trek has plenty of $8,000 electric mountain bikes and road e-bikes for the hardcore riders out there, these two new models are designed for everyone else; the kind of riders that just want to get out and hit the pavement or the dirt without worrying about shaving off every last gram or bragging about top tire components.While both of the new models could likely handle both urban riding and manicured trails, the Dual Sport+ certainly has one wheel further in the dirt category while the FX+ is more of your everyday commuter e-bike.The Dual Sport+ is essentially an electrified version of Trek’s existing Dual Sport line; the bike is available in a step-over format (Dual Sport+ 2) or a step-through version (Dual Sport +2 Stagger).Both are priced at $2,399, or several thousands dollars less than most of Trek’s other e-bikes. The lack of a mid-drive motor combined with a smaller battery helps drop that price. The 250W hub motor carries the same 250W continuous rating as most box store e-bikes, though the 40 Nm of torque is admittedly on the lower end of the spectrum for e-bike torque ratings. At full power, the bike offers assist up to 20 mph (32 km/h), making it a Class 1 e-bike in the US.The Trek Dual Sport+ only has three pedal assist settings, but a torque sensor in the bottom bracket will help produce intuitive feeling electrical assist in all three power levels. The remote on the left side of the handlebars makes it easy to switch between power levels and check your battery charge level without taking up too much space with a large display.Powering that motor is a 250Wh battery hidden in the frame; Trek says it’s good for 35 miles (56 km) on a charge. An auxiliary battery is available as a range extender that sits in the water bottle holder and double that ranges to 70 miles (112 km).There’s no suspension to be had, but the 2″ tires should give a bit more relief with modest air pressure.The small motor and battery combination help the bike shed some poundage, weighing in at 38 lbs. (17.5 kg). Other features on the bike include a lower tier 9-speed Shimano Altus transmission, decent Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, and both front and rear LED lights. Racks and fenders aren’t included standard but there are mounting points for adding those accessories if you want to turn the bike into a commuter-ready two-wheeler.Though if you’re more focused on commuting, the Trek FX+ is likely the better option; it’s Trek’s second new model and is designed more for urban riding. Not only does it comes with a rear rack and fenders pre-installed, but it also marks one of Trek’s most affordable urban e-bike models yet with a price tag of just $2,499 for both the step-over and step-through models.Electronically, the Trek FX+ e-bikes offer much of the same components as we saw in the Trek Dual Sport+ models. There’s a 250W hub motor, 250Wh battery built into the frame, a minimalist remote/display on the handlebars and a torque sensor in the bottom bracket.The bike takes on a bit more of a street vibe with its geometry and slightly narrower tires. But a lot of the bones here are quite similar.Both bikes come in four sizes of S, M, L, and XL. They’re available either from Trek’s website or a local Trek dealer.Taken on their own, $2.4-$2.5k is a bit pricey for a hub motor e-bike, even if it does come with a torque sensor. But you’re also paying for more than just a spec sheet here. You’re getting the service and support of a large bicycle company with a worldwide dealer and service network.Are the bikes as well made as Trek’s $8k e-bikes? I doubt it. But are they better made than a one-size-fits-most $1.5k direct to consumer e-bike? You better believe it.So if you’re looking for bang for your buck, this probably isn’t it. But if you want a bike shop e-bike – and all the advantages plus the peace of mind that entails – I could see these Trek e-bikes as good options.",ebikes
2022/07/24,"Last month we featured an awesome DIY solar cargo trailer that an Electrek reader built for his electric bike. Just in case you needed any more proof that our readers are some of the handiest and most clever eco-DIYers on the planet, we’ve got another impressive solar-powered electric bike to show you. This time it does double duty as a school drop-off vehicle for the kids and a grocery getter.This build comes to us from Electrek reader Luke, who built this project during the pandemic with the goal of replacing a family car with a high-utility electric bike instead. He did so by heavily modifying his Rad Power Bikes RadWagon 4 electric cargo bike.While that bike is already an impressive cargo e-bike with plenty of utility, Luke made a number of upgrades to help the bike better perform the heavy-duty daily use he required of it.Before we even get to the solar addition, here’s a list of all the upgrades that Luke performed. First, he swapped out the stock controller for one with double the power. The new 1,500W controller is mounted underneath a varnished plywood platform that he built for the midframe. On top of that platform is a 200W DC-DC converter to provide a 12V outlet for any accessories Luke wants to run from the bike. He also painted it white to prevent it from heating up as much in the sun. Next to it is the solar charge controller, which we’ll get to in a minute. He used waterproof SAE connectors for all of the connections to make the system as water resistant as reasonably possible.It should be noted that doubling the power of the controller, which essentially doubles the power pulled from the battery and supplied to the motor, almost certainly voids the bike’s warranty. With Luke’s level of handiness though, I’m not sure he really needs the warranty anymore. From experience, I can also tell you that running your motor hotter with an overpowered controller can eventually fry the motor, especially if you push it too hard on hill climbing or other high-power scenarios. Luke is careful about his power delivery, though, to keep that in check, and he explained that if he ever does cook the motor, he’ll just replace it. Next, he swapped out the mechanical disc brakes for hydraulics, which he said has been a big improvement by reducing the need to adjust and tune the brakes. Hydraulic brakes don’t suffer from cable stretch, which can be exacerbated on heavy-hauling cargo e-bikes performing numerous stops while laden with kiddos and gear. He also added a suspension seat post to the saddle to help improve the ride on the rigid-frame bike.Finally, he added a solar setup, consisting of a 50W SunPower solar panel mounted on a custom lightweight plywood frame. He used foam door seals to reduce vibration and captive threaded inserts instead of nuts for a clean-looking install.The frame was connected to the Rad Power Bikes Conestoga accessory, mounted with Rad’s sun cover canopy shade.The solar panel feeds into a GenaSun MPPT boost charge controller to recharge the e-bike’s battery directly from the panel.The 50W solar panel trickle charges the battery, and a full day of sun would likely put around 50% of the battery’s charge back into it. In other words, as long as Luke uses around 50% or less of the battery per day, he likely would never need to plug the bike into an outlet to recharge.That is a distinct possibility since the bike gets used for two main tasks: dropping the kids off at school and doing grocery runs for the family. For the former, the kids sit in the back (and Luke added some gorilla grip tape to the floorboards so the wood wasn’t as slippery when wet). The front basket holds their backpacks on the way to school. The Rad Power Bikes Conestoga accessory solar panel is mounted above and includes a waterproof enclosure for the rear passengers. To keep himself dry, Luke used one of those Chinese scooter waterproof canopies. He didn’t have a photo of it in action, but explained that the bike “looks like a bright blue rickshaw when installed.” He explained that he only pulls it out for heavy rains but that it works well and can even withstand riding at speeds up to 35 km/h (22 mph) when properly tensioned in the front.For grocery runs, Luke puts a corrugated plastic box in the kid carrier and can fit around four grocery bags in it. It’s a slick solution that showcases how electric bicycles can be effective car replacers, even for more cargo-intensive tasks like shopping or carrying multiple passengers. This project involved much more extensive modifications than most people would need, but that also means Luke ended up with a one-of-a-kind electric bike that is perfect for his exact needs.In the past, we’ve seen other simplified electric bike solar-charging setups (which I also recreated myself) and even learned of cases where other riders have saved tens of thousands of dollars over several years by giving up their cars in favor of electric bikes.",ebikes
2022/07/22,"Electric mobility company OKAI has just launched its latest electric bicycle known as the OKAI Ranger – this is one electric bicycle that comes ready for action right out of the box.The OKAI Ranger is a fat tire electric bike with a sporty hardtail frame and front suspension fork. That puts it in something of the adventure e-bike class, likely competing head to head with establish e-bikes like the RadRover 6 or Aventon Aventure. Priced at $1,999 (though with a $100 sale currently still going on), the bike is a bit pricier than some others in this class.A 750W nominal and 1,000W peak-rated rear hub motor should give the two-wheeler plenty of acceleration, though the top speed is limited to just 20 mph (32 km/h). That should keep the Ranger classified as a Class 2 e-bike in the US, as opposed to Class 3 e-bikes that can reach higher speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h).The bike’s mechanical disc brakes aren’t quite as powerful as the hydraulic disc brakes that are quickly becoming standard on these types of e-bikes, but should be plenty for stops from 20 mph. Included front, rear, and side LED lights plus a fender set will also keep the bike effective at urban commuting roles when riders aren’t getting down and dirty on the trails.The bike is powered by a 48V and 14.7Ah battery with 705 Wh of capacity. It uses Samsung’s 21700 format cells and gets a claimed 45 miles (72 km) of range with a full charge.More than just a collection of mechanical components and e-bike drive parts, the OKAI Ranger sports some interesting tech housed in its stem. Instead of typical bicycle stem, the area that connects the handlebars to the rest of the bike, the Ranger has a beefier stem that houses a built-in LCD touchscreen display. There’s also a wired remote on the bars with physical buttons, just in case riders find it tricky to hit a moving target on the screen with their finger while riding at full speed.The color screen offers the usual ride data such as speed, battery charge, distance covered, power usage, etc. A range calculator also helps riders know how much distance they have left based on their current riding style.OKAI also has a fairly extensive app to give riders even more data and increased control over the bike’s parameters.An NFC-enabled key offers riders a secure way to lock and unlock the e-bike, though the app can also be used to unlock the e-bike over Bluetooth to avoid carrying a key card.The OKAI Ranger marks another new expansion for the electric mobility company. For years, OKAI has been the silent but ubiquitous producer of electric scooters and e-bikes for some of the largest shared mobility companies in the world. If you’ve ridden a shared e-bike or e-scooter recently, there’s a pretty good chance that OKAI built it before it was rebranded with the bright colors and catchy label of one of dozens of shared mobility operators.Having recently expanded into its own branded products, OKAI has developed electric two-wheelers in diverse categories. The company’s Beetle electric scooter offers a cute but slow-paced seated ride, while its Stride e-bike recently became the brand’s first full-size consumer electric bike.But the OKAI Ranger ups the ante with an even larger and more powerful e-bike designed for tackling serious off-road conditions.",ebikes
2022/07/21,"Eurobike 2022, one of the largest bicycle trade shows in the world, took on a new life this year as it moved to a larger venue in Frankfurt, Germany. Electrek was on site to check out all the latest news and unveilings from the electric bike world.We also want to thank Tern Bicycles for sponsoring our Eurobike coverage this year, which was perfect timing considering Tern’s two newest e-bike models were on full display at the event.First up among the new models on display was the Tern Quick Haul, which was designed to take Tern’s “right-sized” electric cargo bikes and distill the best features into a more affordable version for the masses.You may already be familiar with the Tern HSD and GSD electric bikes, two incredibly well-outfitted models that we’ve featured before. We even tested them out in our Eurobike coverage last year, but those e-bikes are quite pricey, starting at nearly $4k and increasing quickly from there.There’s good news though! For those that don’t have a fast stack of Benjamins burning a hole in their pocket, the new Tern Quick Haul starts at US $2,999 in the US and €2,999 in Europe. At those prices, it brings the high-end e-bike market back down to a price range that a wider range of riders can afford.Tern may have dropped the price, but they didn’t compromise on quality or performance. That means the bike still has a small format but heavy duty frame, awesome vertical parking rear rack, Bosch mid-drive motor, high quality hydraulic brakes and other important components. With that loadout, the Quick Haul is a heavy-hitting cargo e-bike that fits in a space that is much smaller than most cargo e-bikes.The bike is rated for loads up to 330 lb (150 kg), which means most riders will be able to carry a pile of cargo or even a passenger behind them. Tern’s wide range of child-carrying accessories make this a potent carpool bike for taking the kiddos to school.Not only did we get a chance to see the new Quick Haul for the first time in person, but we got the chance to test it out as well. Electrek’s publisher Seth Weintraub and I each took a Quick Haul for a test ride, swapping back and forth between a commuter spec model with panniers and a delivery model outfitted for a pizza company. You can see our test riding as well as the rest of our Eurobike coverage in the video below.The Quick Hauls were surprisingly nimble for cargo bikes, though that should be expected from their smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase than most long tail cargo bikes. Having ridden several Tern electric bikes now (both from the front and back seat, errr… child seat), I’m always impressed with how smoothly they ride, especially considering that they don’t have suspension. Perhaps the tighter tolerances and overall build quality simply shine through, making the bikes feel that much more solid and stable, even without the need for any suspension beneath you.Tern also showed off the company’s new NBD cargo e-bike, which also adopts a smaller format than most cargo e-bikes yet does so in a more accessible frame style.The step-through frame is even easier to mount for anyone with limited leg mobility and is perfect for literally anyone that doesn’t want to kick their kid in the head when swinging a leg over the rear child seat. I don’t know why step-through frames aren’t more common, especially for this type of applicaiton, but Tern definitely gets it.We’ll be back with a more in-depth article and video on our testing experience with the Tern Quick Haul soon, so be on the lookout for that shortly.I’ve had the pleasure of using a Swytch electric bike conversion kit before, where the major innovation is the battery with built-in controller that gets mounted on the handlebars.It was a slick-looking setup when I tested it a couple years ago, but nothing could have prepared me for the awesome update to the kit on display at Eurobike 2022.The previous kit used a fabric-covered bag design, but the latest update eschews the bag for an awesome looking slim profile battery. It looks like something you’d keep in your pocket to recharge your cell phone, yet is a fully-enclosed electric bike battery system.There are actually two models, one with a 90 Wh battery and another with a 180 Wh battery. The smaller battery is even airline compliant thanks to its small capacity. The rest of the kit mostly consists of a front wheel hub motor that isn’t really anything special by itself. But when combined with Swytch’s battery pack and control electronics, it turns into a slick-looking and nearly universal electric bike kit that fits nearly any bike out there.The Barcelona-based e-bike brand eXXite was on hand to show off its latest futuristic-looking electric bikes.In addition to the long-awaited Xone, the company showed off multiple follow-on models and a very interesting Android-based display. The open source EIVA display not only shows you all of your e-bike ride data via the eXXite app, but you can even load any other apps you’d like thanks to its Android operating system. That means Google Maps, social media or any other app you want to have at your fingertips can be loaded onto your e-bike display.And of course I had to hop up on an eXXite e-bike on a trainer to give the company’s RegenFit feature another try. The setup allows riders to use the regenerative braking feature of the e-bike to charge the battery while the bike rests on a trainer, which means riders get to put in some real fitness riding and then ride off later using electricity that they generated themselves. The secret comes from eXXite’s custom engineering in the motor. At certain speeds it can freeze its clutch, which allows it to offer regenerative braking while still offering resistance-free rolling that you generally only get from common clutch-based geared e-bike motors.Rayvolt, which is the more retro-inspired electric bike brand from the founders of eXXite, occupied the other half of eXXite’s booth.There the brand showed off some of the most elegant and beautiful e-bikes I’ve seen anywhere in the world. I’ve travelled thousands of miles in the past just to see these e-bikes in person and test them out.Now that Rayvolt is expanding into so many new countries, though, riders all over the world are getting to experience these beautiful machines.I recently had the opportunity to test the Äike T electric scooter at its factory in Tallinn, Estonia. But at Eurobike, we got the chance to test both the Äike T and the Äike 11, a scooter-sharing version designed for scooter rental companies.Äike completely rethought what should go into an electric scooter, offering a unique design with single side-supported wheels, automotive style tires, a USB-C charging battery pack, a wide deck, and high tech connectivity features.The scooter rides smoothly and is one of the most stable scooters I’ve tested. In fact, I watched the CEO of the company Kristjan Maruste ride it hands-free, which is normally impossible on most electric scooters due to the twitchy steering and instability of smaller wheels.The Äike T is definitely a game changer in the electric scooter industry, and its local European manufacturing makes it pretty much the only e-scooter built outside of Asia. I’m excited to see what else Äike has up its sleeve.Fellow Estonian company comodule had a number of different light electric vehicles at its booth representing several of the manufacturers that use Comodule’s IoT suite of electronics.You probably didn’t know it (I sure didn’t!), but some of the biggest names in the e-bike and e-scooter industries use Comodule’s gear to connect their rides.Comodule’s tech doesn’t just help the Äike T become one of the smartest e-scooters on the block, but has also found its way into electric two-wheelers from Super73, CAKE, Harley-Davidson’s Serial 1 and others.Comodule produces its own hardware and software at its Tallinn, Estonia factory and has grown into a powerhouse in the light electric vehicle connectivity industry. If there was an award for the most visually striking electric bike at Eurobike, Noordung would be in the running. This beautiful and retro-inspired design takes a classy black colorway and uses sweeping frame tubes to create a beautiful work of art that also happens to be a rideable electric bike.The battery looks like a vintage moped’s top tank design, which will likely be divisive in the e-bike community but was at least executed in an impressive way. Whether or not you appreciate the taste, you have to admit that they executed it nicely. The cast wheels add to the minimalist look of the bike by removing traditional spokes. A lack of visible wires and cables help complete the look and are the cherry on top.We’ve had a blast testing out Carbo’s lightweight carbon fiber folding electric bike in the past, but this time the company was at Eurobike to demonstrate a new app that is designed to add even more features to their bikes.My favorite part of the updated app was the turn by turn navigation directions that not only get displayed in the app, but can be paired to the e-bike’s own native display. That means you can have your phone in your pocket but still get turn-by-turn directions right on the bike’s display. And considering how small the display is, that’s a seriously big innovation!Blubrake’s antilock braking was on full display, along with a new partnership struck between Blubrake and Shimano to pair the two companies’ expertise into a complete electric bike anti-lock braking package.We had the chance to test out Blubrake’s ABS on a Stromer electric bike, and I can confirm that this stuff works well. I couldn’t lock up the front wheel even when I went full-on panic braking. It keeps riders safer without the risk of going over the bars in a front wheel lockup situation.I don’t know how long it will take for this type of technology to become standard, but it couldn’t come soon enough. Anti-lock brakes on e-bikes could surely save dozens of crashes per day from riders accidentally locking up their front wheels. Any technology that makes e-bikes safer for riders is a win in my book!Speaking of anti-lock braking, Bosch was also on hand to show off a new ABS system for electric bikes; it was just one of a number of new announcements from the leading electric bike drive maker.Other new products from Bosch include a new alarm system built into the e-bike drive that can help protect riders’ most prized two-wheeled possessions by warding off potential thieves, a new Cargo mode for the company’s cargo drives that helps with smoother starts and power delivery specifically for cargo e-bikes, and a new Auto mode that helps to automatically adjust the drive’s parameters based on current riding conditions.Mountain bikers using Bosch drives will likely enjoy a new hill hold feature to keep the e-bike from rolling back, as well as a new minimalist display that makes it harder to damage your screen in a crash – something many electric mountain bikers will be familiar with.Bosch also showed off its latest e-bike batteries, including the PowerTubes 500 and 625 and the PowerPacks 545 and 725, offering some of the highest capacities available from European mid-drive e-bike makers.Not to be outdone, Chinese motor giant Bafang was also present to show of the brand’s latest developments. We recently covered news surrounding Bafang’s latest transmission, a three-speed automatic shifting internally geared hub. The high-tech IGH is designed to predict shift points based on wheel cadence and should be strong enough for most e-bike drives up to around 80 Nm, though the torquiest of Bafang’s motors will still likely be too powerful for this new transmission.Bafang also makes a number of smaller motors, plus a range of batteries and other e-bike components, all of which were on display.Croation electric bike maker Greyp showed off the latest model in its lineup, the Greyp T5.0.This rigid fork version of the company’s popular trekking bike is the first fully rigid bike in the brand’s lineup. The bike is designed for commuters and trail riders that want a high quality e-bike full of Greyp’s high tech parts (two cameras, anyone?!) but don’t necessarily need to the full-suspension ride of Greyp’s flagship G6 line of e-bikes.Canadian electric speed controller company ASI shared with us several of the brand’s tiny yet powerful controllers. It’s incredible how much power can fit in something the size of your fist. I had 6 kW of controller sitting in the palm of my hand. Mind-blowing!ASI’s controllers are often used for hot-rodding powerful e-bikes like the Sur Ron electric trail bike, but the company has also expanded into light electric four-wheeled vehicles (think golf cart-sized vehicles) that require powerful yet compact controllers and electronics.ASI’s specialization in high quality and high efficient motor controller designs has helped it become a leader in the field, and seeing the controllers in person definitely helps you realize why.I was particularly interested in checking out the Honbike U4 electric bike, having covered the product’s announcement just before the beginning of Eurobike.The simplistic-looking design uses a modified X-frame with a slightly off-axis top tube that results in a visually striking design.While the last Honbike we tested used a fancy driveshaft in a folding frame, the Honbike U4 opts for a Gates belt drive instead to create a lighter and more cost effective drive solution. The reduced complexity helps drop the production cost of the U4, which is critical in the highly competitive electric bicycle market. Sticking with a belt drive though ensures that riders won’t have to deal with maintenance related to chain drives.The Honbike U4’s design is definitely unique, but that might be just what the company needs to help steal customers away from other visually defined e-bikes like those from VanMoof, Cowboy, and other European manufacturers.Kkurad has some of the wildest-looking fully-enclosed electric bike-based vehicles we’ve seen so far; I call them electric bike-based since they seem like they could reach beyond a mere e-bike.Take for instance this electric cargo bike that is essentially a light electric truck. Sure, it’s got a set of pedals and an e-bike motor, but this thing is so big that I’m not sure I’d want to see it coming at me in the bike lane.The company also produces fully enclosed velomobile electric bikes that offer similar efficiency to electric road bikes but in a weatherproof package that will keep you dry in the rain.Parts of Eurobike include geographic groupings of e-bike companies and parts suppliers. In one section that became a de facto Koreatown, a number of Korean brands had some fascinating products on display.A company called HeFlow had a hydrogen-powered electric bike system that they demonstrated on a four-wheeled quadricycle. That was just a concept vehicle, but the company said that the tech for the actual hydrogen setup is ready to be commercialized and could be installed on more conventional electric bikes. A 1-minute recharge of the small hydrogen tank is apparently enough for 150 km of range (93 miles), making it much faster than charging a lithium-ion battery.The brand Korea Mobility showed off one of my favorite e-bikes of the show, a hubless e-bike that looks like a straight up Tron cycle. I’m not sure how it rides or how effective that suspension is, but I love what they’re doing and the design is so striking that it speaks for itself. I’d love to roll up on one of these some day!The aptly-named KoreaBike company brought out two complimentary products that are both produced locally in Korea: electric bikes and portable power stations. The company not only has its own e-bike factory, but also builds the batteries itself instead of ordering completed battery packs for final assembly. KoreaBike’s carbon fiber Carlos model looked particularly impressive, and is available in both a hard tail and a full-suspension version.As the company pointed out, they hope to be particularly attractive to European importers seeking to avoid tariffs on Chinese-made e-bikes, since Korean-made e-bikes aren’t subject to the same punishing anti-dumping taxes.Can you really call an e-bike show complete if Super73 doesn’t make an appearance? This California-based electric bike brand has largely defined the electric minibike scene since the mid-2010’s.While we largely think of Super73 as an American brand, they’ve developed quite a following in Germany where many riders have embraced the Americana theme and generally excessive design of the bikes.Last year we even had the chance to steal a couple of Super73’s e-bikes from Eurobike and go on a bit of a Eurotrip across Germany with the highly capable fat tire e-bikes.You can check out that story here – it’s definitely worth the read!Lightweight carbon fiber road e-bikes aren’t rare, but affordably-priced ones sure are! And that’s exactly what Urtopia is trying to do with its slick-looking e-bikes.The company’s 30 lb (13.6 kg) e-bike had a successful Indiegogo campaign earlier this year where it raised over $3 million, proving there’s a market for affordable featherweight e-bikes.The $2,599 price certainly seems like a lot compared to budget e-bikes, but you don’t get a belt-drive carbon fiber e-bike for a song, and this price is unheard of with these tech features (did I mention the fingerprint scanner?!).The last time I saw a Brompton electric bike, I was a bit underwhelmed. The bolt-on battery bag just seemed like something out of a high school senior design project.But the latest models are looking much better with the battery nicely hidden behind a cargo carrying bag.I’ve had nice experiences on pedal Brompton bikes, and so I have no doubt that this electric version is going to be a convenient and effective solution as well. And now that the design looks presentable, I could actually imagine being seen on one of these!That’s all, folks! We’ve got another year to wait for Eurobike 2023, but let’s hear what was your favorite part of this year’s show. Drop us a few words in the comment section below so we can see what you enjoyed from the wide range of e-bikes presented this year!",ebikes
2022/07/20,"Jinhua, China-based FREY Bike has just launched its first-ever hub motor electric bike, introducing the lower-cost FREY Runner to the brand’s lineup.The move is significant because FREY has long been a high-end electric mountain bike manufacturer that has focused on powerful mid-drive motors.That focus on high-end design has historically also pushed the brand’s prices into the $3,000 to $5,000 range for many of FREY’s popular electric mountain bikes.But the new FREY Runner with a more economical hub motor drivetrain starts at just $2,580. That might sound like a premium over the many low-cost e-bikes on the market, but FREY has always specced their e-bikes with higher-end components designed to withstand harder riding.My first run-in with FREY bikes was at a bike park in China where riders more skilled than myself sent these things soaring several meters in the air. Don’t try that with your local direct-to-consumer e-bike!The FREY Runner is available with either 29″ or 27.5″ wheels, and there are three frame sizes for each wheel spec available: M, L, and XL.The bike may offer a simplified drivetrain in the form of a hub motor, but that doesn’t prevent it from coming with many of the same higher-quality components found on the rest of FREY’s e-bikes.That means a RockShox Recon fork (either 29″ or 27.5″ depending on the wheel size selected), four-piston Tektro HD hydraulic disc brakes, Maxxis tires, Shimano Alivio 9-speed transmission, and a huge 48V 21Ah battery for 1,008 Wh of capacity.The battery is nicely enclosed in the aluminum frame’s downtube, though it can be unlocked and removed for transporting the bike or charging the battery remotely.The battery powers three different motor options, depending on where you ride. Bafang hub motors rated for either 250W, 500W, or 1,000W are available as options. Europeans will likely have to settle for the smallest motor option due to local power regulations, while other areas will be able to take full advantage of FREY’s two larger motor options.All of the motors are paired with a torque sensor in the pedal assist system to offer responsive and intuitive-feeling performance.Designed for touring and bikepacking, the FREY Runner comes with an included rear rack. It is also rated for a load of up to 150 kg (330 lb), which means it can carry both large riders and large gear loads. The bike itself weighs between 27.2 to 29.5 kg (60 to 65 lb) depending on the motor selected.FREY hasn’t released speed specs yet, though the company’s other e-bikes are known to reach speeds in excess of 30 mph (51 km/h) when unlimited. The FREY Runner likely won’t be quite as fast, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see the 1,000W model still offering speeds high enough to max out the Class 3 or speed pedelec limits of 28 mph (45 km/h).This type of touring electric bike has become a popular category, offering double-duty use as a trail bike and an urban bike. They are a bit more popular in Europe than in the US market, but the more rugged design required for trail riding has led some urban riders to favor this style for its longevity and higher build quality.While I haven’t had the chance to test this specific FREY model yet, I’ve ridden a number of the company’s other e-bikes and have always been impressed with their value. The bikes combine high-quality parts with lower-cost production (and a nearly nonexistent marketing budget), meaning they can rival the bigger European brands in performance at a fraction of the cost. The downside though is that they don’t yet have a robust European or US dealer network and shipping times can sometimes be lengthy.While we wait to see the first Runners head stateside, check out my last review of a FREY e-bike below.",ebikes
2022/07/19,"What happens when you’re an electric bike manufacturer trying to solve the issue of urban congestion, but there’s too much traffic to deliver your solution effectively? As Swedish mobility company Vässla recently discovered, the answer is to go (even more) all in on e-bikes.Back in 2017, Vässla’s Founder Rickard Bröms was tired of dealing with soul-crushing traffic and decided to develop light electric two-wheelers that could slice through a city quicker and more efficiently. But after recently expanding into Paris, the company found that it was that same traffic congestion that was preventing them from actually delivering their e-bikes (which are legally classified as electric bicycles in France and several other countries, though may have other designations as micro e-bikes or seated scooters in other areas due to the lack of pedals).If only it happened 25 years earlier, Vassla’s problem would have been a perfect addition to Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic.”Vässla prides itself on being a full-service company, meaning they not only bring customers a new Vässla e-bike right to their doors, but also show up at customers’ doors in the event that any service or support requires a trained technician. The company currently delivers its electric bikes by electric van and use Google Maps as a route planner to find the most efficient routing based on current city congestion. But they’re still limited to a paltry 8-10 bike deliveries per day — not nearly enough. “Our bottleneck right now is definitely deliveries,” Rickard explained to Electrek.Instead of adding more electric vans to the fleet and only compounding Paris’ traffic problems, Vässla decided to go all in on e-bikes and switch to cargo e-bikes for deliveries.The company is currently evaluating various cargo e-bike options and plans to settle on a cargo bike with two trailers on back, each capable of holding five Vässla bikes. Making use of bike routes, a single rider towing two bike trailers could then deliver 10 bikes in a fraction of the time it takes a van to navigate the city’s roads.Rickard plans to start with two bikes to perform 20 deliveries per day, though hopes to scale from there. And scalability is easy, as it just means adding more e-bikes and trailers.In a city like Paris, such e-bike deliveries are proving easier and easier. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has taken an aggressive approach to making the city friendlier to cyclists, pedestrians, and basically every form of alternative transportation.The most important thing about this amazing Paris transformation is how fast it happened — how fast people on bikes “appeared” — once streets were transformed. You can’t write this off as “Paris was always this way,” because it wasn’t. It took leadership. pic.twitter.com/RY3C7XcTOlIt’s a move that is becoming more common in cities around the world as residents demand more accessible urban planning.The concept of walkable cities that are designed to prioritize the mobility of people over cars has led to calls for changes across much of Europe and the US.In many cases that means repurposing car lanes and on-street parking into dedicated lanes for public transportation or bike lanes, as well as expanding sidewalks and pedestrian streets.Many cities are banning cars in downtown areas or introducing congestion pricing to disincentivize driving in the most crowded urban areas.Europe has also taken a lead in government-sponsored incentives for commuters to switch to two-wheeled vehicle as a way to de-emphasize the roles of cars in cities.Some countries have begun offering tax incentives that essentially pay citizens to cycle to work instead of using a car.Belgium recently made headlines when it increased its bike-to-work incentive to €0.25 per kilometer (approximately US $0.45 per mile), according to the Light Electric Vehicle Association.But Belgium isn’t alone in offering cash in exchange for pedaling to work. The Netherlands offers nearly as much, and the UK offers even more. A mileage allowance of around USD $0.26 per mile is available to British cyclists who use their bikes to commute to work, according to the World Economic Forum.The UK also offers a lease-to-own incentive program that rewards cyclists with discounted bikes and cycling gear.",ebikes
2022/07/18,"HeyBike makes moves in the eBike industry, by upgrading on their very popular Mars electric bike. The new Mars Hyper comes with upgraded components, fit and finish and even some regalia. With a limited run of only 500 units, this bike could sell out this season.While HeyBike has a variety of bikes, from the beastly HeyBike Explore to the affordable HeyBike Ranger, the Mars Hyper inches the brand into something a bit more exclusive and higher end. With yellow and black matte finish paint, the bike looks incredibly good for such a unique frame. The fat stubby tires are countered by the 10 spoke alloy wheels, and make for a clean look for a bike packed with features.The standout upgrades on the Hyper Mars is the larger capacity battery pack. Rocking a 48v 15ah battery, this little tank can reach a range of up to 55 miles. Even at full throttle, I would expect a range of 30 miles without pedaling at all. Like other HeyBike models, the Mars Hyper has the battery secured in place with a locking rail in the center of the bike. The balance of weight combined with security and ease of access makes this battery intensely pragmatic, albeit, not hidden at all. All that battery power is sent to the 500w geared hub motor in the rear of the bike. The motor is incorporated into the solid alloy wheels, which adds much more than a sleek powerhouse. The alloy wheels are a great choice for this little slugger of a folding bike, since the wheels never need any maintenance with wheel truing, and can typically hold a higher payload. HeyBike hasn’t yet updated their site, but these alloy wheels enable the Mars Hyper to hold more weight than the regular Mars model. Another great cargo feature is the rear cargo rack, which can hold up to 100lbs of gear over the rear tire. Regular side panniers and trunk bags can fit, and with some straps, very creative things can be carried on this pint-sized punter. With 20” x 4” fat tires, the Mars Hyper has the ability to scale urban jungles and off-road adventures alike. While the tires aren’t the most durable for long-term street use, they are incredibly comfortable and tacky on account of the sheer air volume and surface contact. With the center of gravity being much lower, folding electric bikes like these make off-road riding a comically easy affair. The 160mm mechanical disc brakes are super easy to maintain, and provide decent stopping power both on the roads and brush.Still, the Mars Hyper is a folding bike, and can be folded down into a compact shape rather easily. With the flick of the pedals, frame latch, handlebars and stem, the Mars Hyper has all the transport utility of any folding fat tire electric bike. With the bike taking up a more usable space, it can fit in many trunks, closets, under a desk, or garage corner. Unfortunately, the battery capacity is much too large to legally fly on airlines, but the whole thing can still travel in a boat.The HeyBike Mars Hyper is coming in at $1,499. As an upgrade to the original Mars, that’s a good price for the extra capacity and the alloy wheels alone. On top of that, the better display and all the trappings of an exclusive bike make for a great value for the commuter and adventurer alike. Also keep an eye out for another new e-bike model from HeyBike slated to arrive in September. Check out the links below to shop for your very own HeyBike:",ebikes
2022/07/18,"The Propella 7S electric bike is many things. It’s lightweight. It’s good looking. It’s affordable. The one thing it isn’t, is overly complicated. This e-bike is as simple as it gets and that is part of what makes it so attractive as a commuter e-bike.If you remember our review of the Propella SS 4.0 last summer, you’ll already be familiar with the most important aspects of the Propella 7S. The SS is simply the single-speed version of this bike, and otherwise is mostly identical.While I enjoyed the SS as a great urban e-bike for flat cities, the 7S model adds a 7-speed transmission that is sure to be praised by commuters living in hillier areas and that want the ability to downshift for hill climbing or upshift for flat land speed.You can check out my test riding of the Propella 7S in my succinct video review below. For an even more detailed analysis, though, keep reading afterwards for all of the details.When it comes to the Propella 7S, you have to go into this e-bike knowing what it’s for and what it isn’t for.This is an urban-oriented e-bike, which means it is meant to be light and efficient. Tipping the scales at 37 lb (16.8 kg), it weighs significantly less than many other urban e-bikes we’ve seen.It isn’t a powerhouse since it has a relatively small 250 watt motor, but it still puts out a peak of 400 watts to give you the extra power you need on acceleration or hill climbing.But this isn’t some motorcycle in an e-bike’s clothing. This is the epitome of an electric bicycle designed for pedaling. It’s a Class 1 e-bike, meaning it lacks a throttle and operates only on pedal assist. You get five levels of pedal assist to choose from ranging from Level 1, where you’re doing most of the work, all the way up to Level 5, where you basically just have to lightly spin the pedals and let the motor do the work for you.At full speed it will get you up to 18.5 mph, which might sound like an odd figure but is likely there because it translates to 30 km/h. I would have loved to see them give us that extra 1.5 mph allowable under Class 1 e-bike laws, as 20 mph would have felt perfect. But even so, you don’t really notice such a small difference, and the slightly lower top speed likely helps squeeze out another mile or two in range.The small and lightweight battery may not sound like it has much capacity, measuring just 250 Wh, but those Samsung cells seem to be sipping energy through a coffee stirrer instead of a milkshake straw. If you keep it in Level 1 or 2 pedal assist, you can practically go all day. But if you tend to use high power mode most of the time, expect to drop your range from 40-ish miles to closer to 20-ish miles. Level 5 pedal assist will garner even less, but I rarely ride around in Level 5 because it just doesn’t require much pedal input. Instead, Level 3 seems like my sweet spot to feel like I’m part of the process but not overly exerting myself to the point where I’m working up a sweat.So between the 400 W peak-rated motor and 250 Wh battery, you seem to get a pretty decent electrical side to the bike. But what about the mechanical side? The minimalist aluminum frame is adorned with narrow urban street tires and sexy blue anodized rims. The blue bar ends match the rims and make a nice accent to a slick-looking e-bike. When you add in the 7-speed gear set and grabby Shimano disc brakes, you’ve got some very nice and effective parts on a budget-oriented e-bike (normally priced at US $1,249 but currently on sale at the time of this review for just $1,099).The two big things I feel like the bike are missing are fenders and LED lights. To be fair, Propella has a set of fenders and rechargable LED lights that they’ll sell you. You can also pick up a rear rack while you’re at it. But I always love seeing these parts included on commuter-oriented e-bikes because they are such essential components. I’ve made the same complaint against other popular lightweight urban e-bikes too, so Propella is far from the only one I’ll call out on that note.The other thing I’ll ding Propella on is charging a $50 shipping fee. I’m not saying that it isn’t fair. To be honest, they almost certainly pay more than $50 to ship the bike to you. But free shipping (i.e. shipping included in the price) has become nearly standard across the e-bike industry in the US, and so I would have loved to see that here to make the bike’s price easier to compare against other companies.But all things considered, Propella has still done a great job at creating an effective and attractive urban commuter e-bike. Not only is it one of the few electric bikes in this nearly $1,000 price class that actually looks quite good, but it also comes with brand-name parts despite the entry-level price. Shimano brakes and shifter, CST tires, Samsung battery cells, Bafang motor. All the big names are there instead of the cheaper imitation parts. So props to Propella for making a slick-looking, easy-riding and simple to use electric bike that comes in at an affordable price. For those that need the comfort of a multi-gear bike but still want something minimalist and classy looking, it’s hard to go wrong here. The only riders I’d warn to steer clear are those that have their hearts set on either suspension or high power. For everyone else, this bike is definitely one to keep on your list.",ebikes
2022/07/17,"Anti-lock brakes might sound like old tech in cars (and motorcycles to a certain extent), but another two-wheeler has had to deal with brake lockup since its invention – the bicycle. But two different companies have just shown off competing anti-lock braking (ABS) systems designed for e-bikes to improve safety and performance.Electric bikes make prime candidates for ABS brakes. Not only do they put on more miles and travel at higher speeds than pedal bicycles, but they carry an onboard battery that is perfect for running the electronics required by ABS brakes.Rear wheel lockup usually isn’t a problem on a bicycle and, in fact, is often used on purpose for performing slides since it simply means the rear wheel drags along harmlessly. But front wheel lockup threatens bicycle stability, either by having the front wheel slip sideways (if in a turn) or by causing the rear wheel to lift up (if traveling straight). With high enough speed, this can cause a wipeout in a turn or an over-the-bars crash when riding straight. Neither are great options, and most cyclists try to keep both wheels firmly on the ground at all times.Experienced riders can often modulate front braking power to mitigate wheel lockup when it begins, but this is a slowly acquired skill, often developed over the course of several skinned elbows and knees. And despite what many mountain bikers may think, computer-controlled ABS will always react faster than the meat computer under their helmets.ABS for bikes promises to remove the danger of front wheel lockup, allowing riders to brake harder in performance scenarios, like racing and mountain biking, or to simply panic brake without the consequence of crashing due to front wheel lockup.Blubrake has had a functional ABS setup for e-bikes for some time now but has just teamed up with bicycle component behemoth Shimano to offer the combined Blubrake/Shimano ABS for electric bikes. The system uses an actuator mounted low on the fork that runs in-line with the hydraulic brake line for the front brake caliper. When the system detects that the front wheel has slowed compared to the rear wheel, indicating an impending lockup, it quickly releases the brake pressure on the front disc rotor. The result is a slight pulsing sensation in the brake lever and the inability to actually lock up the front wheel.We tested the Blubrake system a few days ago at the Eurobike 2022 trade show and were unable to lock up the front wheel, even with hard panic braking.Bosch also unveiled an updated ABS as part of the company’s new product announcements at Eurobike.The actuation of the system is similar to Blubrake’s, in that a proprietary black box sits in-line with the hydraulic brake line on the bike’s front fork, interrupting the brake line when it senses that the front wheel is locking up. It is currently only compatible with brakes from Magura, but Bosch plans to open the system to other brake manufacturers as well.We tested the Bosch ABS setup on two different bikes – a full suspension mountain bike and a front-loading cargo bike. Both represent interesting real world scenarios where anti-lock brakes would be a huge improvement. For electric mountain bikes, riders can corner harder and brake quicker without having to modulate the front brake themselves to avoid lockup. The computerized wheel speed sensor will always react quicker than a human, meaning riders can improve their track times with ABS.For a front loading cargo bike that is designed to carry children or heavy cargo, a front wheel lockup leading to a crash could be disastrous. But even with an empty front bucket, which is a perfect recipe for locking up a lightly loaded front wheel, I was unable to lock up the wheel when using the Bosch ABS.We even hit up a patch of gravel to give the system a worst-case scenario, finding that the Bosch ABS kicked in perfectly to bring the bike to a quick and safe stop without locking up the front wheel.Check out Electrek’s Seth Weintraub grabbing a couple fistfuls of brake in a patch of gravel below.",ebikes
2022/07/17,"Have you ever thought to yourself, “I’d love an electric bicycle, but it’d be even more convenient if the battery fit into my pocket?” OK, fine, but lots of people actually have. And the UK-based e-bike conversion kit company Swytch made it happen with the newest edition of the brand’s easy-to-use electric bike conversion kit.I got the chance to see the new kit in person at Eurobike a few days ago and even take a couple of quick test laps on a bike equipped with the updated kit.Longtime Electrek readers might remember that we originally tested out Swytch’s electric bike conversion kit in the past when I used it to simply and easily convert my Merida city bike into an electric bike.I was already a big fan of the small format battery, but the company has now taken its handlebar-mounted power packs to the next level with a totally new battery design.The update includes a new handlebar mount that clamps into a rigid plastic case housing the battery. But unlike most e-bike batteries that are the size of a small fire extinguisher, the Swytch battery is the size of those graphing calculators you probably used in high school trig class.That means you could conceivably carry the battery in your pocket, at least if you have functional pockets. (Sorry to all the ladies out there with their form-over-function pockets.)Another cool part about the kit is that the new battery system is backward compatible. So if you’re one of the tens of thousands of people that already have the previous generation Swytch e-bike kit installed on your bike, but you want to upgrade your battery to the newest model, you don’t have to replace the rest of the kit. You can simply get a new battery, and you’ll be off to the races.The rest of the kit is fairly standard, consisting of a basic hub motor designed to swap onto the front wheel of a bike. It hits 25 km/h (15 mph) in Europe and 32 km/h (20 mph) in the US, and it gets a standard-issue 250W label.It’s nothing fancy, but it gets the job done and it’s how most e-bikes in the world are built. Hub motors are simple and effective, so there just isn’t much left to innovate there. Instead, Swytch focused on innovating on the battery side, which has a much larger impact on riders.And the beauty of that innovation is that all of the electronics are built into the battery itself, meaning the kit is nearly universally compatible with any bicycle. I’ve personally installed past Swytch kits on a folding Brompton bike with 16″ wheels and a hybrid urban bike with 700c wheels. Swytch even likes to show off a hilarious penny farthing bike that they’ve converted to electric.Basically, any bike with wheels can be converted using the Swytch kit.As the company explained:It is the only electric bike system that is compatible with almost any type of bicycle. If your bike has handlebars and a front wheel, the Swytch kit will be compatible – with only a few small exceptions. The wheel size of your bike doesn’t matter – we can build the motor wheel in any size for any bike.The batteries are available in two sizes. There’s the Swytch Air that packs in 90 Wh for 15 km (9 miles) of range and the Swytch Max with 180 Wh for 30 km (18 miles) of range.That might not sound like much range – and it’s not. But the whole idea is that the kit is for short urban trips. And if you really need extra range, it’s as simple as carrying a second battery in your pocket.Plus the cool thing about the 90 Wh Swytch Air battery pack is that it is airline compliant at under 100 Wh of capacity, meaning you could bring your e-bike on vacation and legally carry the battery onto the plane in your backpack.The small size also means they don’t need to charge an arm and a leg for the kit. The two kits are both marked down by 50% during the promotional pre-order period. An entire Switch Air kit, which also includes the front wheel motor, mounting hardware for the handlebars, LED display, and charger, will currently set you back just €599 (US $604). The larger Swytch Max kit is currently on sale for just €749 (US $756). Both of those prices include a generous 50% discount off the MSRP.Swytch, which has been in operation since 2017, has spent most of the past few years catching up to huge demand. The company has often been in a pre-order period while rushing to produce enough conversion kits to fulfill customer orders. The recently announced new version of the kit has also led to a surge in demand, meaning Swytch is still playing catch up with manufacturing. The full retail price is expected to come back into effect once the kits are in stock, but the company is offering the pre-order price for those that want to get in line early and wait for their kits. Don’t take out your credit card just yet though, as the next pre-order period likely won’t open until September.Until then, let’s all just appreciate how beautiful these slim e-bike batteries truly are!",ebikes
2022/07/14,"When Addmotor unveiled its E-53 City Pro electric bike recently, it showed off one of the biggest batteries in the industry: 48V and 20Ah of capacity for a nearly 1 kWh of energy between the rider’s knees. But the bike wasn’t only about big batteries and long range. It also included a number of commuter-worthy features and components designed to turn the Addmotor E-53 City Pro electric bike into an ideal everyday runabout electric bike.The obvious big draw to this e-bike is its massive 960 Wh battery. That is well above average these days, especially considering that the bike still comes in at a reasonable $1,599 price.Addmotor tells us the bike can go 125 miles on a charge, though if you read the fine print then you’ll discover that range is only possible at 8 mph (13 km/h) in pedal assist level 1 on flat ground with a lower than average weight rider.Suffice it to say that you will likely not achieve the full 125 miles of range, but that the huge battery will still take you farther than most other e-bikes. On throttle only at 12 mph (20 km/h), Addmotor claims a 90-mile range (145 km). If you push it to the top speed of 20 mph on throttle only riding, expect closer to 40-45 miles of range (64-72 km).That’s still quite good, and is a testament to just what can be achieved with a big ol’ battery. I have other commuter e-bikes that have half as much battery and I struggle to achieve 20 miles of range. So getting 40-45 is a huge step up in the e-bike industry.There’s more to this story than just a big battery though. The E-53 is also a very nicely designed commuter e-bike.It checks my main three boxes for commuter e-bikes, meaning it comes standard with LED lights, built-in fenders, and a rear rack. And fortunately for us, all three of those parts are quality.For the LED lights, they are reasonably bright and the rear even comes with turn signals, though I don’t know how many car drivers will notice them. At night they might slightly indicate your turning intentions, but the blinkers are so close together that I doubt they’ll make too much of a difference. This is a common issue with electric bike and scooter turn signals that are mounted close to the bike’s centerline. I’d still signal with my hands, but at least it’s a cool feature to have.The fenders are aluminum fenders, not cheap plastic ones. That means they stay in place and have a nice rigid feel to them. If you hit a pothole, they aren’t going to shake around and flop like a fish, which is my biggest pet peeve of cheap plastic fenders.The rear rack is also nice and sturdy. It comes with a 55 lb. (25 kg) weight rating, meaning you know they tested it to even higher levels if their lawyers let them put that figure on it. This isn’t some cheap rack for carrying one grocery bag – it could support a child or other heavy cargo easily.The rest of the bike also sports a nice combination of components. 100 mm of travel (4 inches) is plenty for a suspension fork, and honestly is probably more than most people need for casual city riding. The 7-speed Shimano transmission is basic but acceptable for commuter use. It’s not going to win any awards for robustness, but it’s another “get the job done” type of part for casual city riders. The hydraulic disc brakes are a very nice addition to see, especially at this price point.The Kenda tires offer a compromise of an urban tire with a checkerboard pattern that splits the difference between smooth and knobby tires. The tread itself is smooth on each square, yet the checkerboard gives you better grip if you do take it on some light trails. And with that suspension fork up front, you’ll be tempted to hit your local Rails to Trails or other nature trail route, assuming e-bikes are allowed.Even the smaller notes like adjustable angle stem to dial in the handlebar height and a grab handle under the seat for easier maneuvering of the bike are great additions that make the Addmotor E-53 City Pro a pleasure to use.If I could change one thing about the bike, it would probably be to boost the power a bit. Yes, the 500W continuous-rated motor actually gets closer to 900 watts of peak power, but I feel like the bike could have a bit more oomph on take off. Perhaps they kept the power slightly more modest to eke out more range, which wouldn’t be a bad thing. But those wanting extra power might want to look for a bike with a 750W continuous-rated motor instead of a 500W power plant. Even so, I’d say Addmotor did an excellent job designing and executing this e-bike. It’s not overly fancy, but it’s a reasonably priced commuter electric bike with a nice inclusion of parts and features. For $1,599, it’s hard to say the Addmotor E-53 with its big battery, comfortable design, and proper performance aren’t worth it.",ebikes
2022/07/12,"Eurobike is the premier bicycle trade show in Europe and one of the largest in the world. This year – for the first time – it’s taking place in Frankfurt, Germany. Once upon a time, electric bikes were a small corner of the show. But times have changed, and these days the main attractions are all the innovative e-bikes on display.Electrek will be on the show floor right when the doors open to bring you the latest and greatest news and debuts from the bicycling world. This year we’re excited to partner with Tern Bicycles, who is sponsoring our coverage. It’s perfect timing too, since chief among the many new debuts we’re expecting to see are some game changing e-bikes and products from Tern. Check them out below along with the many other cool features we’re expecting to see tomorrow.It’s been a busy few months for Tern, who has become the undisputed leader in right-sized electric cargo bikes and utility bikes.Not only did Tern already have several highly acclaimed models of cargo e-bikes in their lineup, but the company has recently unveiled two new e-bikes that have made the brand even more accessible.Just a few months ago, Tern announced a new model known as the Quick Haul, which takes many of Tern’s signature e-bike features and repackages them in a more affordable model for budget-conscious riders who are still looking for a high quality ride.Tern more recently unveiled the NBD, which also adopts a similar design for a small-format cargo bike with big cargo capacity. But this time, the new frame with a low-step-through design is built to fit smaller riders and those with accessibility issues. The two new e-bike models and all the other e-bikes in Tern’s lineup will be at Tern’s Eurobike booth for the public to check out. Those who want to get an even more intimate experience with the bikes should head over to Terns’ outdoor booth (F10.0/D04) in the cargo bike demo area to take a spin on Tern’s e-bikes and feel for themselves what a “right-sized” cargo e-bike feels like. Anyone wanting to try the NBD specifically can find it in the second test area at Hartje’s booth (F12.0/I15).Of particular interest to businesses will be Tern’s participation in the Cargo Business Bike Panel on July 14 at 11:30 a.m. on the Pink Stage in Hall 8. Tern’s heavy-hauling cargo e-bikes are popular with many commercial users due to their rugged designs. They’re built to withstand daily commercial use, not just light consumer use, which should also be another good indication for consumers that these bikes are overbuilt to last for a generation.We’ll be sure to get some saddle time on Tern’s bikes, and you can be looking for that in our summary video as well as likely a few dedicated testing videos too. To get an idea of what we’re in for, check out our Eurobike video below from last year’s event to see the wide variety of cool e-bikes that will be at the show.Valeo will be on site to show off its Valeo Cyclee electric bike drive system.The unique drive is an innovative setup that combines at the pedals a 48V electric motor, automatic gear box, and predictive software for shift timing.The system has apparently been scooping up customers, as Valeo explained:After unveiling this major innovation for the new mobility landscape in December 2020, 14 months later in February 2022, Valeo already had its first 14 customers. And on the eve of Eurobike 2022, Valeo announces it has now won the trust of 20 bicycle manufacturers, around 20 months after the technology was first unveiled.Anti-lock brakes aren’t just for cars and motorcycles anymore. Now electric bikes will be able to take advantage of the important safety innovation thanks to Shimano and Blubrake teaming up for a new product launch.The goal is to reduce the chance of the front wheel locking up or the rear wheel lifting up, even during panic braking. While that might make it harder to pull off some sweet tricks, it’s a much safer way to brake for the millions of riders out there who rely on bikes for daily transportation.The design is being offered by Shimano to manufacturers that can integrate the hardware into the frame of a cargo bike, keeping a sleek design without added bulk.This is definitely one that we’re going to want to see in action in Frankfurt!Super73 confirmed to Electrek that they’ll be in attendance with the bulk of their German team, and they’ll also have some of their US team on site, including CEO LeGrand Crewse.The company will be showing off its wide line of motorcycle-inspired electric bikes that rely heavily on 70s’ and 80s’ minibike styling.Last year we borrowed a couple Super73 electric bikes from the company’s Eurobike booth and had our own little Eurotrip across Germany with them. It was quite an adventure, to say the least!Despite Super73 unveiling a concept electric motorcycle earlier this year, we’ve been told to not get our hopes up for seeing it in Frankfurt. However, it could make an appearance at EICMA 2022, the Milan Motorcycle Show, so we’ll keep our fingers crossed there.Honbike recently unveiled its latest electric bike model known as the U4.The Japanese e-bike company is known for its funky and stylish designs, and the U4 did not disappoint. The frame is ultra-minimalist, hiding away the battery and motor in a package that looks more like a pedal bike than an electric bike.We don’t know too much yet about the new model, but we’re excited to learn more when we check it out in person.We’ve had some fun playing around with a previous version of the Swytch kit, even taking it off-roading, but now the UK-based company says they’ll be hosting a preview of the world’s lightest and smallest e-bike conversion kit at Eurobike.Considering how impressed we were with the last Swytch kit, we’re definitely going to want to check this new one out.In the meantime, you can see the former kit in our testing video below.We recently had the chance to tour Comodule’s factory in Tallinn, Estonia, to see how they build their IoT connectivity tech. It turns out that many of the connected electric scooters and e-bikes available on the market today rely on Comodule’s technology to make their apps and features even more user friendly. That includes companies like Super73, Serial 1, Tuul, CAKE, and more.The team is already set up at Eurobike and shared their booth image on Instagram below.A post shared by Comodule (@comodule_iot)Comodule shares an origin story with Äike, the makers of premium electric scooters.During our Tallinn visit, we had the chance to take a test ride on the newly-released Äike T electric scooter, and experience the awesome ride! The scooter is full of neat tech like USB-C charging, single side-supported wheels, a removable battery, and multiple display options.The Äike team will have scooters available in the outdoor demo area, so you’ll definitely want to check those out.Talk about a big Tallinn contingent! The European capital’s other big electric mobility company, Ampler Bikes, is also sending their team.During our tour of Ampler’s factory last month, we got to see firsthand just how much effort and care goes into building these premium electric bikes. The sleek bikes don’t even look electric, making them all the more impressive! Check out our video tour below of the Ampler factory, then make sure to meet the team at Eurobike!There are going to be hundreds of other interesting companies and products on display this year, and this article is by no means an exhaustive list. Consider this just a teaser of the companies that have reached out so far or shared with us some early info.We’ll be checking out all of them and more over the next few days, so make sure you come back to Electrek to see our coverage. You’ll feel like you’re on the show floor with us!",ebikes
2022/07/11,"Touring various electric bike factories has been a fascinating experience for me over the years. It’s a chance to look behind the curtain and see how the sausage is made, so to speak. And with bicycles being one of the great equalizers, it is interesting to see each culture’s take on the handy vehicles. I’ve been on behind-the-scenes tours of e-bike motor builders, Chinese e-bike factories, American e-bike factories, and all sorts of other e-rideables in various countries. But checking out Europe’s own homegrown e-bikes at Ampler’s Tallinn, Estonia-based factory has been a particular high point of mine.Come along with me while we explore just how this classy e-bike startup builds its own local e-bikes, which are quickly becoming a favorite across major European markets.Ampler’s electric bikes are known for their elegant designs that closely mimic conventional pedal bikes. In fact, many of the company’s models are barely distinguishable from pedal bikes.We’ve tested the bikes before and been majorly impressed with the smooth ride and quality manufacturing. We’ve since watched as Ampler has grown into a burgeoning European powerhouse and has released several new models to high acclaim. To achieve that kind of independent design and high growth rate, the company has had to handle nearly everything itself, from production to fulfillment. Check out my video tour below to see the factory in action, then read on for the full story!Production starts with the bare frames that are taped and prepped before they wind their way through the company’s extensive powder coating facility. The first-generation models were painted, but Ampler found that the results were mixed. As many car companies have discovered, paint is difficult. But with powder coating, Ampler has found that it can maintain a great shine while offering a much more rugged and scratch-resistant finish.The powder coating is actually done in two steps, which requires two loops around the frame roller coaster. It could be done in one, but Ampler only has a single powder coating robot, and thus switches between color and clear coat for each pass. An average of 120 frames move through the painting facility each day, though some days see as many as 150 frames completed.Next, the frames move on to electronics stuffing. That means the company’s proprietary batteries get fed into the frame along with controllers, torque sensors, wiring harnesses, and everything else that sends power and signals throughout the bikes. I wasn’t able to photograph much of the electronics due to the secretive nature of their custom electronics designs, but trust me when I say they’re pretty awesome looking. The batteries in particular are slickly engineered to hide in the downtube of the frame. They’re accessible for servicing but not removable for daily charging, which is just about their only downside. A new display is built into the company’s second-generation models, which also gets inserted into the frame.The display lines up flush with the tube and integrates nicely, helping remove extra bulk from the handlebars. The result is a clean and sleek set of bars that adds to the bike’s pedal-only illusion.Further along in the factory, wheels are built up from bare rims using a combination of hand setting and robotic truing. It’s interesting to see this same step completed at different e-bike factories around the world. Each time I see it, the faces of the workers are different but the machines are basically all the same. I feel like there’s a philosophical message in there somewhere, but I’m not sure I’m qualified to look that deeply.The motors that get laced into the wheels may look like your basic Chinese-made electric motors, and technically they are. Well, Chinese-made, at least. But they’re far from standard. Ampler has changed just about every part in them to make them more robust and longer lasting than what typically comes out of an OEM factory. While Ampler would love to be able to build its own motors in-house, some parts like these can’t really be brought into local production until you hit an even larger production scale. Until then, Ampler designs its own changes to the motors and has them built off-site. Once the wheels are built, they are assembled onto the bikes at individual mechanic stations along with the rest of the bike components. Brakes, cranks, pedals, handlebars, and other components are all installed at this step, with around 80 bikes finishing assembly each workday.The bikes then move on to testing where they are ridden by a professional tester to ensure that everything is working properly and the systems are all dialed in perfectly. If anything isn’t 100% perfect, it is noted on the bike and it goes back to a mechanic. Usually everything checks out the first time though and the bike is off to packaging. Ampler designed its packaging to ship the bike as completely assembled as possible to make it easy for the customer who receives the bike. While there are several Ampler showrooms and dealers across Europe, most customers order their e-bikes online and thus receive the bike shipped directly to their doorstep. The packing is also designed to be as environmentally conscious as possible, eschewing foam for cardboard that is custom cut to cradle Ampler’s specific e-bikes.Having as much of the process being handled in-house has proven critical for Ampler’s growth, especially as the company hopes to continue its skyward trajectory. Currently sales hover at around 12,000 e-bikes per year, but the company has been doubling its sales every year and has big projections for future growth.With five models of e-bikes to choose from across a range of commuter-style models, Ampler is trying to create a little bit of something for everyone in the urban e-bike market.I had the chance to do a bit of touring around on an Ampler Juna that I rode to dinner down by the sea. The Juna is a light and comfort-oriented electric bike that offers a step-through frame but doesn’t go full-on women’s Dutch bike either. It finds a happy middle ground and makes for a sprightly yet easygoing ride.It includes a Gates carbon belt drive setup for a silent, maintenance-free drivetrain and feels as smooth as the welds look, which is to say “very.”The next day I had a chance to spend a whole morning and most of the afternoon touring Tallinn on an Ampler Axel e-bike. I captured a pile of great footage of that ride experience, and I’ll be excited to return soon with a complete first-ride review of the Axel.Suffice it to say for now though that Ampler’s bikes are a beautiful combination of sleek design, lightweight engineering, and high-quality fabrication.",ebikes
2022/07/10,"Ducati may not have a consumer-level electric motorcycle yet (and barely has a racing electric motorcycle, for that matter), but the company can’t stop pumping out smaller two-wheeled electric vehicles. Case in point: Ducati has just unveiled two new folding electric bicycles.Both electric bicycle models were released under Ducati’s Scrambler brand, which has grown into a heavyweight lifestyle brand in recent years.Ducati has leveraged it before for folding electric bikes, and appears to be sticking to its guns with the latest models unveiled recently.The new SCR-X and SCR-E GT are both fat tire folding e-bikes that use a 60 Nm Bafang rear-mounted hub motor for power. The 48V system on both bikes is generally associated with higher power, but the EU-based company was forced to limit the speed of the e-bikes to a mere 25 km/h (15 mph) to conform to local electric bicycle regulations.The SCR-E GT is more road-oriented and comes with 20″ street tires matched to spoked wheels.A 500 Wh battery is said to offer 50 miles (80 km) of range, and is removable for charging off of the bike. Considering the pedal assist nature of these e-bikes, that’s likely a reasonable range rating.The SCR-X, on the other hand, is the more trail-oriented e-bike of the lot.While both bikes feature front suspension, the SCR-E GT includes rear suspension, knobby tires, and mag rims, which should perform better in more dynamic off-road riding conditions. A larger battery with 614 Wh of capacity will also offer more stored energy, which is important for e-bikes ridden in harsher off-road conditions that often require more power from the battery.The SCR-X adopts a step-through frame that will make it easier for riders to mount the bike without swinging a leg over the tall saddle, while the SCR-E GT uses a step-over frame instead.Riders should expect the two new models to become available later this month across Ducati’s dealerships and online, though the company has yet to reveal pricing details.These two new models follow several Ducati entries into the electric bicycle market.The motorcycle company first rolled out an electric mountain bike in 2018 via a partnership with THOK bikes, marking the company’s first electric two-wheeler.At the time, Ducati was teasing an electric motorcycle in its future but was still making excuses for why the company wouldn’t be able to develop one for many years.The company followed up with several more models of electric mountain bikes in 2019.By 2020, Ducati was toying with electric folding e-bikes and produced a number of interesting models with fairly new features such as frame-integrated lighting.Ducati continued releasing new electric mountain bikes in 2020, improving the performance and quality level of the e-bikes.By early 2022, the company released its first electric road bike designed for high-end racing bike consumers. The bike also came with a Ducati-sized price tag though, asking for a lofty €7,690 (approximately US $8,020).Ducati may have made more progress on the electric bicycle front than in its electric motorcycle division, but the latter has seen a number of headlines lately as well.Earlier this month Ducati unveiled specs on its V21L racing electric motorcycle prototype that will become the sole model used in the FIM MotoE racing series next season.Ducati has confirmed that it will produce at least 18 of the bikes for the 2023 season of the FIM MotoE racing series. Each of the V21L electric motorcycles will be capable of outputting 110 kW (147 hp) and 140 Nm (103 lb-ft) of torque.The bike was said to reach a top speed of 275 km/h (171 mph) on a test circuit in Mugello, Italy.Despite carrying a rather large 18 kWh battery pack, Ducati was able to bring the weight of the V21L prototype down to just 225 kg (496 lb.). That’s still a hefty bike, but weighs significantly less than the 282 kg (621 lb.) Energica Ego electric motorcycle that it will replace beginning in the 2023 season.While Ducati may have spent years dragging its feet on two-wheeled EVs, it’s hard to claim the company isn’t playing catchup now with a series of big unveilings. What do you think of Ducati’s EV progress? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/07/09,"Dumpster diving into the abyss of the world’s largest online shopping site has regularly seen me bob to the surface with some uniquely interesting and sometimes terrifying finds. China has become the undisputed leader in producing electric vehicles, especially the seemingly outlandish ones. But as much fun as a bright pink life-size Barbie electric pickup truck can be, it’s the truly useful EVs that catch my fancy the most. And this week’s entry in the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week series has me wanting to give it all up to start my own ice-cream man business on an ice-cream cargo e-bike!And this isn’t just any ice-cream cargo e-bike, no siree Bob! It’s a solar-powered ice-cream cargo e-bike!This is exactly what I need to scratch that entrepreneurial itch that’s been tickling me ever since my ill-fated highway on-ramp lemonade stand debacle. It’s got that perfect mix of old-school charm and new-fangled EV technology, all wrapped up in a much better solution than a stuffy ice-cream truck: an ice-cream bike!I can’t help but think 50 Cent’s classic club song could have been a bit better had he seen one of these first.♫ I’ll take you to the ice cream shop. Except this time it’s an e-bike with a solar top. Go ‘head girl, you can ride non-stop. Keep goin’ until you’ve sold the lot. ♫Hey, you don’t have to ask me twice! I’m ready to start my new ice-cream man career, hopping aboard an electric tricycle built by the lowest bidder and giving up the life of glamour and prestige that comes with being an e-bike journalist (remind me to tell you about the time I took an emergency nap on the cold, hard floor of the Tokyo Motorcycle Show).This old bucket is 78 kilos (172 lb.) of pure, good ol’ entrepreneurial spirit!It’s not a particularly fast or powerful e-bike, rocking a 250 W (1/3 hp) electric motor and teetering to a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). But it should surely get the job done. And when the job is slingin’ ice cream, an eye-watering top speed isn’t exactly critical.The cool thing (get it?!) is that since the ice-cream e-bike is so low-powered, the 170-watt solar panel on top is likely going to be enough to keep it fairly well charged. You’re not going to get infinite range, but the amount of time spent parked is likely to maintain the batteries at nearly full charge. You could probably ride to your local beach, park for several hours while you make a measurable impact on the local diabetes level, then ride home with a fully charged battery.A lot of food carts and ice-cream trucks use a gasoline or diesel generator to run the cooler box and other equipment. I assume it’s for the added exhaust flavor. But this ice-cream e-bike keeps things green with an onboard battery 12V 100Ah battery bank for the cooler.Another nice feature is just how customizable the little ice-cream e-bike is. Not only can you of course choose the colors of the bike, but you get six different cooler sizes to choose from. They range from 108 liters to a massive 508 liters.I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a 500-liter cooler before, but you could sleep in that gigantic thing. That would be a terrible, ridiculously dangerous thing to do, so please don’t try that. But I’m just saying, you could if you wanted.The thing is even super compact for shipping too! It shows up in a little cardboard box. There are probably 30 man-hours of assembly required, not to mention finding some replacement hardware for the inevitably missing pieces. But at least you don’t need to rent a flat bed truck to get it home from your local port like my last big Alibaba purchase.And there’s so little investment required here, too! For a cool 850 smackaroos you can start your own small business slinging cold sugary cream. Talk about a low barrier to entry! With $1,000 burning a hole in your pocket, you could have your ice-cream cargo e-bike and a load of sugary nonsense ready to go! Well, plus probably several thousand bucks more for shipping, customs, port fees, transfer fees, docking fees, handling fees, paperwork fees, de-icing fees, etc. Oh and you want the bike with wheels, right? That’s another fee.So there may be a few unexpected charges to go around here, which is something that several of my readers have found when they made the terrible decision to actually buy some of the weird Alibaba EVs I’ve found.As much fun as it would be to become a Times Square ice-cream tycoon on my own vending e-bike, I think I may have to sit this one out. But I can at least stay up at night restlessly thinking about what could have been if I had simply followed my dreams…",ebikes
2022/07/08,"Electric bikes are great for a lot of things. They get you where you’re going faster than a traditional bike, cut through traffic faster than a car, and are more fun than both. But the downside is that they can often be rather chunky looking. Some are even downright chonks. But not the Honbike U4, as this is one new e-bike that looks so sleek and elegant that you’d never guess it had an electric motor or battery on board.Heading to Eurobike 2022 (Europe’s massive bicycle trade show that Electrek will be covering on site), the Honbike U4 is set for its worldwide debut on July 13.The design speaks for itself with a strikingly minimalist use of round tubing in a modified X-frame.As the company explained:The Honbike U4 has a simplistic yet contemporary angular-free unisex design, making it ideal for urban use and a perfect for every user. Honbike’s new U4 is an e-bike that looks just like a traditional bicycle, but brings users all of the benefits of the features inherent in simple, easy-to-use e-bikes.That sleek frame is ultra-lightweight, yet rigid, thanks to the use of 7000 series aircraft-grade aluminum instead of the more common 6000 series aluminum we see in most bicycles.This isn’t Honbike’s first stab at a new e-bike. We tested the company’s previous model and came away majorly impressed. You can check out our video review of Honbike’s first e-bike model below.The design was created without any sharp curves or steep angles, resulting in the round and polished-looking frame with single side-supported wheels. Unlike the single side-supported wheels we saw in Honbike’s last model, this time Honbike used more standard mounting while still innovating with one-piece magnesium rims. We rarely see single side-supported wheels in e-bikes and scooters due to the engineering challenge, but when companies can pull it off it results in a very distinctive appearance. Even with more traditional wheels supported on both sides, the magnesium rim here looks quite impressive and also helps remove the hassle of spoke maintenance or concerns of wheel truing. The bike is powered by a built-in 432 Wh battery. It is frame integrated, which has its advantages and disadvantages. On the upside, it’s so slickly hidden that you’ll basically never know it’s there. The tradeoff though is that it isn’t easily removable for charging off of the bike, so you’ll need to bring the bike close enough to an outlet to charge. If the battery ever needs servicing, it can be accessed with tools, but it isn’t designed for daily removal.Honbike says the U4 can get an honest 62 miles or 100 km of range from that battery. At around 7 Wh/mile, that would require a lot of pedaling on your side, but would likely be doable on the lowest assist setting. For those that want more power and can sacrifice a bit of range, the Honbike U4 has two other power settings that are likely to give you a bit more push. The bike is also apparently smart enough to auto-select the appropriate power level based on the riders’ own pedaling input. There’s no word yet on whether or not that means a true torque sensor-based pedal assist system, but it’s something we’ll want to look at closer at the Frankfurt show next week.While the exact mechanism for engaging the pedal assist is still a bit hazy, the drivetrain itself is much more clear. We know the bike is packing a Gates Carbon Drive belt system, allowing it to offer a smooth and silent pedaling platform that is free of the oil and maintenance concerns of bicycle chains.Honbike’s Managing Director Quinton Pullinger put it best, explaining: Our e-bikes are designed to promote no chain, no fuss and our Honbike U4 is no exception. It is a model of true craftsmanship, thanks to technology and design that offer buyers affordable value, so it is the smart choice for anyone who has ever considered an e-bike but not yet made the move. Ideal for those on a budget, compared to competitors, the Honbike U4 does not compromise on any of the features that e-bike lovers demand and have come to expect.The belt drive also means its a single speed, which is either awesome or a downer depending on your own cycling views. As someone who rides in mostly flat areas, I’m a big fan of single speeds. Even for light hills though, the electric assist often does the work of a lower gear by adding more oomph for riders while climbing inclines.The rear wheel motor doesn’t come with a power rating, but is likely going to bear a 250W label for legal reasons as the bike will debut in Europe. Thanks to Europe’s more restrictive e-bike laws, higher powered motors aren’t common on the continent.The first Honbike U4 models will become available next week in the UK, where they will be priced at £1,599 including tax (approximately €1,880 or US $1,920). EU sales should follow soon after.Early shipments will begin in August, but don’t expect the bike to become available in the US until this Fall at the earliest.I’ll hopefully get to give the bike a test spin at Eurobike, where we’ll let you know our thoughts on the ride quality.Until then, let’s hear your opinion on the design. Could you see yourself on an e-bike like this?",ebikes
2022/07/08,"With so many electric bike options on the market these days, it can be difficult for companies to stand out and show us something different. You’ve got to start thinking outside of the box, which is exactly what the Fucare Gemini X does. It’s an electric bike with a trellis-style frame. I’ve never seen anything quite like it, but it definitely works well.This is one of those electric bikes that you’ll want to see in action. Check out my succinct video review below before continuing on with the rest of this written review!The first thing you notice about the Fucare Gemini X is of course the unique frame; it’s got tubes for days. And the 400 lb weight capacity (181 kg) speaks to the strength of the frame. Hopefully other parts like the brakes are up to that level of weight, but the hydraulic stoppers feel darn sturdy, too.The frame may be odd-looking, but it definitely makes for a rigid structure. Building a transporter bridge out of balsa wood in 8th grade science class taught me two things: Trusses are damn strong for their weight, and hot glues burns. Both of those lessons have served me well to this day.The frame’s welds aren’t the prettiest I’ve ever seen, but they seem just fine. Some companies go way above and beyond on smoothing out their welds, but Fucare isn’t one of those.Even so, the impressive weight capacity and cool frame design help me look past the slightly ugly welds.In this case, the trellis frame doesn’t just add rigidity and look cool, but also creates an interesting protective structure around the front battery. And I say “front battery” because there are actually two batteries on this e-bike, unlike most others that have a single lonely battery. With two 500 Wh batteries, the Fucare Gemini X is packing 1 kWh of capacity – that’s enough for 80 miles (130 km) of range on low power pedal assist, or closer to around 40 miles on throttle only riding at around 20 mph (32 km/h). Fucare even offers a 15 Ah battery upgrade option, if you really want to push the capacity further. Unless you’re doing delivery work, I don’t think you’ll need the larger capacity battery. Two 10.4 Ah batteries (500 Wh each) is plenty for most average riders.Here’s the thing, though: If you’re like me then you’re not going to be sticking to a measly 20 mph. On throttle only riding, the Fucare Gemini X can get all the way up to 28 mph (45 km/h), which is how it’s really designed to ride.This is largely an electric moped in an e-bike form factor, meaning it is designed with motorcycle-esque design cues like those large urban tires, powerful 750W motor and tons of battery. The smaller 20″ wheels also give it more of a motorcycle feel with moderate diameter wheels that carry plenty of rubber side to side for extra grip.The tires are of course street-optimized, but I did a bit of detouring across grass just to see how they work. The ride is decent, but things get slippery if you push too hard. So consider this a street bike that will allow you to do some very light off roading, such as smooth gravel trails or light grassy stuff. Steer clear of wet grass unless you want to have a slip n’ slide experience.The front suspension also makes the ride even better. It’s not a dual crown fork like we’ve seen on other motorcycle-inspired electric bikes, and so in that regard it tips back towards the bicycle side of the scale. But it still offers some nice shock absorption up front that improves the ride on rougher roads.In terms of features, the bike offers a nice balance of components for the $1,899 price. The included LED lights check my box for required equipment on any e-bike designed for street use. Reflectors just aren’t enough for any e-bike designed to mix it up with cars, so I’m glad to see that the Fucare Gemini X is outfitted with solid front and rear LED lights.The rear rack is nice and sturdy, which should be great for carrying plenty of cargo back there. It’s rated for 110 lb (50 kg), which means you could probably exceed that and carry a heavier person back there. They’ll tell you not to do that if you ask, and I won’t take liability for it, either. But having sat on it myself with my own 150 lb (75 kg) weight, I can tell you it feels darn strong.Fucare offers basket options if you want to get something designed to fit the bike, or you could easily DIY your own storage solutions back there. Combined with the included fenders, the storage and weather protection features make this a great commuter option right out of the box, no other accessories needed.The 5.3″ color LCD screen is also quite nice. Not only is it a huge display that is easy to read with large digits, but it also includes a USB-A port to keep your phone charged on the go – that’s critical if you use GPS or other map apps often, as they can drain your battery quickly. And with a big battery like this, you may be heading out on longer range rides than you’d expect.Hydraulic disc brakes are another nice to see part. At $1,899, I’d almost say that I expect them, but the dual battery setup here contributes significantly to that price and so I wouldn’t have been surprised to see mechanical brakes. But good for you, Fucare, for going the extra mile and giving us hydraulic stoppers!One other small note: you might notice what looks like a mid-drive motor mounted near the pedals. That’s a decoy. It’s not really a motor, but instead seems to be where they stashed the controller and other electronics/wiring. It’s kind of neat that it makes the bike look like a fancier mid-drive model, plus it also gives easy access to the controller while still keeping that eyesore out of view. Taking a once over, the Fucare Gemini X is a great heavyweight commuter electric bike for anyone that wants a more moto-ish or moped feeling ride. The power, speed and ride all give you that classic moped-style experience.The bike is pretty darn heavy, but as long as you don’t need to lift it often, then you probably won’t mind. It makes up for the weight with good parts and good features, plus plenty of range.I wouldn’t mind having other colors to choose from, but I guess the single option helps them cut down on inventory issues. And the grey is admittedly pretty nice with the industrial trellis frame design.The bike is available either on Amazon or directly on Fucare’s site, which is nice for those that like buying options. If you want the extra accessories like baskets and batteries though, you’ll have to stick to Fucare’s site.Those are my thoughts, but now let’s hear yours. What do you think of the Fucare Gemini X electric bike? Share your opinion in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/07/04,"E-commerce giant Amazon has found a simple solution to replace thousands of its van deliveries: smaller electric cargo bikes and good old-fashioned walking.The first city to see Amazon make the switch is London, where the company is beginning a trial with electric cargo bikes – but these aren’t your typical two-wheeled electric cargo bikes. In fact, they aren’t even the common delivery e-trikes we’ve seen before.These are four-wheeled electric cargo bikes that look similar to a miniature delivery van, but use an e-bike drivetrain for propulsion. That means the driver is actually a rider who sits on a bike seat and pedals the vehicle to engage an electric motor that magnifies his or her pedaling force. Ultimately, most of the power comes from an electric bicycle battery, though the rider does add a fair amount of pedaling power too.The vehicles are usually limited to a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph), which is generally sufficient for delivery purposes in crowded city centers.Amazon will also be expanding the use of walking deliveries as well, which are much more efficient in dense urban areas that can be managed by mobile package hubs that resupply the delivery walkers.According to The Guardian, Amazon will begin its electric cargo bike testing in the East London borough of Hackney where the e-bikes will be operated by Amazon’s partners. There, they will join an extensive electrically-powered fleet of full-size Amazon delivery vehicles.The electric vehicles in the fleet make a combined 5 million deliveries a year in the area.As Amazon’s UK Country Manager John Boumphrey explained:Amazon is driving towards a global net-zero carbon future. One way we’re doing that is through the transformation of our transportation networks. Our new e-cargo bikes, walkers and growing electric vehicle delivery fleet will help us make more zero emission customer deliveries than ever before across London and the UK in the coming months.Amazon of course isn’t the only delivery giant to explore the use of four-wheeled electric cargo bikes for deliveries in densely populated urban areas.UPS began testing a similar four-wheeled electric cargo bike that looks like a miniature UPS van in Scotland a few months ago. The company then began testing the same vehicles in NYC, another area that lends itself well to deliveries via micromobility vehicles.DHL is testing a similar vehicle as well in the UK. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has also been testing out electric bicycles for package delivery, though has opted for three-wheeled electric tricycles instead. Those vehicles are built in the US by the American company Coaster Cycles and designed for carrying large loads such as an entire day’s mail route.The giant rear cargo box provides 72 cubic feet (over 2,000 liters) of space for mail, and the bike can hold up to 400 lb. (181 kg) of cargo. Hydraulic disc brakes help bring all of that weight to a stop quickly and safely.Powering the bike is Bosch’s Cargo Line e-bike drive system, which supplies the rear wheels with 85 Nm of torque. The drive system is paired with a 500 Wh battery to power the mid-drive motor, though multiple batteries can likely be swapped in to extend the range. As delivery companies continue to seek out more efficient ways to disperse packages in cities that are increasingly prioritizing people-first urban planning, large delivery vehicles are quickly starting to look like dinosaurs in these changing cities.Smaller and more efficient bicycle-based delivery vehicles therefore could eventually comprise a majority of the delivery vehicles in city centers, likely much to the joy of city residents who rely on deliveries but suffer from the congestion and inconvenience of large parked vans.Amazon bike image credit: John Nguyen/PA",ebikes
2022/07/03,"When we think of the term “electric vehicles,” we generally conjure up mental images of Teslas or other headline-grabbing electric cars. But a new German study from Deloitte shows that it’s actually electric bicycles that are leading the shift toward electric transportation. The study was conducted by Deloitte last month in Germany, where 1,008 respondents provided feedback about whether or not they use electric transportation and, if so, which type.The largest portion of respondents by far answered that they use an electric bicycle, with 18% of the survey sample commuting by e-bike.The next most common categories were electric cars (7%), electric scooters (7%), electric mopeds (3%), electric motorcycles (2%), and electric micro-mobiles (1%).Interestingly, the study suggests that one reason for the high use of electric bicycles may be the higher perceived attractiveness of the electric two-wheelers. To determine the attractiveness of each form of electric vehicle, the study asked respondents to score the attractiveness of various modes of electric transportation on a scale of 1 (very unattractive) to 4 (very attractive).Again, electric bicycles came out on top. E-bikes scored an average ranking of 2.7, beating out electric cars (2.6), electric scooters (2.2), electric mopeds (2.2), electric motorcycles (2.2), and electric micro-mobiles (1.9).The study drilled down further to determine why respondents elected to rank certain vehicles with the highest attractiveness. For electric bicycles, the leading attributes included practicability (62%), alternative to other vehicles (46%), sustainability (41%), and fun (37%).A comparison of the results of the attractiveness survey can be seen below.The results of the study seem to align with previous reports we’ve seen that indicate an accelerated adoption level of electric bikes.The United Kingdom Bicycle Association recently reported that 160,000 electric bikes were sold in the UK in 2020. The group noted that with 108,000 electric car sales in the UK during the same period, e-bikes handily outsold larger four-wheeled EVs.According to data released by the LEVA, the US saw nearly 790,000 electric bike imports in 2021. That marks a 70% increase from the 463,000 imports in 2020. Compared to the 790,000 e-bike imports in 2021, that same year saw Americans purchase 652,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids, according to BloombergNEF.The US’s electric bike boom has been spurred by large companies such as Rad Power Bikes, which are selling hundreds of thousands of value-priced electric bikes per year. In addition, new electric bike startups have entered the market and helped drive down prices. Compared to Europe, where a premium electric bike is often priced at between the US equivalent of $3,000 to $6,000, the US has many more value-oriented e-bike options, with many starting at or below $1,000.However, higher prices for e-bikes in Europe don’t appear to have slowed down sales on the continent. E-bike sales may have surpassed electric car sales in the US, but in Europe, they’re on track to surpass the sales of all cars — not just electric cars — later this decade.And for many city residents, that day couldn’t come sooner. In addition to providing a more affordable and more efficient form of alternative transportation for riders, electric bikes actually help improve cities for everyone. While e-bike riders can directly benefit from lower transportation costs, quicker commute times, and free parking, more e-bikes on the streets means fewer cars. And fewer cars means less traffic.E-bikes are widely seen as one of the best ways to reduce urban traffic, especially in cities without effective public transit systems. Even in cities with solid public transit, e-bikes are often more convenient alternatives as they allow riders to commute on their own schedules and without route constraints.While electric bicycles certainly can’t replace all car trips, the growing number of e-bike styles and the emphasis on e-bike utility mean that a growing number of families are trading a second car for an electric bicycle.",ebikes
2022/06/29,"Tern’s electric bicycles have become synonymous with quality, a reputation that has been earned over several years of high-performing e-bikes. They’re not cheap in any sense of the word, which leads us to believe that the newly unveiled Tern NBD will be another winner for the company as well as for riders in the high-end electric bike market.Assuming folks can afford it, that is.The Tern NBD, which stands for New Bike Day, was just unveiled this morning.The acronym is also commonly used to abbreviate “no big deal,” as in “no biggie, we just pumped out another awesome urban utility e-bike a few months after our last big unveiling.“The new Tern NBD may be following in the tire marks of the company’s March unveiling of its Quick Haul electric cargo bike, but the NBD takes a slightly different turn toward an easy-riding and more accessible design that accommodates a wider range of riders.The frame features an ultra-low-step design to make it even easier to mount than Tern’s other e-bikes. No more swinging a leg over a tall saddle. Instead, the bike is designed to mount like a conventional Dutch bike, stepping right through the center. That also makes it easier to dismount as riders can simply slide forward off of the saddle and step off to the side.Tern team captain Josh Hon explained that accessibility and ease of use was a key part of the Tern NBD’s design:To the average rider, the NBD will be an amazingly easy-to-handle, easy-to-ride bike that fits wonderfully into crowded urban settings. But what gets us really excited about the NBD are the special features we’ve added for riders that aren’t conventionally “average.” For riders that are smaller in size and have a hard time finding a bike that fits, or older riders who might not have ridden a bike in a while, or riders who might have balance or physical issues, or riders who are just intimidated by the sheer size and weight of the average e-bike, the NBD will be refreshingly easy to hop aboard and ride.The smaller 20″ wheels, long wheel base, and low center of gravity from a low-slung motor/battery combo make the bike easy to balance and handle. The bike is also highly adjustable, meaning riders can dial in the seat height, cockpit length (distance from saddle to bars) and handlebar height to fit a wide range of shapes and sizes. The bars even fold flat making it easy to load in the back of a car or SUV.In terms of sizing, Tern says that the bike works great for riders ranging from 4’10” to 6’3″, or 147-190 cm.I’ll be right back. I’ve got to go tell my 4’10” mother that I finally found an e-bike for her!Just because the bike is small doesn’t mean it can’t handle a load though. The NBD is rated with a gross vehicle weight limit of 308 lb. (140 kg). The bike’s cargo racks can handle 59 lb. (26.7 kg) on the rear and 44 lb. (20 kg) on the front. The rear rack fits most child seats, and the low position of the rack thanks to the 20″ wheels helps keep the child’s weight low on the bike to further improve handling. Another neat feature found in the rear rack is that it includes supports that allow the bike to be parked vertically, taking up around the same amount of space in a small apartment as a coat rack.While the bike lacks traditional suspension, an included suspension seat post will offer a bit more shock absorption than typically found on a fully rigid bike.The bike also includes much of the same quality parts we’ve come to know and love on other Tern e-bikes, such as Bosch’s Active Line Plus mid-drive motor with 65 Nm of torque and accompanying Bosch PowerPack 400 battery pack, hydraulic disc brakes, built-in LED lighting, tool-free handlebar angle adjustments, and more.The NBD will be available in two models, both of which should start rolling into bike shops in the first quarter of 2023. The S5i (with belt drive) will be priced at US $4,699 and the NBD P8i (with chain drive) will be priced at US $3,899.Seeing more accessible e-bikes for shorter riders is great because it addresses a much overlooked segment of the population. Sure, there are a few options here and there, but so many e-bikes come in a one-size-fits-most offering. And as shorter people know quite well, most is not all.Everything else about the bike looks great. Adjustability, sweet Tern rack, fenders and lights, belt drive option, rear geared hub… these are all awesome parts. And Tern routinely builds their e-bikes to meet the highest industry quality and safety standards, so you know it’s going to be built to last.But dang if it isn’t expensive! I’m not saying it’s not worth it. Tern builds e-bikes that are meant to be ridden every day. These are true car replacers. And you pay for that kind of robustness. But it’s still a pretty penny to lay down.If you’re a smaller rider and have been looking for a high-end e-bike that you can depend on every day, and if the NBD lands within your budget, then even without riding one I can already say this could definitely be a great option for you. Now I just want to try one for myself!",ebikes
2022/06/28,"California-based automaker Rivian is best known today for its electric trucks, but could tomorrow’s Rivian be an electric bike? That possibility is looking much more certain now that the former CTO of a major bicycle brand has joined Rivian’s development team.We’ve already seen hints of Rivian’s electric bicycle aspirations via trademark filings.As we previously reported, the company filed to expand the use of its Rivian trademark to a new category focused on electric bikes:RIVIAN™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of bicycles; bicycle structural parts; electric bicycles; electric bicycle structural parts; electric bicycle components specially adapted for electric bicycles, namely, battery packs, motor controllers, electric motors, throttle controls, pedal assist sensors, display consoles, wiring harnesses, sprockets, cassettes, chains; bicycle frames; bicycle pedals; bicycle horns; bicycle brakes; bicycle chains; bicycle gears; bicycle wheels; bicycle seats; bicycle tires.At the time, we noted that companies often file trademarks that they don’t end up using, and that this could have just been a way for Rivian to protect its name across other industries.However, now we’re getting even stronger evidence that Rivian is actually developing new electric bicycles. The latest corroboration comes in the form of Rivian hiring the former CTO of Specialized Bicycle Components, maker of Specialized’s high end Turbo electric bicycles.Chris Yu spent more than 10 years at Specialized, serving in various roles from R&D Engineer, Head of Applied Technologies, Chief Innovation Officer and CTO. Now his current role at Rivian is VP of Future Programs.While a number of interesting projects could be hiding under that broad title, electric bicycles are obviously a specialty of Chris.Further strengthening the case for Rivian’s expanded focus on electric bikes, sources with knowledge of the matter indicated that Rivian was indeed exploring e-bikes, fitting with Rivian’s modus operandi of making vehicles that cross the adventure, utility and everyday lifestyle.This wouldn’t be the first time a major automaker expanded into the quickly growing electric bike market. Porsche launched two electric bikes last year alongside the Taycan Cross Turismo. BMW also unveiled several electric bikes last year.Peugot has its own extensive line of e-bikes, and Spain’s SEAT has partnered with Barcelona-based Silence to roll out its own seated and standing electric scooters.GM developed an electric bicycle in-house, though the project was killed off early in the COVID-19 pandemic.ŠKODA rolled out one of the weirdest electric bike/scooter concepts we’ve seen, though there’s no indication it is headed for produciton.Jeep has gotten into the high-power e-bike game via licensing agreements, though its similar attempt to co-develop an electric scooter was significantly less impressive.Even motorcycle manufacturers like Harley-Davidson and BMW Motorrad have gotten into electric bicycles and scooters, though Harley’s results have been much more impressive than BMW’s.This would be a fascinating move for Rivian, and is likely well within their wheelhouse. While electric bikes aren’t exactly simple machines, they’re much easier to develop and produce than electric trucks. Not only are they much less labor and material intensive, but they are subject to considerably less regulatory oversight as well, further simplifying the path from R&D to production.Scooping up Chris Yu is a great shortcut to bringing in the right talent, and it’s a move that is quite common in this industry. When Harley-Davidson decided to build electric bicycles, they did so after hiring some of the best talent from bicycle companies, for example.I’m definitely excited to see what Rivian can come up with, and to see how it may shake up the industry.",ebikes
2022/06/28,"Here at Electrek we love DIY projects. And solar power. And electric bikes. So when those three can be combined, that’s pretty much a trifecta in our books. In this case, we got the chance to chat with the builder of an awesome solar charging utility trailer that the industrious e-bike owner built to upgrade his ride.The creator of the awesome little trailer is a redditor who preferred to remain anonymous (wisely forgoing the heaping serving of internet fame that Electrek would surely bestow upon him), so we’re going to call him Bob.Bob built the base of his utility trailer using a Wike DIY kit. The kit includes the basic hardware such as the corner pieces, wheels, and other small parts required for the trailer, but lets you add the structural components to customize the size and construction to your own needs.The frame was built using 1/16″ aluminum square tubing and the walls of the trailer were made from galvanized sheet metal meant for roofing, which Bob then caulked together to dampen out the rattling sound.For the roof of the trailer, Bob used a rigid solar panel that he mounted on gas pistons that allow it to open easily and hold its position. A bungee cord is used to adjust the angle for optimum sun, but he keeps it closed while riding so it doesn’t turn into a wind sail at the wrong moment. The flat panel is still fairly efficient for solar electricity generation, but angling it towards the sun when the bike isn’t moving helps boost the efficiency even more.Speaking of boosting, to get the 12V panel’s DC voltage up to the 54.6V required by the battery, a simple boost converter was used that employs MPPT charging to get the maximum possible efficiency.As is usually the case with these types of DIY electrical projects, Bob had to do a bit of an electrical connector square dance to make everything play nicely. A mixture of XT60 connectors, MC-4s and 5.5×2.1 barrel connectors were used to match the solar panel, charge controller and charge port on the e-bike’s battery.Bob’s setup is designed to charge his Rad Power Bikes RadRunner Plus electric bike, whether the bike is operating or turned off. He measured the output of the panel at around 100W in direct sunlight, which isn’t enough to provide infinite range when the sun is out (that’d probably take 300-400W of power or around 3-4x the size of the current trailer’s roof). However, the 100W from the panel is likely enough to help offset the extra power required to pull the trailer. If so, that basically gives Bob back the energy he would have spent on lugging around a less-than-aerodynamic box behind his bike.The goal of course wasn’t to offer endless range, but rather to provide an easy way to slowly recharge the bike when in use for several days. Camping trips were one example Bob gave, where he could spend a couple days out in nature and get a full charge each day directly from the sun.We’ve seen other interesting DIY solar charging projects for e-bikes before, and I’ve done my own experiments with simple portable power stations and their matching solar panels, but Bob’s project is one of the nicest and cleanest mobile solar charging solutions we’ve seen. Plus the fact that it’s part of a sturdy trailer that is rugged enough to carry a few hundred pounds of concrete sacks sure makes it even more impressive!",ebikes
2022/06/27,"Some electric bicycles are for leisurely rides in the park. Some are for dropping off the kids at school or picking up groceries. Some are for budget-friendly alternative methods of transportation. The C3STROM ASTRO PRO electric bike is none of those things, and I struggle to even call it an electric “bike.” This is a powerful, full-featured electric motorbike wearing an e-bike’s clothes.This is no ordinary electric bike. Yes, it has pedals. And sure, they work. But there is so much power here that you’re way past typical e-bike performance.The C3STROM ASTRO PRO sports a 35A controller, which means that its electrical system is pulling around 1,800 watts of peak power from the battery when you gun the throttle.The Bafang motor is listed with a 750W continuous power rating, but that’s just a sticker. The true power is what you feel when you twist that half-grip throttle. And what you feel is an e-bike that is ready to rocket.Let’s all take a moment to appreciate those mag wheels too, which are both made by Bafang and add to the bike’s slick look. They also mean you never need to worry about spoke maintenance since you don’t have any spokes. For moped-style electric bikes, these mag wheels are becoming a popular option, and I couldn’t be happier about that.The half-twist throttle makes quick work of laying down the power, though you’ll find yourself relying on the pedal assist too if you want to go even faster. That’s because the throttle gets you up to 20 mph (32 km/h), and then the pedal assist activates the Class 3 mode to bring you up to an even faster 28 mph (45 km/h).Fortunately, the bike feels like it was designed to actually handle that kind of riding. The street tires are sticky and confidence inspiring. The front suspension is decently responsive (though you don’t want to hit any big bumps with a rigid rear). And the bench seat is more or less comfortable, even making for some decent pedaling geometry with the pedals more forward-mounted.I’m also glad to see some safety considerations like a big headlight, strong hydraulic brakes, and even turn signals, though I’ll be the first to say that the rear turn signals aren’t very visible. The fronts are a nice touch though! And there’s even a low/hi-beam selector, just in case you want to go around blinding motorists at night.The upside-down shifter on the left bar end is kind of comical, but not something we haven’t seen before. That’s due to the typically right-mounted rear shifter being installed on the left to make way for a right-hand half-twist throttle.With a massive 52V and 20Ah battery, you’ve got over 1 kWh of capacity to keep you riding. They claim over 30 miles of range on throttle only, and that’s absolutely doable (especially since throttle-only riding limits you to 20 mph).If you do plenty of 28 mph riding with slight pedaling to activate the higher speed, expect the range to dip down below the claimed 30 miles. If you can resist the high power and instead stick to moderate pedal assist, you can get significantly more range. They claim a maximum of over 70 miles, though that’d be a tall order, especially on a motorcycle-style e-bike like this.I must say that I’m a big fan of the way the frame is built around the battery to incorporate it into the design. It fully embraces the motorcycle styling yet keeps the battery removable. However, you do need to remove the key to actually drop the battery out, since it interferes with the frame tubes on the way out of the bike.And while we’re talking design, the funny little pseudo mid-motor cover panels are a cute touch, though I don’t think anyone will be fooled into thinking you’ve got a mid-drive motor hidden down there near the pedals. I assume they’ve just shoved the controller down there or used it to hide away the messy wiring, which means it might actually make for a useful access panel if the controller or wiring ever needed to be worked on.There may be a few oddities here, but all told I think the design is nicely refreshing while still maintaining a classic motorcycle-inspired ethos that is becoming increasingly popular in the e-bike space these days.At a price of $1,999, you’re going to have to really want this kind of styling to open your wallet that hard. I’m not saying $2k isn’t a fair price for such a powerful and long-range bike. But with a new company that is asking for you to trust their Indiegogo campaign, that’s a significant outlay. Having tested the bike and confirming that the company actually knows what they’re doing – at least for a few models – I feel pretty comfortable vouching for their e-bike design chops. But not so comfortable that I’m not still going to warn you that crowdfunding campaigns are inherently risky since you aren’t outright buying an e-bike but instead backing a project with the promise of an e-bike in return. So make sure you’ve considered that when you make a buying decision.",ebikes
2022/06/23,"If you’ve owned an electric bike, e-scooter, or other personal mobility device (and especially if you’ve owned more than one), you know they all have a charger that pretty much fits nothing else you own. I have several electric bikes, scooters, skateboards, and other e-rideables, and almost none of them can share chargers. But don’t fret! There’s already a convenient solution here, and it’s called USB-C. Electric bike battery USB-C charging needs to become a thing. And while, we’re at it, USB-C PD discharging, effectively turning the battery into a backup power supply for your electronics, could easily be added.  So listen up, electric bike companies. This one’s for you.Remember a decade ago when every cell phone had a different charger? USB saved the day (or at least, micro USB did), finally ridding our kitchen junk drawers of the handful of various DC barrel plug chargers that were turning into a rat’s nest of e-waste. Well thanks a lot, e-bike companies, because you’ve brought us right back to the dark ages with electric bike battery chargers.Every e-bike has a different charger, and it’s even worse than the cell phone days because not only do they all have different connectors, but they also have different voltages. And using the wrong charger with the wrong voltage significantly raises the stakes of having a very, very bad day should the Battery Management System (BMS) ever fail.Sure, there’s been some slight standardization with the 5.5 x 2.1mm DC barrel connector finding its way onto a plurality of batteries, though definitely not a majority. There are at least five or six common connectors across the industry, then more than a dozen less common options. If you stop by a friend’s house and want to borrow their charger to juice up while you’re there, the chances of being able to add a nickel to their electrical bill are incredibly low unless you’ve got the same make/model of e-bike.The answer to this madness is simple though: the common, convenient, and powerful USB-C connector. Specifically USB-PD, or power delivery. Electric bike battery USB-C charging could and should  be closer than you think.The same USB-C charger that we already plug into our laptops could conceivably charge our electric bikes and electric scooters. It could even do so decently fast. Until a year or two ago, USB-C could handle 100W. That’s more powerful than most electric scooter chargers and approximately equal to the power level of a basic 2A e-bike charger that comes with most electric bikes.But last year the USB-PD Revision 3.1 increased the power potential of the protocol to a whopping 240 watts! That’s as powerful as pretty much any e-bike charger you’ll find today, and it’s more than enough to make me and the rest of the electric bike community happy.But you don’t even have to get fancy with the new higher power protocol for a fast charger. Even the old 100W protocol would be more than enough for us! We’d be spraining our wrists patting you on the back so hard for giving us simple 100W USB-C charging.And it’s not even that hard. Seriously, I’ll help you out. Take your e-bike battery. Add a DC-DC converter to bump up from 20V to 54.6V (or whatever your battery voltage is). Connect it to a USB-C PD port. Done. Go play Xbox or something.You want extra credit and to add a ton of value? Make it bidirectional. Many e-bike batteries already have a USB-A port on them for charging your phone. Give me a bidirectional USB-C port on my battery so I can charge my laptop or any other device from it. Boom, you’ve just made a portable power station out of your e-bike battery! Watch out, Jackery, the e-bike industry is coming for you!OK, squeeze in closer here folks. I want to tell you a secret while the e-bike company CEOs are busy checking with their team to see if this is really as simple as I just described. We only have a few minutes until they come back.There’s a simple reason they haven’t done this yet. The e-bike companies haven’t given us USB-C charging because most of them don’t design or build their own batteries. Most e-bike batteries are entirely designed and assembled in a Chinese factory, then purchased à la carte by the e-bike companies for installation on their e-bikes.Some companies have actually taken the leap to doing partial assembly of their packs in the US, so there are exceptions. But by and large, they’re mostly all pre-built batteries that are chosen from an OEM’s catalog. They may be specced with the cells and the wiring and whatever other components an e-bike company wants, but it’s all menu items. There’s not a ton of original design going into these things.That can change though. Money talks. And after the pandemic, big e-bike companies have a lot of it laying around right now. With their buying power, they can force a Chinese battery maker’s hand and demand USB-C charging for their e-bike batteries. And they should. Do you know how many headlines that would grab?!I’m not even saying USB-C needs to be the only charging option. Give me a 100W USB-C port on a battery and leave your DC barrel plug there too – I don’t care. Sell me a 200W fast charger that uses your own port, that’s fine. I might even buy it for times that I want to charge even faster. But I’m not going to carry that bulky fast charger around with me and that’s the whole point. I need a charger plug that I can find just about anywhere. And when you’re in a group of people these days, at least one of them is bound to have a USB-C charger. Any 100W MacBook Charger or 35W iPad charger is now a backup charger for your e-bike. OK, I have a confession to make. This isn’t quite as simple as I made it seem earlier.It’s close, but there’s a bit more to it. You do really only need to add one small part to an e-bike battery: a USB-based DC-DC converter with a USB-C PD port.But there are other issues here. You’ll likely need to mitigate the heat from that converter with a heat sink. You need to isolate the converter. You need to weatherproof the connector. There’s a bit of work here.But this is all pretty darn simple stuff. And Chinese electrical engineers are good. Like, really good. They designed most of the electronics you’re using every day. This is child’s play for them. They can have a USB-C e-bike battery finished in an afternoon.All it takes is a push. So what do we need? An X-Prize? Fine. Consider this me establishing the Micah USB-C E-Bike Charging X Prize. Or whatever. The first company to put an e-bike with USB-C charging in my hands wins. I don’t know what the prize is. How about $50 to the charity of your choice? Or a video of me riding your e-bike down the road in a pink tutu? Heck, I’ll do both. Or whatever you want. Whatever it takes. Name your prize and get to work. Because this needed to happen, like, yesterday.",ebikes
2022/06/22,"Ever heard of an electric micro-bike? That’s okay, not many have. It’s a fairly new (and largely undefined) class of micromobility vehicles, but one that is growing thanks to several interesting new additions to the market.While technically not really “bikes” at all in the traditional sense due to a lack of functional pedals, electric micro-bikes offer a similar style of seated ride to a conventional e-bike, yet are usually smaller and lighter for added convenience.That convenience is key, since the most common use case for electric micro-bikes is a short-range city commuter vehicle. It’s a similar type of use as folding electric bikes, yet without the added complexities of pedal drivetrains.Take for example the JackRabbit 2.0. This humorous-looking mashup of an e-bike and an e-scooter rolls on 20″ wheels that look like they could have come off a folding bike or a BMX. But the size and minimalist design bring the weight in at just 23 lb. (10.5 kg).Despite the small size, it can still reach a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), making it just as fast as any other Class 2 e-bike in the US. There aren’t any pedals and so you’ll be using purely throttle to get around, but that’s part of the charm of this quirky little electric vehicle. And considering the price recently dropped to just $999, it’s a much cheaper electric vehicle than anything you’ll find on a car lot!We had a chance to test out the JackRabbit earlier this year and found it to be an awesome little commuter vehicle, as long as your commute is under 10 miles (16 km). Spoiler alert: Most purely urban commutes are well under 10 miles.While the JackRabbit offers a bolt-on rear rack to add to its utility, some electric microbikes have designed utility right into the frame.Take the Fiido seated scooter, for instance. The design uses a double wishbone-style frame that is rarely seen on e-bikes or e-scooters, creating a hollow section in the middle of the frame. Since the battery is housed under the seat, the entire middle section of the frame becomes one big basket. The company even provides a fabric bag that fills the space and ensures you don’t lose any small items along the way. As if that wasn’t enough, there’s even a seat pad that can turn the scooter into a kid carrier too, though there aren’t any foot pegs for the little one’s feet so he or she will have to get creative.The top speed is a rather limited 15 mph (25 km/h), but at least the range is quite good at 32 km (20 miles)!This model also offers front and rear suspension, which you don’t normally find on these minimalist micro e-bikes – especially not for the low $899 price.This is another one that we had the chance to test out, and it’s a hoot to ride. It doesn’t quite feel like an e-bike or an e-scooter, but rather something in between.Established low-cost brands like Jetson have also been dipping their foot into the electric micro-bike field for some time now.The Jetson Bolt is the epitome of a simple, easy-to-use electric micro-bike. Everything is hidden away inside a plastic shroud in the center of the frame, giving the little scooter a clean appearance.The small foot pegs don’t take up much space when parked but still give plenty of room for the rider’s feet.A lower top speed matches the Fiido model above at just 15 mph (25 km/h), but the small wheels don’t lend themselves to super fast speeds anyway. Having tested this one myself, I can confirm that 15 mph feels fast enough for such a small model like this.At just $398, this is a steal for someone looking at a super simple, small, and foldable electric micro-bike or seated electric scooter.If the Jetson Bolt represents the most entry-level offering in the electric micro-bike market, then the Emove RoadRunner might balance it out as the most extreme offering in the market.With two motors offering all-wheel drive and a fast top speed of around 35 mph (56 km/h), the EMove RoadRunner is one of the most extreme electric micro-bikes on the market.It is built around a huge 48V and 26Ah battery offering 1,250 Wh of capacity, or around 50 miles (80 km) of range if ridden in a more modest power mode. But with this much power and speed, most riders will be tempted to keep it going faster.There’s front suspension to help manage minor bumps, but the lack of rear suspension means you won’t want to hit any major obstacles at full speed. That padded seat will still launch you upward if hitting a big enough bump at wide-open throttle.Priced at $1,795, this is one of the more expensive electric micro-bikes on the market but also one of the most capable. Considering you get what you pay for, you certainly get a lot with this wild ride.As this style of minimalist electric vehicle continues to grow in popularity, more offerings are sure to hit the market.Could you see yourself on an electric micro-bike? Or do you need the confidence of knowing you have pedals as a backup? Or perhaps you just prefer standing like on a scooter? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/06/22,"The folding electric bicycle company Morfuns has recently improved upon the brand’s Eole S model of e-bike that we recently tested, adding suspension and outfitting the bike for an even more comfortable ride. The new model known as the Eole X marks the latest evolution in the brand’s e-bike development.The new e-bike is actually available in two models. The Eole X sports rear suspension (which appears to be an elastomer-style setup) while the Eole X Pro adds a suspension fork up front for a full-suspension design.Unlike the carbon fiber Eole S, the X and X Pro are both made with more traditional aluminum frames.The bikes are outfitted with a 36V and 10Ah seat post battery in the base model, with an optional upgrade to a 36V 15Ah battery to add 50% more range. A locking seat post clamp allows riders to leave the seat and battery on the bike while parked outside.The company claims a range of 75 km (41 miles) with the base battery and a whopping 115 km (71 miles) with the larger 15Ah battery, though those numbers are almost certainly the optimistic level 1 pedal assist figures.For riders that want to push their range figures even further skyward, an optional bottle battery can be strapped onto the frame to add an additional 7Ah to the 36V battery, with the company claiming a combined maximum range of 170 km (106 miles).Yeah, sureeeee.Regardless of how accurate those range figures are, one thing is certain: Whatever battery you choose will be powering a 350W motor in the Americas or a downgraded 250W motor in Europe.The models don’t show a throttle, which are not legal on e-bikes in Europe, but Morfuns has supplied the Eole S with a throttle to American customers before, so it could be included on bikes destined for the US.The Eole X and X Pro will offer a top speed of 25 km/h (15 mph) on the 250W version of the bike and a slightly faster 30 km/h (18 mph) for the 350W version designed for North America. While that won’t eke out the maximum allowable speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) for Class 1 & 2 e-bikes in the US, we’ve seen other models adopt this 30 km/h (18 mph) limit recently.Despite the rather low power, Morfuns says the motors output up to 64 Nm of torque, claiming the bikes can handle hills with between 20-30º of incline. An 8-speed Shimano deraileur should make it easier for riders to drop into low gear and help the bike up steep hills if those lofty climbing figures don’t exactly pan out.Both models include hydraulic disc brakes and 20″ wheels. The Eole X’s tires are 2.0″ wide and the Eole X Pro gets slightly wider 2.2″ tires.The Eole X offers an early-bird price starting at US $1,298, while the full-suspension Eole X Pro starts at US $1,499. Both of those prices are nearly 50% off of the bikes’ MSRPs. Shipping is expected to begin in September for the Eole X and October for the Eole X Pro.As a reminder, Morfuns is using crowdfunding via Indiegogo to pre-sell its latest electric bike models. While crowdfunding has been used by many of the largest and most established electric bicycle brands, it still comes with risks since it is not a direct sale but rather a “pledge” or “backing” in exchange for the promise of a product. Here at Electrek, we only cover crowdfunding campaigns in cases where the company is either an established brand with a reputation for successfully delivering products, or when the company lets us physically test the product in advance to ensure it works as well as they claim. In this case, we’ve seen Morfuns operate successfully for years and have had previous experience testing the company’s e-bikes.We’ve also noticed other publications beginning to adopt our crowdfunding coverage rule, which is great for the industry.The ruggedness and durability of minimalist folding electric bike frames have been a growing concern ever since the crowdfunded Fiido X was recalled for a design defect that caused the bike to break in half. Morfuns alluded to that bike when discussing why they chose aluminum over magnesium, explaining that they “recognized the problem of mass frame breakage in another brand, so Morfuns chose the more traditional but more reliable option of aluminum alloy welding.”It seems Morfuns may be attempting to head off any reliability concerns, sharing a GIF of accelerated load testing performed on the aluminum frame. As the company explained, “through rigorous vibration testing, Morfuns far exceeds industry standards, and the original frame design provides higher stability.”We hope to get a chance to test out the Eole X Pro soon and compare it to our experience on the Eole S, which was already a great option for riders with fairly smooth roads on their commutes.Until then, let’s hear what you think.

2022/06/21,"Chinese manufacturer Bafang is a titan of the electric bike motor industry, and thus news swirling around the company generally trends toward new motor announcements. But the latest headline-grabbing product unveiling from Bafang isn’t a motor at all, but rather an internally geared hub designed to provide automatic shifting on both electric and non-electric bikes.The new Bafang hub offers three gear ratios and is able to shift between the gears automatically based on the bike’s speed.The hub is designed to fit a wide variety of wheel diameters and thus can have its cadence-based shifting points adjusted to meet changing wheel sizes and bike requirements.Unlike some internally geared hubs that weren’t originally designed for the high torque of electric motors, Bafang’s offering is intended to withstand powerful motors pulling up to 80 Nm of torque.While that won’t be sufficient for some of Bafang’s most extreme motors that can output torque figures at twice that level, it will cover most of the company’s motor lineup as well as nearly all European mid-drive motors like those made by Bosch and Brose. The automatic shifting nature of the hub removes the need for a shifter cable or handlebar controls, simplifying the user interface and reducing cable clutter on a bike and its bars.Bafang says that the hub is designed for compatibility with a wide range of electric bikes from city and utility e-bikes to cargo electric bikes. Interestingly, the company is also positioning the hub for use in non-electric bikes as well, which would put it in competition with other major bicycle component manufacturers such as Shimano.The new internally geared hub is designed to work with either typical chain drives or alternative belt drives. Belts such as those developed by Gates Carbon Drive are becoming an increasingly popular option for mid- to high-tier electric bikes.We had the chance to tour Bafang’s manufacturing facility in 2019 and watch how the company assembles its motors on its production line. You can see that process in our video tour of the Bafang factory below.We’ve actually suspected for some time now that Bafang would get into the transmission game. It makes sense considering that many of the company’s more powerful motors have pushed the limits of existing bicycle drivetrains produced by OEMs such as Shimano.This isn’t even Bafang’s first transmission in a hub, though it may the company’s first standalone model. Bafang has previously produced hub motors with built-in automatic two-speed gearboxes, and some of that development work likely helped lead the design of this new three-speed hub.I’m a bit surprised we haven’t seen Bafang innovate on the higher power end of the transmission range, considering its highest power motors are commonly known to be particularly harsh on basic bike components such as chains and sprockets that aren’t designed to handle such high power and torque levels.Perhaps such a transmission is still under development though, with this 80 Nm offering being an early release before its big brother hits the market.",ebikes
2022/06/20,"When it comes to mid-drive electric bikes – or e-bikes with the motor mounted near the pedals – you’re generally looking at a group of higher quality but also higher priced e-bikes. But with the Ride1Up Prodigy, though, we’ve finally discovered the best of both worlds: A high quality mid-drive electric bike complete with German-made motor yet that is still available at an affordable price. And that’s why the Ride1Up Prodigy just may be the best mid-drive electric bike for anyone shopping on a budget. Compared to hub motor electric bikes (that have the motor in the center of a wheel), mid-drive e-bikes are usually more natural feeling, more balanced and provide a nicer experience for those that actually like to pedal instead of just riding an e-bike like a motorbike.The downside of mid-drive motors is that they are more expensive, which means that low-cost mid-drive electric bikes (under $2.5k or so) generally use lesser known Chinese motors instead of the costlier European mid-drive motors like Bosch and Brose. To get those nicer Euro motors, you usually have to spend well north of $3.5k or more.But the Ride1Up Prodigy is perhaps the first e-bike to offer US customers both an affordable price (just $2,295!) and a great quality motor.Check out my test ride video below to see the Prodigy in action – it’s worth it! Then read on for my complete written review!Ride1Up describes the Prodigy as “feeling so natural, you will forget it’s electric.” After having put some good miles on this e-bike, I can almost 100% agree – with one caveat. Yes it’s pretty darn natural feeling, but when you crank the power meter up into higher power modes, you’ll remember it’s electric because you’ll really start flying!The German-made Brose TF Sprinter motor feels so natural in large part because it uses a torque sensor to intuitively measure how hard you are pedaling and then apply power based on your own inputs.It doesn’t feel clunky or laggy, it just feels like you’re stronger than you really are. When you push the pedal lightly, you get a little assist. When you push harder, the motor instantly kicks in harder. It’s you, but with more oomph.The other factor at play here is that the high quality motor uses internal belt reduction instead of toothed gears, meaning it is essentially silent. Many e-bikes have perceptible gear whine from the motor, even though they’re still fairly quiet. But the Brose TF motor here on the Ride1Up Prodigy is so quiet that you don’t even know it’s there, adding to that natural feeling of the bike.As I mentioned, though, the Ride1Up Prodigy has some serious power that won’t allow you to forget that it’s offering you palpable assist. Don’t let the silly “250W” label fool you; they have to put that on European-made motors to meet local e-bike laws. This thing puts out way more true power, as evidenced by its 90 Nm torque rating. That’s enough to get you flying up to 28 mph (45 km/h) quite quickly! You’ll need to put in some good effort on your own, as it’s only going to give full power assist when it measures that you’re also pressing decently hard on the pedal. But when you’re ready for the extra boost, the Ride1Up Prodigy will deliver!The 36V and 14Ah battery provides 504 Wh of capacity, which translates into somewhere around 30-50 miles (50-80 km) of range. If you’re riding all the time in the highest pedal assist level, you can find your way under 30 miles. Or if you stick to level 1, you can actually get over 50 miles. But somewhere in that range is where most people will settle most of the time.The lack of a throttle may be a bummer for those that like knowing they can rely on motor power alone at the end of a long ride (or who are just feeling a bit lazy in the morning), but it also helps improve the range. Since you have to pedal at least somewhat, you’re always helping the motor – even slightly. That means a modest 500 Wh battery will always give you more range than you may be used to on a throttle-controlled electric bike.From my experience, the Ride1Up Prodigy electric bike feels like a dual purpose commuter/leisure e-bike. The high quality parts make it great for either type of riding.The nice components include hydraulic disc brakes, a higher-end Shimano Alivio transmission than we see on many e-bikes (with 9 speeds instead of the common 7), a comfortable Selle Royal Viento saddle, included aluminum fenders combined with a stylish rear rack, built-in LED lighting (including rack-integrated rear tail light), and that beautiful color display from Brose.With all these great parts, the bike both looks and feels a step or two above most other mid-level and budget-class electric bikes. And of course you can feel the difference in the ride.I should note that I’m testing the Ride1Up Prodigy XR, which is the step-over street version that is also available in a step-through frame (that’s the Prodigy ST). There’s also an XC version that is a cross country bike, which makes it more of a trail bike than a true mountain bike. But it does swap the rigid commuter fork for a suspension fork as well as update the gearing a bit, plus it subs in some trail-ready tires in place of the slicker street tires. If you think you’ll be riding more nature trails and single track than streets, the XC is probably the right choice for you. It will of course work great in the bike lane too, but would be much better for anyone heading off-road.At a current price of $2,295, the Ride1Up prodigy is incredibly fairly priced.That might seem high considering most of the company’s other e-bikes fall in the $1,300-$1,600 range, and they even have a couple models right around $1,000.  But keep in mind that you’re getting a much higher-end drivetrain here, not to mention several other nice components.That German-made motor doesn’t come cheap, but it’s worth it. Brose motors are renowned for their quality and smoothness. Then it gets paired with a great Shimano Alivio transmission (or ‘great’ by us normal e-biker standards – I’m sure some lycra-bois will tell me it’s nothing compared to a Shimano XTR 12-speed). Then consider those hydraulic disc brakes, custom designed rack that looks great and holds the tail light right in the metal to protect it, the comfortable seat, included full-metal fenders, etc. There’s just a lot going on here that will take the average commuter or leisure e-bike rider to the next level, getting a bike shop e-bike experience for an online e-bike price.I don’t say this lightly when I call the Ride1Up Prodigy the best mid-drive electric bike on a budget. It’s an awesome deal for an awesome riding e-bike.",ebikes
2022/06/17,"Serial 1, the electric bicycle brand spun off from Harley-Davidson’s own internal e-bike development, has just unveiled its new SWITCH/MTN electric mountain bike. The announcement comes just a few short weeks after the brand unveiled its BASH/MTN e-bike.The BASH/MTN used a similar-looking frame design to the rest of Serial 1’s e-bikes. While the shared frame design created with hydroformed aluminum tubes and sporting internally routed wires and cables has largely won praise in the industry, the BASH/MTN bike unveiled a few weeks ago left many scratching their heads and wondering why the trail bike’s frame was paired to a rigid fork.As it turned out Serial 1 already had a front suspension bike – commonly referred to as a hardtail – in the works, which the company rolled out this morning.The brand described the SWITCH/MTN in its own words, saying, “Extremely off-road capable, SWITCH/MTN has the performance to satisfy an expert rider, but careful attention to fit and fine details ensure that our latest eMTB is just as accessible and accommodating for riders who are just beginning their off-road adventure too.”Serial 1’s brand director Aaron Frank went further, detailing why Serial 1 doubled down on its expanding off-road direction:The vast majority of our world is unpaved. Fire roads, Jeep trails, singletrack paths, terrain parks, ski hills, state forests—there are so many great destinations to explore on two wheels and SWITCH/MTN, with its powerful motor, large-capacity battery, fully adjustable front suspension, and wide-ratio 1×12 drivetrain, has the all the performance and capability to take you anywhere you want to go.If many of the parts look familiar next to Serial 1’s other urban e-bikes, that’s because they share the same DNA. The SWITCH/MTN is built on a similar foundation, including the same 90 Nm mid-drive Brose S Mag motor and proprietary in-frame 529 Wh removable battery developed in part by Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire motorcycle engineers.The bike has new off-road geometry though, helped by Suntour’s premier ZERON35BOOST AIR fully adjustable suspension fork, high-volume Michelin E-Wild knobby tires, and a TranzX dropper seat post to let riders dynamically adjust their seat height at different points along the trail.The mountain bike drivetrain includes components from SRAM’s SX Eagle lineup, such as a 1×12 gear setup combined with an electric bike-specific single-click trigger shifter. Braking comes from high-end TRP Slate T4 hydraulic disc brakes that feature four pistons and are specifically designed for electric mountain bikes. They bite down on large 203 mm rotors that are a full 2.3 mm thick, all but eliminating the chances of brake fade when bombing long downhill segments.Lighting comes from Serial 1’s in-house designed BAF (Bright As F***) headlamp and high-visibility RAT (Rearward Awareness Technology) combination tail and brake lights that are built right into the frame near the rear dropouts.Coming from someone who has accidentally stared directly down the barrel of that headlight (and barely lived to tell), I can confirm that the name is apt.The SWITCH/MTN is also app controlled, taking advantage of the recently announced partnership with Google Cloud to make the bike more connected than ever. And to keep your phone charged up, the bike includes a 10W USB-C charging port on the handlebars.The new model is available in four sizes of S/M/L/XL, with the L size weighing in at 53 lb. (24 kg).Pricing starts at $4,499, and the bike is available now either online or at various Harley-Davidson and LiveWire dealerships.While we haven’t had a chance to try the new Serial 1 electric mountain bikes yet, you can take a look below at our first ride on the company’s street-oriented models when we took them for a spin in Milwaukee before their public release.

2022/06/14,"Walmart has long offered an interesting array of low-cost electric bicycles. Some of the bikes have even dipped down into ultra-budget territory with prices below $400. It can be a good option for those that want the utility of an electric bicycle but don’t have a lot of spare cash. But while Walmart is known for its super cheap e-bikes, the company has never offered higher-end e-bikes with nicer features like mid-drive motors. At least, not until now with the launch of Kent’s new mid-drive electric bike.I’m not entirely sure what the exact model name is here. If Walmart’s product listing is any indication, the bike is known as the “Hyper E-Ride Electric Bike, 29inch Wheels, Men’s MID DRIVE MTB Dual-Suspension, 36 Volt, 20+ Mile Range, Matte Grey.”Try telling that to someone while out of breath in the middle of a ride!Whatever it’s called though, one thing is obvious: Walmart and one of its major e-bike suppliers Kent are stepping up their game with a nicer version of a popular electric bike model.Mid-drive motors are one of the two most common electric bike drivetrains, with the other being hub motors. Most low-cost electric bicycles use hub motors – or a motor housed in the center of a wheel – simply because they are cheap and easy. They cost less to produce, and they are basically bulletproof in terms of user error.Mid-drive motors, on the other hand, are more costly to produce due to their more complicated design. That complication also makes them a bit more touchy, at least for new riders that aren’t used to shifting a bike.Mid-drive motors, unlike hub motors, actually power the bike through the standard gears on a bicycle. Hub motors, on the other hand, are single-speed drivetrains that bypass the gears and chain altogether, allowing them to be controlled quite simply as there are no gears to worry about. This is a gross oversimplification, but you can kind of think about it like automatic versus manual transmission cars, at least in terms of simplicity and ease of learning or use for the driver.The advantages of mid-drive motors, though, mean that you’ll usually find them on higher-end electric bikes, whereas low-cost electric bikes tend to favor hub motors. With mid-drives offering advantages – including more efficient and more comfortable pedaling, plus the ability to downshift for more torque when pedaling up hills – many more serious e-bike riders that use their two-wheelers for fitness prefer a mid-drive setup.In the case of Kent’s mid-drive electric bike, seen above, it’s not clear exactly which 250W motor is used. Nicer (i.e., more expensive) e-bikes tend to use fancier mid-drive motors like those made by Brose, Bosch, Yamaha, and other major German or Japanese manufacturers. Cheaper mid-drive electric bikes tend to opt for Chinese-made mid-drive motors like those from Bafang, Truckrun, Tongsheng, and others.With a price of $1,498, Kent’s mid-drive e-bike certainly isn’t competing with the several thousand dollar models that use German mid-drive motors, and so it likely opts for a Chinese motor. That isn’t a bad thing, as many riders (including myself) have been very happy with lower-cost mid-drive motors. I have a Truckrun motor on my daily rider city e-bike, and it works wonderfully.The rest of Kent’s mid-drive e-bike fits more in line with the other budget models in its class. A 36V and 10.5 Ah battery claims a range of 20 miles (32 km) from its 378 Wh of capacity. Simple front and rear suspension offer a bit of spring without costing an arm and a leg. A 7-speed Shimano transmission may be low-end, but it is at least a name-brand component. And the mechanical disc brakes are likely plenty for a 250W bike that isn’t going to get up to 20 mph (32 km/h) very quickly.It doesn’t exactly look like a master class in full-suspension mid-drive e-bike design and calling it a mountain bike requires a bit of a poetic license, but the bike also helps bring mid-drive functionality to riders who otherwise couldn’t afford it on more expensive e-bikes.And yes, the Lectric XPremium is probably the best game in time now when it comes to mid-drives at affordable prices. For just a bit more at $1,799, the dual batteries, significantly higher power/speed, hydraulic disc brakes, and a pile of other features blow this Kent bike away. But Lectric’s model is also a folding fat tire e-bike and won’t fulfill the trail bike role that Kent’s offering here claims to satisfy.Having not ridden Kent’s new e-bike (yet, but hopefully that changes), it’s hard for me to judge it too hard on the spec sheet alone. But for the $1,498 price, it’s at least an interesting addition to a slew of Walmart e-bikes that so far haven’t taken a shot at such higher-end (or perhaps even midlevel) markets.What do you think of Kent’s new mid-drive full-suspension electric bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/06/12,"With average national gas prices passing $5 per gallon in the US, there’s no time like the present to find a cost-effective alternative to driving. And if that money-saving alternative happens to be fun, efficient, healthy, and better for the air your kids breathe, then all the better. In fact, considering how much gas costs right now and how big many American cars are, you’d be surprised how few stops at the gas station it would take to buy you a brand spankin’ new electric bicycle that could replace many of your local trips. Plenty of people have saved thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars by replacing their cars or trucks with e-bikes. Could you be next?For some reason, pickup trucks are the best-selling vehicles in the US. If you drive a big truck, it would take you surprisingly few fill-ups to buy an e-bike. An F-150 has a 26-gallon fuel tank, which puts a $5 per gallon fill-up at $130. Many of you reading this are currently paying even more than $5 per gallon, depending on where you live. California averages around $6.50 per gallon right now, for example.Believe it or not, just five tanks of gas at $5 per gallon could get you a budget-level electric bicycle. Here at Electrek, we’ve personally tested several Amazon e-bikes like those $600 specials from Ancheer. That’s just five tanks of fuel if you drive a truck, or around seven to eight tanks if you drive a sedan. SUV drivers, you’re somewhere in the middle at around six tanks.That Ancheer is, of course, a fairly low-end electric bicycle and will just get your foot in the door. If you’re willing to forgo a bit more driving at the cost of one or two more tanks of fuel, you can get some really awesome rides for not much more dough.Consider a $799 Lectric XP LITE. That’s a recently released folding electric bike that weighs just over 40 pounds, yet it can travel at 20 mph for 15–25 miles on throttle or pedal assist. You can fold it up to toss it in your trunk if you want to use it to extend your commuting abilities (drive from the ‘burbs to the city edge, then ride in to beat traffic) or use it to replace your car entirely. And with the built-in throttle, you don’t even have to pedal if you don’t want to (though you’d be surprised how much fun it can be, not to mention some great light exercise).We reviewed the bike recently and found it to offer great bang for your buck, almost as much as its 28 mph and $999 big brother, the Lectric XP 2.0.For those that want to rock full-size wheels instead of smaller 20″ wheels, I’ve got a couple of other recommendations for you. The RadMission from Rad Power Bikes is an affordable $1,199 e-bike that offers 20 mph speeds and a range of up to 40 miles with some decent pedaling (or closer to 20 miles if you run on throttle only to save your legs). Check out my full review to see why this low-cost electric bike could replace many of your around-the-town car trips, totally gas free!You can even see a video of me testing it out below.Or if you want an even lighter e-bike that goes faster to around 25 mph, the $1,045 Ride1Up Roadster V2 is a definite winner in my book. It lacks a throttle, though the $1,195 Core-5 from Ride1Up will get you back into throttle territory.There are even some really beautiful offerings such as the 20 mph Aventon Soltera, complete with integrated battery and head/taillights. It is priced at just $1,299, or the equivalent of 10 tanks of gas. It’s important to mention, though, as our friends at Cycling News accurately reminded us recently, that for the price of zero tanks of gas you, could be riding the old pedal bike that is probably gathering dust in the back of your garage. Spending money isn’t always the best way out of a problem, and if you already have a bicycle that isn’t getting used, this could be a great time to pump up the tires and get it back into action.As I’ve pointed out in the past though, many people, unfortunately, don’t ride pedal bikes as car replacements due to the higher level of exertion they require. That’s is one of the main reasons electric bikes are now helping so many returning riders leave their cars in the garage for around-the-town trips.Electric bikes are already skyrocketing in popularity, especially as more affordable alternatives to cars (and I haven’t even mentioned the significant financial savings on parking, car payments, insurance, oil changes, and yearly registration, which could add up to hundreds of dollars in savings per month).With everyone else waking up to the many benefits of e-bikes, isn’t it time you gave one a try?",ebikes
2022/06/10,"REI has just launched two new models of e-bikes as part of its new “Generation e” line of electric bicycles. The new e-bikes were unveiled under REI’s Co-op Cycles bicycle line and are known as the Co-op Generation e1.1 and Generation e1.2 e-bikes.Unlike REI’s last big e-bike unveil, the urban-centric Co-op CTY e2.1 and CTY e2.2, the new Generation e line is designed for utility riders.That means smaller diameter 20″ wheels in a wider 2.4″ motorcycle-inspired tire, a low frame that is easy to mount, and a one-size-fits-most sizing doctrine.The bikes also feature memory foam saddles, dual Y-style kickstands, and LED lighting in both the front and rear.As REI’s general manager for cycle Nate Nielsen explained:This e-bike line was designed to help make it easier for people to hop on and go. The frames and features give them approachability and versatility, whether you’re a new or seasoned rider, dressed in workout gear or jeans.The bikes are outfitted with Shimano 7-speed drivetrains and Tektro hydraulic disc brakes. In a nod to affordability, the e-bikes are powered by 350W Bafang hub motors instead of mid-drive motors like REI’s last big e-bike reveal.The two models both reach a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), but have other important differences.The Generation e1.1 uses a 36V 11.6Ah battery rated for 30-40 miles of range (51-64 km), has a Suntour suspension fork, and includes and integrated rear rack. The Generation e1.2 uses a 48V 14Ah battery rated for 40-50 miles of range (64-80 km), has a more cargo-optimized rigid fork and includes both a front and rear rack. Both models weigh 54 lb. (24.5 kg).Both models are classified as Class 1 electric bikes, meaning they do not have a throttle and instead use pedal assist to provide motor support when the rider pedals. The motor support cuts out at 20 mph (32 km/h), meaning that riders can pedal faster but will be on their own at higher speeds without the assist of the motor.The Generation e1.1 is priced at $1,499 and available now, while the Generation e1.2 is priced at $1,899 and will become available in September. Radrunner, anybody?Just kidding, sort of. I mean, the bike does share some Radrunner-esque design features, and looks like that bike had a baby with a VanMoof, but there’s some definite uniqueness here, too.I’m a big fan of this type of small diameter wheel utility e-bike, and so I’m glad to see REI getting in the game. Plus it is hard to complain about the lower entry price, though considering the more entry-level model has a weaker 36V battery, I could have been happier with a couple hundred bucks cheaper on that model. Compared to something like a Tern though, these prices are practically rock bottom. But of course, these e-bikes don’t carry the same build quality or high-end parts as an expensive Tern.As it is though, these are some nice entries into the utility e-bike space. Suspension and hydraulic brakes are both great upgrades over some other similar models that lack those parts, even if the 36V battery feels a bit anemic for an e-bike intended for light cargo duty.What do you think of REI’s Co-op Cycles Generation e1.1 and Generation e1.2 electric bikes? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/06/09,"German automotive manufacturer Porsche isn’t sitting in the slow lane when it comes to expanding the company’s reach in the electric bike market. Porsche’s latest power move in the two-wheeled EV industry just saw it buy up Fazua, an innovative electric bicycle drive manufacturer.Fazua makes a number of interesting electric bicycle drives and components, but the company’s flagship product is an e-bike drive that allows both the motor and battery to be completely removed from the bike.The removal can be done in seconds and essentially turns the bike back into a pedal bike, shedding almost all the weight of the electric drive system. It’s a huge advantage for cyclists who want to enjoy the assist of an electric motor during some training rides, but also want to ride their bike assist-free without the weight penalty of carrying around an unused motor (many e-bikes already have easily removable batteries).Porsche had already bought up 20% of Fazua earlier this year, but has now completed its acquisition of the company by buying up the remaining shares.At the same time as Porsche’s initial purchase of 20% of Fazua, the automaker also announced that it was establishing a strategic partnership with Ponooc, a Dutch investment company that specializes in sustainable energy and mobility solutions. Porsche says that it will establish two ventures with Ponooc.As the company explained:The first joint venture is to develop, manufacture and distribute a future generation of high-quality Porsche e-bikes. The second company will focus on technological solutions in the fast growing micro-mobility market.That news followed on the heels of Porsche announcing that it was buying up high-tech Croatian electric bicycle company Greyp late last year.Combined with Porsche’s own in-house line of electric bicycles and now these new acquisitions, Porsche seems dead-set on expanding its stake in the electric bicycle and larger micromobility industry.Porsche isn’t stopping there though. The company just announced this week that the automaker is expanding its venturing network by collaborating with UP.Labs, a new model for fostering innovative startups.According to Porsche, the startups’ focus “will revolve around Porsche’s core activities. For example, these could involve predictive maintenance, supply chain transparency or digital retail.” However, some leading industry analysts have speculated that Porsche’s expanding light electric vehicle activities could also be used to target micromobility startups, leveraging the agility of new ventures to make quick progress in the rapidly developing electric mobility industry.That would see Porsche taking a leading position in the growing trend of major automotive manufacturers throwing their hats in the e-bike and light electric vehicle rings.Peugot has its own extensive line of e-bikes, and Spain’s SEAT has partnered with Barcelona-based Silence to roll out its own seated and standing electric scooters.GM developed an electric bicycle in-house, though the project was killed off early in the COVID-19 pandemic.ŠKODA rolled out one of the weirdest electric bike/scooter concepts we’ve seen, though there’s no indication it is headed for produciton.Jeep has gotten into the high-power e-bike game via licensing agreements, though its similar attempt to co-develop an electric scooter was significantly less impressive.Even motorcycle manufacturers like Harley-Davidson and BMW Motorrad have gotten into electric bicycles and scooters, though Harley’s results have been much more impressive than BMW’s.",ebikes
2022/06/08,"While the Golden City is far from perfect and certainly has its own fair share of problems (name one that doesn’t), San Francisco is known to lead on many social issues. And the latest move from SF will soon see it giving out dozens of free electric bicycles to delivery drivers to be used as delivery e-bikes.It’s part of a pilot program run by San Francisco’s Department of the Environment. The goal is to provide relief to delivery drivers who are suffering at the pump just like many other drivers, but to do so in a way that doesn’t lead to further financial burdens, i.e., the cost of car ownership.According to the SF Examiner, one-third of delivery drivers from Amazon Fresh and Doordash are on some form of public assistance, making this an ideal group to benefit from a cost-effective form of alternative transportation.And of course there are ulterior motives at work here too, albeit good ones. The fewer drivers there are on the road in San Francisco, the lower the levels of pollution, traffic, urban grime, and countless other car-related issues that plague major urban areas.The free delivery e-bike pilot program is set to begin in September, where an initial 35 electric bikes will be given out to delivery drivers. The specific model of e-bike to be used has not been announced.According to the SF Examiner:App-based delivery drivers working for companies like Doordash, Instacart and Uber Eats will be selected for the program based on to-be-determined criteria, with a focus on social equity. The drivers will receive bikes, helmets, locks, saddle bags, rain jackets and other accessory gear free of charge and indefinitely. The program, administered by the nonprofit GRID Alternatives, will also include complimentary insurance as well as safety training from the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition.Data will be collected from the e-bikes and compared to a control group of delivery drivers using cars, helping the program operators to evaluate the validity of the delivery e-bikes. “The business case we would like to make is that you could earn more per mile per delivery on an e-bike than you would in a car,” explained Lowell Chu, program manager for the Department of the Environment.The program will cost $559,000 and will be covered by a grant from the California Energy Commission.I’m not quite sure how the price of 35 delivery e-bikes plus a pile of helmets and bags reached such a high figure, but those must be some pretty darn fancy bikes. As it stands, several companies already make delivery-specific electric bikes such as the Juiced HyperScorpion Express that are ideal for delivery riders.Even several general purpose e-bikes can be outfitted in utility format, such as the $999 Lectric XP 2.0 that can employ a $149 cargo package to add a ruggedized front and rear rack, making it an excellent delivery e-bike.This sounds like an amazing program for two reasons.First, it is targeting a group of residents that specifically needs this type of assistance. It’s helping reduce their costs and making it easier for them to get around to do their job. That’s a double whammy.Second, it’s simply a better way to do food delivery. Where I live in Tel Aviv, all delivery drivers use two-wheelers. They’re either electric scooters, electric bikes, or gas motorcycles (with the occasional electric motorcycle thrown in there). You wouldn’t last a day if you tried to do food delivery in a car. And every time I travel to major European cities, I see the same thing. Food delivery riders instead of food delivery drivers. It’s quicker, cheaper, and easier.So the more cars we can take off the road and replace with smaller vehicles like delivery e-bikes performing these important tasks, the better. And the closer the US will come to learning from solutions already employed by the rest of the world.Lead image credit, second image credit",ebikes
2022/06/07,"Electric bike manufacturer Evelo is back with a brand-new model known as the Evelo Galaxy SL. The updated model is designed as a comfort cruiser that should be ideal for a wide range of riders.With a laid-back frame and relaxed riding style, the Galaxy SL exudes cruiser vibes.It also does what many other cruisers can’t: opens the door to less vertically gifted riders. The Evelo Galaxy SL is rated for riders from 4’10” to 5’10” (147-178 cm), meaning it joins a short list of e-bikes for short riders. A short short list, if you will.Designed to feel light and nimble, the 54 lb. (24.5 kg) electric bike rolls on somewhat smaller than usual CST Cyclops 24″ x 2.4″ tires. There’s no suspension in the frame or fork, but the spring saddle and 2.4″ tires should combine to give a decently smooth ride as long as the beach path isn’t cratered. Adding a simple suspension seat post might make the ride just a bit nicer, though the stock Selle Royal saddle is already a nice piece of kit.Powering the Evelo Galaxy SL is a Dapu 500W mid-drive motor that puts out 740 peak watts of power and 90 Nm of torque. The motor should get the e-bike up to a maximum speed of 25 mph (40 km/h).The mid-motor uses a KMC chain to drive an Enviolo continuously variable transmission (CVT) that should allow riders to dial in the exact gear ratio of their preference. A torque sensor is included in the mid-drive motor to provide the most natural-feeling pedal assist, though riders will also find a throttle on the handlebars that can be used to activate the motor without any pedaling input required.Evelo claims a maximum range of 50 miles (80 km) from the 36V and 13Ah battery. With just 468 Wh of capacity though, don’t expect to get that range while riding on throttle only. You’ll have to rely on a lower level of pedal assist to achieve that maximum range figure.Along with the torque-sensing mid-drive motor and Enviolo CVT, other nice parts included on the bike include Zoom hydraulic disc brakes (180mm front rotor and 160mm rear rotor), 3.7″ color display, included rack and fenders, and included LED lights.The Evelo Galaxy SL is currently priced at $3,499, marked down from its MSRP of $3,699 for pre-orders that are expected to ship in August.While there are some nice aspects to this bike, and I also appreciate seeing more options for short riders (my wife would love the low standover of this e-bike, as she’s a low cruiser fan), the price feels a tad bit steep. Yes, you get that nice motor, an excellent transmission, and some nice brakes, but the battery is rather small and there’s no real suspension going on here. Plus, 2014 called and it wants its rack battery back.On the other hand, Evelo offers a four-year warranty, which is largely unmatched in the industry, so you are also paying for longer service and support than you would get elsewhere. And the Evelo bikes that we’ve tested in the past have earned some pretty good marks, so the company is obviously doing things right.Ultimately, if you’re looking for a comfortable bike designed for a shorter rider but still want a high-end drivetrain, the Evelo Galaxy SL could still be a great option.",ebikes
2022/06/05,"I’ve been an electric bike proponent for well over a decade. My love affair with e-bikes began when I discovered their utility as car replacements (and has led to me living essentially car-free since high school). But I learned more about their usefulness as I dove deeper into the fitness and recreational aspects of e-bikes. Now, after a recent trip around Iceland, I have gained a whole new appreciation for electric bikes as tourist wheels. And here’s why you should definitely consider renting an e-bike on your next vacation.When my wife and I travel, we usually like to dive a little deeper into the city or country hosting us. That means checking out the local eateries, craftsmen, parks, or anything else that could give us a closer look at the local culture. Tour buses, hop-on-hop-off excursions, and walking tours all have their advantages, but they also tend to keep you separated from the city you’re exploring.We recently tried renting electric bikes as a way to get around Reykjavik, and now I never want to go back to seeing a city through glass or to spending a half-hour walking to a cool local site that could have been a seven-minute bike ride away.For this trip, we stopped by the Reykjavik Bike Tour folks (who also apparently offer Segway tours too, but we wanted to get some good pedaling in, electric or otherwise). The team there was super helpful and offered both opened-ended and guided e-bike tours. We like to feel pretty independent, so we went with the first option so we could explore on our own. But they helpfully left us with a giant map and pointed out all the coolest places along with suggestions for where we’d find the best bike trails and interesting sights to see.In terms of hardware, I hopped on an Ikea e-bike that didn’t offer any special bells or whistles, but worked just fine and allowed each one of my pedal strokes to get amplified with the help of an electric assist motor. When renting an e-bike, you’re limited to the options at hand. But fortunately, most e-bikes will offer you a similar experience, bells and whistles aside.My wife, who is quite petite, didn’t fit on the same model of electric bike that I used, but they helpfully rolled out a cute little Xiaomi e-bike that seemed like it was purpose-built for her, and so she had a blast on that model. Both were folding models, which would have been neat if we wanted to toss them in a car and head farther outside of the city. But with so much to see right there in Reykjavik, there was no reason to get a car involved in any of this.Neither e-bike had a throttle, which we’re both used to using, but European e-bike regulations generally mean that all of their e-bikes have the fun switch removed. Even without a throttle, a bit of light assist is all you need as long as you don’t mind doing a little honest pedaling yourself. That turns out to be part of the fun and also ensures you don’t get going too fast to miss the fun sights around you. It’s also a nice compromise as on pedal bikes we’d probably have spent more energy cranking out pedal strokes in the city and had less time or energy to enjoy the sights and sounds around us. And yet we were also still getting in some decent exercise, as my Fitbit helpfully informed me.With our electric bikes helping ease the ride, we were able to pedal right along the Icelandic coast, stopping whenever we wanted to walk on the beach and get a closer look at anything that jumped out at us. We’d never have been able to do that with a tour shuttle, especially since the roads didn’t even go that close to the most beautiful parts of the beach. We’d stop at small little harbors along the way and watch seals playing in the water, then hop back on the bikes whenever we were ready.Riding back into the city found us on the streets again, but it was easy to wind our way into the less busy paths and away from traffic. A cute little hilltop park called our name, so we stopped there for a picnic lunch. Pro tip: remember to bring a little backpack for food and water on an e-bike excursion as you’ll still work up an appetite and a thirst!Each time we wanted to check out another attraction or a cool little spot, it was just a few minutes away by bike. We had walked much of the city the day before, and we realized how much easier it was to get around to see some of the things that we wrote off as being “too far” previously.Frankly, I don’t know how I’ve gone so long as an everyday e-bike rider but have yet to take advantage of these awesome tools on vacation. Renting an e-bike is like a cheat code to opening up a new city and exploring it faster, for longer, and with a bigger smile on your face.Maybe I hadn’t realized this yet since I often think of going to a new city or country as a time to do something different, as in out of the norm. But if e-bikes are my norm every day because of how great they are to navigate my own city, then it makes sense that they’d be great to navigate most other cities too. And having had that experience in Reykjavik, I’m definitely looking forward to finding some electrified wheels on my next trip.Electric bicycles are becoming an increasingly popular form of alternative transportation and a growing option for both fitness and leisure. But these are usually expensive machines, which makes buying one just to try it a risky endeavor. If you have a local e-bike shop that offers test rides, that’s a great option. But since many people don’t have a local option for electric bike test rides, perhaps renting an e-bike on your next vacation or trip to another city would be a great way to get your feet wet, so to speak.Until you try an e-bike for the first time, it’s hard to imagine what an odd combination of child-like fun and adult-like utility these things offer. But the first time you throw your leg over one and spin it up, you get it. We often talk about an “e-grin” in the e-bike industry – that smile that all first-time riders have when they roll back around after their first loop on an electric bike. It’s something that transcends just about everything that separates us and makes us unique. In the end, it’s hard to find a person that doesn’t enjoy taking a spin on an e-bike.And the more they integrate themselves into my own life, whether that’s my daily supermarket run or my once-in-a-while vacation excursion, the more I’m loving the fact that these awesome rides exist. ",ebikes
2022/06/03,"I recently wrote an opinion piece about how the United States Postal Service (USPS) could look to solve its gas-guzzler truck problem by following Europe’s example of delivering mail with smaller electric cargo bikes. As it turns out, the postal service has already been testing this out, and the little electric mail bikes look pretty snazzy too.Not only are they designed to carry heavy cargo loads, but they’re also built in the US by Montana-based Coaster Cycles.The electric mail bikes are built on the Freighter AW platform, which can be modified for various types of commercial e-cargo bike applications.Technically it’s an electric cargo tricycle, but it almost looks more like a cargo van than a bike.The giant rear cargo box provides 72 cubic feet (over 2,000 liters) of space for mail, and the bike can hold up to 400 lb. (181 kg) of cargo. Hydraulic disc brakes help bring all of that weight to a stop quickly and safely.Powering the bike is Bosch’s Cargo Line e-bike drive system, which supplies the rear wheels with 85 Nm of torque. The drive system is paired with a 500 Wh battery to power the mid-drive motor, though multiple batteries can likely be swapped in to extend the range. It’s not like the bike lacks space to carry a spare battery or two.The mid-drive motor runs through a sophisticated automatic transmission based on an Enviolo CVT, meaning mail carriers can spend less time worrying about shifting and more time looking for house numbers and watching the road.Smaller diameter rear wheels help keep the cargo box lower to the ground, while rear view mirrors help the rider see over the back of the cargo box.The bike’s cockpit includes a backup camera to make the bike easier to handle when reversing in tight spaces. While most e-bikes have excellent rear visibility, I can see how a backup camera would come in handy on this particular model.So far, the USPS e-bikes seem to be working out nicely. Christopher Jackson, the director of city delivery, explained in The Postal Record:While there are still many things to consider and evaluate with these new e-bikes, I am hopeful that the Postal Service will continue exploring eco-friendly options for city delivery. I enjoy hearing feedback from the carriers who are participating in the tests. Thank you to the Florida bicycle carriers for welcoming NALC representatives and providing valuable insight, as well as for their dedication every day as they pedal many miles through their communities delivering the mail. As always, my heartfelt thanks goes out to all city carriers, as you continue to provide excellent service to the American people despite the many challenges.The news of additional electric vehicles working their way into mail carriers’ routes couldn’t come soon enough.The United States Postal Service is currently dealing with the fallout from backlash to its new gas-guzzler mail truck plans.The USPS initially announced that it would be purchasing up to 165,000 mostly gas-powered Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDVs) from Oshkosh Defense Corp.The original plan was for 10% of those vehicles to be electric, though the USPS then increased that percentage to 20% for their initial order of 50,000 vehicles. The gas-powered NGDVs will get as low as 8.6 miles per gallon (approximately 27.5L/100km) during operation.However, several lawsuits have recently been filed against the USPS regarding the high percentage of gas-guzzling vehicles in the order.As Electrek’s Jameson Dow recently explained:The lawsuits filed today rehash many of the recent arguments against this decision, primarily focusing on the USPS’ failure to do timely environmental assessments. They argue that not only was the initial environmental assessment undertaken after the contract was announced, but that the assessment was deficient in considering air quality and climate impacts of the plan and did not seriously consider other alternatives to the gas guzzlers the USPS decided on.Per the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed in 1970, federal agencies must publish environmental impact statements (EIS) before any change in policy that is likely to have an environmental impact.But USPS’s environmental assessment has been panned as insufficient not only by all the groups filing lawsuits today, but also the White House and EPA, which sent letters criticizing the plan (which also conflicts with President Biden’s order to convert the entire federal vehicle fleet to electric). Even the USPS watchdog group, the Office of the Inspector General, stated that the agency would benefit from adopting more electric vehicles than their current plan.",ebikes
2022/06/02,"When Giant Group’s new “lifestyle-inspired” electric bike sub-brand Momentum unveiled the Voya E+ 3, it did so at a positively mid-range price of $2,400. That brought it in below the fancier mid-drive e-bikes in most bike shops but well above the value-oriented direct to consumer e-bikes. Considering it has one wheel solidly in each camp, let’s see how it competes against the rest of the industry.I had the chance to get some hands-on testing with the bike when Momentum agree to let me go nuts on one of their demo models for a couple of weeks. Having never tested an e-bike from this brand before, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect after I covered the bike’s original unveiling.On the one hand, it’s a fairly low-powered hub motor e-bike and thus isn’t going to knock anyone’s riding socks off in the power department.On the other hand, Giant Group knows their way around a bike, and thus the bike is well made with mostly good-quality parts, and so I knew this one would be better than a fresh-off-the-boat white-labeled electric bike directly from China, so to speak. You can come along with me on my rides in my testing video below, then keep reading for the rest of my complete review.The Momentum Voya E+ 3 is part comfort bike, part commuter bike. It’s not as forward-leaning as it might look (see my ride video above for reference), but also isn’t a totally upright, cruiser-style ride either.Between the comfortable touch points in the saddle and handlebars, it’s a much better feeling ride than some ultra-lightweight commuter e-bikes out there, that’s for sure.It’s also only borderline “ultra-lightweight.” At just under 40 lb. (18 kg), it’s definitely a lighter electric bike than we’re used to seeing. But it’s also not going to blow away in the wind. Again, that’s the first of many compromises you’ll see in this e-bike.Part of the lightweight design comes from the lower power drivetrain. That rear hub motor is just 250W and 30Nm (though I’ve also seen Giant literature that lists it as 25 Nm, so I’m not sure which to believe). Anyway you slice it, it’s a modest assist motor, not a powerhouse.It’s fine for getting you up to the bike’s top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), but not quickly. This is very much a cyclist’s type of e-bike. It’s for someone who enjoys cycling – as in pedaling – but wants a constant tail wind in the form of some light electric assist.If you punch it up into the highest assist mode, then you’ll feel some nice power, but it’s never going to feel overpowered. The Momentum Voya E+ 3 just ain’t that type of e-bike, folks.The battery isn’t huge either at just 250 Wh, but that’s actually quite appropriate for the bike’s design. With an energy-sipping motor and controller, you can make that battery last all afternoon. Giant Group says it will stretch itself to 45 miles (72 km) in the lowest assist setting. I’m not sure if it will or not, as I just couldn’t bring myself to ride around in pedal assist setting 1 all the time. It’s such a light level assistance that I kept giving into the urge to bump up the power level by a click or two. I like a bit more power than that, what can I say?But when it does come time to recharge, the 4A charger will get the battery mostly filled in barely two hours. Between a lower-than-average battery capacity and higher-than-average power charger, it’s a bit like filling a bucket with a fire hose: It happens quickly.On the user interface side, there’s a nicely integrated “display” in the top tube that takes the place of the kind of digital displays we’re used to seeing on the handlebars. You’ve got a pair of LED bars to indicate battery level and pedal assist level. There’s a multi-function button for turning the e-bike on and for making power selections. It almost disappears into the top tube, which is a snazzy and low-profile way to do it. You can’t fault the Momentum Voya E+ 3 for having too much gear in your face, that’s for sure. And I’ll take a nice, clean pair of handlebars any day of the week.The other more mechanical interface points are nicely spec’d as well. The hydraulic disc brakes are punchy and confidence inspiring. The 9-speed MicroSHIFT transmission gives plenty of room to run through the gears. And the fairly narrow bars make this a nimble ride that cuts a nice compromise between twitchy and responsive. There’s of course no suspension on the bike, it’s a commuter after all. But the 38c tires in 700c diameter are a bit bigger than you’d see on a purely urban ride, so there’s a tiny bit more forgiveness there. Even so, this isn’t the bike for someone that has major back issues or just doesn’t like feeling the topography of the road.While I’m mostly happy with everything I see here (even if I could always do with a little more power), I’m a bit surprised by the polymer pedals. They just jump out as cheap looking, and I didn’t expect to see plastic pedals on a $2,400 e-bike. They may be lighter, but they scratch up quickly and they just don’t look the part for such a classy and stylish e-bike like this.Ultimately though, for a mid-priced e-bike, I think the Momentum Voya E+ 3 results in a mid-level ride. It compromises nicely between the fancier bike store e-bikes and the direct to consumer rides. You can get higher end parts with the former and you can get more power and battery with the latter. But if you’re looking for a Goldilocks option in the middle, I can see this falling into that niche. I may forever fault Momentum for not giving us built-in lights, which I think are a necessity on a true commuter e-bike, but I’m happy with the rest of the bike. It’s a higher-end and more nicely refined machine that I typically see from direct-to-consumer companies, and it wouldn’t look out of place sitting next to a $3,000-$4,000 bike store e-bike. But it also saves you several thousand dollars with a simpler drivetrain and modest component selection. Plus with three different frame sizes to choose from, it goes way beyond what we normally see from e-bikes at half its price range.The Momentum Voya E+ 3 won’t be for everyone, but it might be the missing link between the good and the great that is sorely lacking in this market. If that’s what you’ve been on the hunt for, then I’d recommend checking it out. If you don’t want a low-power electric bike for light assistance, then I’d skip it in favor of higher-power models with more bang (and power) for your buck.",ebikes
2022/06/01,"UK-based premium electric bicycle maker Gocycle is redesigning the company’s retail model in a move to bring more value to both its retailers and its customers. The good news for the latter group is that the new model means much lower pricing on Gocycle’s most premium (and most expensive) fourth-generation e-bikes known as the G4 line.The move is centered around the company’s new Gocycle Showroom Partner (GSP) program.The program allows its current bike shop partners, as well as new bike shops that want to enroll in the program, to court Gocycle shoppers while keeping less physical stock on hand.As Gocycle’s designer and founder Richard Thorpe explained:The world has changed and we must too! Amidst a challenging and dynamic global economic backdrop we’ve adapted and streamlined our G4 model sales approach to pass on savings to our customers and provide stock flexibility to our retailers. Things are tough out there with cost-of-living increases and stock availability. We’ve taken a look at all of the areas in our promotion, warehousing, delivery and sales process, and where possible, we’ve implemented cost savings to make our entry level model more competitive and accessible to a wider customer and retailer base.At a time when e-bike production lines are increasingly strained due to supply chain–related issues, that will allow more shops to help more customers find the Gocycle e-bike they are looking for.Keeping just a few showroom bikes on hand will allow riders to perform test rides, while the shop helps customers order a specific model and color combination for delivery (though customers can of course also order a bike themselves online). The shop then continues to cover service and support for the customer (including a free 100-mile [160 km] service inspection and tune-up), ensuring they aren’t stuck trying to do their own tune-ups or maintenance on an expensive bike that they might be nervous about wrenching on alone.Speaking of expensive e-bikes, Gocycle’s high price on the G4 line is also dropping thanks to the new program.The G4 e-bike was previously priced at $4,799, but has now dropped by $800 to $3,999. That follows a previous $200 price drop earlier this year.As Richard continued:The result is that our Gocycle Showroom Partner program brings the G4 model into a price range compatible with many government cycle to work purchase and tax credit schemes in the UK, US, and EU. We have also implemented some amazing interest free finance options for our customers that reduce monthly ownership costs.Our retail partners benefit by not having to hold extensive stock at a time where credit is becoming more expensive. In particular, we have focused on lowering the barrier to onboarding Gocycle with new dealers as we continue to invest and grow our retailer partner network. Many dealers are not able to benefit from our global brand PR, promotions and offers, but with our GSP program, they now can and will.The G4i and G4i+ models (of which I reviewed the latter in the video below) remain a bit higher priced, but pack in even fancier options. All of the bikes feature a fast folding design, single supported wheels including a carbon fiber single-sided fork, MotoGP-inspired racing tire compounds for increased traction, a CleanDrive pedal drivetrain that completely seals the drivetrain, and of course the hidden silent motor and battery combination that make Gocycle so unique.",ebikes
2022/05/31,"Crowdfunding is a common way for many small companies to get their start, and is especially common in the light electric vehicle industry for e-bike and e-scooter companies. But let’s face it, crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo are still erroneously synonymous with scams in the minds of many. Believe it or not, many of the biggest names in electric bicycle companies these days actually got their start on those platforms, proving that just because a company is pre-selling e-bikes doesn’t mean they won’t deliver.That being said, there’s of course some legitimate basis for the aversion to crowdfunding held by many e-bike shoppers. While these campaigns often present themselves as simple pre-order arrangements, the fine print says otherwise. Technically, backers (those forking over their cash) are simply pledging monetary support to a company, and that’s the end of the legal agreement. The companies doing the crowdfunding promise in exchange that backers will receive rewards or perks (the product being pre-sold). But that’s really all it is, a good faith promise.While rare, a small number of companies have in fact taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars and failed to deliver the e-bike or e-scooter before, often due to changing market conditions during COVID-19 or various mismanagement reasons. But those represent a tiny fraction of the cases. For the most part, successful crowdfunding campaigns result in successfully sending out pre-ordered e-bikes and e-scooters, though the products almost invariably arrive behind the predicted schedule.It may surprise you to learn that some of the following major players in the e-bike market got their start just like this.Technically speaking, Rad Power Bikes traces its lineage back over a decade and a half to when founder Mike Radenbaugh began hand-building his own DIY electric bicycles as custom-built orders. And while that is true, the major leap forward that helped launch the company to its current position as the largest e-bike brand in North America came when Rad launched its RadRover fat tire electric bike on Indiegogo in 2015.That campaign introduced the RadRover to a wider audience, managing to pre-sell the bikes for a price of $999.Compare that to today’s prices for a $1,999 RadRover 6 Plus (which is admittedly a much higher-end e-bike than the original seven-year-old RadRover 1).You can check out the new model in my first ride experience on the bike, seen in the video below.Ultimately it just goes to show, today’s new entry to the market as a quaint little Indiegogo campaign could be tomorrow’s industry top dog, perhaps one day reaching Rad’s level of selling as many e-bikes in an afternoon as its original campaign sold in a month.Today we know GoCycle as the ultra-premium folding electric bicycle company founded by former McLaren engineer Richard Thorpe. The bikes are fancy, space-age wonders that feature fast-folding designs with suspension, exotic materials, fully enclosed drivetrains, and more. The entry-level models can be found in the $3-4K range while the fanciest of the bunch head northwards to $6K or more.But back in 2016, GoCycle was a much smaller company. After already rolling out in its domestic market of Europe, GoCycle went global with a Kickstarter campaign for its 2G and 2GS folding e-bikes.Back then, $1,999 was enough to land you a high-end folding e-bike – if you were brave enough to take a chance on the young company.Sure, $2K was definitely a big ask back then. But compared to today’s prices, that’s practically pocket change.Widely considered to be the leading lifestyle electric bike brand in the US (and probably much of the world, if we’re being honest), SUPER73 wasn’t always known as the marketing and branding powerhouse it is today.Way back in 2016, it was launched as a small Kickstarter campaign with big aspirations.The original Super73′ (back before the apostrophe was dropped) was upstart Lithium Cycles’ first offering, coming with similar speed and performance figures compared to today’s SUPER73 models, such as a 1,000W motor and a 25 mph limit.But the original bike did so with some majorly different components, such as a Bafang mid-drive motor and a less elegant rack-style battery. $1,799 was enough to score the first model, which eventually went on to retail for $2,999.The brand has a come a long way in design and marketing, but their little known origins are a reminder of what is possible when a small community of backers help a plucky e-bike startup get rolling.These days the e-bikes that fly out of SUPER73’s factory are much more polished and feature flashier designs, custom tires and more.The company also regularly partners with famous brands to build custom models that leverage SUPER73’s unique styling.Check out my recent test ride on a SUPER73 bike when my wife joined me for some joyriding around LA on a SUPER73-ZX, seen in the video below.Going even further back to 2015 brings us to Canadian electric bike company Biktrix’s humble beginnings.Long before Biktrix was innovating its own 2,500W electric bike drivetrains, the company got its start as a Kickstarter campaign for a humble fat tire electric bike.A pledge of around US $1,699 was enough to land you the mid-drive Juggernaut fat tire electric bike, combining the thrill of all terrain riding with the performance of a Bafang BBS02 mid-drive motor.Today Biktrix is known as the Canadian leader in powerful high-performance electric bicycles. The Juggernaut line is still alive and well, and the manufacturer’s mid-drive electric bikes as well as more affordable hub motor line are highly regarded.But back in the day, they were just another startup looking for a chance to succeed.Propella is known for its lightweight and iconic blue hipster-spec electric bikes that are favorites among the traditional-urban-cyclist-turned-electric-cyclist crowd.But back in 2017, the company was just getting prepared to launch its second-generation e-bike with an Indiegogo campaign.The e-bikes pre-sold for $949 for a single-speed version, which compares favorably to Propella’s $1,099 e-bike today.That campaign even followed on the heels of a 2016 campaign for the original version 1 e-bike, which interestingly came with an option for hot pink rims.I never tried the second generation of the e-bike back in 2017, but I have tested out the current fourth-generation e-bike and fell in love with it immediately.Propella has parlayed its crowdfunding success to launch a number of other models too, include a mini-sized e-bike with 20″ wheels for lower weight as well as a higher-end 9-speed electric bike that retains that urban messenger bike styling.SONDORS is a big name in e-bikes these days, but the brand began with an infamous start when the company launched a $500 electric bike on Kickstarter.The new company was believed to be a scam in many circles simply because at that point no manufacturer had managed to sell a $500 e-bike at a profit.After a lawsuit-avoiding name change from the Storm e-bike to the SONDORS e-bike, the company shocked the naysayers when actually did deliver (though it’s anyone’s guess whether there was a profit margin left over in that first run of e-bikes).The campaign was so successful, raising nearly $1.4M, that it was one of the highest-funded Kickstarters of the time.Today SONDORS not only has a wide range of low-cost and higher-end electric bicycles, but is dangerously close to delivering its first ever electric motorcycle model as well.The days of a $500 fat tire e-bike, though? Sadly those are long gone.ONYX’s electric mopeds are classy, retro-inspired electric two-wheelers that bridge the gap between electric bicycles and electric motorcycles.The ONYX RCR launched with impressive specs during a 2018 Indiegogo campaign, touting a top speed of 60 mph.The bike was originally available for a modest price of $2,299. These days? An RCR will run you $4,349. This will forever be “the one that got away” for me.For those that want to grab an ONYX style ride but don’t want to pay RCR prices, the company is relaunching its CTY2 step-through design for $3,699. The 45 mph top speed of the CTY2 is a bit more muted than the 60 mph RCR, but it still looks like a million bucks to me.The Kuberg Freerider is a fairly well-known electric trail bike these days. It competes in a similar class as the famous Sur Ron Firefly as a lightweight but highly-capable off-road electric motorbike.The Kickstarter campaign offered the full-suspension Kuberg Freerider – at the time rated for 2,000W of power and 34 mph (55 km/h) speeds – for just $1,999. The company also offered smaller versions for younger riders starting as low as $799.The campaign barely reached a third of the $100,000 goal and thus didn’t succeed, meaning the 24 backers who opened their wallets didn’t end up on the hook for the bikes. Even so, Kuberg soldiered on and the rest is history. Today Kuberg’s popular bikes include many models, and the Freerider has increased in price to $5,500, though the speed and power have increased considerably to 43 mph and 14,000W.The JackRabbit may look like a funky little electric scooter, but this “micro electric bike” as the brand calls it is actually a fun and easy-to-use alternative to larger electric bikes and scooters.I know because I tried it. And it was awesome.It’s not technically an e-bike since it doesn’t have pedals, but instead allows the rider to rest his or her feet on foot pegs. Even so, it gives a bicycle-like ride thanks to the larger 20″ wheels. Compared to a typical standing electric scooter, it’s a lot more confidence inspiring. And while today you can just pluck one off the company’s website, JackRabbit originally got its start as a Kickstarter campaign back in 2018. Back then the small sum of $449 got you your own odd little electric two-wheeler, if you were brave enough to pre-order it and risk your cash.Today the bike, in new and improved form, runs for $999. It’s really a fun little runabout, and you can see my own review of it in the video below.A-Ride, the wacky and wild mashup between an electric mountain bike and a standing scooter that we checked out at the last CES, also benefitted from a crowdfunding launch.The Canadian company got a big boost on Indiegogo in 2020, launching the novel form of electric transportation and recreation for a pre-order price of around US $3,200.These days the price is a bit higher at around US $4,580.Early backers certainly took a risk on both a new design and a new company. But that risk paid off for the more than 100 early adopters that put up the cash to help A-Ride grow into the company it is today.It just goes to show that a novel and head-scratching design may look odd, but could just become the next big thing.Cero is known for its high-quality mid-drive cargo e-bikes that rock a smaller front wheel for lower a center of gravity.It’s a neat design that we tested ourselves, instantly becoming smitten with the bike.But before the brand grew to its present status, it was running a Kickstarter campaign to try and get started. And interestingly, it didn’t even succeed. The company tried to pre-sell its electric cargo bikes for $2,399 but only made it half way to its funding goal. That meant that none of the backers actually paid the company, since no funds are transferred when a Kickstarter campaign doesn’t succeed to reach its goal.A lack of a successful campaign didn’t stop Cero from forging ahead, and the brand was still able to grow in an impressive comeback story.Now the Cero One is a respected and unique entry in the global electric cargo bike market, despite its rocky start on Kickstarter. Oh yeah, and these days it is priced at $3,799. Kind of makes you wish you could have grabbed it for the Kickstarter price and saved $1,400!While we typically think of the huge electric bike companies we know today as having always been there, many titans of the industry began as humble little crowdfunding projects.These days we see plenty of new startups trying to get their footing with interesting and novel designs in the personal electric mobility space.Could any of these be the next big thing? If history is any guide, they just may be!",ebikes
2022/05/30,"The Velotric Discover 1 is a great value electric city cruiser with surprising quality given the entry to mid level price. There’s so much to love about this bike, but the look, is undoubtedly the first positive impression. The Discover 1 has a wonderful build that blends utility and aesthetics.The Discover 1 is really good looking in photos, but it’s looks even better in person.The quality on the Velotric Discover 1 really shows, with a very striking frame that is a refreshing take on the electric cruiser platform.  The rear triangle comes up to meet the rear rack, and the bottom bracket is met with a bold frame joint that stands proud and becomes a part of the design. On the front of the bike rests the headtube, which is large and accommodating for both the mechanical features, but also holds the internal cabling for a better fit and finish.Powering the Discover 1 is a 500w rear hub drive motor with an output of 65Nm of instant torque. Combined with the large capacity battery of 48v and 14.4ah, the bike has a stated range of up to 48 miles on level 1 pedal assist. Even at full throttle, I would expect to see about 30 miles of range without pedaling. Using the pedal assist function, the Discover 1 could last much longer than most people want to be on a bicycle seat.But the Discover 1 has a secret power too. The high capacity battery is constructed with Samsung or LG 21700 cells (the same size form factor of cell used by Tesla), which enables greater power output in bursts of energy. These cells can handle more high output discharge compared to the common size (the 18650). Moreover, theses cells are made for balanced lifespan and power applications, making this a perfect choice for city cruising.As a Class-2 electric bike, the Discover 1 is equipped with a throttle, and a 20mph top speed. This makes it a legal bicycle in most municipalities, normally in cities where the bike is meant to explore.As a city champion the Discover 1 has both front and rear integrated lights, and the rear light also has a high beam for brake light functionality. The actual stopping power comes from a set of 180mm mechanical disc brakes, which also house a motor-cut off function. Keeping strength and function, the frame is a step through design made of reinforced aluminum with an angular motif throughout the bike. The rear triangle features a clean cut and fantastic lines, a real head-turner in many ways. It’s hard to find a bike of this quality and unique design at this price point. It’s very easy to mount and dismount, but also maintains steady steering on the road. This laid back riding position takes stress off the rider, and allows the bike to take the brunt of the road imperfections.The discover 1 has some hidden features that add value behind the scenes. First off is the UL2849 certification. This classification ensures the electronics on this bike have been tested for resistance to fire and electrical shock for the entire drivetrain and charging systems.More noticeable, is the internal routing and sleek design of the bike itself. The cabling and wires for the bike slide into the frame of the bike, making for a clean look from front to back. The electrical cables meet at the controller, which is internally housed in the frame, preventing damage or risk to the electric system.On the business side, the Discover 1 comes equipped with a rear rack for carrying extra cargo of various sizes, both trunk bags and side panniers. It also is equipped with full front and rear fenders  protection against the weather and road debris. The 7 speed Shimano drivetrain operates in full alongside the motor, still putting some skin in the game, albeit, a bit much easier. Not only riding in style and utility, the Discover 1 features a wealth of comfort points. The ergonomic grips have a great texture on all sides, the handlebars come to meet you, taking strain off of your back, and the saddle is wide and plush to reduce fatigue. A surprising benefit is the front shock on the discover , making this bike much more fit for urban exploration than stiff bikes at a cheaper cost.Surprising enough, all of this is delivered to your door with free shipping in the lower 48 states, and for a regular MSRP of $1,899 this is a lot of quality value for a great price. Right now they are performing a launch sale, where you can save $500 off, making the bike slide in below the $1,400 mark.This puts the Discover 1 on a very short list is UL2835 certified electric bikes in this price point, perhaps the only one at $1,399. You can follow Velotric for its latest announcements on YouTube and IG. ",ebikes
2022/05/27,"….that pedals smoother than most acoustic bikes up to 25mph. I’ve spent the last few weeks with Luna’s new $1395 Eclipse folding fat tire e-bike. It is unlike any other e-bike on the market, and yet I can recommend it enthusiastically for a big swath of the foldable fat tire e-bike market. And even some general e-bikers. Here’s why:One look at Luna’s new Eclipse e-bike, and you know there is something special here.It is part BMX, part fat tire folder and part full-suspension e-bike. Add to that solid components all around like a 1kW Bafang geared rear hub motor, aluminum alloy frame, Gates CDX belt drive and big 672Wh removable battery and we’re looking at an incredible package that Luna is somehow selling for under $1400. That price however means some costs had to be cut. Some components are great but not are all amazing – notably mechanical brakes and mid-grade suspension. No gearing makes 20mph+ pedaling difficult and top assist speed of just 25mph. Still though, with full suspension, gates belt drive, great wheels and 1kW of power and 672WH of battery, this is an amazing package and more importantly the Luna Eclipse is so much fun to ride and own. Update: I hadn’t seen the Enki Billy bike which obviously was inspiring. Thanks commenter.The Eclipse arrived about a week from order placed via FedEX from Luna’s HQ in El Segundo/Los Angeles, CA. FedEX contracted a local last mile delivery service to get it to my door, and the box arrived in great shape.Unlike some foldable bikes that come mostly assembled and folded in a wider/shorter box, Luna’s Eclipse arrives in a traditional long, narrow bike box with about 10 minutes of assembly required. You’ll only need some scissors for the zip ties, a hex for the four handlebar screws, and a wrench for the pedals and front wheel. Other than that, and putting the seat in and optionally adding some air to the tires, it is ready to go. The process is super easy and even someone with zero experience putting together a bike could do this in just a few minutes. One thing to note about the foldability of the Eclipse is that the handle bars don’t fold, so it ends up being a bigger package than some other folders. For tight space trips, you could just loosen the four hex screws and fold the down the 8-inch handle bars, or even loosen the front bolts and take off the front tire. One thing I really like about Luna’s packaging (for all of their bikes) is the liberal use of cardboard as padding. Only a few pieces of plastic protection and zip ties (15?) are used and that waste can be held in one hand. The rest is recyclable paper products which feels very eco-friendly. Luna posted an incredibly detailed and useful unboxing and assembly video below, which I’ll not attempt to usurp:The bike battery came in about 2/3rds charged, so I immediately plugged it into the fanless 54.6V 2.0A Barrel Charger made by Wuxi Dpower (note Luna specs say 2.5A). Fanless means it is going to be a little more rain-proof but no such warrantees are given. An extra charger for the office or backpack is going to run you about $30. A full charge takes about six hours with this charger, but Luna offers faster 5A chargers that will cut charge time by more than half. I really couldn’t wait to jump on this thing and take it for a spin. It definitely has a BMX vibe/approachability but the step over height is deceptively high at 73 cm or almost 29 inches, especially compared to other 20-inch wheel folders. Another less obvious departure from a typical 20-inch fat tire e-bike is the the standard seat here. Rather than a banana seat or a bench or even a comfy saddle, Luna ships the Eclipse with a Chifa seat made for pedaling. It isn’t anything to write home about comfort-wise, but it also doesn’t make pedaling an afterthought like a lot of the heavier Super73-style bikes out there. That’s one of my big takeaways here. You can actually pedal this bike. On a flat surface, it feels like a regular acoustic bike with the power off. It glides like a bike with much narrower wheels. For short trips where your speed doesn’t need to get terribly high, some folks won’t even turn the power on here. That’s impressive for a bike with a 1kW motor.Eclipse owners who expect to see a 1kW motor on their bike will be disappointed that the motor that it ships with, the Bafang RM G.06 48V 500W, is rated for half that much nominal power. However, Luna ships the bike with a double power controller which maxes out at 48V and 21-22A. My first thought was, “Is this going to overheat? Not be terribly efficient at high power?” After a few weeks of taking my not lightweight self up a 700ft hill without issue, I had 0 issues with the motor. This one is also rated at 80nm of torque. After a recent big climb, I did an old fashioned heat test (put my hand on the motor). It was a little warm, but not hot. Luna says they’ve done hours and hours of testing on the dyno and that it can handle 1000kW all day long.Riding the Eclipse is instantly different than most 20-inch fat tire bikes I’ve tried. The low 55lb weight, the low rolling resistance tires, and the Gates CTX belt drive combine to make this an entirely pedal-able bike. Add 1kW to the pedal assist or throttle, and you are playing with the acceleration of those heavier Super73/Juiced Hyper/Arial Rider type of bikes that are pushing close to double the motor and battery requirements. Up steep hills I was close to the same 15mph that I get on the heavier, less efficient bikes. For better or worse, however, the motor cuts out at 25mph making this a “class 2.5-ish” bike. Unfortunately, most people will stop pedaling long before they reach 25mph. With the one gear speed that Luna optimized for fast starts and hill climbing, the ability to pedal at 18-25mph is a test of cadence threshold. That’s probably my major complaint about real world usage. I like to pedal assist and get at least a little exercise when riding. I found that dialing the assist down to about 3 (0-5 are options so that’s probably ~500W) and pedaling briskly got me up around 18mph on flat roads. Compare that to my 250W class 3 commuter e-bike which gets me to about 25mph on flat roads. However on the steepest and most dangerous hill on my commute, that 250W commuter bike drops down to 8-10mph, whereas I have no issue hitting 14-16mph on the Eclipse. That makes me feel a lot safer.I got the Eclipse up to 45mph on a downhill, and it felt relatively safe and stable. The Tektro brakes and 180mm discs are just fine for bringing this 55 lb. bike to a stop. I did need to tighten the brakes a few mms after about a week of usage, which is completely normal.Luna includes a 48V 14AH (672WH) removable pack with LG MJ1 18650 cells, which is quite a bit bigger than other packs we see at this price point and even higher. It locks into the tube with a hidden bottom and is chargeable inside or outside the bike with the same port. I have a hilly 10 mile round trip commute to “the office” (read: coffee shop) – after two trips on level 3 pedal assist, I had used about half the battery, so I think 40-50 miles is realistic in normal settings. On throttle alone I think you’d be closer to around 25-40 miles depending on the speed, weight of the rider, and the amount of hills. There’s no USB port here on the bike or battery which is a shame because it could make a great backup power supply or iPhone charger. Hey this thing is full suspension, fat tire e-bike with a kilowatt of power under the hood. Of course it goes off road! But I’d stick to the beginner – or at very worst – intermediate trails on this one. The tire tread isn’t great for mud, and the suspension just isn’t mountain grade. However, the Luna Eclipse kicks ass on gravel giving a much better ride than I expected, even in rain. The biggest differentiator between this bike and other fat tire e-bikes is likely the high-end Gates CTX belt drive. By no means is this a cost saving feature, but it is certainly a weight saving feature. By removing the chain, gears and controller, Luna is saving a significant amount of weight while at the same time providing a much smoother and simpler pedaling experience with much less maintenance over time. But that also means adding gearing would jack the price of this thing up significantly requiring an internal geared hub. I would pay a few hundred extra for a 3-gear setup, so maybe a Shimano Nexus makes sense here? As it stands, pedaling gets hard before you get to 20mph. Other small quibbles I have with this bike:Again, Gates CDX components are expensive, so it is beyond impressive that Luna got these in a $1400 bike. As I’ve said throughout, the Luna Eclipse is a game-changer of a bike and unlike anything we’ve seen before. It looks like a cool BMX-ish bike, rides like a smooth, fast commuter bike, folds, goes off-road, has impressive power and range, and costs way less than you’d ever think. The few quibbles I have are a result of Luna needing to get the price down, and I have to say that for the vast swath of e-bike buyers, the tradeoffs were overwhelmingly worth it. Buy the $1395 Eclipse direct from Luna. ",ebikes
2022/05/27,"If you know anything about me or the topics I cover, you’ll know two of my biggest hobbies revolve around electric bicycles and DIY projects. So combining them has always been a natural conclusion for me – to the point that I even wrote the book on the subject.With so many great electric bicycles already available at your local bike shop or from direct-to-consumer online companies, some people may wonder why it could be worth performing your electric bike conversion anymore. But the ability to repurpose that bike gathering dust in your garage or build the exact e-bike of your dreams means that a DIY option is a still a great choice for many riders. Plus, being able to do it all for just a few hundred bucks helps sweeten the pot!These days you can find plenty of different all-in-one electric bike conversion kits that make the process simple and easy.We’ve tested several of them, such as the Swytch kit, that include everything you need in one simple package and hide away most of the electronics in a neat handlebar-mounted battery.But to make the price even more affordable (and offer a bit more power), you can find some slightly more generic options on sites like Amazon.I’ve often used Amazon for the combination of detailed reviews of kits and the ability to see which kits are newcomers and which have sold hundreds or thousands of units. Sure, reviews can be faked, but finding a pile of detailed good and even mediocre reviews along with people’s installation photos (or even a few bad reviews, for that matter) can help separate genuine products and reviews.I recently performed an e-bike conversion on a simple mountain bike using a $469 Amazon e-bike kit that came with the motor, controller, battery, accessories, and even a little bag to hide away all the extra wiring.The 500W kit fit nicely on a Schwinn mountain bike I had, bringing the total build price in at just under $500, including a special mount I had to get to make the battery fit the rather low water bottle bolts on that specific frame.For less than the cost of the cheapest retail Amazon electric bike, I was able to build my own using a more powerful 48V system and reach speeds of around 24 to 25 mph (40 km/h) with a reasonable range of around 20 miles (32 km).Sure, it’s not going to compete against the more expensive retail e-bikes, but it sure does a nice job for something I threw together in my backyard for a fraction of the cost.The process is quite simple, believe it or not. You basically remove the bike’s rear wheel and pull the tire/tube off. You swap those onto the wheel that comes in the kit (which conveniently has a motor in the hub) and then install the motor wheel on the bike in its place. The battery gets bolted onto the water bottle mounts in the front of the frame, and all of the color-coded connectors are plugged into each other. A few zip-ties get installed to hold down the wires and you’re ready to rock and roll!There are a pile of interesting e-bike kits out there to choose from, and that variety gives you plenty of options.In the past, we’ve seen fun DIY fat tire e-bike builds such as a project that Electrek’s publisher Seth Weintraub threw together on a Mongoose fat tire bike.While it may not have the flash or pizazz of a retail e-bike, it sure offers nearly the same performance for a mere fraction of the cost. And the ability to recycle a bike you already have lying around but aren’t using helps to make the deal even sweeter!Have you performed your own electric bicycle conversion? Let’s hear about it in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/05/26,"The West Coast Electric Highway in the US, which sees electric car charging stations dotting the route from the Canadian border in the north to the Mexican border in the south, is getting a new type of EV charging station as well. Now you’ll be able to charge up your electric bike along the way too, at least in the Oregon section.That’s because the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has announced that it has taken the initiative to outfit all 44 of the electric car charting stations along the Electric Highway in its states with extra 110V plugs.Those outlets can be used by electric bikes, or other smaller micromobility vehicles like electric scooters or electric unicycles, to charge up at the same stations used by electric cars.The announcement was made at a press event this week where Oregon Governor Kate Brown discussed the state’s commitment to electric vehicle charging of all forms. On hand was an e-bike that was used to demonstrate the new 110V charging outlets by recharging the electric bike on the spot.The chargers currently reside along I-5, I-84, US 101, and a few other highways in the state. Further work on the Electric Highway is ongoing, with several more charging stations expected to be added later this year. All of them will contain charging outlets that can be used by electric bikes.Unlike electric cars, which generally charge on Level 2 receptacles that offer higher power (or DC Fast Chargers, which offer even higher power), electric bicycles use Level 1 charging. That means they plug directly into a typical wall outlet and charge just like a cellphone or laptop.While Level 2 charging stations for cars are becoming much more widespread, especially on the US West Coast, e-bikes aren’t nearly as fortunate. Anyone who has had their cellphone battery run dry in the middle of the day knows how hard it can be to find an electrical outlet while out in public. Now imagine you’ve got to roll your 50+ lb. (22+ kg) electric bike up to the outlet you finally located. That’s exactly why states like Oregon are making a point of installing dedicated outlets that can be used by electric bicycle riders and other users of micromobility devices.It also helps head off the phenomenon of “guerilla charging,” where e-bike riders seek out any outlet they can find. I once performed a 500-mile (800 km) e-bike ride over several days and had to charge up along the way anywhere I could find. When I was lucky, I could plug in an extension cord at a restaurant as I stopped for lunch. When I was unlucky, that meant rolling up behind an ice machine at a gas station and plugging into the outlet there while hoping no one noticed – another one of those “better to ask for forgiveness than permission” moments. Hey, I bought some snacks!But with the growing number of initiatives to democratize electric vehicle charging for all EVs – not just electric cars – electric bike owners may one day wake to an entirely new charging landscape.via: Bike Portland",ebikes
2022/05/25,"Gates, a leading belt transmission manufacturer that creates chain-replacing belt drives for bicycles, motorcycles and other power transmission needs, has just unveiled the newest update to its Carbon Drive portfolio of belt drive products. The updates include new as well as upgraded components across its four key product lines (ST TM, CDN TM, CDC TM, CDX TM).Belt drives are prized for their many advantages of chain drives, including reduced maintenance, longer life spans, lower noise, and lack of oil that can muck up your ankle or pants’ leg.They’ve proven incredibly popular on mid-to-high-end electric bicycles as consumers have flocked to their quiet and maintenance-free operation, and Gates’s belt drives have even begun working their way onto more affordable electric bikes.Gates has thus become a household name in belt-drives for bicycles and can be found on countless e-bikes across the industry.Gates’s CDX line is the company’s premium power transmission line for bike products and is designed for bikes operating over long distances in extreme riding scenarios. It offers 3x the life span of a traditional chain drive. Gates has added to this product line by unveiling a new CDX:BLACK sprocket line for high torque applications, which is especially useful for mid-drive e-bikes and bikes with mid-gear boxes. The sprocket line will feature a wide range of rear & front sprockets to accommodate a variety of interfaces, including Shimano Inter-5e, Enviolo, Kindernay, and Bafang hubs, as well as the Valeo geared mid-motor, Pinion gearbox, and more.Gates’s CDC line is introducing a brand-new belt designed specifically for mid-drive e-bikes. Gates says the design will be cleaner, quieter and more convenient for riders.On the more affordable end of the spectrum, Gates’s CDN line is designed for mid-range applications and seasonal bikes or occasional commuters. The design is more appropriate for hub motor e-bikes that don’t see as high levels of torque applied to the belt drivetrain.Balanced between performance and value for urban/city bikes and hub-drive e-bikes, the CDNsystem is tailored to mid-range applications for seasonal on-road riding and occasionalcommuting. The newly updated CDN belt includes carbon fiber tensile cords, a new ethylene elastomer (EE) compound, and Gates’s signature debris-shedding CenterTrack TM design for improved durability and wider operating temperature range vs. the first-generation CDN belt.Gates has also unveiled a new tensioner that is compatible with the CDX & CDC product lines. The tensioner is designed to make it even easier for manufacturers to convert their bikes from chain drives to belts by using the simple system that requires little to no maintenance.All of the updates are intended to further ease the transition from chains to belts as Gates seeks to scoop up even more market share across the bicycle and e-bike industry.As chief marketing officer Tom Pitstick explained:For many years we have been focused on converting chains to belt drives across a wide variety of applications, based on the many advantages that belt drives offer. Nowhere is this happening as quickly as in our mobility end-markets, given strong market drivers for alternative commuting and recreation options. Bicycle – especially e-bike – demand is rising rapidly across the globe, and our latest innovations extend our coverage to an even wider range of applications. By adding all-new and significantly upgraded products to our Carbon Drive product lines, we’re enabling manufacturers to continue advancing the state-of-the-art and empower cyclists of all kinds with clean, quiet, long-lasting belt drives.",ebikes
2022/05/24,"When Harley-Davidson spun off its electric bicycle division into Serial 1 and then released several models of urban e-bikes bearing the “/CTY” suffix, the company was dropping a fairly heavy hint that non-city electric bikes would soon follow. Now Serial 1 has made good on that heavy foreshadowing, unveiling the brand’s first electric mountain bike known as the BASH/MTN.The Serial 1 BASH/MTN is built on a similar frame to the existing MOSH/CTY, which makes sense since that model is often referred to as an “urban playbike.”It may be a rigid, single-speed bike, but it’s been seen riding stairs, dropping in on skate parks and basically performing all sorts of crazy stunts you’d never expect to see a simple commuter e-bike tackle.Now the company is taking it one step further by turning it into an even more ruggedized electric mountain bike, with a bit of a throwback to the early days of mountain biking before suspension entered the mix.That should be an advantage for riders, as Serial 1’s brand director Aaron Franks explained:Less is more. That’s the promise of BASH/MTN. No fussy suspension to tune, no finicky drivetrain to adjust—just two wheels, one gear, and one purpose, to provide the most direct connection between you and the trail. The less you worry about managing and maintaining technology, the more you can focus on enjoying every ride.The bike isn’t entirely without suspension, thanks to the inclusion of a suspension seat post. But considering the type of air they’ve shown the bike getting and the type of hardcore riding it’s been put up against, it seems the lack of traditional frame suspension or gears hasn’t held the BASH/MTN back from… well, anything.The 48.8 lb. (22.1 kg) BASH/MTN may feature a similar frame as the MOSH/CTY, but it also packs in some dedicated parts designed to help it tackle new stomping grounds. That includes high-traction Michelin E-Wild knobby tires and high-power quad-piston TRP hydraulic disc brakes. The bike retains the same important drivetrain components though, including the maintenance-free Gates Carbon Drive belt, the mid-mounted Brose S Mag motor that makes 90Nm of torque, and Serial 1’s in-house developed 529Wh lithium-ion battery. The company’s custom high-power integrated lighting is also present, helping riders light up the trail before them.The BASH/MTN is the second offering from Serial 1’s “Select Series,” which is a limited-edition run of special production e-bikes. The first model in that line was an elegant reproduction of Serial 1’s first concept bike, a model that nearly broke the internet when it was first unveiled. That white-tired vintage-inspired e-bike sold out nearly instantly.Now Serial 1 is certainly hoping for a repeat performance with this second new model in the Select Series.As part of this new limited series production, only 1,050 BASH/MTN e-bikes will be produced. Half will be sold in the US and the other half will head across the pond to Europe.A new colorway of Yucca Tan paint with Gloss Graffiti graphics will be included on the BASH/MTN, marking the second time in less than two weeks Serial 1 has opted for bold new colors after several years of offering the same largely black and white colorscheme.Just last week Serial 1 rolled out the second generation of its city-oriented e-bikes, showing off a new blue colorway and Google Cloud integration used to develop a more capable smartphone app to make better use of the e-bike’s techie features. That new app will also be compatible with the just-unveiled BASH/MTN e-bike.Those who want to get their own BASH/MTN may want to hurry, considering the limited-production nature of the bike. Priced at $3,999, it’s a premium bike but likely worth the price considering Serial 1’s extremely dedicated precision engineering and host of nice parts, not to mention the support and service of a local US-based company.What do you think of Serial 1’s new BASH/MTN e-bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/05/23,"Schwinn’s electric bicycle line has significantly expanded over the last couple years. When I first started riding electric Schwinns, I was largely limited to cruiser e-bikes. But with several new commuter-specific e-bikes like the Schwinn Coston CE that I recently tested, this household bicycle name is making a big move on the wider e-bike market.The Schwinn Coston CE falls in the middle of its e-bike model line, offering a slight upgrade over the Schwinn Marshall but without some of the features found on the higher-end Coston DC.It’s basically the Goldilocks option, offering enough performance and functionality for everyday commuters without pushing the price too high.It may not compete head to head with many of the direct-to-consumer companies, but it represents a big jump for Schwinn’s e-bike line and may just fit the right commuter looking for an e-bike with these features.Speaking of which, check out my video below to see the bike’s performance and features in action, including those cool frame lights. Motor: 250W rear geared hub motorTop speed: 32 km/h (20 mph)Range: Up to 56 km (35 mi)Battery: 36V 8Ah (288 Wh)Weight: 25 kg (56 lb.) with batteryFrame: AluminumTires: 27.5 x 2.6-inchBrakes: Mechanical disc brakesExtras: Pedal assist and throttle riding options, LED head light, tail light and battery side lights, Microshift 7-speed transmission, front suspension fork, included fenders, two frame sizes availablePrice: Currently $1,799The Schwinn Coston CE is very much a commuter electric bike, but it’s not one of those thin-wheeled messenger e-bikes.With 2.6″ tires, you’ve got a lot of air and rubber under you to tackle more than just well-manicured bicycle lanes. Hitting curbs or potholes will be smoother than most pure commuter bikes, especially considering the inclusion of the front suspension fork and suspension seat post.And with a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) combined with both throttle and pedal assist functionality, this Class 2 e-bike will help you fly around the city quickly and effortlessly (if you rely on the throttle).As a commuter e-bike, I’m also glad to see some good commuter specific parts, like the included fenders and the excellent lighting. Not only do you get typical head and taillights, but you also have LED frame lights built into the sides of the battery. That adds a nice nighttime glow to the bike to give you better side visibility – an area where most bikes are lacking.It looks just odd enough for drivers to take a second look in a “what the heck is that thing?” kind of way. A second look is invaluable as a rider, where we’d often even be grateful for a first look from drivers.A 7-speed transmission from Microshift also adds to the commuter street-cred, giving those in hilly areas the ability to run through the gears on hills.That being said, the small-ish 250W motor isn’t going to be a powerhouse on hills. The bike accelerates fine on flat ground, but you’ll definitely need to add some leg assist if you’re going to be climbing tall hills.The low power motor is matched by a low capacity battery. With just 288 Wh of capacity, the battery surprised me, and not in a good way. Sure, I’ve seen plenty of e-bikes with 288 Wh batteries before. It’s just that they’re usually on smaller, lightweight e-bikes that push the needle considerably less on the scale.So to offer a full-size electric bike with otherwise nice commuter features yet with such a small battery is a bit surprising.I’m sure that keeping it in low pedal assist will still net riders the claimed maximum of 35 miles that Schwinn promises. But I didn’t do that. I’m not about to pedal around in the lightest pedal assist setting all day, especially since this isn’t a high power e-bike to begin with. So if you’re using liberal throttle, keep in mind that you’re going to wind up with limited range.The bike itself feels well built. Nothing feels cheap, plastic-y, or vulnerable to quick failure. It all seems like a robust and well-built electric bike. You also get two different frame sizes to choose from, which is a big upgrade over the single one-size-fits-all frames that many e-bike companies still offer.And perhaps the robust built and frame size options are why Schwinn is charging so much for it. At a MSRP of $1,799 on Schwinn’s site or the same price on Amazon, it feels a bit rich for my blood when considering the pure specs. At that price, there’s a huge argument for saving a hundred bucks on something like the Ride1Up 700 Series, while simultaneously getting triple the power and battery capacity, hydraulic brakes and other nice parts.So I can’t say that the Schwinn wins on value here. But that doesn’t mean the bike doesn’t have a place. The features like the neat integrated lighting are rarely seen in the industry and are a definite win. And the build quality feels like it should stand the test of time.I just wish the bike was several hundred bucks cheaper so I could tell you that this was a deal. Because at this price, it’s not the deal I had hoped for.",ebikes
2022/05/20,"Spoiler alert: Electric vehicles are the future, and they’re destined to replace fossil fuel-powered cars. Unless you’ve got your head firmly buried in the sand, that won’t come as a shocker to you. But credit where credit is due. We humans, we’re a pretty ingenious animal. We figured out how to build massive societies fueled in large part by poking holes in the ground and then burning the super-pressurized pre-historic algae we found. That was a neat trick, until we realized that it had the small downside of destroying the world we’re leaving for our kids. Whoops.Now we’re in the process of righting that wrong. Some are embracing the change wholeheartedly, and others are being dragged into the future, kicking and screaming. But make no mistake, it’s the future and it’s coming.But here’s the other little thing: While electric cars are undoubtedly the future and will represent the single largest shift in the private transportation sector as we move away from fossil fuel-powered cars, they aren’t the only solution. But they sure are being touted like they are, since a few people make a lot of money when you buy an electric car. However, there are other alternatives to shift your transportation toward an electrified future and away from fossil fuels, even without owning an electric car. That’s exactly what I did.Everyday I move around my city by electric vehicle. In fact, I own several electric vehicles. They just aren’t electric cars. They are a wide range of smaller personal electric vehicles.Electric bicycles. Electric motorcycles. Electric mopeds. Electric scooters. Electric skateboards. I own them all and I use them all the time for my own personal transportation. Each one cost me a mere fraction of a Tesla or whatever fancy electric car you’re hearing about today. And each one of them gets me around the city faster, using less energy, for less money, and with a bigger smile on my face when I arrive. Well, except for the electric skateboard on that last note – that one is equal parts fun and terrifying depending on which roads I’m skating on. So maybe that one is part smiles, part slow-motion horror grimace. I listed electric bicycles first because e-bikes make up the single largest portion of my urban trips.If there was ever a veritable miracle pill that could solve the biggest problems of urban transportation, this is it. The humble electric bike is the answer.Don’t like being stuck traffic? Ride an e-bike.Cars are too expensive? Ride an e-bike.There’s never any parking? Ride an e-bike.No time in your busy schedule for some light exercise or physical activity? Ride an e-bike.Electric bicycles are the wonder drug to solve the biggest annoyances of getting around a city. I will never not be able to smile at being able to take the bike lane and fly past some poor shmuck in a BMW swearing as he’s stuck in gridlock traffic. Sure, e-bikes were all once pretty expensive. But those days are gone. Prices on good-yet-affordable electric bikes are constantly improving. One of my favorite e-bikes for city commuting goes 25 mph and costs barely $1K. For the cost of one Tesla, you could give an entire apartment building full of people their own personal electric vehicle.But even more than the cost savings and convenience of e-bikes, they also solve the long-term problems that we don’t like to talk about. While finding easy and free parking or using a cheat code to slip past morning rush-hour traffic are the flashy benefits of electric bicycles, other big wins like not leaving your grandkids with a fiery hellscape of a planet are pretty cool perks, too. As I mentioned, I use all sorts of personal electric vehicles to commute around my city. When I need to travel at higher speeds, I hop on my electric motorcycle or electric moped. For utility, I can’t beat my NIU NQi GT Extended Range. It hits nearly 50 mph (80 km/h), has a cargo box on back plus more space at my feet to carry bigger things, and gets a range of around 60 miles (100 km) on a charge. All for a tiny fraction of the cost of an electric car. Oh yeah, and I love the way my wife hugs me tight when she rides on back. As much as I love my electric bikes, my NIU is one of my favorite personal EVs. It may sound silly, but it’s the minivan of electric two-wheelers. Check it out in my ride video below.For shorter trips when an electric moped or e-bike is more vehicle than I need (and I don’t want to lock up an e-bike outside), I’ll ride a smaller folding electric scooter or electric skateboard. Both can usually be brought inside many businesses or offices without anyone batting an eye.I’ve even experimented with electric unicycles, which are actually incredibly convenient as an entire commuter vehicle that has the size and portability of a briefcase.But by and large, e-bikes are my favorite form of electric vehicle. And since it also just happens to be National Bike to Work Day (look how well that worked out, almost like it was planned…), perhaps it’s a good time to think about how an e-bike might work for you, too.As Bird’s VP of consumer products Dan Dumansau explained via email to Electrek, “We believe National Bike to Work Day should be every day! Each short car trip replaced with an eco-friendly bike contributes to cleaner air and safer streets for communities.” I couldn’t agree more with Dan. I’ll be hopping on his Bird V-Frame electric bike soon for a review, but in the meantime I’ve reviewed hundreds of electric bicycles and pretty much everyone one of them could make an awesome alternative to a car for commuting around a city (though some might be a tad bit overkill for that task).Ultimately, we’re all collectively staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe. We just are. And changing our transportation habits is one of several ways we can make a meaningful contribution to not completely destroying the habitability of our planet. But while electric cars are often touted as the flashy solution, sometimes no cars is an even better solution. Instead, smaller personal electric vehicles (or even non-electric pedal vehicles for those that have the physical fitness for them) are the better solution for cities around the world.There are many other helpful solutions too that shouldn’t be overlooked. Improving public transportation systems to reduce car dependency would be another huge step in the right direction.Even non-transportation areas should be scrutinized. Taking a harder look at how and where we produce our food and the effect it has on climate change would make another giant impact. Personally, I just marked one year from switching to a largely plant-based diet (I cheat with ice cream), and I’m proud to say that I’ve even avoided the common pitfall of smugly telling the world about it. Oh wait, dammit.The point is, there are a lot of steps we can all take, some small and some large, that can help move us toward a future with a massive reduction in human impact on climate change. But the flashy “switch to an electric car” commercials aren’t providing the panacea that many hope. Change starts small and it starts locally. And when it comes to reducing the impact of our transportation needs, small and local are essentially synonymous with personal electric vehicles. They go together like sandal hikers and granola. And whether it’s throwing your leg over an economical electric bicycle or strapping on that sexy motorcycle helmet and jacket to commute to work on an EV that takes up just 20% the space of an electric pickup truck (and that costs just 10% of the bill to charge), there are so many fun and efficient alternatives out there that they tend to sell themselves.Speaking of which, now we just need more state incentives to make them even more affordable. Though with awesome electric bicycles available at literally every price level, there’s probably something out there for you already.",ebikes
2022/05/19,"Heybike, makers of eBikes small and large, has set a new standard for a feature rich electric folding bike. With so many ways to enjoy electric bikes, the Ranger model can make short work of any commute, off-road short-cut or an otherwise hum-drum day. In the past we took a look at the Heybike Mars, another folding bike, but with a different direction. The Mars is more on the affordable end, an electric bike that removes the pricing excuse for new riders. For the extra money, the Ranger is definitely worth another look, as you get a load of upgrades, added in the appendix below.With bicycles it’s hard to find a balance between several key uses, but the Ranger manages to hit the sweet spot in several categories. The Ranger does decent work in adventure, business, utility, and comfort. In a great middle ground, none of these uses are in total conflict, and the bike can blend seamlessly in between.Most everything on the Ranger is made with comfort in mind. There’s so many comfort points on this bike that we have to dive: Comfort grips, relaxed riding position, fat tires, comfort saddle, suspension fork, and a suspension seatpost. All of these parts com together without any extra work from the rider. In a passive sense, they all work to keep the rider on the bike longer, taking advantage of the large battery capacity.The Heybike Ranger has a max range of 48 miles on a single charge. With that kind of range, one could easily make it around town, maybe even downtown and back, with more charge left for the spontaneous trip. If long trips aren’t ion the cars, the throttle can be used to blast into the horizon at the top legal speed for an electric bike.The Ranger has a surprising payload of 330lbs, which means that the sturdy rear cargo rack can really earn its keep. Keeping dry with the full fenders is a breeze, and the front and rear integrated lights keep visibility high. The 500w motor can make short work of hills, and the included brake lights can safely descend the hill as well.While gliding downhill, the Ranger includes 180mm mechanical disc brakes, with a motor cut-off signal built into the levers. This device will automatically cut off power to the motor, making stops much more predictable, and protected against unwanted acceleration.  Propelling the bike is a 7-speed Shimano gearset, with a Toruney Derailer and rust resistant chain.After all of these specs and uses, it’s hard to believe the bike can still fold. Buckling the frame in half, telescoping the stem, pinching the pedals and collapsing the handlebars get the Ranger into a smaller cube shape that can easily fit into a variety of spaces. Packed up and ready for most any adventure, the Heybike Ranger is ready to rock.For $1,399 there is a lot of value packing into this small folding bike. My personal favorite part about the bike is the mag wheels which never need truing and can hold a great deal of total payload. This makes the bike very sturdy all around, and put the wight low for a very fun riding experience. Other bikes, like the Heybike Explore offer a more mission specific direction, but for a versatile platform where you make the rules, the Ranger is a great option.Check out the Heybike website to shop for your very own Heybike Ranger.

2022/05/18,"The descriptors “nimble” and “fat tire” rarely go together as well as they do with the Juiced RipRacer. This self-proclaimed fun-sized electric bike deftly combines the exhilaration of go-anywhere electric bikes with the convenience of small-format micromobility vehicles.In doing so, it makes the RipRacer just as much of a utilitarian e-bike as it is a fun-loving adventure-riding runabout.It may look small – and it kind of is – but the RipRacer still packs in everything we’ve come to know and love from California-based Juiced Bikes. That means big batteries, big motors, quality e-bike components, and a general disregard for plain old boring e-bike design.The bike also marks the first introduction of Juiced’s fancy-pants new second-generation electric bike batteries that come with added features, such as a carry handle and a hidden spot for an AirTag tracking device.Take a look below to see my video review of the Class 3 version of the RipRacer, and then read on for my complete thoughts on this awesome new electric bike model.The Juiced RipRacer is something of an enigma for an e-bike.Fat tire e-bikes are generally bigger machines designed for trails and other off-the-beaten-path riding situations.But the RipRacer is actually fairly small and light. At 66 lb (30 kg), it’s not a lightweight e-bike, but it’s decently svelte compared to most fat tire e-bikes that pack on a few dozen more pounds.Juiced Bikes says it “comfortably fits” riders from 5’0″ to 6’3″ (152 to 191 cm). I’m 5’7″ (170 cm) and fall right in the middle of that range. For me, the bike feels great.And thanks to its smaller size, it easily fits in more places. It takes up less room in your garage, is easier to slide in the back of a truck or SUV, can wiggle itself into an elevator, and is nimble enough to weave through city traffic. The wheelbase is a mere 40.3″ (102 cm), meaning the bike turns on a dime (which, while we’re doing conversions, is 9.6 euro cents).It’s not that we haven’t seen smaller fat tire e-bikes before. It’s just that Juiced’s is better. And a big part of that has to do with Juiced’s tech.For starters, you get that highly detailed LED matrix display, or at least you get it if you opt for the $1,599 Class 3 version of the e-bike. If you get the lower-priced $1,399 Class 2 version, that bike comes with a more simplified display. Considering the Class 3 version can be unlocked to go 28 mph (45 km/h) compared to the Class 2 version’s limited 20 mph (32 km/h) speed, I highly recommend getting the Class 3 version for the extra speed and fun.There’s also that awesome new battery. It’s a large capacity 52V 15.6Ah pack with a whopping 800 Wh of capacity (though it’s a smaller 540 Wh pack on the Class 2 version of the RipRacer). The big battery offers tons of range, up to 55 miles (88 km). But more importantly, it also offers new features, such as the ability to hide an Apple AirTag for tracking the battery and/or bike if it should, unfortunately, get stolen. Juiced is also planning on offering a charging dock and base station that turns your e-bike into a power station to run 110V AC devices and smaller USB devices, so this second-generation battery pack has some serious potential outside of just powering your e-bike.Then there’s the bright LED lighting. Instead of going with cheap and dinky lights, Juiced Bikes outfitted the RipRacer with some high-quality and ultra-bright LEDs. The headlight puts out 1,050 lumens, for crying out loud! That’s enough to light up the road, not just shine into the eyes of some car drivers in a feeble hope that they notice you.At the same time, there are a few compromises here that help lower the cost and production complexity. The front fork looks like a suspension fork, but that’s just a clever design. It’s actually a rigid fork, meaning there’s no suspension on the bike other than what you get from the 4″ of air and rubber between your rims and the ground.Next, the bike is a single-speed. I hope you weren’t looking for a derailleur because that ain’t it. There’s a tensioner on the back, but it doesn’t shift gears. Instead, it just keeps your chain from flopping around and also makes it easier to remove the wheel to change a flat tire.The bike also doesn’t include any fenders or racks as standard equipment. You can add front and rear racks/baskets, plus fenders and other accessories, but they’ll cost you extra.Even so, there’s a ton to appreciate here with the RipRacer. It’s a powerful e-bike with well over 1,000W of peak power. It has a big ol’ battery with some awesome new features. Those hydraulic disc brakes are strong and grippy. And the geometry makes it just as much fun for hopping curbs as tearing up trails.It’s the epitome of a go-anywhere e-bike, as long as you don’t mind the lack of suspension. But considering the small size and increased convenience, I’m quite happy with the RipRacer’s current package. The big tires are enough suspension for me, and the bike is so much fun that the term “fun-sized” feels even more appropriate than ever.This is absolutely an e-bike to check out if you’re looking for high performance in a small package and want to get some pretty good quality components to boot!",ebikes
2022/05/17,"Ukrainian electric motorbike company Delfast has seen its electric bikes used for some vastly diverse tasks, such as breaking Guinness World Records and outfitting Mexican police. But their latest use is perhaps the bikes’ most important mission yet: helping Ukrainian soldiers strike a David vs. Goliath blow against Russia’s barbaric invasion of their country.The image below shows one of many Delfast electric bikes that have been supplied to Ukrainian armed forces, who are currently using them to defend their country from the over two-month-long Russian onslaught.Get your own Delfast Bike hereThe electric bikes, which have functional pedals allowing them push their range to over 200 miles (320 km), have enough speed and power to border on electric dirt bike territory. A hand throttle means that riders can use the pedals as foot rests when necessary, focusing instead on maintaining speed and navigating tricky terrain.When pushed hard, the bikes can reach speeds as high as 50 mph (80 km/h). Their long travel suspension and ability to carry heavy loads has made them particularly useful for navigating forested trails or overlanding when trails are nonexistent.The bikes used by Ukrainian defenders have been modified to carried NLAW rockets, or Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapons, which are specially designed to allow a single operator to destroy an enemy tank.The rockets are designed to be human-portable and carried by infantry, but the 28 lb. (12.5 kg) weapon is much easier to haul over long distances when carried on the back of an electric bike.Such portable anti-tank weapons are a game-changer in Ukraine’s fight to defend its sovereign territory from a Russian takeover, but their use isn’t without significant risk.Real life isn’t like Counterstrike, and this isn’t a video game. Getting into position in an open area to fire an NLAW or the similar US Javelin missile is incredibly risky, often exposing the operator to the enemy tank’s main cannon or multiple heavy machine guns. The use of a high-power electric bike to quickly and quietly reach a firing position can significantly reduce the soldier’s exposure and improve the mission success outlook.In fact, Ukrainian forces are already employing multiple types of light electric two-wheelers in creative capacities to help repel invading Russian forces.Another local Ukrainian company, ELEEK, has also supplied its country’s armed forces with silent, powerful electric motorbikes for use on the battlefield.In that case, the electric motorbikes were requested for use by sniper teams. They offer similar advantages to these NLAW-carrying electric bikes in that they help Ukrainian operators quietly reach a firing position in less time than rucking in on foot. One of the bikes can be seen below, demonstrating its quick and lightweight riding style.Electric motorcycles and e-bikes are rapidly becoming a common tool employed by militaries around the world.As far back as 2018, we learned that Norway’s armed forces began testing fat tire electric bicycles in border guard patrols.Patrol roles were also performed by the New Zealand Defence Forces in 2020 when they began testing UBCO’s electric utility bikes.Australian soldiers have been documenting stealth electric bikes since last year, and we also saw the first application of helicopter-mounted electric motorcycles last year in an application designed for quick insertion of special operators on low-signature electric dirt bikes.Multiple special forces units in Europe and the Middle East have also tested high-power electric mountain bikes for field use, with paratroopers even air-dropping electric dirt bikes onto the battlefield.",ebikes
2022/05/17,"It’s been over two years since Harley-Davidson spun off Serial 1 as its quasi-independent electric bicycle company. The first generation bikes were met with nearly universal acclaim for their sleek design and high-quality manufacturing. Now the company is back to announce its second generation e-bikes, this time touting a new partnership with Google Cloud.In fact, it appears that the Google Cloud features may be the single largest update in the second generation Serial 1 MOSH/CTY and RUSH/CTY e-bikes.Between that and a USB-C cable, I can’t really find much else new here.With the help of Google Cloud, Serial 1 has rolled out an all-new app for its second generation electric bikes. The company says that it is “among the first to integrate Google Cloud’s new Intelligent Product Essentials software solution that enables predictive, proactive, and intelligent features that drive a better eBicycle experience for every rider.”So just what are those features? It turns out that it’s more than just an e-bike with Google Docs downloaded on it.The new bells and whistles largely consist of “app-controlled security features,” Google Maps navigation, and real-time ride data gathered directly from the e-bike to be displayed on a dashboard screen.The company also touts the app’s connection to the bike while simultaneously taking a dig at other e-bike apps. Serial 1 explained that “most e-bike apps communicate solely via Bluetooth wireless technology, which means critical features only function when in proximity to another Bluetooth-enabled device. Serial 1’s next-generation /CTY platform takes connectivity beyond Bluetooth technology by incorporating a sophisticated Internet of Things (IoT) device that enables connection via not only Bluetooth wireless technology but also using cellular data and/or GPS, to ensure that you can reliably access your bike even when it’s not within sight of you or anyone else.”Riders will also be able to use the connectivity feature to pinpoint their e-bike on a map, should it ever get stolen. Push notifications will update the rider if the bike is jostled while locked up.The app functions as a dashboard as well, offering riders critical information like speed, ride duration, distance, range, EV and rider power output, efficiency, and battery charge percentage.As far as hardware goes, unless Serial 1’s press team is holding out on us, the only physical change to the bike is that a USB-C cable is included under the handlebar stem to charge your phone or other device while riding. Oh, and that a blue colorway is now an option.The rest of the hardware is expected to be the same, include a Brose mid-drive motor, Gates carbon belt drive and an automatic shifting CVT. All the models hit 20 mph (32 km/h) except for the US-available RUSH/CTY SPEED that can hit class 3 speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h).The bikes themselves are still as impressive as ever (and if USB-C cables are your thing, then they’re arguably even more impressive), but you shouldn’t expect this second generation model to be very different from the originals.Priced at between $3,799 to $4,999, the new models are still the cheapest new Harley money can buy. Well, almost.What do you think of Serial 1’s second generation electric bikes? Could you see yourself cruising the neighborhood on a silent electric two-wheeler powered by the Harley-Davidson?

2022/05/17,"It was an inevitability that once electric bikes started skyrocketing in popularity, more e-bike thefts would soon follow. But NYC-based electric bike company Wing Bikes is helping riders fight back with a free location tracker included along with its electric bikes.The location tracker is part of a bundle that Wing Bikes is currently offering, including a $300 discount on its bikes plus another $200+ in free accessories such as that location tracker.Just use the code 1WING on the site to grab it, though it seems like you’ll likely have to install the location tracker yourself.Wing Bike’s founder Seth Miller didn’t want us to disclose the exact location of the tracker, for obvious reasons, but told me a bit more about how it works. It uses a special compartment hidden on the bike and also employs security bolts that would make it harder for a thief to get into without having a special set of security tools.The device relies on the Apple Find My network and helps hide an AirTag that can be used to locate (and then hopefully recover) a stolen e-bike.But to prevent it from getting to that point, the kit also includes a warning sticker to thieves letting them know the bike is trackable. Hopefully, that’s enough of a deterrent to get the thief to pick another target… or better yet, reevaluate their decisions.The location tracking kit is the last line of defense, and all of Wing Bike’s e-bikes come with a first line of defense comprised of a loud vibration alarm. It can be activated via a key fob that comes with the e-bike and will sound a loud alarm if the bike is moved. It remains to be determined whether or not that will scare the pants off the poor schmuck that was just trying to lock their bike next to yours. Wing Bikes of course isn’t the first company to include alarms on their e-bikes. We saw a great example of a loud e-bike alarm when we toured Electric Bike Company’s California factory, and Juiced Bikes also offers alarm options as well as an e-bike battery that can fit an Apple AirTag for location tracking.But Wing Bikes is one of the few that has outfitted all of the bikes across its line with the ability to support both the loud alarm and AirTag tracking feature.We’ve tested Wing Bike’s rides in the past, though it’s been a few years and we haven’t quite made it onto their newest generation of electric bikes yet.For those that already have an electric bike, the next best thing to a location tracker built into the bike is a good lock or two.I’ve tested several locks in the past, but the name of the game is to lock early and often. Multiple locks of multiple styles make your e-bike less interesting to thieves as the chance of defeating multiple locks goes down. It would take an ambitious thief to attempt to bypass multiple locks in a crowded place, especially when other more vulnerable options are parked close by.Another good tip is to register your new e-bike after purchase. Bike Index has been used to track and recover millions of dollars worth of bikes, such as a recent dramatic accidental sting operation to get back a RadRunner Plus. Stay vigilant out there everyone and make sure that your expensive e-bike remains yours!",ebikes
2022/05/16,"May is National Bike Month in the United States. With a combination of more cities focusing on walkability/bikeability as well as an increasingly alarming outlook on climate change, a larger discussion on switching to smaller vehicles couldn’t come soon enough. But for those who never considered switching to a bicycle before, it may be time to take a second look. And that’s because with the invention and subsequent skyrocketing in popularity of electric bikes, switching from an expensive and polluting car to a cheap and efficient two-wheeled alternative is easier than ever. In fact, I go nearly everywhere by electric bike and I barely even touch pedal bikes anymore. Here’s why.Pedal bikes, or “acoustic bikes” as we often quip in the electric bike world, are incredible. I think they’re one of the most important transportation inventions of all time, perhaps only after the wheel itself.If you came here for an opinion bashing pedal bikes, then you’re in the wrong place. This is not an attack on pedal bikes, and I think that anyone who can ride one, should ride one. They’re fun, enjoyable, healthy, and accessible. If 10% of commuters switched to pedal bikes today, we’d be in an immensely better world.But here’s the thing. Not everyone can or even desires to ride a pedal bike. In fact, I find that I get all of those same benefits, plus many more, from my electric bikes. And the one big downside to pedal bikes, which is pretty much the main reason I don’t ride them, is that they just require so much physical exertion for me to use them for anything other than fitness purposes.For example, let’s talk about utility riding, where speed and convenience are often the name of the game.For me, the most common use for cycling is transportation. I’m at point A, and I need to arrive at point B soon. A bike is a tool to get me there. And since I live in a city, it’s a tool to get me there much, much faster than a traffic-afflicted car.By making use of bike lanes and the inefficient space left between cars, I can wiggle my way through the worst traffic jams. And I can do it even faster on an e-bike – usually up to around 40 km/h (25 mph) while cars crawl along much slower in traffic. In the US where electric bike laws are laxer, speeds of 45 km/h (28 mph) are possible on loads of e-bikes available to commuters.But when I’m heading out to join a group of friends, going to a meeting, or just embarking on any other daily transportation need, I don’t want to be sweating profusely when I get there. And on a pedal bike, that would be a given. But with my e-bikes, I can do the same route (usually in less time) and decide how much exertion I’m prepared for. On my pedal assist e-bikes (that lack hand throttles), I can dial the electric motor’s assist level up or down depending on how hard I want to work. On my e-bikes that do have throttles, I can ride them like a motorcycle and treat the pedals like foot rests. The wind in my face is the best air conditioning I can ask for, and I arrive wherever I’m going in less time and with a bigger smile than if I had been in a car or on a pedal bike. Oh yeah, and I’m dry (or just a little bit sweaty if I felt like pedaling a bit, but not drenched in sweat like I would be on a non-electric bike).And I know that many pedal cyclists can easily hit the same 25 mph speeds or more. I sometimes get passed by road bikers on their morning fitness rides. So I’m not claiming that e-bikes are always faster than pedal bikes. But I’m not super interested in shaving my legs, squeezing into a leotard, hopping onto a $5K carbon road bike, and pedaling like crazy while I chug from the several water bottles I have holstered on my back. That’s not why I ride. I ride to get somewhere in my city more quickly and easily than I could in a car.The fact that electric bikes don’t require as much exertion also means they are great for utility jobs like riding home with a week’s worth of groceries in front and rear baskets. That’d be a slog if you had to pedal a few dozen pounds of extra gear around, but the electric motor makes it both easy and fun! Same goes for carrying passengers on an e-bike. That’s a recipe for a disastrously slow and painful ride on many pedal bikes, especially if your passenger is a full-size adult or multiple kids on the way home from school. But e-bikes make it easy to carry both kids and adults on the bike with you, whether you’re pedaling or making liberal use of a throttle.And these days, it’s becoming easier than ever to find a good electric bike. I started riding e-bikes well over a decade ago. At the time, there were five electric bikes in my city of 500,000 people, and I owned three of them. E-bikes were an enigma. Oh yeah, and I had to build them myself since e-bikes were nearly unobtainable from retail companies. But those were the old times. Today there are literally hundreds of e-bike companies each with several interesting models. There are e-bikes for all budgets ranging from several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. It’s never been easier to find a good e-bike to fit a specific rider’s needs in that specific rider’s budget.Fitness is the biggest argument I hear from the pedal bike community regarding why “e-bikes are bad, mmkay?”The saying goes that if you want to exercise, get a pedal bike, and if you want to be lazy, get an e-bike. But here’s the thing: That’s so wrong it’s nearly comical. Study after study after study after study has documented the fitness benefits of riding an electric bike (when actually using pedal assist instead of a throttle).In fact, some studies that tracked long term e-bike ownership and usage have actually found that e-bike owners got even more exercise each week than pedal bike owners. The reason often relates to the fact that e-bikes can be more enjoyable due to the motor “taking the edge off” of the worst hills and lowering the extreme exertion during some points of rides, which results in many riders either staying out longer to ride farther, or riding more often during the week. The end result is they get more exercise than they would on a non-electric bike.In addition to all of these documented studies, I can offer you a bit of my own anecdotal evidence. I’m fortunate enough to live right on the coast and I try to start each morning by walking my dog on the beach. My fitness tracker tells me that when I’m walking in deep sand, my heart rate increases from my resting HR of around 48 to somewhere around 105-115. For reference, running brings me higher to around 150 bpm. In other words, sand walking is a moderately exerting activity, and certainly more than a walk on nice smooth pavement, which puts me in the 90 bpm ballpark. When I go on leisurely e-bike fitness rides with modest pedal assist, my HR again lands in that same 105-110 bpm range. So essentially, when I ride my e-bike for an hour, I’m getting the exercise equivalent of an hour-long walk on the beach. That’s a pretty nice exercise benefit in addition to the fun and thrill that a ride offers. Plus, if I was knocking out two birds with one stone by getting my exercise as at the same time that I’m already commuting or running errands, even better!And the idea that electric bike riders “are simply lazy” couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m pretty active in the e-bike industry and have gone about as deep down this rabbit hole as anyone can. By and large, I find that electric bike riders that I meet are fitter than the average person in their country. I don’t know if that’s a chicken and egg situation or not, but the two simply seem to go together. In my case, I don’t even ride my e-bikes for fitness as much as I do for transportation. I run three to five miles a day to be healthy, and I usually ride my e-bikes fast on throttle to get where I’m going, saving pedal assist for when I actually want some fitness riding. But if you’re the kind of person that can find yourself on two-wheels, electric or pedaling, then you’re probably going to be the kind of person who is either generally aware of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle or you’re about to be pleasantly surprised that you accidentally started getting healthier after you switched from a car to an e-bike. Either way, you’re going to be in a good place.Cost is seemingly the one area where pedal bikes seem to win out. There’s no beating around the bush here. An entry-level pedal bike costs significantly less than an entry-level electric bike.Look no further than Wal-Mart for a perfect example. You can walk out of that store with a cheap cruiser bike for $184. But an electric version of that same bike will set you back $698. That’s an extra $500 to toss on some electric assist. I generally don’t recommend going with a Wal-Mart bike for a number of reasons, but the economics in that example are pretty clear.Here’s the thing though: There’s more to the story. An entry-level pedal bike is going to basically be a piece of junk. The brakes are junk. The shifters are junk. The cables will rust nearly instantly. The wheels often aren’t even true when you spin them. But on even entry-level electric bikes, the stakes are higher so the parts are usually better. You’ll start out with better brakes, tires, etc. It’s not altruistic. It’s just that their lawyers know you’ll be going faster and riding more, and so putting better parts on is cheaper for the manufacturer than paying lofty settlements later (or for a bit less dark reason, perhaps using better parts also protects against plunging brand reputation when those cheaper parts would degrade more quickly on a higher mileage electric bike).Whatever the reason, e-bikes will generally be built better and use more robust parts, when compared to the same entry-level or mid-level models in the pedal bike world. They’ll still be more expensive, but you get more and are likely to use it more. And if you’re moving from a car to an e-bike, the cost savings will start to stack up immediately. Consider the instant savings of buying less gas, getting free parking, spending less on wear and tear from your car’s maintenance bill, etc.While e-bikes are admittedly more expensive than pedal bikes, there are still plenty of good e-bikes in the three-digit ballpark, so don’t think that you have to spend thousands of dollars to get a decent electric two-wheeler. Spending more of course helps you climb the quality ladder and get more features, but it’s not a requirement for a decent ride.This probably sounds like a competition, but I’m not trying to pit pedal bikes against electric bikes.It’s not that one is inherently better. However, one is definitely better for me. And that’s the key takeaway here. Each person is different, and each person has to make this calculus individually. But the fact that most people aren’t riding bikes now is largely because most people just aren’t interested in pedaling to go everywhere. (And it’s also because cycling infrastructure sucks, but we’re slowly working on that.)Since the main impediment to cycling is having to cycle one’s legs, electric bikes simply make good sense. They offer all of the benefits of pedal bikes, including the fitness (if desired), and yet are even more fun to ride while offering improved utility, to boot! If you can ride a pedal bike every day, then that’s awesome. But if you can’t or won’t, then consider an e-bike to be the equivalent of swimming with flippers on. You’re still swimming – it’s just easier, faster, and more fun.So if you’ve previously thought that a bike sounds nice but isn’t practical for you, it might just be time to think again.",ebikes
2022/05/14,"Electric cargo bikes, especially four-wheeled versions that function as mini delivery vans, are becoming an increasingly common solution for mail delivery around the world. As USPS struggles with its own delivery van ordering scandal, the latest example of alternative lightweight and efficient electric four-wheeler delivery vehicles saw yet another European country demonstrating the effectiveness of switching away from gas-powered mail trucks.Omniva, the national mail service in Estonia (and a country with its own vibrant domestic e-bike production) has recently begun expanding its electric cargo bike delivery service.Using four-wheeled electric cargo bikes manufactured by Vok Bikes, Omniva can replace gas-guzzling mail trucks along local routes.The small easy-to-maneuver electric cargo bikes also better facilitate mail delivery in cramped urban areas that remain difficult to access for traditional trucks.Despite the smaller size, each battery for the electric cargo bike can operate for 100 km (62 miles) before needing to return to a depot to swap its battery.With a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) due to European electric bike regulations, these delivery vehicles offer four hours or more of operation. Considering time stopped while performing deliveries, each e-bike could potentially work for an entire shift on a single charge.Omniva’s Head of Logistics and Transport explained that the success of the program after a trial period has convinced the company of the need to expand it:The initial experience of using an electric bike for providing services in a densely populated area is positive, so we decided to introduce the bikes gradually: first, in cities, but later, perhaps also in smaller cities and towns. The advantage of using a bike in densely populated areas with a lot of traffic is the ease and convenience of access to buildings and maneuverability. Our couriers are enthusiastic about using electrical cargo bikes, so there is no shortage of willing users!Such electric cargo bikes are now finding use all over the world as a replacement for larger delivery trucks. While many are used for package delivery, examples like the food delivery e-bike below are increasingly common.UPS is currently trialing 100 Fernhay four-wheeled electric cargo bikes for its deliveries in crowded urban areas, and other delivery companies have also begun using various electric cargo bikes for deliveries as well.The shift away from larger delivery and mail trucks for local routes comes at a time when the United States Postal Service (USPS) is at a crossroads for its next massive vehicle purchasing contract.The USPS initially announced that it would be purchasing up to 165,000 mostly-gas-powered Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDVs) from Oshkosh Defense Corp. The original plan was for 10% of those vehicles to be electric, though the USPS then increased that percentage to 20% for their initial order of 50,000 vehicles. The gas-powered NGDVs will get as low as 8.6 miles per gallon (approximately 27.5L/100km) during operation.However, several lawsuits have recently been filed against the USPS regarding the high percentage of gas-guzzling vehicles in the order.As Electrek’s Jameson Dow recently explained:The lawsuits filed today rehash many of the recent arguments against this decision, primarily focusing on the USPS’ failure to do timely environmental assessments. They argue that not only was the initial environmental assessment undertaken after the contract was announced, but that the assessment was deficient in considering air quality and climate impacts of the plan and did not seriously consider other alternatives to the gas guzzlers the USPS decided on.Per the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed in 1970, federal agencies must publish environmental impact statements (EIS) before any change in policy that is likely to have an environmental impact.But USPS’ environmental assessment has been panned as insufficient not only by all the groups filing lawsuits today, but also the White House and EPA, which sent letters criticizing the plan (which also conflicts with President Biden’s order to convert the entire federal vehicle fleet to electric). Even the USPS watchdog group, the Office of the Inspector General, stated that the agency would benefit from adopting more electric vehicles than their current plan.While many are pushing the USPS to purchase more electric delivery trucks, could part of the solution be to avoid purchasing trucks at all? And as electric cargo bikes become increasingly accessible – especially four-wheeled electric cargo bikes with significant hauling capacity – could these highly efficient electric vehicles be an even better solution than electric trucks and vans?Let’s hear what you think in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/05/13,"The Buzz Charter F, which is the latest e-bike from the value-oriented electric bike brand Buzz, offers up a low-cost $999 folding model with the battery hidden in the seat post.It’s a battery design that we’re starting to see more of, and for good reason. It can come in handy in urban settings where riders will likely want to take both the saddle and the battery inside with them while the bike remains locked outside.Those are the two most commonly stolen parts of an electric bike, so combining them into one easy-to-grab component means riders can head thieves off at the pass.But there’s more than just a clever battery design at work here on the Charter F. Take a gander at my video review below to see what I mean, then keep reading afterward for the rest of my in-depth review.Motor: 250W rear geared hub motorTop speed: 32 km/h (20 mph)Range: Up to 64 km (40 mi) Battery: 36V 8Ah (288 Wh)Weight: 15.8 kg (35 lb) with batteryFrame: AluminumTires: 20 x 1.75-inchBrakes: Mechanical rim brakesExtras: 3 levels of pedal assist, LED dot display, battery built into seat, locking seat post clamp, kickstandPrice: Currently $999The Buzz Charter F’s specialty is being a lightweight, no-frills folding e-bike.At just 35 lb., it’s definitely on the lighter end of the range of e-bikes I’ve tested. Folding bikes are often particularly heavy due to the extra weight of a few rugged folding mechanisms, but the Buzz Charter F manages to keep an eye on its waistline to maintain its trim figure.That makes it ideal for anyone that needs a lightweight folder to lift into a car trunk or carry onto a subway.That being said, the light package comes at a cost: power.The 250W rear hub motor isn’t the peppiest motor I’ve tried before. In fact, it’s on the lower end of the spectrum. This is a pedal-assist electric bike – no throttle included – so you’ll be adding your own assist. But don’t expect to lay down rubber when you pull away from the stop sign on the Buzz Charter F.The nice thing though is it still gets you up to the maximum allowable speed for Class 1 e-bikes of 20 mph (32 km/h). A lot of these small folding e-bikes top out at 15 mph (25 km/h), so the extra speed is a nice benefit, even if it takes a few extra seconds to reach the top end.The good news about the low power is that it helps the rather low capacity 288 Wh battery last longer. They say you can get up to 40 miles (64 km) of range out of the e-bike, but that must be in the lowest of the three power modes. If you’re riding faster, expect closer to 25-30 miles with reasonable pedaling. The fact that the battery is hidden in that seat post makes up for the small battery though, since it is so convenient to pop in and out when you lock the bike up.To maintain the bike’s low $999 price tag, a few compromises had to be made.In addition to the smallish motor and battery, there’s a simple LED dot display. It shows you the battery capacity, pedal assist level, and that’s it. It’s good enough for other e-bikes I’ve enjoyed, and so it’s good enough here, too. But if you were hoping for an LCD screen with speedometer and other data, you’ll have to look elsewhere.Next, the bike uses rim brakes. They have plenty of stopping power, so that’s not a concern. But they can be a bit more finicky to adjust over time as the cable stretches. You’ll also need to align the brake pads each time you change them, which is a slightly tricky task if you aren’t used to it. Any bike shop can help you do it in a couple minutes though, if you don’t want to get your hands dirty yourself when the time comes to change brake pads.There’s also no fender package or rear rack. Not only are they not included, but there aren’t even options available as add-on accessories. You’ll have to go third-party if you want to add those parts. I would love to see the company at least offer a compatible option that you can purchase directly instead of trying to find your own third-party parts. When Lectric eBikes recently unveiled the XP LITE and didn’t include fenders or a rear rack to reduce the price, at least they offered them as paid upgrades. So that would be a nice thing to see here.Lastly, there are no lights on the bike. That means if you want to ride at night, you’ll have to add your own. They do give you a pair of rear reflectors, which is pretty neat. But true e-bike lights should be standard equipment, in my opinion.So while there’s a lot to like here, there are some compromises that have been made as well. All told though, the bike rides well and is ultra-convenient for city riding. Just don’t get caught out after dark without buying a decent set of bike lights to add!",ebikes
2022/05/12,"The UK-based micromobility company Eskuta says that its SX-250 electric bike combines motorcycle design with e-bike pricing to offer two-wheeled commuters the best of both worlds.Originally geared toward delivery riders and couriers, the SX-250 is an electric bicycle designed for hardcore urban use.One look at the bike will confirm it too.This isn’t an elegant messenger bike or a fat tire adventure bike. Instead, it’s an urban assault vehicle meant to tackle urban roads and city obstacles.On the motorcycle side of things, the Eskuta SX-250 bears sideview mirrors, turn signals, “motorcycle grade adjustable suspension and braking,” a lockable front glove box, bright LED lighting with high- and low-beam switch, an anti-theft alarm with a motor immobilizer, a keyless start, alloy wheels,  and tubeless tires. There’s even a motorbike-style rear cargo box.On the e-bike side of things, the SX-250 is still a street-legal electric bike, thanks to its functional pedals. As an e-bike, it is free from requirements imposed on motorcycles such as licensing, registration, and insurance. It’s also priced like an e-bike, starting at £1,795 including taxes (approximately US $2,190).Available in eight different colors, the SX-250 can also be custom branded for delivery services.The SX-250 is already bringing in riders from many backgrounds, as Eskuta’s managing director Ian O’Connor explained in a statement provided to Electrek:Our SX-250 appeals to a wide range of individuals, from young people over the age of 14 who are not yet able to drive but want the freedom of an electric bike, to older customers who want a comfortable mode of transport for short distances. This popularity is testament to the fact that electric mobility is becoming more and more mainstream, and it is a trend that is only set to grow going forward as we look to make the switch to electric vehicles and reduce carbon.A 48V electric system offers peppy acceleration for the 119 lb. bike (54 kg), and the battery is lockable and removable for charging on or off of the bike.The bike gets an impressive range rating of 40-50 miles (64-80 km), though that’s likely helped by the limited top speed of just 15.5 mph (25 km/h). Most of Europe shares fairly strict electric bicycle laws limiting the top speed and power of e-bikes, unlike the US where e-bikes can reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h).The Eskuta SX-250’s design is also rarely seen in the US, where e-bikes often take on either a more traditional bicycle design, go full ‘Murica with massive fat tires, or in a more recent trend, adopt a retro style of motorcycle or moped-inspired design.With so many companies developing and/or importing such a wide variety of electric bike designs, these days there truly is something out there for everyone.What do you think of the SX-250’s design as a motorcycle-inspired full-suspension electric bike?

2022/05/12,"Back when COVID-19 ravaged New York City and turned the city’s transportation needs upside down, significant portions of the road space were repurposed for non-car use. From bike lanes to public seating and urban parks, roads that previously saw gridlocked traffic were nearly instantly transformed into public spaces that benefitted a wider group of residents.After being forced to realize the benefits of such repurposing of streets, the city is now asking, “Why shouldn’t it just stay that way?”It’s all part of a new plan known as NYC 25×25, which is backed by NYC mayor Eric Adams.The proposal calls for 25% of NYC’s street space to be converted into walkable pedestrian plazas, bike lanes, green space, and bus lanes by 2025.The logic goes that the vast majority of NYC’s streets being dominated by cars doesn’t benefit most city residents, and it doesn’t really benefit cars either. With traffic-clogged streets moving at an average of 5 mph (8 km/h) in Midtown Manhattan, private automobile transportation in NYC is responsible for a significant portion of the city’s carbon emissions, air pollution, and urban grime. Meanwhile, pedestrians and cyclists are forced to navigate the crowded fringes of roads, often weaving around parked vehicles and heaps of trash awaiting pickup.And that’s all before even considering the staggering number of pedestrian and cycling deaths caused by cars in the city.Repurposing street space would help to both clean the city and better serve its residents. The executive director of Transportation Alternatives Danny Harris, of the group behind the 25×25 proposal, explained to the Guardian that “space minus cars equals quality of life.”NYC currently has around 3 million free parking spots lining its streets, which is more than the number of cars registered in the city.And considering that most NYC residents don’t own a car, but rather use other forms of transportation such as buses, subways, bikes, and walking, dedicating so much space to cars simply doesn’t make sense.As Harris continued:If you live in a place where buying a car and spending $10,000 a year on car-related payments is your only way to get around, then your leaders have failed you and your children. Using streets to simply move and store cars is not optimizing that space. We just got blinded by the car industry and this belief that we should put an SUV in every garage.Right now, we give most of New York to cars – but imagine if sidewalks were bigger, if you could bike or quickly take the bus anywhere you wanted, if you didn’t have huge mounds of garbage on every single street. As New Yorkers, we think of ourselves as being tough. But that doesn’t mean we have to live in filth, or that we should fear death or injury every time we cross the street.Transportation Alternatives’ plan for NYC would see the creation of 500 miles (800 km) of dedicated bus lanes, another 500 miles of protected bike lanes, new secure garbage containers to prevent the piling of garbage mounds on sidewalks, and widespread community use of car-free roads.Ultimately, it would result in the equivalent of 13 Central Parks worth of public space to be reclaimed from cars.The plan has been endorsed my NYC mayor Eric Adams, who said last month that “these are our streets, and it’s about riding, skateboarding, walking. You know, this is a good place you could come shop, sit down, spend time, and just enjoy the outdoors.”The trend is part of a larger movement that seeks to turn cities around the world from car-centric to people-centric, creating more bikeable and walkable areas that still help move residents around without the negative impacts of cars.Cities like Paris are leading the charge with car bans in the city center, an increasingly popular method for governments to create navigable cities that are friendly to pedestrians and personal vehicles like bikes and scooters.Many countries also offer tax incentives to citizens that choose to ride bikes instead of driving cars. The US flirted with its own e-bike buying tax incentive that seems to have stalled in Congress, though US cities like Denver are going it alone with their own e-bike tax rebates programs.Should NYC be shifting over dominance of its streets from cars to people? Should your own city be doing the same? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below.Image credits: Zichuan Han, Miles Rothoerl, Dylan Spangler",ebikes
2022/05/11,"Aventon’s electric bikes have always impressed me with their build quality and attention to detail. When the company launched an updated version of its popular Pace 500 e-bike, I knew to expect more of the same excellent qualities. Now that I’ve been able to spend some quality time testing the bike, I’m even more convinced of the brand’s commitment to giving its customers more than they anticipated.The Pace 500 Next Gen was first announced this spring and offered upgraded parts compared to the first generation version of the Pace 500 that we previously tested.From frame-integrated lights to a nicely hidden battery and even hydraulic disc brakes, the new Pace 500 is coming in hot with plenty of fancy parts to pique the interest of even the most seasoned urban e-bike rider.To see this new e-bike put through its paces, check out my testing video below. Or keep reading (or both!) for an even deeper dive into the model.The Aventon Pace 500 Next Gen is the epitome of an urban e-bike. That means it’s designed for tackling both well-manicured and oft-neglected city streets thanks to a robust frame and moderately wide 27.5 by 2.2–inch tires.Those tires complement the lack of suspension by retaining enough air volume to take the edge off of a bad pothole while still being narrow enough to reduce weight and maintain a nimble ride.Comfortable touch points on the bars and saddle, when combined with the moderately relaxed riding position, help to make the bike a pleasure to ride. It’s nowhere near as hunched forward as many urban e-bikes yet isn’t a totally upright cruiser-style bike either. The adjustable bars allow you to go further to either end of that spectrum as you see fit for your own comfort. Somewhere in the middle, the Pace 500 finds a happy compromise.Other key urban features include the easy-to-read LCD screen and the built-in lighting that offers a powerful headlight and awesome frame-integrated taillights built directly into the seat stays. Those are becoming a staple of Aventon’s e-bikes, and I love them. You get bright, easy-to-see brake lights and taillights on either side of the bike, and you don’t have to worry about damaging them like other e-bikes with bolt-on lights since Aventon’s lights are buried into the frame itself. I can’t tell you how many times on other e-bikes I’ve caught my lights on the brake and shifter cables of other bikes when I park at crowded bike racks, so anything that is built into the frame is a major advantage in my book.Class 3 e-bikes are kind of my jam; I love the ability to hit speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with a bit of pedal help. It means the bike feels like a superweapon designed to take on any urban commute and still keep up with traffic.When operated on throttle-only, the Pace 500 can easily hit 20 mph (32 km/h) thanks to the peppy 500W continuous-rated motor in the rear wheel. But when you activate the pedal assist and crank it up to a higher level, 28 mph (45 km/h) speeds are possible. The 8-speed shifter helps you get up to those higher speeds without spinning your feet too terribly fast.Back on the lower end of the pedal-assist range, the bike is a comfortable pedaler when you’re intending to do most of the work yourself. As much fun as it is to cruise fast, I also enjoy easing back on the power and having a bit of combined fitness/leisure ride on level 1 or 2 pedal assist.The lower pedal assist levels also help make that battery last much longer.Remember what I said about how much I love it when lights are built into the frame? Well, the same thing does for batteries. Frame-mounted batteries that get bolted on top of the frame are so 2019. These days, frame-integrated yet still easily removable batteries are where it’s at. And that’s exactly what the Pace 500 offers.I will say that the 48V 12Ah battery is a bit smaller than average, offering just 614 Wh of capacity. Many companies are in the 650–750 Wh range these days, though Aventon is pretty darn close to that industry average. But going with a slightly smaller battery is also part of the bike’s sleek design as it doesn’t have a chunky downtube that tries to hide away a massive battery pack.And I always have to give Aventon props for the brand’s fully-transparent range ratings. Other companies often give opaque range ratings or a simple “up to 50 miles” figure without context. But Aventon offers up every pedal assist level’s range rating from real-world testing, plus the throttle-only range (which many people who rarely pedal will care about).The company comes right out and tells us we’ll get 30 miles (48 km) of range on throttle only, and that the range drops to 24 miles (38.6 km) on the highest pedal assist level at 28 mph (45 km/h), but that you can also eke out 47 miles (76 km) of range if you go slower on the lowest pedal assist level.To me, the Aventon Pace 500 Next Gen feels like everything I need in an urban commuter e-bike. It’s a comfortable ride with a high top speed, good quality parts like hydraulic disc brakes, high-quality manufacturing, and even a great app for those that like extra data with their e-bikes.The app integrates with the display and allows you to track rides, make parameter adjustments on the bike like speed and power, and you can even use it as a dashboard to control lights and other functions.The $1,699 price feels fair to me, though if they’d included the rear rack and the fender set in the base price, then I’d be singing Aventon’s praises from the rooftops. Even so, riders that are interested in that extra gear can of course add it from the wide range of Aventon accessories.Between the nice design, color options and multiple sizes of frames (and both step-through and step-over options), the Aventon Pace 500 Next Gen is a great-looking and great-riding e-bike that I’ll definitely be recommending to friends and family.",ebikes
2022/05/10,"Specialized’s electric bikes are many things: Quality, highly engineered, covering a wide range of riding styles. But one thing they aren’t is low cost – at least, not until now. That’s because Specialized has just announced that it is launching a new and more affordable line of e-bikes known as Globe, which will focus on utility and cargo electric bikes designed as car replacements for city use.Specialized made the announcement this morning but didn’t provide many specifics regarding the actual bike designs or the price points that the company is targeting. The company did share a teaser image of the first model, shown carrying quite a load of cacti that conveniently hides many of the most interesting parts of the new e-bike.What we can see though is that the bike is powered by a rear hub motor, which would be a first for Specialized’s electric bicycles. [Update May 11: I stand corrected – certain Specialized Turbo models from 2012 to 2017 also had hub motors!]The company has previously used mid-drive motors like those from Brose to provide a high-end yet pricey electric drivetrain.Moving from mid-drives to hub motors is a move we’ve seen elsewhere recently in the e-bike industry, and it allows higher end companies to offer more affordable e-bikes without compromising on many of the other higher quality components that are expected to come with their brand label.I also spy hydraulic disc brakes and what appears to be at least a 9-speed transmission on the rear of the bike, which could come in handy for those that like to help pedal up hills or just get in a human-powered workout. It’s not clear if the bike will feature a throttle. There is a wire shown terminating in throttle-territory on the right handlebar, but that could be for an additional set of buttons such as for LED lights or a horn.The company is expected to reveal more details regarding the bikes’ specs as well as pricing as we get closer to the official launch date. That pricing info will be of particular interest to see just how competitively Specialized can position itself next to a growing crop of low-cost direct-to-consumer electric bikes.The company says that orders should be opening later this year and that deliveries will begin in early 2023.For more info, see the company’s press release below:Today, Specialized is announcing the creation of a new business unit called Globe. Most everyday car trips are short, joyless, and bad for your wallet and the planet. Globe is an extension of the Specialized brand that will focus on bringing more fun to local living while reducing the number of car, truck, and SUV trips needed for everyday transportation. Specialized’s purpose is to harness the power of the bicycle to pedal the planet forward. Globe will help us deliver on that promise in a new and even more accessible way. We’ll do this through a commitment to lifetime value and affordability with the products that we create, the way that we reach and communicate with new riders, and through our continued partnership with independent local bike shops who don’t currently benefit from the growth of direct-to-consumer exclusive brands. Globe will harness the power of the Specialized ecosystem to provide everyday riders with the widest nationwide network of sales and service opportunities. Globe will serve riders with a growing number of everyday high performance EVs and the accessories that go with them. Globe bikes are built to move you, your family, and your things. Our plan is to start taking orders in late 2022 and deliver our first bikes to riders in early 2023. ",ebikes
2022/05/09,"Barcelona-based Rayvolt not only has some of the most beautiful electric bikes I’ve ever seen, but also designs its own technology to ensure that those e-bikes offer industry-leading performance and user-experiences. That kind of combination of beauty and brains is rarely seen outside of a Hollywood blockbuster, which is why I just had to stop by Barcelona in person to check out the latest from Rayvolt.The company kindly invited me out to its yearly press and dealer meeting, which returned after a two-year hiatus caused by COVID-19.Back with a bang, the event showcased Rayvolt’s newest developments and exciting news about the future direction of the company. On display in the brand’s showroom were many of the stunning electric bicycles we’ve come to know and love, but also several new models with a new twist.Check out my brief video below to see what Rayvolt had on hand, or keep scrolling to read even more about these head-turning electric bikes.First up, the Rayvolt Cruzer is a classic in the brand’s lineup and features stretched cruiser styling with motorcycle design accents. Of all the bikes that carry Rayvolt’s (literal) brass seal, this is the one that likely best encompasses the brand’s design ethos.The bike is massive, though it is also available in a shorter wheelbase version which smaller riders will likely find more comfortable. Both versions feature the same styling and leatherwork details that you’ll quickly see are a theme at Rayvolt.Other models – like the Ambassador – are a bit more subdued, at least in mass. Narrow frame tubes and tires give a more elegant urban look to the Ambassador bike, while still retaining the classic Catalonian leatherwork and shiny brass features around the bike.The bike is a much lighter weight model designed for city riders that want to retain that classic fixie look while still embracing the company’s signature styling, right down the the leather handbag that pulls double duty as the removable battery case.Branching out into broader styles of e-bikes, models like the Ringo offer more of a moped take while the Beachin’ model explores a traditional fat bike design for cruising the coast (though “traditional” shouldn’t imply that it strays very far from Rayvolt’s popular aesthetic).And that’s barely scraping the surface of what Rayvolt has to offer. The company’s Torino e-bike offers an even shorter wheelbase version of the Cruzer and swaps the wide tires for more balanced 2″-ish rubber to create a nimble city ride. The Trixie is a front-loading electric cargo trike with enough room for several kids and/or pets up front, all while still embracing the design cues that make Rayvolt stand out from the crowd.The Clubman offers a sophisticated motorcycle-inspired design with vintage-looking white wall tires to complete the package.The list just keeps going, as did the room after room of eye-catching e-bikes that look as good on a museum shelf as they do whizzing down the road. Check out some of the beautiful collection in the gallery below.Not content with just electric bicycles, Rayvolt is even going full cruiser motorcycle.The company has developed multiple prototypes for light and medium-weight electric motorcycles that – yep, you guessed it – also embrace the Catalonian design cues that adorn Rayvolt’s electric bicycles.My favorite model includes four battery bays beneath the frame that offer huge battery options for longer range riding, to the tune of up to 27 kWh of capacity. That’s more than Energica’s largest capacity batteries and around twice the size of Zero’s largest batteries! Plus, it offers the classic cruiser motorcycle geometry for a foot-forward ride. That’s a rarity in the electric motorcycle industry.Now this is a bike I can ride everyday!But it’s not just the designs that catch the eye, at least not for those that appreciate what powers these beautiful e-bikes. Rayvolt’s technology is industry leading for the simple reason that they don’t buy off-the-shelf drivetrain parts, but rather design their own controllers, hardware, and software to work together seamlessly.The company’s custom designed motors and pure sine wave controllers offer the highest efficiency and lowest noise level possible. A combination of sensors ranging from torque sensors in the pedal assist system to heat sensors in the motor give the controller realtime access to key data from the bike’s most important systems.All of this has helped Rayvolt design in new technology and features, like the ability to modulate the power of the regenerative braking in the motor simply by pedaling backwards faster or slower. That regenerative braking feature has also been key to the company’s development of its RegenFit program, which allows riders to put their e-bike on a stationary roller and use it at home like an exercise bike, recharging the battery while burning calories.The company’s in-house designed EIVA 2.0 app that interface’s with the bikes’ software has been recently updated as well, giving riders even more control. The open-source Android-based app can be installed directly on the bikes’ displays, meaning owners can add their own Android apps as well. Want Google Maps directly on your e-bike’s display? That’s now possible, at least if you have a Rayvolt bike with built-in EIVA display.While Rayvolt is of course known for its iconic design, the company’s technology has lead it to spin off a new brand known as eXXite for its more techie-looking rides.The actual technology behind the eXXite e-bikes is largely identical to that found in Rayvolt’s line of vintage-looking e-bikes, but it gets wrapped in a much more modern package that will likely appeal to a different type of rider.For example, the X One electric bike has some Rayvolt Cruzer recessive genes in it if you look closely at a few of the frame tubes, but then it goes its own direction entirely for a much more modern look.After first being unveiled in 2019 and then being derailed in 2020 when COVID-related supply chain disruptions saw important components in its design delayed and then cancelled, such as the unique brake levers and fork that were imperative to the bike’s design, the X One is now back on track and hitting production.I had the chance to test out one of the first models, which you can see in my video from the event above. The bike feels nearly as large as the Cruzer but has its own unique flair to it, such as the turn signals mounted in the handlebar ends. At the same time though, the technology is unmistakably Rayvolt’s. When I engage the regenerative braking and crank up the power, it feels like I just popped a parachute out the back even though the brake pads haven’t even touched the discs yet.The new brand eXXite line is now expanding into even more models, including a more traditional-looking belt-drive commuter bike for the city and a neat take on a standing electric scooter. The scooter includes a shield in front that is more reminiscent of a Vespa-style scooter. Despite being designed as a standing scooter, eXXite is planning a cargo box that will be mountable on the back of the scooter and just might offer a bit of a seat to lean against, almost turning the scooter into a seated version.And of course the EIVA 2.0 app system is available on the eXXite line as well via the built-in Android display, meaning riders can install any Android apps they wish directly to their e-bike or e-scooter screen.Both the Rayvolt and eXXite brands are built on a similar foundation, but it is obvious that they are going their own ways when it comes to design and branding. Sharing the same technological foundation while branching out to different markets seems like a smart move though, making it easy to co-develop new tech and features that can equally benefit very different customers.With so many interesting things on display (beautiful e-bikes, awesome motorcycles, novel scooters, the list goes on!), I almost don’t know where to turn next in order to follow Rayvolt and eXXite’s future paths. There’s a lot to be excited for here, and I’m sure we’re going to be seeing big new things coming out of Barcelona soon.",ebikes
2022/05/07,"Fucare’s new Gemini X electric bike pairs a novel-looking trellis-style frame with some high-performance electric bike parts to create a fast Class 3 e-bike that looks at home on both the streets and the trails.The frame is rated for 400 lb. (181 kg) of load and gives the Gemini X a look all its own, at least for now. We rarely see e-bikes rated for such heavy loads, though we also rarely see e-bikes with this frame design.Part truss bridge, part Erector Set, the frame uses narrow diameter tubes that wrap around the forward-mounted 48V battery while still leaving an open area on top to allow for battery removal.A second battery is housed just behind the seat tube, resulting in a combined 20.8 Ah. With 998 Wh of total battery capacity, Fucare claims a lofty 55 miles (88 km) of range on throttle-only riding, or an even further 80 miles (130 km) under pedal assist.The 750 W hub motor in the rear wheel will provide 20 mph (32 km/h) of assist on throttle-only riding or an even faster 28 mph (45 km/h) when the rider uses the highest pedal assist level. That keeps the Gemini X in Class 3 designation for street legal operation in the US.Suspension is provided up front with a spring fork that features both pre-load adjustment and lockout. Moving a bit higher, the bars house a large 5.3″ color screen to display pertinent ride data like speed, distance, battery charge level, pedal assist mode, and more. There’s also a USB charge port in that screen that can be used to help keep your phone or other USB-powered device topped up on your ride.Moving further back along the bike, a 7-speed Shimano transmission gives a range of gear ratios for those that will use the pedals as more than staggered foot rests.Both wheels include hydraulic disc brakes for quick and maintenance-free stoppers, and those wheels get wrapped in 4″ wide rubber. The fat tires are only 20″ diameter, striking a balance between wide tires for comfort and cornering, yet maintaining a smaller diameter for reduced sized and improved nimbleness.A step-through version of the e-bike is also available.Both models include a rear rack, ABS fenders and LED lights in the base price of $1,899. The company is also throwing in a cable lock, though it looks like you could cut through it with a pair of safety scissors, so you may want to consider a higher-end lock for an e-bike investment of this price.Those that want to add even more accessories like a rear basket can trick the ride out for extra utility, but even the base model seems to be nicely spec’d.What do you think of Fucare’s striking new offerings in the e-bike market? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/05/06,"Electric bicycles that blur the line with electric motorcycles and mopeds are an increasingly popular category of the e-bike industry. The latest new e-bike to take a full-throttle approach to this design philosophy is the C3STROM Astro.Available in both the Astro and Astro Pro models, C3STROM is definitely packing both high-power looks and the high-power performance to match.And that was by design, as C3STROM CEO Harry Chan explained in a statement provided to Electrek:The Astro’s release marks a new level for the all-in-one electric bike. The story here was just us asking, ‘Why are riders supposed to choose between looks, comfort, speed, and adaptability?’ They shouldn’t have to.So far, it seems like Chan’s statement rings true. The motor may be listed as a street-legal 750W power plant offering a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) to score the bike a legal Class 3 designation, but it can be unlocked to achieve 32 mph (52 km/h) in off-road mode. The front suspension fork should help with bumps to a degree, but the lack of rear suspension could make any decent-size potholes or obstacles quite a doozy at top speed.To come down from such high speeds, the bike includes four-piston hydraulic disc brakes on both the base level and Pro models. Both bikes also feature wide tires to allow on and off-road riding possibilities.Built into a motorcycle-inspired frame, the battery is wrapped in the frame tubes in a way we’ve rarely seen before. E-bike batteries often play double duty as motorcycle-inspired top tank design notes, but to build the frame entirely around the battery, which itself is suspended from the top tube, is an uncommon design choice that further differentiates the C3STROM Astro from other moped-style electric bikes.That’s no small capacity battery, either. If they’re going to build a moto-inspired and presumably heavy e-bike, they better give it some serious battery capacity. The base level model will carry a 780 Wh battery, while the Astro Pro will come outfitted with a 1,040 Wh battery. Both are built using Samsung 21700-format lithium-ion battery cells.A smartphone app will also be included to provide connectivity with the e-bike and allow riders to view important riding data as well as make changes to the bike’s performance parameters.The C3STROM Astro will soon become available for a starting pre-order price of $1,699, meaning it should compete favorably in the category – at least on cost. Heavyweights in the electric moped industry like Juiced Bikes and SUPER73 may not have too much to fear if the final price jumps up in the future, but the promotional pricing sure puts it in the lower end of the price range compared to today’s top options.",ebikes
2022/05/03,"The new Mahle X20 electric bicycle powertrain is set to lead to some ultra lightweight e-bikes thanks to the pared down electric motor and battery combination.The drivetrain improves upon the company’s existing Mahle X35 e-bike powertrain; that lightweight drive system has been featured in electric bicycles weighing as little as 10.5 kg (23.1 lb) and is a favorite of lightweight e-bike designers like cycling legend Greg LeMond.The new Mahle X20 system weighs in at just 3.2 kg (7.05 lbs.), including the motor, battery, wiring, controller, and head unit used as the system’s user interface.That low weight opens big possibilities, as head of Mahle Smartbike Systems Jochen Sommer explained:With the X20, we are starting a completely new chapter by combining weight advantage, aesthetics, and customization in an unprecedented drive solution.As you may have guessed, though, this level of ultralight design also means that power and range figures are a bit on the light side as well.The 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) rear hub motor is said to put out 23 Nm of torque, though Mahle claims that is equivalent to a mid-drive motor that can supply 55 Nm of torque.The internal battery is available in two models, the iX250 and iX350. The former provides 250 Wh of capacity, while the latter offers 350 Wh. They are both designed to be integrated into the frame itself as a non-removable battery (though removal by a technician is possible for servicing or replacing the battery). A separate range extender battery is also available that can be mounted like a water bottle to increase the total battery capacity of the bike.According to the Light Electric Vehicle Association, the X20 “has a sophisticated sensor package that measures acceleration, speed, torque, temperature, and pedaling rate. It also uses artificial intelligence to continuously adapt the drive to the person in the saddle. The X20 thus offers a perfectly tailored cycling experience—even when riders or training conditions change. Further impressive features of the drive system are its absolutely natural pedal feel, which is similar to that of a conventional high-performance sports bike, and the noise-free support it offers the user. Communication between cyclist and vehicle takes place via a modern HMI with haptic feedback.”The powertrain is already making its way into lightweight e-bikes, like the 10.7 kg (23.6 lbs.) Scott Addict eRide electric bike.Anything in the sub-30 lb. range is already exceedingly light for an electric bike, and approaching 20 lbs. is considered ultra lightweight in the industry.In the past, we’ve seen other lightweight electric bikes that have gone to great lengths to shave off the grams.Hummingbird debuted the lightest folding e-bike at 10.3 kg (22.7 lbs.), and the HPS Domestique is probably the current lightest production electric bicycle at just 8.5 kg (18.7 lbs.).Technicall,y the 6.872 kg (15.15 lb) Freicycle electric bike is even lighter, though it was a one-off DIY build and thus doesn’t compete against production e-bikes.",ebikes
2022/05/03,"If there’s one thing I love as much as playing with batteries, it’s charging them up from the sun. And when it comes to my electric bikes, which are kind of outdoor toys by definition, being able to charge in the field is a pretty darn neat trick for extending range when camping or just spending all day in the great outdoors. I recently had the chance to test out QuietKat’s all-in-one electric bike solar charger for just that purpose, and I can tell you that this is a really cool piece of gear to bring on your next e-bike trip.For starters, this is a folding solar panel, meaning it is made up of multiple units of smaller solar cells all wired together so it can fold back up into a small package.It comes in a convenient little carry case that also includes pockets to store the various cables that extend the utility of the solar charger.Not only do you have both a DC barrel connector and a three-pin connector, but you also get alligator clips for more DIY-ish charging purposes and the tried-and-true MC4 connectors that you’ll find on many other solar panels.You can see all the contents from the kit in the images below. There’s also a typical 48V e-bike battery there for scale, though I can tell you the bag is around 13x8x3.5 inches when packed down (33x20x9 cm).It’s actually a surprisingly small and packable little kit when it’s all folded up. In fact, the first time I pulled the solar panel out, I couldn’t believe how big it was compared to how small the bag was.The panel is rated for 150W, which is actually more power than most typical e-bike chargers that come with a base model e-bike. For a 48V battery, you’ll usually get a 48V 2A charger from the manufacturer, which equates to around 100W. So this charger will actually be a slight boost in charging performance and speed compared to your wall charger, unless your manufacturer was kind enough to spend the extra few bucks and give you a 3A or 4A charger with your e-bike (most aren’t).This version of the charger is the 48V option, but they also make a 52V version as well.Technically this solar charger is intended to be used for QuietKat’s wide lineup of overlanding and all terrain e-bikes. But I’ll let you in on a little secret: I don’t have a QuietKat e-bike, so I just used it on several of my e-bikes from other brands. As long as they use either the incredibly common DC barrel connector or the less common small three-pin connector (both of which come in the QuietKat solar charger kit), it will work for your e-bike battery –assuming you chose the correct 48V or 52V version to match your e-bike battery.And since I don’t have an awesomely rugged Jeep-branded QuietKat e-bike, I couldn’t take a cool photo like their marketing images below, but you get the point. It’s a big panel. Also it can stand up like a science fair trifold board, which is pretty cool, though largely inefficient unless you’re charging at 8:00 or 18:00 when the sun is near the horizon. For any other time, you’ll want the panel either laying flat (for midday sun) or propped up on something (like your e-bike) to angle it toward the sun for best results. But the panel also has two tie-down holes with grommets in the top corners, plus it includes two carabiners, so you can also hang it on something if you want.The charger itself has three ports on the backside, including two USB-A ports and a DC barrel connector.The USB-A ports will be useful for charging up your phone, tablet, GoPro or other action camera, walkie-talkie, flashlight, heated socks, Tamagotchi, or whatever else you happen to bring into the field.The DC barrel connector is where all the heavier duty charging things plug in, i.e., your e-bike battery.Using the included connector cable, you simply pop that sucker in the panel on one side and your e-bike battery on the other. For a typical 48V 10.4Ah e-bike battery, you’re looking at somewhere around four hours or so for a full charge in good sunlight. If you’re just stopping for lunch for an hour, even getting 25-30% charge back into your battery is a definite possibility.The whole package is slickly designed and easy to use. You just pull it out, unfold it, and plug in. That’s it. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.The only hard thing is that it’s a bit rough on your wallet, to the tune of $769. In terms of dollars per watt, that will make some solar enthusiasts want to cry. But then again, the point isn’t to make a cheap solar panel, it’s to create an all-in-one e-bike charging solution. It’s a huge convenience factor that you don’t need any inverters and can simply plug the panel directly into your e-biker, not to mention the convenience of the tiny size of the packed panel. I don’t know if you’ve seen other 150W solar panels in real life before, but they’re usually around the surface area of a surf board. The fact that you can get 150W of solar power folded into something the size of a box of tissues (again, Americans will use anything to avoid the metric system) is a pretty cool advancement in solar powered e-bike charging.So while this won’t be a toy for the cash-strapped, it is a really cool way to charge your e-bike off-grid, and pretty much the only one I know of that’s a complete all-in-one solution. And that’s pretty cool in my opinion.",ebikes
2022/05/02,"When it comes to bang-for-your-buck electric bicycles, it’s hard to beat the Phoenix-based company Lectric eBikes. While it may not have the fancy components of the big-name companies or the sprawling reach of the industry top dogs, there’s a reason the company has such a dedicated following: It offers good e-bikes at great prices. Having just released two new e-bikes on both the higher and lower ends of the market, plus offering a great mid-tier option, we’re going to break down the differences between the Lectric XP 2.0, the Lectric XP Lite and the company’s newest model, the Lectric XPremium.All three models maintain Lectric’s signature design ethos: just enough of what you need, nothing you don’t, and a killer price.The Lectric XP LITE is priced at $799, the Lectric XP 2.0 is a bit heftier on the wallet at $999, and the Lectric XP Premium with its higher performance and better parts is priced at $1,799.But while they all share a great balance of features and cost compared to the industry, there are also a pile of differences to understand. The bikes offer three different motors, three different batteries, and a wide range of components and designs meant for different types of riders.Let’s start with the Lectric XP Lite and work our way up the model line. And if you’d like to see a brief video version of this post to check out the three models in action, I’ve got that for you below.The Lectric XP Lite, which was unveiled in mid-April, is the lightest and most affordable e-bike in Lectric’s lineup.At just 46 lb (20 kg), it is surprisingly compact and maneuverable when folded down. I was able to easily toss it in the back of my car and ride around to find the best spots when I tested it ahead of the bike’s official launch.The XP LITE offers Class 2 performance specs, which means the assist on both throttle and pedal assist will cut out at 20 mph (32 km/h). While that’s plenty for some riders, others like to go faster and will enjoy the two models further down on this list.The XP LITE’s smaller 720W peak motor is sufficient to hit 20 mph, but it isn’t as strong as the next two e-bikes on this list. Even so, modest hills and some good old-fashioned pedaling combine to make this bike a trooper in moderately hilly terrain. The bike also offers a single-speed drivetrain and a rigid front fork without suspension, which combine to help reduce both the price and weight. The smallish 375 Wh battery still offers a powerful 48V system but drops range to around 15 miles (25 km) on throttle-only riding, and also helps to reduce weight.Another nod to low weight are the more narrow 2″ tires. These are not narrow by most measures, but rather fit a typical urban mountain bike role. Compared to the larger tires on the XP 2.0 and XPremium though, they’re both lighter and nimbler.Strong mechanical disc brakes, built in LED lighting, and an easy-to-read LCD display round out the list of included gear, meaning you’re still getting a lot for your hard-earned dough.The Lectric XP Lite is best for riders that want a good e-bike but on a budget, and don’t mind giving up features like multiple gears and suspension to get there. It’s also best for someone looking for a lighter-weight folding e-bike or that wants it to fit in a more compact area like a smaller car trunk.For just $200 more though, you may want to check out the XP 2.0 model that we’ll discuss next next.The Lectric XP 2.0 is something of the original classic e-bike from Lectric eBikes. Technically it is the second version, having replaced the 1.0 version by adding a number of upgrades like suspension, new tire size, stronger rack, more rugged frame, etc. But just keep in mind that this is the model that people think of when they refer to the original Lectric XP.The XP 2.0 is priced at $999, making it just a $200 bump over the XP LITE. You give up the lightweight feature of the LITE since the XP 2.0 is about 20 lb heavier at 65 lb (29 kg). But you definitely get a lot more.The XP 2.0 has a more powerful rear hub motor rated up to 800W and that can power it up to a faster top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist. On throttle though, it will still only reach 20 mph (32 km/h) as required by law for Class 2 e-bikes. The more powerful motor also makes the XP 2.0 a better hill climber than the LITE.Speaking of hills, the inclusion a 7-speed drivetrain on the XP 2.0 will also help riders in hilly areas that want to downshift for more torque when helping to pedal up a steep hill.Other design improvements include an oil suspension fork up front combined with a pair of 3″ tires that offer a nice compromise between comfortable all-terrain fat tires and narrower urban tires. At 3″, you get the best of both worlds with a reasonably nimble ride that still feels like you’re on a higher end suspension bike.The bike also includes a strong rear rack that is technically rated for around 70 lb. Fenders and lights are also included, meaning you’re getting a ton of nice parts for just $999.The XP 2.0 is probably my main recommendation for anyone looking at a high-value hub motor e-bike and that doesn’t mind the somewhat heavier weight compared to the LITE.With the launch of the XPremium late last month, Lectric eBikes entered into much higher level competition with fancier mid-drive electric bikes.Mid-drive motors, which house the motor by the pedals instead of in the rear wheel, are a more elegant and torquier way to power an electric bike. They allow the rider to power the wheel through the bike’s gears, letting you shift your way to either mega torque in lower gears or high speed in the upper gears.The Lectric XPremium uses a mid-drive motor produced by a company called Truckrun, which is a good quality but lesser known manufacturer that can be found on several fancier electric bike models priced at over $3,000.The XPremium ostensibly gets similar power and speed ratings compared to the XP 2.0, namely the peak of 800W and top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), but the higher quality motor gives riders more freedom in how they get there, plus the ability to have a much nicer pedal assist experience.That’s because the motor uses a torque sensor instead of a cadence sensor to engage the pedal assist, meaning the power comes on much smoother and more naturally. For anyone who really wants to pedal and experience an intuitive pedal assist support, this is the model for you.The bike also comes with two batteries as standard equipment (there’s no up-charge for the second battery, unlike almost every other e-bike company that charge for the second battery option). With a real-world 50 miles (80 km) of range on throttle-only riding or 100 miles (160 km) of range on pedal assist, the Lectric XPremium offers seriously long riding possibilities, or just the ability to recharge less frequently. Other nice parts include the hydraulic disc brakes for stronger stopping and reduced maintenance, upgraded LED lighting for more powerful night time illumination, oil suspension fork for softer rides, 4″ fat tires for the best all-terrain performance, a strong rear rack, and included fenders. The bikes also come with Slime anti-flat puncture resistance formula in the tires, which can save you a massive headache of fixing a flat tire on the side of the road.The $1,799 price may seem like a big jump from the $999 XP 2.0, but it’s absolutely worth it. Not only is this a nicer motor and over twice the battery, but you get those higher quality parts like the hydraulic disc brakes too. And remember, you’d probably pay at least $1,000 more to get similar features and performance from other brands.When Lectric eBikes first started out, they had very few accessories to choose from. But times have changed and now you’ll find a wide range of useful gear to add to your bike.Some of my favorites include the cargo package and the comfort package.The first adds some serious hauling capacity to the bike in the form of front and rear baskets. They basically turn your e-bike into a cargo bike, and would be great for anyone that needs to do some serious grocery shopping or wants to use their e-bike for commercial use like a delivery rider.The comfort package swaps out the standard saddle and seat post for a wider and cushier saddle on a suspension seat post. To be honest, the included base-level saddle is already a great piece of gear – it’s not like those cheap and hard base-level saddles that many low-cost electric bikes come with. But the comfort saddle is just one step higher when it comes to comfort. And that suspension seat post also adds some nice cushioning to the rear of the bike for harsh bumps that the front suspension fork won’t help with.I haven’t tried Lectric’s pannier bags yet, but they look like a solid option. I have used the folding lock, and I really like the way that it integrates into the XP 2.0’s frame to hide it out of the way when you’re not using it but still accessible when you need it.There are a lot of great e-bikes out there. I’ve ridden tons of them and I recommend plenty of brands outside of Lectric for all sorts of uses and rider types. But Lectric has gone above and beyond when it comes to bang-for-your-buck, and these three models demonstrate that.If you want higher-grade bicycle components, ultra-lightweight frames, or rear suspension, you’ll want to look elsewhere. Lectric eBikes doesn’t cater to the higher-end crowd like that. But what it does offer is good-quality gear that may not make it to top-shelf status, but that will last for years with a bit of care and attention, and that is backed by a local customer support team that is ready to help.Hopefully this guide has helped you learn a bit more about the different models and what makes each one tick. Ride safe out there and may your battery be forever charged!",ebikes
2022/04/29,"When the RadExpand 5 was first unveiled, I was surprised to see the company go in this direction and replace the RadMini with a new model. But now that I’ve spent some good time in the saddle, I see exactly what Rad was thinking, because the folding RadExpand 5 e-bike draws on some of the best parts of every other e-bike in the company’s wide lineup.I’ll start by saying that it’s going to be hard for Rad Power Bikes to top their own RadRunner e-bike, which holds a special place in my heart as such an innovative and high utility design.But the cool thing about the RadExpand 5 is that it’s almost like a folding version of the RadRunner, though with some key differences I’ll cover soon.That design direction though, taking RadRunner-like traits and applying them to a folding e-bike, means that the RadExpand 5 offers huge utility in a package that is more convenient for anyone who regularly transports their e-bike or needs to fold it to fit in a tight space.To get a down-and-dirty sense of the new e-bike, check out my video review below and join me on my rides. Then read on for my complete thoughts on this new electric bike model!The RadExpand 5 of course brings the same Rad performance we know and love from the company’s other e-bikes. That means 20 mph (32 km/h) on either throttle or pedal assist, and 25-45 miles (40-72 km) of range per charge.That’s plenty of range for most everyday riders, whether you’re using the bike for leisure, commuting, or local errand running. As much as I’d love to see a Class 3 Rad bike that gets up to 28 mph (45 km/h), we’re set at 20 mph until Rad’s lawyers let us go faster.I’m definitely glad to see the built-in lights stick around for this model, as do the fenders and the rear rack. All of that equipment comes standard so you don’t have to start adding accessories. Though if you want to deck the bike out, Rad of course does have an industry-leading selection to choose from. Seriously, they’ve got so many e-bike accessories that they even have things for your dog.I’m also a big fan of that high handlebar setup as it helps give the bike its upright seating position and comfortable geometry.Plus the handlebars even fold down, which makes it easy to stick the bike against a wall or behind a couch and have it take up less room since the bars lay flat against the fork instead of sticking out sideways like, well, bicycle handlebars.That’s also a great trick to use when loading the bike in the back of an SUV or minivan. On other bikes, I’ll often have to loosen the bars by unbolting the four bolts that hold the bars to the stem and letting them flop down. That allows the bike to become short enough to stand up in most SUVs or minivans. But it’s not great for the bike because you can wear down those threads over time with repeated tightening and loosening. This folding handlebar setup instantly drops the bars lower and means you can easily slide the RadExpand 5 into shorter areas, no tools required.The display/remote is borrowed from Rad’s other economical bikes, namely the RadRunner and RadMission. That means we get a simplified LED dot display to tell us the battery capacity, pedal assist power mode, and the headlight/tail light status. There’s no odometer or speedometer, which is a bit of a bummer for people that really like data, but not necessarily a deal breaker.Unlike the economical bikes though, the RadExpand 5 borrows its wide tires from Rad’s true fat tire e-bikes, sticking with a 4″ size to give more cushioning to the ride and more off-road riding control. The lack of a suspension fork (another move from the Mission/Runner playbook) means that the fat tires are even more important for the ride comfort. I did plenty of trail riding though on grass, dirt, and sand (as you can see in my video above), and I often couldn’t even tell that the bike lacked suspension. Those fat tires are amazing at soaking up bumps.I also love the step-through frame and I’m glad this more or less matches the RadRunner’s step-through frame. It’s just such an easy way to hop on and off of the bike, especially when that rear rack is loaded high. I don’t have kids of my own, but I can imagine how a kid’s seat on back would make the step-through design a winner – no more kicking Junior in the face each time you hop on!The only slight issue with the step-through setup is the battery on the forward part of the downtube means the key sticks out and sometimes rubs my leg when I pedal. The obvious answer is, “Duh, you aren’t supposed to ride with the key in the battery.” And that’s correct. But c’mon, many of us do it sometimes (it’s a great way to not lose your key!), and so it’s something I’ve noticed on occasion. But a friend who also tried the bike with me said it wasn’t noticeable, so maybe I just pedal more narrowly.I’m quoting a lot of RadRunner-style inspirations here, but the RadExpand 5 also goes its own way in many respects. For example, the 7-speed shifter is a big improvement over the RadRunner for anyone who has to deal with hills or just likes to downshift for that extra torque.One of my few gripes on the bike is – believe it or not – the bell. For some reason (almost certainly “supply chain issues”), Rad switched from a brake lever-integrated bell to a standalone bell. Normally that’d be fine, even though I prefer the index finger-actuated brake lever bell. However, there’s a problem here. The display/remote on the left bar end is fairly wide, meaning you have to reach past it to get your thumb on the bell. Unless you’ve got huge thumbs, that means you have to slide your hand in pretty far and loosen your finger grip on the bar to stretch that far. You could swap the bell and the display, but then you’d have the same problem reaching the display (which you use much more).This is admittedly a minor inconvenience, but it’s an inconvenience nonetheless. A good bike bell that is easy to use is actually quite important to me as I often ride in areas with heavy pedestrian traffic, and it is very helpful to angrily ding at people that walk into your lane. I really wish Rad switches back to the brake lever bell, as that was a big winner in my opinion.All told, there’s very little I can complain about here. The bike was a killer deal at its promotional $1,299 introductory price. Now at its new $1,499 price (thanks, inflation), the RadExpand 5 is still a lot of bike for your money, not to mention Rad’s industry-leading service and support. But boy was it seriously tempting at that intro price, eh?I still recommend it to folks who want most of the benefits of the RadRunner, but who prefer a folding package (and for such people who don’t require the awesome passenger capabilities of the Runner).The RadExpand 5 certainly seems like a more than worthy replacement for the RadMini line and keeps me excited to see continued updates and innovation from Rad.",ebikes
2022/04/28,"The federal government’s plan to provide a tax credit for electric bike purchases doesn’t appear to be coming off of life support any time soon, but that hasn’t stopped Denver from creating its own e-bike rebate program. In fact, the city might have done an even better job making these effective car alternatives more accessible to a wider range of incomes and budgets.That’s because Denver’s new electric bike rebate program is an actual point-of-sale rebate.Unlike the proposed federal tax credit that could provide 30% off of a new electric bike purchase, yet still requires the rider to shell out the full price then wait on a return, Denver’s program applies its rebate instantly at the store.It’s nearly as potent as the up to $900 offered in the federal program, with a $400 rebate for most e-bikes and up to $900 for electric cargo bikes, meaning it can make a significant dent in the price of a new electric bike for Denverites. To make it even more equitable, low-income residents that qualify can see the rebate increase up to $1,200.Oh yeah, and the program actually exists. That’s just one more advantage that Denver’s rebate has over the stalled federal program.So while we wait with bated breath to see if Congress can revive the stalled e-bike tax credit for millions of Americans, perhaps its time to take a closer look at how cities and states can follow Denver’s lead and make car alternatives more accessible to commuters.Denver’s program is interesting for a few reasons.First, it includes nearly all electric bike designations. That means Class 1, 2, and 3 e-bikes qualify (speeds up to 28 mph or 45 km/h), as long as they don’t exceed power ratings of 750W.Second, it focuses on electric bikes that riders can actually use for utility purposes, i.e., picking up the kids from school, buying groceries, getting to work, etc. Full-suspension electric mountain bikes are specifically excluded from the rebate. That’s probably a fair move, as these e-bikes generally cost $4K–$8K and anyone who can afford one doesn’t need help buying one.Yes, they’re fun to ride. I love getting big air and bombing both uphill and downhill runs. But that’s not the point of these rebate programs. It’s not about giving people a fun new leisure toy or even a form of exercise (don’t forget that electric mountain bikes can offer as much exercise as pedal mountain bikes). It’s about providing car alternatives that can help reduce traffic, reduce emissions, and push society toward embracing more walkable cities.That means you’re left with good old-fashioned commuter, hybrid, and comfort e-bikes for the $400 rebate, or electric cargo bikes for the $900 rebate (e-cargo bikes get an additional $500 rebate on top of the base level $400 rebate for all e-bikes outside of full-suspension electric mountain bikes).And lastly, the rebate is redeemable by purchasing through a number of local electric bike shops. There are currently around a dozen electric bike shops taking part, and they offer popular e-bike models like those from Aventon, Raleigh, Fattebikes, Trek, Electra, Pedego, REI, etc. Sure, it’d be nice to just order a $799 Lectric XP LITE e-bike online and get it for 50% off using the rebate, but that’s not going to happen. Instead, the Denver program is helping local businesses that sell e-bikes. And for this type of program, that makes sense. Many riders taking part will likely be new to e-bikes and so the support of a local dealer that can provide service and answer questions will be invaluable.More studies are showing the benefits of swapping out cars for space-efficient and energy-efficient e-bikes that can travel at similar car speeds in cities at a fraction of the cost. Simultaneously, more cities than just Denver are finding ways to help embrace the societal benefits of increasing accessibility to these important commuter tools.In fact, e-bike company Aventon maintains a list of various local electric bike incentives dotting the US right now. Having recently reviewed the company’s awesome new Aventon Soltera e-bike, I can see a prime target for applying some of these rebates.Shouldn’t your city be next?",ebikes
2022/04/27,"It’s a bit ironic that California-based electric bike maker Ride1Up’s name is now antithetical to its newest model, the Cafe Cruiser. Riding two-up is generally motorcycle speak for carrying a passenger on back. And that’s just what the Cafe Cruiser does, in addition to combining some sexy styling with a comfortable cruiser-inspired ride. And to top it all off, the bike has some darn good performance as well.This is Ride1Up’s first cruiser-ish electric bike, as the company has mostly focused on purpose-built commuter e-bikes in the past. The new model is not a full-blown stereotypical California cruiser as it maintains a number of commuter-friendly components like front suspension, fenders, rear rack, hydraulic disc brakes, built-in LED lighting, and the ability to carry your friend along with you on the back.But it still has the comfortable laid-back seating position and swept-back bars of a cruiser bike, not to mention the motorcycle-inspired top tank frame design to add a neat little accent to the bike’s top tube.As a mashup between a comfortable cruiser and a feature packed commuter electric bike, the Cafe Cruiser lives up to its name and throws in some seriously good performance too. Check it all out in my video review below, then read on for my complete thoughts on this awesome new electric bike.The beauty of the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser is that it rides like a relaxed cruiser bike, yet offers the performance of a fast and sportier-feeling electric bike. And as the rider, you have the ability to choose how you want to ride it each day based on your mood or needs.Crank it up into high pedal assist levels and hit 28 mph (45 km/h), or ease back and cruise effortlessly on the throttle at 20 mph (32 km/h). Or, drop it into lower pedal assist levels and get an easy-going workout by casually pedaling along the boardwalk or beach path. It’s got so much potential thanks to its high performance mixed with laid-back cruiser design.The pedal forward layout and wide saddle give you a comfortable and relaxed geometry, especially considering the swept back handlebars bring the grips right to you and allow you to stay nice and upright in the saddle instead of leaning forward.The hydraulic front suspension fork and big 26″ x 3″ balloon tires smooth out the ride for everything from boardwalks to nature trails. Those tires are more street optimized than anything, which means I didn’t make great progress while trying to ride through the fluffiest of Florida sugar sand, but more packed sand would likely be possible. Even so, the “cafe” part of the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser prevents it from being a more dedicated sand bike, and you’ll want to opt for a true fat tire bike if sand is your thing. But you’ll definitely be the king of the bike path on this thing – I sure am.With 750W of power (a true 750W, not just a peak-rated 750W), this makes the bike quite sporty. You don’t only get up to a high speed of 28 mph, but you get there quickly. And you’ve got the confidence of punchy hydraulic disc brakes to bring you back down to a stop quickly.I’ve got to give the company props on the lights, too. While many companies are still holding back lights as optional equipment or forgoing them altogether, the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser includes a powerful and high quality 80 lux front headlight and a highly visible rear tail light. These aren’t dinky, cheap lights either. They look and feel solid, as if they are designed to last for years (or as if Ride1Up doesn’t want them breaking off and then having to deal with warranty claims). The tail light is even protected by the frame-integrated rear rack, meaning it won’t get caught on obstacles around your garage or bike rack that could risk knocking it loose or snagging a wire.Speaking of the rear rack, that’s the “last but not least” big feature I want to talk about. Not only is the rack super sturdy since it is built into the frame itself (helping it achieve that massive 130 lb or 59 kg weight rating on the rack), but it’s the perfect mounting point for the passenger package. This awesome accessory from Ride1Up adds a rear bench seat onto the rack, plus fold out foot pegs and a clear wheel skirt so passengers don’t get their pant legs or skirt sucked into the rear wheel.Many companies have now started offering rear bench seats as part of passenger packages, but Ride1Up’s is the best one I’ve seen so far for one simple reason: it has a quick release to remove it. You see, with other passenger packages I’ve tried on competitors’ e-bikes, you have to bolt the bench seat onto the rack. That means if you want to access the rack again, such as for strapping down some cargo or adding a milk crate for temporary storage, you have to spend several minutes unbolting the bench seat. But the Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser’s rear seat has a spring-loaded quick release that allows you pop it on and pull it back off in about two seconds without any tools other than your fingers. It’s rock-solidly attached, but is still easy to remove! I love it!And the final kicker is the price, at just $1,595! I don’t know how Ride1Up has resisted increasing prices when so many other US-based electric bicycle companies have been walking up prices recently, but I’m also afraid to ask and ruin a good thing, like the kid who reminds the teacher that she forgot to assign homework. The Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser debuted at $1,595 when it went on pre-order late last year, and here we are four months later in an inflation-riddled economy where the only thing steady appears to be the price of Arizona Ice Tea and Ride1Up’s bikes.Other companies will sell you a lot less e-bike for a lot more money. With what you’re getting in this electric bike and what you’re paying, this is some crazy good value if I’ve ever seen it.",ebikes
2022/04/26,"Cooper Bikes, the company behind the Mini Cooper car, has just unveiled four new electric bicycle models that comprise the brand’s second generation e-bikes.Cooper Bikes is the two-wheeler division of Cooper Car Company, which was the original designer of the Mini Cooper, itself a segment of BMC’s iconic Mini.But while the Mini Cooper helped create a name for the company as far back as 1961, today it is Cooper Bikes that is stealing the headlines with four interesting new models.The new e-bikes are all designed for urban commuting and include the urban dropbar CR-7E Randonneur bike, the single-speed CS1E bike, plus the “Classic Gents” and Classic Ladies CG-7E and CL-7E bikes, respectively.The e-bikes all use the Zehus Gen2 electric bike drivetrain that includes a rear hub motor capable of regenerative braking. The company claims that the system has “unlimited range” thanks to its ability to recharge while the rider is pedaling, though this is a bit misleading. While theoretically possible, it is a very inefficient way to charge compared to simply recharging from a wall outlet. When the mode is engaged, it turns the e-bike into a bicycle that is even harder to pedal than a non-electric bicycle, slowly storing up energy through higher-resistance pedaling to later release as electric assist. It’d be like walking up two flights of stairs in order to generate enough electricity to power an escalator to later take you up one and a half flights of stairs.The more efficient way to ride it is to simply wall charge it like every other e-bike, and then use the regenerative braking ability to add around 5% more range to the battery as well as save on brake pad wear.Not that the brakes will have to work too strenuously as it is; the e-bikes are limited to European-legal top speeds of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). The light-duty performance matches the rather low power of the motor, with just 40 Nm of torque. The batteries aren’t exactly large either, coming in at just 173 Wh. Compare that to a more typical 600-700 Wh battery from other leading e-bike brands. But the location of the battery inside the rear hub motor necessitates that small size and results in the clean look of the bike. It’s a rarely used feature – housing the battery inside the motor wheel – but it certainly helps add to the bike’s aesthetic.The single-speed bike also gets a fancy Gates carbon belt drive system that adds to the sleek design, while the multi-speed bikes rely on a chain drive. There’s no display to take away from the clean lines, and instead riders can use a smartphone app to view ride data like battery life, distance, speed, etc.All of the bikes carry Brooks saddles, and all except the CR-7E have hydraulic disc brakes.Prices start at €2,399 including VAT (approximately US $2,570), and the bikes are said to become available “soon.”via: BikeRadar",ebikes
2022/04/25,"Lectric eBikes, the Phoenix-based electric bicycle company that has built its name on budget-priced electric bikes, opened orders today for its newest model: the Lectric XPremium. The recently-unveiled folding e-bike sets a new industry low-price for high-performance mid-motor e-bikes at just $1,799.While we’ve occasionally seen mid-drive electric bikes with lower sticker prices, they’re usually underpowered and come with limited speed and range.But the Lectric XPremium not only reaches Class 3 speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h) from an 800 watt peak-rated motor, but it also comes with two batteries for long range riding.The pair of 48V 10.4Ah batteries add up to a kilowatt-hour of capacity, which is around 50% more battery than the industry average. That results in a throttle-only range of around 50 miles or 80 km, or a pedal-assisted range of over twice that figure. An unlike most dual-battery electric bikes that charge several hundred dollars for the second battery, the XPremium features the dual packs as standard equipment.The mid-drive motor on the Lectric XPremium also includes a torque sensor, which means that pedal assist feels natural and intuitive since it is applied based on how hard the rider is pedaling at any instant. I know because I had the chance to take an early test ride on the bike, which you can see in my first ride video below.The pricing on the Lectric XPremium sent a shockwave around the industry when it was first announced due to its significant undercutting of most other high-power electric mid-drive e-bikes. But the move was par for the course at Lectric, since the brand is known for its budget-level prices.Lectric grew to stardom and developed a cult following for its Lectric XP 1.0 and Lectric XP 2.0 e-bikes, which were launched at just $899 and $999, respectively, while still offering maximum legal e-bike speeds.Last month the company debuted a lower performance but significantly lighter weight model known as the Lectric XP LITE, which was priced at just $799 and became one of the only 48V-based e-bikes at that price point.Both the Lectric XP 2.0 and the XP LITE were targeted at the lower end of the e-bike price range in order to appeal to bargain shoppers that still desired a higher performance option. But the Lectric XPremium’s higher performance and higher quality parts now usher Lectric into a more upmarket product class, competing more closely with $3,000 mid-drive e-bikes that similarly offer higher power motors, hydraulic disc brakes, oil-dampened suspension and other mid-to-upper tier features like the XPremium’s.Yet at just $1,799, Lectric eBikes has flipped the script on what these higher performance mid-drive e-bikes can cost, all while including parts like racks, fenders, and built-in LED lighting as standard equipment.Having tested the bike myself for an afternoon at Lectric’s Phoenix’s headquarters, the only real downside I could find was the heavy 75 lb weight. Other than that, the compact folding frame and powerful mid-mounted motor made it a blast to use. I was able to toss it in my rental car and drive around town to the best riding spots – something not very many fat tire e-bikes can do.I look forward to getting the chance to spend more time on the bike soon for a more in-depth review, but I can already give it two thumbs way up and proclaim it as the absolute best bang-for-your-buck mid-drive electric bike in the market, bar none.",ebikes
2022/04/24,"FREY Bike, the Jinhua, China-based high-end electric bicycle manufacturer, has just released a fat tire version of the company’s popular CC full-suspension electric comfort bike. The new FREY CC Fat takes the laidback and relaxed riding style of the original CC and opens the door to more off-road trail rides and diverse terrain with its massive tires.FREY Bike is known for building high-quality and high-powered electric mountain bikes that compete with $6-$8K European models, yet at around half the price. Unlike most of the company’s mountain-oriented e-bikes though, the CC model is all about comfortable cruising.The original FREY CC electric bike, which was released all the way back in 2019, became one of the most popular high-end full-suspension electric comfort bikes in the market – though the dearth of competitors certainly helped.Sure, electric comfort bikes are a dime a dozen. But nearly all use lower-tier components to achieve budget prices. That’s because most comfort e-bike shoppers aren’t looking for components designed for ruggedized downhill bikes.But overbuilt high-end electric mountain bikes and downhill bikes are exactly the kind of two-wheelers that FREY Bike specializes in, and so the company applied their unique take on full-suspension e-bikes to a comfort-oriented model. The end result was the commuter-friendly FREY CC.Now the company has returned with an updated model that doesn’t just tear up the streets, but is ready to take on the trails too. The new FREY CC swaps the street rubber for aggressive Maxxis 4″ fat tires that are designed to handle just about any terrain.The comfort frame and relaxed geometry remain though, offering a mid-step full-suspension frame with high-quality suspension. The front air fork features 140 mm of travel, while the rear gets a RockShox Monarch RL shock. Braking is accomplished via 4-piston Magura MT5e stoppers – some of the highest-quality and highest-power brakes in the e-bike industry. And a Shimano Alivio 9-speed drivetrain brings a mid-tier transmission to the bike with a healthy offering of gear ratios to help commuters and leisure riders alike find the right gear for each hill.But the real prize here is the Bafang Ultra M620 mid-drive motor, which is widely known to be highest power retail mid-drive e-bike motor on the market. Some specialty mid-drives are in the works that could take its crown, but until they reach production, the M620 is the king of the hill for high power. It peaks at 1,500W on the FREY CC Fat, though comes with a more modest 1,000W continuous power rating.To feed that energy-hungry motor is a frame-integrated 1,000Wh battery rated at 48V and 21Ah. A giant battery like that is the only way to get decent range out of such a powerful motor, unless riders can resist temptation and keep it in a lower power setting. If so, ranges of up 100 miles (160 km) can be possible on pedal assist. If tapping into max power on throttle though, even 30 miles (51 km) can be reasonably obtained – which is still quite a feat for such an energy-guzzling motor.FREY hasn’t published a top speed for the CC Fat, though many of the company’s e-bikes using this motor handily exceed 30 mph (51 km/h). I’ve personally hit over 35 mph (56 km/h) on FREY bikes before, though the CC’s fat tires might make the low 30s of miles per hour more likely.The FREY CC Fat is now taking pre-orders ahead of production commencing this July, but it doesn’t come cheap. The MSRP of $4,980 is knocked to just $4,480 for the first 50 bikes and $4,680 for the next 50.While that price is certainly much higher than most ordinary budget-level comfort e-bikes, the CC Fat is anything but ordinary. This motor combined with the higher-end suspension, brakes, battery, and other components cost significantly more than many other brands, not to mention the wave of price increases we’ve seen recently around the industry due to pricing pressures in the e-bike market.Hopefully we’ll get to test one of these beasts at some point. In the meantime though, you can check out my review of the standard FREY CC below to get a sense of what such a high-powered full-suspension comfort e-bike can do.",ebikes
2022/04/22,"Right after unveiling a new lower-cost folding e-bike two weeks ago, Phoenix-based Lectric eBikes is back with a new higher-end mid-drive electric bike known as the Lectric XPremium. The new folder is the brand’s first mid-drive e-bike and applies Lectric’s signature low-cost pricing to a much higher end electric bike than we’ve previously seen from the company.Coming in at a reasonable $1,799 introductory price, the Lectric XPremium has parts and performance that we’ve previously seen on $3,000+ electric bikes.For starters, the XPremium rocks a mid-drive motor that can reach speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h) thanks to its 500W continuous power rating and 800W peak rating. The included throttle allows the bike to operate in Class 1, 2 or 3 depending on the user-adjustable setting.The bike comes with two battery packs for double the range, letting riders travel longer distances, even at higher speeds (more on that in a moment).There’s also a torque sensor built into the motor that measures how hard the rider is pedaling, using that data to provide more intuitive pedal assist output. The nearly instantaneous response makes the bike more natural feeling to pedal. I was fortunate enough to receive the first test ride of the new Lectric XPremium ahead of the launch, which you can check out in my video below.While the $999 Lectric XP 2.0 has long been a bang-for-your-buck favorite in the e-bike industry and the newly released $799 Lectric XP LITE has taken the ultra-budget category by storm, the new Lectric XPremium is likely to help the company scoop up significant market share from riders looking for a higher-end mid-drive e-bike that still comes in at a budget price.The low-slung frame offers easy mounting and dismounting in a folding package that is perfect for anyone that needs to fold the bike up to fit in a smaller space. The bike also has a max weight rating of 150 kg (330 lb), so it should fit a wide range of riders while still maintaining extra capacity for cargo hauling.An integrated downtube battery plus the seat tube-mounted battery combine to offer extremely long range. Real world test data provided by the company show that with a 180 lb (82 kg) rider on flat ground, 50 miles  (80 km) of range is possible on throttle-only riding. In pedal assist level 2 (out of 5 levels), a range of 140 miles (225 km) is possible.I also like how the downtube battery is removable from the bike without having to fold it (unlike with the XP 2.0 or XP LITE).An 82mm travel front suspension fork doubles the travel of the Lectric XP 2.0’s front fork and combines with the true 4″ fat tires to offer a super cushy ride. Those tires are puncture resistant but will also come with pre-Slimed tires (thanks to a partnership between Lectric eBikes and Slime) for extra protection against flat tires. Anyone who wants to crank up the luxury ride feel even more can add the Comfort Package with a larger saddle and a suspension seat post to truly ride on a cloud.The fast and powerful Lectric XPremium includes hydraulic disc brakes for stronger and more reliable stoppers. The use of hydraulics also means less brake maintenance than cable-actuated mechanical disc brakes.The mid-drive motor is paired with a 7-speed transmission to make it even torquier and better able to climb hills at higher speeds.The Lectric XPremium includes the company’s “premium headlight” accessory as standard equipment, unlike the other bikes in Lectric’s lineup that can be upgraded to the higher end headlight. The bike’s tail lights also flash when the brakes are pulled, drawing extra attention when stopping.The bike comes with faux-leather ergonomic grips and is IP65 rated for better dust and water resistance.Having tested the bike myself for an afternoon ahead of the official launch, I can say that it rides great, and the mid-drive motor is really a thing of beauty. The motor is powerful, the fat tires and comfortable geometry make for a relaxed ride, and the brakes are super grippy. The only real complaint I came away with was that the bike was heavy as hell, coming in at 75 lb (34 kg) with the dual batteries; this definitely won’t be a fun one to pick up and carry around. But extra weight is the price you pay for a powerful mid-drive motor, big tires, long travel suspension and a pair of big batteries.Arriving fully assembled, the Lectric XPremium can be unboxed and ridden immediately. It will open for pre-orders soon at its $1,799 price and is available in either black or white colorways. I’ve heard from the company that the introductory price might not last too long though and could go up to $1,999 after the launch, so you may want to snatch it up before the price increases in the future.",ebikes
2022/04/21,"Electric cargo bikes, which are essentially normal electric bicycles with stretched frames for carrying more gear or passengers, are becoming increasingly popular as car alternatives in the US. The move follows a common trend in the electric bike industry that sees Americans tracking several years behind European e-bike industry currents. The last time much of the Electrek team was in Germany, we couldn’t help but notice the sheer number of electric cargo bikes rolling around every city we visited.  Whereas in the US you’re likely to see streets and parking lots lined with SUVs and minivans, many European cities instead host countless electric two- and three-wheelers toting around shopping bags and multiple children.Not to be outdone (at least not for more than a decade or so), Americans are now embracing a wave of increasingly accessible electric cargo bikes for utility tasks.In New York City, where electric bicycles were only recently legalized, cargo e-bikes with multiple kids aboard are becoming a more frequent sighting. City commuter Savannah Wiza explained to the NYT that the family began looking for a way to get their children to school in late 2020 after in-person learning returned. They ended up buying an electric cargo bike on Craigslist for $1,200 and have been using it for nearly two years as the family “school bus”.In the past, electric cargo bikes were most commonly available from high end companies like Yuba and Riese & Müller, often costing upwards of $5,000-$9,000.  But more affordable electric cargo bikes  – like the $1,999 RadWagon from Rad Power Bikes – have helped families with tighter budgets find their way onto stretched out e-bikes.I had the chance to test that e-bike out and enjoyed riding around with my two nephews on back, as you can see in my review video below.Other brands are also helping to lower prices on cargo e-bikes and bring these high-utility bikes to the masses. Tern’s GSD and HSD electric bikes have proven incredibly popular among urban residents seeking a large capacity cargo e-bike in a smaller form factor that takes up less space in a garage or apartment. But the high price tag of around $4,000-$6,000, due to parts like Bosch mid-motors, belt drive systems, and automatic transmissions have limited Tern’s reach to more affluent shoppers. Now, though, with the release of the new Tern Quick Haul electric cargo bike, the company is able to offer an e-bike with many of the same benefits starting at just $2,999.Low-cost companies have pushed the needle even further, such as when Lectric eBikes rolled out a cargo package for its $999 Lectric XP 2.0, adding massive front and rear baskets to a popular low-cost e-bike model.Even delivery companies have hopped onto the cargo e-bike bandwagon with FedEx, UPS, and DHL all testing out various forms of cargo electric bikes.In many urban areas, cargo e-bikes have been found to make quicker deliveries due to their ability to slice through traffic via the bicycle lanes.As electric cargo bikes become increasingly popular in the US, the growing movement towards personal electric transportation and walkable cities will continue to see cars replaced by smaller and more efficient alternatives.Could your commute or grocery run be next?",ebikes
2022/04/20,"It’s a nice break to ride a bike that’s made for someone my size. The Heybike Explore lands in the middle of a popular segment for electric bikes, being equipped for comfort, commuting, and a dash of off-road.  It’s honestly a lot of fun riding a bike that’s sized just right for papa-bear.I’m 6′ tall, with mildly long limbs and more often than I care to admit, I’m riding a bike made for a smaller rider (sometimes much smaller). Not today! Below we take a look at the Explore model, a full-sized versatile electric bike. The Explore model is genuinely equipped for the first time rider to explore their surroundings. There’s plenty of other mission specific bikes out there, but for the first time buyer (or maybe second) a versatile platform with a wide array of features will help broaden horizons and create a lifelong passion.Getting into commuting, the Explore is a great choice, as it’s already equipped with the essential accessories to get going that very day. On the rear of the bike is a thick rear rack, that can accept a variety of bags both on the side and on the top. The wide metal fenders are sturdy and expansive, providing real protection where others might be just for looks. The lighting system is bright and easy to use. On the front is a bright white LED (which also houses the horn), and on the rear is a wide red LED with brake light flashers as well.With these functions in place, the explore is ready to keep the rider protected from the elements, seen by motorists, and packed for work or adventure. And to top it off the Explore not only includes a water-bottle cage, but it was mounted on the bike at the factory, a nice touch.The HeyBike Explore can jump into light trail riding without an issue. It’s certainly not intended for downhill bombing, or long off-road trekking, but shortcuts and walking trails are a piece of cake for the Explore.Leading the bike is a pair of 26″ x 4″ fat tires, which can find grip on even the most loose of terrain. The fat tires also help with maintaining balance and comfort when obstacles are in the way. Also keeping control is a front suspension, which includes both a lockout and fine tuning with adjustable controls. While the Explore features Shimano 7-speed mechanical gearing, the use of this component is mostly for the road. Steep off-road climbs will require the use of pedal assist on the electric system.The Explore can ride in three different modes: full pedal power, electronic pedal assist, and full electric throttle. with 5 levels of pedal assist, clearly visible on the center display. The remote thumb switch is easy to use without taking eyes off the road, and the center display keeps the visuals right in the center of the handlebars. The Explore also has a throttle control, powering at the twist of the wrist. Powering the Explore is an efficient 750w brushless motor, that can take on most any hill. That large motor is met with a 48v 20Ah large capacity battery, packing nearly 1 kilowatt hour of energy (960wh). With this kind of power, the Explore could see 55 miles on full throttle, and 70 miles on pedal assist. Riding at full top speed of 28mph, the explore might see less range.Cruising back home is very comfortable with the Explore. The easy to mount step-through frame makes riding and stopping a stress-free experience for any rider. The suspension damping seat post, and wide saddle absorb the bumps and imperfections in the road, and the tires and fork add more luxury to the ride.To tease at a bit more of the HeyBike offerings, the front head-tube is equipped with front rack mounts, so that a front basket or platform can be added securely and natively.HeyBike has been a supporter of Electrek for some time, and we’re happy to participate in their upcoming anniversary sale.

2022/04/20,"Luna Cycle, the California-based electric bike company that has always shirked industry norms in favor of the path less traveled, has just launched an interesting new e-bike known as the Luna Eclipse.While many big-name electric bike companies have seen their prices rise in recent months, Luna’s newest model is now the brand’s most affordable yet at just $1,395.The Luna Eclipse is also the first hub motor electric bike from Luna Cycle, which has previously favored mid-drive motors in the brand’s high-performance electric bikes.But just because the Eclipse gets a lower-cost hub motor in back, don’t think that this isn’t a powerhouse worthy of Luna’s eccentric label. The bike likely has more mass market appeal, but it’s still a beast that can hit speeds of 25 mph (40 km/h) thanks to 1,000W of power from that Bafang hub motor in rear.The motor is wrapped in a 20″ fat tire, helping make the bike smaller and more nimble while adding a bit more all-terrain style riding to its repertoire. Though with those urban tires that are bordering on racing slick territory, perhaps the bike is better kept on the tarmac.The smaller wheel diameter with those 20″ tires also makes the bike torquier, and Luna specifically says that it is geared for higher torque and better hill climbing.A large 48V and 14Ah battery made from quality LG MJ1 battery cells should give riders plenty of range. Luna doesn’t have exact range measurements, but 20-25 miles (32-40 km) on throttle or twice that on low-power pedal assist are likely reasonable figures for flat land cruising.Other major US-based e-bike companies have pushed out non-suspension e-bikes lately that cost more than Luna’s latest model, but the Eclipse seems like it came loaded to the teeth and ready to fight. Not only does it feature full-suspension (both front and rear suspension feature four inches of travel), but the bike even swaps out the old-fashioned chain for a Gates belt drive.Gates belt drives have a number of advantages over chains, including that they last for tens of thousands of miles, are essentially maintenance-free, and don’t get your pants legs or ankle oily. Oh, and for anyone who likes to stash their e-bike in a car to take it to the local trails, the Luna Eclipse is also a folder. That gives it extra utility for riders who live in an apartment or need to fold up their e-bike to save on space while riding public transportation.While Luna is more commonly known for its high-performance e-bikes like the $4,200 Luna X2, the Eclipse is angling to become the brand’s first massively popular e-bike for the common man. Something of the Model T on two wheels, but with a few nicer parts thrown in for good measure.The Eclipse is available now on Luna’s site in either Matte Black or Silver color options. While black and dark colorways have been a mainstay at Luna, that silver edition looks pretty darn good to me.What do you think of Luna’s first entry into the hub motor electric bicycle market? How does the Eclipse stack up against other folding e-bikes in its price class? Let’s hear your opinion in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/04/19,"Santa Cruz-based electric bicycle company Blix has launched its new Blix Ultra as the brand’s first fat tire off-road adventure e-bike. But true to its roots, Blix’s new e-bike looks like it’d make a great commuter or urban assault e-bike as well.The Blix Ultra sports a 750W continuous-rated rear hub motor wrapped in a four-inch wheel and tire, putting out 90Nm of torque. Despite the 750W sticker, the company says that the peak power rating of the motor is actually 1,350 watts.That’s just shy of two horsepower. And with five levels of pedal assist, the bike can reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist, or 20 mph (32 km/h) with the included throttle.Supplying that powerful motor is a single or dual battery setup of 48V 14.5Ah batteries. Riders that opt for two batteries will have a maximum of 80 miles (130 km) of range from 1,344 Wh of battery capacity. Even with a single battery though, this e-bike still packs in plenty of capacity for longer rides.Speaking of capacity, the batteries aren’t the only high-capacity parts on the bike. The Blix Ultra is designed for high-capacity cargo hauling too, rated for 150 lb in the rear and 50 lb in the front (68 kg and 23 kg, respectively). The modular design of the bike means that riders can swap on all sorts of cargo accessories to take advantage of those weight capacities for hauling gear or kiddos in back. One passenger-specific accessory that will likely become a crowd favorite is a passenger package that includes rear foot pegs and a wheel guard to keep wandering feet out of the spokes. Many e-bikes have added passenger packages to their designs, making it easier than ever to carry more than one person on an electric bike.The combined off-road ability and cargo-hauling features of the Ultra are exactly what Blix was going for, as founder and CEO Pontus Malmberg explained:The Ultra concept was to design an all-terrain e-bike that is practical enough to fit into your day, furthering our mission to integrate health and activity into everyday life. This is the most capable and versatile e-bike we’ve built, and it will bring a lot of value and differentiation to the table.Other nice features seen on the bike include hydraulic disc brakes, an 80mm travel front suspension fork, an eight-speed transmission, and an 80-Lux headlight. That’s a lot of eights!The frame also features a drop section just forward of the seat post. It may not be a full step-thru, but at least it’s not going to leave you singing in the boys choir if you stop short and need to scoot forward off the seat.Connectivity on the bike is available through the Blix Connect smartphone app that interfaces with the bike’s display. Riders can access ride data, a community feed, and over-the-air firmware updates when needed. They’ll also be able to switch between Class 2 and Class 3 e-bike modes through the app.As Pontus continued:Connectivity is central in Blix product strategy and unlocks a whole new level of user experience and product improvementsThe Blix Ultra is now taking pre-orders and is expected to begin shipping in July of this year. The bike is priced at either $1,999 for the single battery model or $2,399 for the dual battery model.",ebikes
2022/04/18,"California-based Vintage Electric builds beautifully styled, high-power electric bicycles unlike any other on the market. And just to make sure they retain their crown of individuality in the power department, they’ve stepped it up another notch with the highest performance e-bikes they’ve made yet. These new e-bikes tout a 72V electrical system for extreme speed and power.To be fair, the “bicycle” part of “electric bicycle” is stretching the limits of linguistics here. Technically, Vintage’s new 72V e-bikes qualify as electric bicycles since they ship in street legal mode in the United States. That means they are limited to 20 mph (32 km/h) out of the box, and the motor comes with an electronically limited 750W street mode.But that 750W label requires a wink so strong you might pull an eyebrow muscle. As soon as you pop these babies into Race Mode, the motor suddenly turns into a 4,000W beast.That’s enough for speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h), or twice the out-of-the-box speed.As with many e-bike companies that walk the legal line of high-power electric bicycles, Race Mode is intended for use on private property, trails, abandoned airstrips, or derelict sections of highways that have been retired and wiped from the map – basically anywhere but public streets.No one is watching over your shoulder to make sure you’re actually on a disused airstrip, but if you were, the bike seems to have the technical muster to meet the performance figures on its spec sheet.The 72V battery is rated for 1,152 Wh, making it one of the largest factory-installed battery options in the e-bike market. We’ve occasionally seen companies push the 1 kWh mark, but it does’t happen often. The battery also comes with a high-power charger that claims a recharge time of just three hours.On the bike side of things, that 4,000W motor includes regenerative braking via the rear brake lever and is tied into a single-speed pedal drivetrain with a rather small 39T chain ring. Don’t expect to add much pedaling power at 40 mph – your feet would be spinning like a food processor.You do get a torque sensor though, so your pedaling force will at least get accurately translated into proportional pedal assist. I imagine most riders will be making ample use of the throttle, especially on a bike that looks this much like a vintage motorcycle.The 81 lb (36.7 kg) bike itself has an aluminum frame and an inverted front suspension fork, plus hydraulic disc brakes and a pretty sweet-looking head light.Three styles are available including a Roadster, Sportster, and Shelby. The last one came out of a licensing agreement with Shelby of Shelby Cobra fame, which we first learned about a few years back. That’s also fitting, since this bike seems like the electric bicycle equivalent of stuffing a massive 427 motor into a previously underpowered British race car.Electrek’s own Seth Weintraub had the chance to test out some of Vintage’s rides back before the new high voltage 72V line came out, and even back then he was already praising their power, not to mention their great looks. You can read out about his experiences here.But as you can imagine, with more power comes a higher sticker price. The new high voltage bikes start at $6,995, so don’t expect to pick one up for cheap. But if I had $7k to blow and had to choose between this or a 250W European e-bike that weighs less than a loaf a bread, I think you guys know which one I’d choose. Speaking of which, I should probably update my life insurance policy …",ebikes
2022/04/17,"I know, I know. The whole “Don’t like gas prices? Ride a bike!” sounds annoying and feels impractical for most people. But if you weren’t already aware, there’s a much more practical alternative to conventional pedal bikes: fun and energy-efficient electric bikes! Now more than ever, with gas prices rising steeply and uncertain fuel prospects on the horizon, perhaps it’s time to give an electric bike a second thought.Look, if you can pedal for your entire commute, that’s awesome. Go for it! But the simple fact is that very few car commuters have the patience or physical stamina to trade their car commute for a pedaling slog on an old-school 21-speed. But electric bikes have seen huge success convincing drivers to make the switch to two wheels. E-bikes basically take the pain out of cycling, turning a long and arduous bike ride into a shorter, faster, and funner joyride. While most e-bikes have a pedal assist feature that gives you a helpful push while you provide a portion of the pedaling, many (at least in the US) also have hand throttles that allow them to be ridden like mopeds, no pedaling required. Pedaling is great for exercise, and it’s awesome that e-bikes provide that option. But sometimes you just need to get to work quickly, and that’s where a low-cost e-bike with a hand throttle can be a nice alternative.The savings at the pump are impressive. The US national average gasoline price per gallon was US $4.32 today. Depending on your car, that might take you anywhere from 20-50 miles.But on an electric bike? That same US $4.32 will take you over 2,000 miles. That’s because it is ridiculously cheap to charge an electric bicycle, and they are ridiculously efficient. You likely won’t even notice a difference in your electricity bill from owning an electric bike – they simply barely use any energy.Don’t believe me? Here’s the math. Considering a US national average electricity price of $0.10 kWh and an average e-bike efficiency of around 20 Wh/mile, that works out to roughly $0.002 per mile, or 5 miles for one cent of electricity. If you’re an urban commuter and you drive a 5-mile commute, you could do it on an electric bike for the cost of just one sticky penny wedged in the bottom of your car’s cupholder. Then consider the savings in parking fees, insurance, car payments, wear and tear on the car, etc. Many people have taken advantage of these savings by transforming from two-car families to one car and one e-bike families. Some have even given up cars altogether in favor of e-bikes, saving tens of thousands of dollars. For example, a woman in San Francisco calculated that over seven years, she saved $50,000 by switching to an electric bike.Sure, there are plenty of very nice electric bikes out there. Prices can easily balloon into the several thousand-dollar range. I’ve tested many of these expensive e-bikes, and yes, you actually get a better bike for the price.But if the goal is to save money, then you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars. There are also great options on the more affordable end of the spectrum. And depending where you live, they may pay for themselves in a matter of months. You’ll of course have to price this out for yourself, but with a tank of gas approaching $60-$100 right now depending on your tank size, you can see how quickly an e-bike can pay for itself.Then consider other factors like the price of parking. In San Francisco where parking averages $350 per month, a $1,000 electric bike can pay for itself in less than three months! Even if you have an electric car, the price of parking alone can be a great reason to switch to an e-bike for many trips.And fortunately there are plenty of good e-bikes that can be had for a solid price. I generally recommend avoiding anything under $600 or so, as the e-bikes are largely disposable at that price level. But from around $800 to $1,300 or so is a sweet spot for high bang-for-your-buck electric bikes.I recently compiled some of the best electric bicycles that I’ve tested at every price level (from well over 100 e-bikes over the last couple years), but below I’ll share some of the best budget options that would be great for alleviating pain at the pump without requiring a huge initial outlay.Lectric XP 2.0 ($999): This is one of my favorite bang-for-your-buck e-bikes right now. It can hit fast speeds of up to 28 mph, has a pretty decent range of at least 20 miles (though many e-bikes can go farther), and comes with front suspension, rear rack, fenders, lights, and more included as standard equipment. Plus the folding nature means you can also take it on the bus or keep it in the trunk of your car if you want to drive to the city outskirts then ride the last few miles, saving gas and parking fees. Check out my full review here.Lectric XP LITE ($799):The Lectric XP LITE is the baby brother to the Lectric XP 2.0 from above. It’s not quite as good of a bike, but it might actually be the better option for some riders. It still gets good performance, including a 20 mph top speed and a range up to 40 miles on pedal assist. But it has an 18% smaller battery than the XP 2.0 so the throttle only range isn’t as good – perhaps just 15 miles if you ride it really hard. Though if you only need to go 15 miles or less (which is true for most urban residents), then this might be the ticket for you. It’s also a single-speed bike without suspension, so you’re giving up a couple of the nicer features from the XP 2.0. But if you’re alright with a single-speed, it will reward you with a much lighter 46 lb weight. It’s also smaller when fully folded, meaning its even easier to lift and stuff in a car trunk or back seat. It’s definitely worth a look if you’re trying to get an awesome e-bike for under $800. You can see my full review here.Ride1Up Roadster V2 ($1,045): This one doesn’t have a throttle, but the strong pedal assist means that the motor will help you hit speeds of up to 25 mph as long as you’ll do a bit of the pedaling yourself. The bike is super lightweight for an e-bike at just 32 lb. It is a single-speed and uses a belt drive, meaning you’ll never have to deal with chain issues or maintenance. The ride has more of a forward leaning, sporty road bike feel. That will be great for some people, but others may prefer a relaxed and upright ride. You can get a more relaxed riding position on the company’s $1,399 Ride1Up 500 Series, if that’s your thing. Check out my full review here.Rad Power Bikes RadMission ($1,199): The RadMission is a more conventional metro-style e-bike, which might feel more familiar to many new and returning riders. It can reach a top speed of 20 mph and travel for between 20-40 miles, depending on whether you plan to help pedal or not. Plus it is fairly lightweight compared to most e-bikes at just 47 lb. It’s a single-speed, but it seems to work well on modest hills too. Rad also released a new e-bike recently known as the RadExpand 5. It has similar performance specs (though a bit more range from a larger battery), yet comes in a step-through folding frame with fat tires. At $1,499, it’s a bit more expensive but might be more of the ride type that you’re looking for. Check out my full review here.Aventon Soltera ($1,199): The Aventon Soltera is a surprisingly high-quality e-bike for the price. It features a 20 mph top speed and a very nicely integrated battery that hides away in the frame, yet is still removable for charging. It’s also a very forward-leaning posture city e-bike, but comes with more city-centric features like built-in tail lights directly in the frame. There’s a throttle and pedal assist, plus the bike is available in single-speed or 7-speed. Check out my full review here.There are so many good e-bikes out there in a wide range of prices that there is almost surely something for everyone. But if you’re on a tight budget and trying to get started for cheap, these are excellent options to get you rolling efficiently.",ebikes
2022/04/15,"When Ride1Up first unveiled the Prodigy electric bicycle, it shocked many in the industry. The combination of a full-featured commuter electric bike with a high-end German mid-drive motor is nothing new, but selling it for just $2,295 was unheard of.Now after several industry delays, the bikes are finally heading to riders’ driveways, ushering in a new era of affordable higher-end electric bicycles.Mid-drive electric bikes, which mount the motor near the pedals and power the bike through it’s existing geartrain, offer a more natural riding experience and better hill-climbing performance but at a higher cost than cheaper hub motors.We’ve of course seen affordable mid-drive e-bikes before, but they’re generally built with lower tier motors.E-bikes with motors from the fancy European manufacturers like Bosch and Brose generally cost a premium, usually in the $3k-$6k range.But San Diego-based Ride1Up, which has long prided itself on offering affordably-priced yet high performance commuter electric bikes, has managed to deliver a Brose-powered high-speed electric bike for just $2,295.Perhaps even more impressively, the price has remained the same since it was unveiled early last year, despite rising pricing pressures in the industry that have seen other companies walk up their prices.The Ride1Up Prodigy was first unveiled last January, before the company opened up pre-orders last summer.Supply chain issues and shipping constraints have affected all major e-bike companies and pushed back delivery times considerably, forcing some companies like Rad Power Bikes to get creative and charter their own container ships.While the delivery of the Ride1Up Prodigy was delayed, pre-order customers should be happy to know the bikes are now shipping out to homes across the US. New orders are estimated to ship within 1-2 weeks.Just in time for riding season in much of the country, the power 28 mph (45 km/h) class 3 e-bikes are designed for both commuting and recreational/fitness riding.The bike comes in both a step-through and step-over variant complete with fenders and rear rack, or riders can opt for the XC mountain bike version with knobby tires and rack/fender delete in favor of a suspension fork over a commuting fork.All models have the Brose TF Sprinter German-made mid-drive motor with a whopping 90 Nm of torque, Tektro hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm rotors, 500 Wh frame-integrated and removable batteries for 30-50 miles (50-80 km) of range, nine-speed Shimano drivetrain, color LCD TFT display on the handlebars, and built-in LED lights (only head light on the XC mountain bike).While the commuter/leisure-spec models are priced at $2,295, the XC mountain bike version has a $100 premium.With any luck, other companies will take note and Ride1Up can help usher in a new wave of lower-priced mid-drive e-bikes with higher quality European-made motors. Or if not, I’m sure they’ll be happy to have the affordable mid-drive market all to themselves.",ebikes
2022/04/13,"Last week we broke the news that Fiido X electric bikes suffered from a design flaw in the magnesium frame’s folding mechanism, resulting in multiple bikes breaking in half. Now the Hong Kong-based company has announced its solution, which involves a major redesign to the bike and replacements for riders.The original Fiido X folding e-bike featured an ultra-sleek frame with a minimalist folding mechanism in place of the normally bulky and ugly folding joints on most other folding e-bikes.As it turns out, the design was overly minimalist to the point where it wasn’t structurally sound.The company’s replacement plan was just announced today:As of April 13, 2022, Fiido officially launches the recall and upgrade of all Fiido X folding electric bike which manufactured between September 2021 and March 2022, a total of 2,989 units.

Fiido official after sales service team will directly contact all affected customers advising them to make an appointment with support team, free product recall services and corresponding user protection plan will be carried out.Fiido has now reworked the X’s design, creating the Fiido X V2, which will come with a three-year frame warranty after the new design was laboratory tested to “achieve two times the test standard of EN19154.” In addition to an improved folding mechanism design, the new Fiido X V2 will also feature improved Shimano transmission, upgraded handlebar display, improved keypad and bar grips, and a redesigned magnetic locking system for when the bike is folded.Fiido has now announced that all affected customers will receive either a new upgraded Fiido X V2, a different Fiido e-bike model of equal value, or for riders who need a quick replacement for daily commuting, another currently available Fiido e-bike model of lesser value, plus a refund of the difference in cost. The entire recall plan can be seen here.As part of the recall, riders will need to remove the locking latch for the battery/seat post on the rear of the frame, as well as the bolt-on dropout at the rear of the bike. These two small parts will need to be mailed back to Fiido, demonstrating that the bike has been effectively “destroyed” and rendered unusable in the future.Riders waiting for an updated Fiido X V2 with an improved folding mechanism design have been told that the new bike model will ship from the factory in June or July of this year. Riders trading in their Fiido X1 for a similarly priced Fiido D11, M1 Pro, D21, or T1 should see their new e-bikes ship from the factory by June . Riders swapping out for an L3 or D3 Pro and partial refund will see their replacement bike ship in the next two weeks from Fiido’s US and EU-based warehouses.The company appears to have taken the safety issue seriously, quickly stopping sales and redesigning the product while simultaneously developing a replacement plan for affected riders, all in under 10 days.Electrek spoke with Fiido’s CTO Keven Wang this morning, who shared how the team has been working night and day on everything from the failure analysis to the recall plan.As he explained:After receiving the feedback on April 3rd, the entire Fiido team attached great importance to and quickly implemented the solution. The Fiido product laboratory immediately conducted more rigorous testing. After the failure reappeared on April 8th, we immediately announced that all users stopped using it, meanwhile, closing all Fiido X sales channels. Because we, like our users, put safety first. Although the FIIDO X V1 version has passed the relevant tests of EN15194 on this product, we did not fully consider the correlation between the strength test and the transportation environment. This will also be one of the key improvements in our future work. Although this recall will let FIIDO face an unprecedented financial crisis, responsibility and credibility are more important to us. Fortunately, our missteps haven’t caused anything more serious. Fiido hopes to regain everyone’s faith with our honesty and responsible attitude. The occurrence of this incident is an alert to us. We will hang the broken FIIDO X on the wall of the R&D department and let it remind us how to design products.",ebikes
2022/04/12,"Rad Power Bikes, the leading electric bicycle company in North America, is restructuring its operations to cut costs and double down on the customer experience of its hundreds of thousands of e-bike riders.Helping to lead new changes, Rad Power Bikes has also onboarded a new president and chief operating officer Phil Molyneux, who previously served as president and COO of Sony Electronics and President of Dyson America.The moves come as electric bike companies in the US have faced rising costs on everything from raw materials to parts to shipping.When you’re the largest e-bike company in the country, those costs stack up even higher. To its credit, Rad Power Bikes has gotten creative at finding ways to keep pumping out thousands of electric bikes per day and maintain stock of its fast-selling e-bikes. The company has gone as far as chartering its own vessels when other smaller e-bike brands were still struggling to find shipping containers and space on cargo ships.Now Rad is going even further to focus on streamlining the customer experience. And one of those major cost-cutting measures is the closing down of Rad Mobile in favor of enriching the online shopping experience as well as opening more Rad Power Bikes retail stores.As Rad Power Bikes founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh explained in a call with Electrek:We’re focusing on resetting the business, on our strategy, and on putting us on a sustainable path for the long term as we operationally mature.Instead of a Rad e-bike mechanic in a van making house calls to service e-bikes or deliver them fully assembled, Rad instead wants to provide more physical retail locations where customers can receive service/support, test-ride different e-bike models, and explore accessories on their bikes before making a purchase.Rad Power Bikes already operates physical stores up and down the West Coast of the US in Seattle and two California stores in Berkeley and San Diego.Now Rad Power Bikes is announcing five more stores to open this year, including locations in Salt Lake City, Huntington Beach, Dallas, Brooklyn, and St. Petersburg. With the opening of the New York and Florida stores, Rad is expanding its retail presence to the East Coast and all four corners of the country. The company is working on quickly increasing the number of physical locations even further, underscoring its goal of providing both an online and in-person shopping experience for customers.While Rad Mobile will be ending, Rad’s mobile service partners will continue to work with the company to provide that mobile service for customers who don’t live near a Rad location.As Rad’s new president and COO Phil Molyneux explained to Electrek:Our US customers will continue to have access to mobile support from out our partner services like Velofix and Beeline. They understand our mission to reduce cars in our communities and get more people on bikes, it’s part of their DNA. And these are partners we’ve grown up with over the past years and we know they will continue to provide great service to our customers.Radenbaugh further explained that the move is aimed to more efficiently use Rad’s resources in the face of increasing industry challenges:What we wanted to do was reduce costs across the business wherever that didn’t impact the customer experience. And our third-party partners have expanded greatly in coverage and capacity, and they provide a lot of preferential support for Rad Power Bikes because of the size of our community and the close-knit relationship we’ve built with them.Rad is also committed to continuing to grow its team. While around 100 Rad Mobile positions will be closing, a higher number of new positions will be opening at Rad’s new retail locations.Another new change will be the way customers will be able to virtually build their e-bikes online, as Molyneux described further:We are putting resources behind building an industry-leading e-commerce experience, including a feature that will allow customers to see what their bikes will look like with various combinations of accessories, as well as new functionality that allows easier sizing, better frame selection and a more in-depth visual.Rad is known to have the largest selection of e-bike accessories, covering everything from rain kit to cargo gear to illumination and even a plethora of pet-carrying accessories for riding with a four-legged friend. The new online tool will make it easier for customers to virtually test different combinations of loadouts on their e-bikes to see how they’ll look before making a buying decision.Ultimately, the changes are designed to further invest in the way customers react with Rad, as Molyneux explained:We’re all about continuing to focus on the customer experience and elevate our capabilities. We’re continuing to invest there and I think we have a very bright future to build.I must say that I’ll be sad to see the Rad Mobile service go. It was incredibly convenient and I used the service several times. But I get that not only is it hard to make it sustainable, but it’s also not Rad’s core competency. Rad is about getting as many butts on bikes as possible, not operating a sprawling mobile van network. There are companies like Velofix that specialize in it, and they do it well. As a matter of fact, I use Velofix myself and happen to already have a Velofix appointment on Friday for a different bike. So I’m sure they’ll keep Rad’s customers serviced in areas where Rad’s stores haven’t reached.But it’s those Rad stores that are the bigger prize here. With Rad’s massive scale and massive funding, opening more retail stores seems like a prudent investment. The hardest part of buying an e-bike online is the uncertainty of knowing how the bike will fit and feel. With Rad now expanding into massive population centers around the country, I’m excited to see the company giving more people that experience. And the fact that they’ll have a service center nearby will of course make that buying choice that much easier.",ebikes
2022/04/11,"The team over at Phoenix, Arizona-based Lectric eBikes has just launched their newest and most affordable electric bicycle yet: the Lectric XP LITE. At just $799, it packs in much of what riders already loved about the brand’s flagship Lectric XP 2.0 folding e-bike, yet shaves off some serious dollars and poundage.The Lectric XP 2.0 has spent years as the leading affordable electric bike in the United States. Riders have long praised its balance of performance and comfort at a super-reasonable $999 price.When the original XP was launched and then followed by the XP 2.0, Lectric eBike co-founder Levi Conlow told me that he was convinced that it would soon face competition from the other US-based major e-bike companies. “I was sure that Rad and the other big guys were going to immediately come out with a bike that was priced low enough to compete with us. So I pretty quickly worked up this design for an even more affordable e-bike to top them.” But as years went by and no low-cost challengers arose, Levi finally decided that they shouldn’t just sit on the design anymore. If no one else would compete with Lectric to push prices even lower, they’d just do it themselves. And thus, the Lectric XP LITE was born, coming in at just $799.Levi and his co-founder/childhood friend Robby Deziel invited me out to Phoenix recently to see the Lectric XP LITE e-bike in person and put some miles on one of the first units off the line. After just one afternoon with the bike, I can already tell you that this is the #1 electric bike I will recommend to anyone shopping on a tight budget. If I’ve learned one thing about low-cost e-bikes, it’s that there’s a lot of junk in the $500-$800 e-bike category. But the XP LITE is finally a ray of light – a quality offering at a super low price. It may not have the same high performance as the XP 2.0, but the LITE version still offers way more than any other e-bike in its price range.Take a look at my test ride video below to watch as I get my first ever ride on this new budget e-bike.The Lectric XP LITE keeps much of what makes the XP 2.0 so well loved then chucks anything extra to cut down on extra cost and weight.For example, it’s still a class 2 e-bike with a 20 mph top speed and a twist throttle to get you there without pedaling (though of course you can ignore or remove the throttle and use the pedal assist to ride it as a class 1 e-bike). The nominally 300W motor actually puts out 720W of peak power, so it’s got decent pep, despite not being a powerhouse. I did some uphill riding on grassy knolls and it was up to the task. I’m not sure how it would do in San Francisco, but moderate hills were not a problem.It’s also got a minimalist folding frame that keeps the bike at a mere 46 lb (20.8 kg). That’s not light by folding-bike standards, but it sure is light by folding electric bike standards!Then you’ve got your backlit LCD display with giant visible readout, 160 mm disc brakes, integrated lights, IP65 water resistant build, etc. All of it is backed by a US-based company with local shipping and a team of young Arizonans manning the customer support phone lines and email/chat boxes. You just can’t get that with pretty much any other ultra-budget electric bike these days.Now there are some compromises here, to be fair. For example, this is a single-speed e-bike, so there’s no multi-speed transmission to run through the gears. But with that 720W peak-rated motor, you likely won’t need to downshift when climbing up hills.And there’s no suspension, which brings us back to the Lectric XP 1.0 days when a rigid fork kept the weight down and longevity up.The tires are also narrower at 2.6 inches wide. So, this is a more urban-oriented electric bike, though that didn’t stop me from doing some off-road riding in parks (see my video above). The lack of suspension means that rutted out grassy areas will give you a bit of a shock, but the bike is still powerful enough and rugged enough to handle it, as long as your body is equally capable.The last compromise is the XP LITE’s smaller battery. It’s small in terms of capacity, but it’s still a relatively high voltage system at 48V, which makes this likely the most affordable 48V e-bike on the market. Even so, the Ah rating is just 7.8, for a total of 375 Wh. That’s not a huge battery by any stretch of the imagination. They claim a maximum range of 45 miles (72 km), but that’s with serious pedaling effort on your part. For throttle-only riding, 15–25 miles is a more realistic real-world figure.So, the bike isn’t perfect. It lacks the 28 mph speed of the XP 2.0 and the larger battery, suspension, and 7-speed shifter. But it’s smaller, 20 pounds lighter, easier to move around, more nimble, and of course even more affordable. And it comes in four color options, which is a fun little bonus over the black and white options for the XP 2.0.Plus, the Lectric XP LITE can even take advantage of much of the same ecosystem of accessories like the racks and baskets, upgraded lights, comfort package, pre-slimed tires for automatically-sealing tires, etc. Including fenders and rack would have been a nice touch, but I find it hard to complain about missing accessories when the base price is just $799. They did give us an LED headlight and tail light, which is more than I can say for so many e-bikes these days that hold out on lights.Now just because this is a pretty awesome price point doesn’t imply this e-bike is for everyone. The narrower tires and lack of suspension mean it isn’t going to be as adventure-friendly as the wider tire and front-suspended XP 2.0. And, the smaller battery won’t let the rides last quite as long as other e-bikes with bigger batteries, though the medium power level will help the battery last longer than a higher power motor would have allowed.So, if you’re power hungry or want the most comfortable ride out there, this likely isn’t the bike for you. But as long as “normal” bike tires (i.e. not ridiculously fat tires) are acceptable and you can get by with 20 mph speeds and modest power, the XP LITE offers a truly fun ride. The bike feels like you should have paid much more for it, that’s for sure.I look forward to getting more time on the bike for a complete review. But after just one afternoon of riding, I’m pretty darn smitten with the XP LITE. And, I’ve got a feeling you’ll love it too. At this price, there’s just no point in going with some off-brand anymore.",ebikes
2022/04/11,"Massive electric two-wheeler manufacturer OKAI has just launched its first consumer-oriented electric bicycle, the OKAI Stride. And for a first consumer e-bike, it comes with surprisingly nice performance specs like an industry-leading speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). If you’ve ever ridden a shared electric scooter or e-bike like those from Lime, Bird, or countless other manufacturers, you’ve probably ridden an OKAI-manufactured product without even knowing about it.The company has recently branched out from only producing light electric vehicles for other brands to actually producing under its own label as well.That means it is combining its massive manufacturing prowess with its experience building ruggedized personal EVs designed to withstand serious abuse.Now we’re getting our first look at the fruits of that labor, namely the OKAI Stride electric bike.The OKAI Stride is powered by a 750W rear hub motor from Bafang that blasts the e-bike up to a maximum speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).The company claims a maximum range of 40 miles (64 km) in low power mode. However, they offer more realistic figures of a throttle-only range of 25 miles (40 km), and a pedal assist range at higher power of 30 miles (51 km). Those numbers seem to jive somewhat better with the 48V and 460 Wh battery.OKAI says they use LG cells in the removable battery, and they claim the battery can be swapped out in one second. That must require some mighty fast fingers, but even if the battery takes a few seconds for the clumsier among us, I’ll still hand it to them for what looks like a slick design.The 64 lb (29 kg) e-bike features a step-through frame for easier mounting and comes with a Shimano 7-speed transmission as well as Tektro mechanical disc brakes. There’s no suspension, which is likely a nod toward its city use as well as OKAI’s experience building rugged bikes with few parts that can break down.The wheels are 27.5 inch and include fenders for splash protection.There’s an interesting color display built into the head cap that also interacts with an NFC chip in the physical key used to unlock the battery. Simply tap the key fob to the display to electronically lock and unlock the bike, adding another layer of theft deterrence. That color display is also customizable via the OKAI app, so you can change the skins to make the display look more agreeable to you.The app also allows you to make other adjustments to the bike, including locking the bike, activating the lights, adjusting the ride mode, modifying the regenerative braking power, and locating the bike on a map. Other historical data functions include tracking previous rides and running diagnostics, in addition to displaying current ride data.The OKAI Stride is now available in the US for $1,599, with shipping said to be available immediately.We recently had the chance to meet some of the OKAI team in person and check out their rides at the 2021 Eurobike show. You can see them at 8:13 in the video below.",ebikes
2022/04/09,"CAKE may be best known for its stylish and highly-designed electric motorcycles. But the company’s latest teaser today seems to imply that a lighter electric two-wheeler is in the cards for the brand’s next model.It’s hard to say exactly what CAKE is working on, as the image is zoomed in to show just two frame members welded at a sharp angle.But those two frame members appear to use tubes that are narrower than those seen on CAKE’s larger electric motorbikes and e-mopeds.They also join at an angle that quite closely matches with the top tube and down tube of a bicycle frame. The teaser image also includes the following caption:“The product line expanding, pre-launch starts soon. The new bikes are developed for a new user matrix, supporting the CAKE mission: To speed up the journey towards a zero emission society, combining excitement with responsibility.”A post shared by CAKE • Electric Motorbikes⚡️ (@ridecake)A move even further into light electric vehicles like electric bicycles would make sense for CAKE.After getting its start with electric dirt bikes, CAKE rolled out street legal versions followed by lower speed electric motorbikes and then even smaller and more muted electric mopeds.So continuing the trend of releasing even smaller and lighter two-wheeled EVs could eventually bring the brand to a true electric bicycle.As a European manufacturer though, CAKE would be limited to European e-bike laws when selling on its own continent. That means low-power 250W motors and a paltry speed of 15.5 mph (25 km/h).In the US, CAKE’s e-bikes could potentially feature three times that power level and nearly twice the speed, up to 28 mph (45 km/h).Though this assumes CAKE is even building an electric bicycle at all. The frame members certainly look like they match the front triangle of a diamond frame on a bike, but CAKE could just be trolling all of us by purposefully photographing a small section of a different vehicle’s frame that looks vaguely bike-ish.If you ask me though, I bet dollars to donuts that CAKE has an e-bike coming.Just for fun, here’s the CAKE teaser image lined up decently well with the frame of the new VanMoof A5 e-bike just announced this week. See? It could work!",ebikes
2022/04/08,"Phoenix, Arizona-based Lectric eBikes may have just dropped a teaser about a new model destined to join its lineup of low-cost electric bikes.The brand is famous for its Lectric XP, which was replaced last year by the upgraded Lectric XP 2.0.The low-cost 28 mph (45 km/h) folding electric bike has gained a fiercely loyal following, racking up well over 100,000 e-bike sales since the brand was born as a literal garage company barely three years ago. The “e-bikes” section of the company’s website normally lists the three different versions of the $999 Lectric XP 2.0. But now, there’s a mysterious fourth product that lacks a photo or details. Instead, all we get is a stylized question mark and the phrase “Something New is Coming…”.Between the cryptic clue and the link to sign up to learn about whatever the announcement will be, one thing seems for sure: this isn’t some glitch. As the site says, something new is coming.The only question left is: “What the heck is it?”It sounds like an odd move for Lectric eBikes. To maintain such low costs while still offering a fast and by our own account fun electric bike, the brand has cut the fat everywhere else.It doesn’t have multiple models. It doesn’t have flashy colors (I hope you like white or black), and it doesn’t have a ton of options. Instead, you get your choice of a step-over or step-through frame. Other than some neat accessories like cargo packages and suspension seat posts/comfort saddles, there just aren’t that many options to be had, so the fact that a new model could be joining the lineup is quite intriguing. The major theme at Lectric is affordability; they give you what anyone else gives you, but for several hundred dollars less, so we can likely expect something similarly affordable. But will it be another folding e-bike? Perhaps a minimalist diamond frame city e-bike? Or maybe it won’t even be an e-bike at all, and could be a folding electric scooter or other type of low-cost mobility device.For now, all we can do is speculate wildly. Feel free to join the party down in the comment section below if you’d like to speculate alongside us.",ebikes
2022/04/08,"We learned earlier this week that California-based electric moped manufacturer ONYX was rebooting the short-lived CTY electric moped. That lower-cost model, with half of the speed of its bigger brother, the RCR, was put on the back burner a few years ago in favor of the much higher-demanded and higher-performance model. But now ONYX has given it new life with the CTY2, and bumped its performance specs accordingly.When the bike first launched, most of the specs were a mystery.That’s largely because ONYX and electric moped companies like it walk a legal tight rope strung over a gray area-sized swimming pool teeming with ill-defined sharks. Essentially, these high-power electric mopeds ship as street-legal electric bicycles, usually meaning a limit of 750W (1 hp) of power and 20-28 mph speeds (32-45 km/h).A user-perform modification can usually unlock their full potential, with the implication being that the user then takes responsibility. The bikes include serial numbers that can sometimes be used to register them as moped-class vehicles in some US states, though many simply follow the “better to ask for forgiveness than permission” doctrine and fly under the radar.When the CTY2 launched less than a week ago, its specifications page was largely empty. But a source inside ONYX has now confirmed to Electrek the complete performance specs of the new electric moped.As suspected, the ONYX CTY2 will ship in a street-legal configuration known as eco mode. Two sets of wires under the cover can be connected or disconnected to enable normal and sport modes. Sport mode will be able to make full use of the bike’s 1,500W nominal and 4,000W peak-rated hub motor.Normal and sport modes will offer higher speeds than eco, as you can see below:However, the source indicated that despite sport mode’s published figure, it will actually be able to reach 45 mph (72 km/h).The CTY2 will feature a 60V and 1.446 kWh battery that will have a new quick charging connector mounted near the bottom of the frame. This removes the need to open the cover of the bike to charge the battery or to have wires hanging out of the box.The battery’s BMS is actually rated for up to 100A of current, but is software limited to 70A to provide a safety factor. The BMS is also Bluetooth enabled to communicate with ONYX’s smartphone application.Range for the CTY2 will depend on the mode of operation, and is claimed to follow the figures below:The new CTY2 now has a customized KLS6018S controller that has been relocated to underneath the frame for improved cooling due to increased air flow.The rear motor will also come with service disconnects to make it easier to remove the rear wheel for maintenance.The new ONYX CTY2 is already available on pre-order for a price of $3,699. After California-based production begins, the first models are expected to ship by July of this year.While we haven’t had the chance to test out the CTY2 yet, I was one of the few people to ever ride the original CTY. You can see it near the end of my review of the more powerful ONYX RCR moped below, but suffice it to say that the moped offered all of the retro design charm of the RCR, while adding a more accessible step-through design.",ebikes
2022/04/07,"If you’ve got a Fiido X electric bike at home, now you have a pretty magnesium sculpture. That’s because the company has issued an urgent notice for owners to stop using the e-bike after a frame defect has been discovered that causes the bike to break in two.The Fiido X electric bike was first unveiled last summer before launching a successful Indiegogo campaign. There it raised over 1 million dollars when the $1,999 electric bike initially pre-sold for a discounted $1,099 price.The folding design of the bike uses a magnesium alloy frame with a low-profile folding mechanism.The design is much sleeker than most folding e-bike frames, but that fancy design apparently came at a cost: strength.Multiple Fiido X electric bikes have reportedly shown worrying fatigue marks in the folding area, with more than one actually breaking in half at the joint.Fiido, the Hong Kong-based manufacturer of the e-bike, said that it suspended the sale of the Fiido X model after receiving the first report of a defective frame earlier this week. After “more stringent tests” performed in a testing lab, the company confirmed the defective nature of the frame and provided a statement urging current riders to stop using the e-bikes.The company has promised more details to follow by early next week, including recall details, a “user protection plan” and a deeper technical analysis of the issue.While the company is of course initially focusing on the safety of riders by urging a discontinuation of use of the e-bike, they also assure that affected owners will be compensated based on details that are yet to be released.Electrek reached out to multiple contacts at Fiido and received direct responses from both the PR team and the company’s CTO confirming the details listed above and ensuring that more information would follow by April 12.First and foremost, if you have a Fiido X, don’t use it. That seems pretty clear. As far as reaction time, it appears Fiido was actually quite quick about this. I sincerely hope no one was injured on their e-bike, and I believe that such a short period of time between first notification of an issue and the recall notice will likely help prevent future possible injuries.Regarding the bike itself, I personally reviewed the e-bike, and, while I found some of the tech to be a bit much, I really liked the design and the ride. It’s a real issue though that this type of defect wasn’t caught sooner. Bicycles are meant to undergo accelerated structural testing specifically designed to locate issues like these through repeated cyclic loading. Somewhere along the line, there was a failure.This is further surprising because Fiido has been building e-bikes and e-scooters for years. Most of their designs are more conventional though, using familiar materials and frame styles instead of creative but potentially more problematic innovative designs like the one seen in the Fiido X.Here’s to hoping Fiido takes care of its customers and that no one else gets injured on a defective product.",ebikes
2022/04/07,"Bafang, a leading Asian supplier of electric bicycle drive systems, has just unveiled its newest electric bicycle motor intended to improve upon one of its popular high-power drive units. The M510 is said to be a lighter-weight solution that still provides high performance for powerful electric bikes.The new Bafang M510 follows on the heels of the M500, a popular electric bike motor used by many electric bicycle manufacturers.The M510 offers the same 95 Nm of torque as the M500, which is significantly higher than the average amount of torque provided by most of the leading European mid-drive manufacturers.Because electric bike motor wattage (the measure of e-bike power) is heavily regulated in much of the world, most motors use underrated “250W” labels. But the M510 surely puts out several times that level, as hinted by its high torque figures.While the M510 has a similar power and torque profile to the M500, it comes in at a half kilogram lighter, dropping to just 2.9 kg (6.4 lb.). As far as higher-powered e-bike motors go, that’s on the lighter end of the scale.The weight savings come from several design changes, but chief among them is a new magnesium case. That’s a move we’ve seen other major motor manufacturers adopt to shave off the pounds.The motor’s software has been reconfigured for smoother starts and power delivery. The inclusion of a sensitive torque sensor also helps make the power delivery feel more natural, as if the motor assist is merely an extension of the rider’s own pedaling effort instead of a sudden rush of power like a motorcycle.The new drive unit includes the motor with a built-in controller as well as multiple display and remote options, and is compatible with several of Bafang’s own battery designs. It also has extra features including a 12V line for lights and upgraded waterproofing.Fortunately for manufacturers that had already designed frames around the previous M500 unit, the new M510 uses the same mount.Bafang’s motors aren’t as common on higher-end mid-drive e-bikes, but many companies still prefer them for their lower cost and higher-power performance. The famed Bafang M620 is one of the most powerful e-bike motors available, though Bafang has also developed its fair share of lightweight and low-power mid-drive motors as well.Electrek previously had the opportunity to tour Bafang’s Shanghai-based factory and take a behind-the-scenes look at how the manufacturer builds its mid-drive motors. You can check out that experience in the video below.via: LEVA",ebikes
2022/04/06,"The brand-new Ariel Rider Kepler has just been unveiled as the e-bike manufacturer’s latest high-performance electric bike. Designed for adventure and recreational riding, this fat tire bike pushes speed and power specs to the max.If you know anything about the e-bike company Ariel Rider, you’ll know that the new Kepler is true to the company’s ethos. If it wasn’t ridiculously fast and overpowered, it just wouldn’t be an Ariel Rider e-bike.With the exception of the brand’s low-cost $899 Rideal city e-bike (which the team there assures me will finally be back in stock in a couple of weeks), Ariel Rider focuses almost exclusively on high-performance e-bikes.And the Ariel Rider Kepler absolutely fits that bill.This full-size fat tire e-bike features a 1,000W nominal rear hub motor that is rated for a peak of 1,800W of power. That’s around two and a half horsepower… in a bicycle!While the bike ships with street legal speed limits programmed in, it can be unlocked up to a maximum speed of 32 mph (51.5 km/h). It’s also generally known that most Ariel Rider electric bikes exceed their published speeds, as the manufacturer often underreports the true figures. I’ve personally hit speeds of around 36-37 mph on other bikes from this manufacturer, and so the Kepler might even see similar performance.That kind of high-speed and high-power operation can take a toll on smaller batteries, which is why the Ariel Rider Kepler is equipped with a massive 52V and 20Ah removable battery. That provides riders with 1,040 Wh of capacity, making it one of the largest stock e-bike batteries on the market today.Ariel Rider claims a max range of up to 75 miles (121 km), though don’t expect to see anywhere close to that if you’re riding on throttle at full unlocked speeds. That maximum range is more likely calculated on pedal assist at slower speeds. Even so, that massive battery could potentially deliver half of the stated range when operating near full power, which would still be quite impressive.The large size of the battery means it isn’t one of those sexy little built-in batteries that can hide away inside the frame, and instead needs to be bolted on top. Even so, the tapered battery design seems to at least go part way toward camouflaging itself against the frame.Other parts that are nice to see included standard on the Ariel Rider Kepler are hydraulic disc brakes with 180 mm rotors, an 80mm travel front suspension fork, front and rear LED lights, 7-speed Shimano shifter, adjustable handlebars, color LCD screen, included front and rear fenders, and an included rear rack.The company hasn’t released a weight figure on the bike yet, but don’t expect it to be lightweight. Based on the specs and appearance, north of 70 lb (32 kg) wouldn’t surprise me at all. They do say that the Kepler has a 300 lb (136 kg) weight limit though, so at least we know it can carry some serious cargo. Speaking of which, there are even large cargo basket accessories, in case you wanted to turn it into a delivery or courier e-bike that can tackle any urban obstacle in your path.The Ariel Rider Kepler is now on sale for $1,799, marked down from its MSRP of $1,999. Shipping is estimated to begin later next month, so your pre-order will hold your spot in line to get one of the first units.For those that like choices, you’ll be happy to know the frame comes in both a step-over and a step-through design, plus there are four color options to choose from.As I mentioned, Ariel Rider is known for its excess. That can be a good thing, since these bikes are ridiculously fun to ride. Check out my Ariel Rider X-Class review video below to get an idea of just how much bang for your buck you get out of these high-performance e-bikes.That being said, there’s some serious rider responsibility to be considered here. These bikes aren’t meant to share the bike line at 30+ mph when you’ve got other cyclists around you. As I’ve pointed out in past reviews of Ariel Rider’s e-bikes, I often take the lane and travel with cars when I ride these fast e-bikes. The 30+ mph speeds mean I can keep up with city traffic, and I’m essentially a motorcycle in the lane. I highly recommend that anyone who plans to ride like this should get their motorcycle license. It’s a painless process that requires a short course that teaches you a lot of important information about handling a powerful two-wheeled vehicle.When it comes to the Kepler’s value, I can’t speak for the build quality yet before I get my hands on one, though the specs on paper show some crazy high bang for your buck. It definitely looks like Ariel Rider is coming after the Aventon Aventure and Rad Power Bikes RadRover 6 Plus with this model. Of course they’ll never be able to touch Aventon’s fit and finish or Rad Power Bike’s support and service, but the specs comparison is striking.Both of those bikes offer arguably similar geometries and bike components compared to the Ariel Rider Kepler, yet have much smaller batteries and motors. The RadRover 6 Plus only hits 20 mph, while the Aventure can do 28 mph on pedal assist or 20 mph on throttle. Since the Kepler can do well over 30 mph on either throttle or pedal assist, it’s a clear winner for those looking for a motorcycle that wears an e-bike’s clothing.I’ll be able to speak more intelligently once I can get my hands on one after the bikes start shipping. Until then, let’s hear what you think of this high-powered hooligan in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/04/05,"The world’s leading shared micromobility company, Lime, has just launched a month-long campaign under the tagline ‘Break Up With Cars.’If you’ve been wondering whether a car may be more harm than good for you (and for your city), then Lime is trying to incentivize your way over the edge towards going car-free.Car-free is a growing trend among urban residents who have found that the hassles and environmental downsides of car ownership in cities outweigh any benefits. With transportation contributing to around 20% of global carbon emissions, the environmental impact of car ownership increasingly weighs into the decisions of drivers. Even electric cars are still much larger energy guzzlers than smaller personal electric vehicles like e-bikes and e-scooters, not to mention that electric cars contribute nothing towards reducing traffic and congestion in cities.Now with many urban areas featuring plentiful shared electric scooters, e-bikes, and e-mopeds like those provided by Lime, going car-free is surprisingly easy to do in densely-populated cities. For just a few bucks, you can cross town on a lightweight personal electric vehicle instead of taking a car. It usually costs less than it would have to park there anyways, let alone the sky-high price of gas or the cost of car registration/insurance/maintenance, etc.To sweeten the pot during Earth Month, Lime is incentivizing commuters who pledge to give up their car for a period of time ranging from a single day to the entire month.Rewards vary, and include up to $3,500 worth of Lime rides, limited “Break Up With Cars” t-shirts, Bern helmets, and other Lime swag.As CEO of Lime Wayne Ting expanded:“With transportation a leading source of global carbon emissions and more than 1.3 million people killed in car crashes annually worldwide, it’s past time to end our toxic relationship with cars. We’re excited about this creative campaign’s potential to move people away from car use and onto more sustainable transportation options. It’s a reminder that freeing oneself from the costly and time consuming headaches of car ownership is not only a healthy step for drivers, but good for cities and the planet as well.”Lime has spent the previous year rolling out several new models of shared mobility rides.The company’s latest electric bike was unveiled earlier this year with increased power and an automatic shifting transmission.Lime showed off new electric mopeds last year, using NIU’s popular 30 mph sharing model that has become a favorite among dozens of scooter sharing companies around the world.Such micromobility and scooter sharing companies are helping add to a larger concept of cities designed for a post-car world. While cars are likely to remain an important part of the transportation mix, their benefits are increasingly undermined in crowded cities.Cities like Paris are leading the charge with car bans in the city center, which is becoming an increasingly popular way for governments to create walkable cities that are friendly to pedestrians and personal vehicles like bikes and scooters.Many countries offer tax incentives to citizens that choose to ride bikes instead of driving cars.As walkable cities become a higher priority for urban residents, perhaps we won’t need incentives to give up our cars.But until then, Lime would like to have a word with you about free rides and t-shirts.",ebikes
2022/04/05,"VanMoof’s new 5-Series electric bikes just launched today, following a teaser released last month that provided a few clues to the coming updates. The new VanMoof S5 and VanMoof A5 electric bikes are described by the company as the “most easy and accessible to ride VanMoof e-bikes yet.”The Amsterdam-based electric bicycle manufacturer is known for its tech-infused e-bikes that combine bold designs with new-age tech. The latest e-bikes unveiled as part of the 5-Series have fully embraced that mantle, pushing the brand further with new technology and updated designs.While the VanMoof S5 refreshes the company’s straight frame design, the new VanMoof A5 introduces a new angled frame that is described as a “step-in” design. It’s more analogous to several of the mid-step frames we’ve seen. The design makes it easier to mount without totally dropping into full step-through territory.The bikes feature VanMoof’s new Gen 5 front wheel motor with 250W of continuous-rated power. The drive system combines electronic shifting from an internally geared rear hub, a torque sensor, and an integrated battery pack housed within the frame. While the bike doesn’t have a traditional throttle, it does include a “Boost” button for an extra shot of power to boost the torque up to 68 Nm. That will likely come in handy when riders need to tackle a hill or overtake another vehicle on the road.Both bikes included the brand’s updated smart Kick Lock, which locks the rear wheel with a kick of a the button on the rear dropout. That action also activate’s the bike’s vibration alarm. The bike will do what it can to prevent it from being stolen, but there’s another solution available just in case the loud alarm doesn’t deter a thief from tossing it in the back of a van and escaping with it. After a rider marks his or her bike as stolen in the smartphone app, VanMoof’s Bike Hunters will chase it down and return it, or replace it if they can’t. Other steps to help prevent it from coming to that include the inclusion of Apple Find My technology, anti-theft nuts and bolts, and an Automatic Rider Recognition feature. The kick-lock also now has a more robust design and an auto-retract feature.The bikes feature automatic shifting with a three-speed internally geared rear hub, reworked high-visibility lights, one-piece adjustable handlebars and stems, and a VanMoof co-designed SP CONNECT phone mount with USB-C charging port. The VanMoof app also allows riders to use their phones for GPS-based navigation directly from the app itself.The 5-Series debuts VanMoof’s new Halo Ring Interface, which is a round LED light on the handlebars that offers riders info regarding speed, battery levels, and connectedness at a quick glance without cluttering up the bike’s streamlined design. It replaces the previous dot-matrix display on the top tube that was a love-it-or-hate-it feature, with enough riders apparently falling in the latter column to warrant an update.The VanMoof S5 is designed for riders from 162 to 210cm (5’4″ to 6’10”), and offers a higher riding position than the A5.The 487 Wh battery is permanently enclosed within the frame, unlike removable batteries that are designed to pop in and out with a key. While that requires charging to occur on the bike, it also allows VanMoof to explore sleeker designs like these.The company says that the battery is capable of 60 km (36 miles) of range in full power mode or 150 km (93 miles) in economy mode.The 23 kg (50.7 lb) electric bike wears a pair of 27.5″ inch wheels with VanMoof’s Gen 5 tires and features a fully enclosed drivetrain with an automatic chain tensioning system. The bike also includes sensors to detect air quality, temperature, humidity, and light conditions.The VanMoof A5 is described by founder Ties Carlier as the brand’s “first one-size-fits-all frame,” and is designed for riders from 155-200 cm (5’1″ to 6’6″).The 22 kg (48.5 lb) bike has smaller 24″ wheels and a slightly smaller 463 Wh battery, though VanMoof’s press documents list it as having the same range as the S5.The bike shares the same technology as the S5, including the ability to install VanMoof’s upcoming “Click-On” range extender battery to add another 463 Wh of battery capacity, good for another 55-140 km (34-87 miles) of range.Just like the S5, the A5 includes integrated lights, locks, and lighting for an ultra-low maintenance design.Both bikes come with a 2A charger that can be upgraded to a faster 5A charger. They each have their own front and rear racks available, with secondary heavier-duty racks available for carrying larger loads.VanMoof has stores in over 50 cities around the world, and the bikes are also available online starting today. The S5 and A5 are both priced at $2,998 in the US.VanMoof continuously impresses me with both its design chops and its tech infusion. Some “smart” bikes can be over the top with unnecessary features, but VanMoof has a keen eye for developing the right tech without overloading riders with useless gimmicks. The Kick Lock they use is an impressive extra step (though it doesn’t replace a good lock or two to keep the bike from being carried off), and it makes it easy to set the vibration alarm. The built-in lighting looks great and has a reduced chance of breaking compared to bolt-on lights that can snagged at bike racks. And the cleanly concealed drivetrain with an auto-shifting three-speed hub is also a masterclass in bike design, not to mention the frames themselves.That A5 looks particularly interesting to me. A 24″ wheel will make it lighter, more nimble, and better suited for tight urban riding, not to mention taking up a tad less space when parked.I’m not a huge fan of front hub motors, but for a modest-performance e-bike like this that is limited to 25 km/h speeds in Europe and 20 mph speeds in the US, front hub motors don’t feel much different than rear hub motors in a straight line. Higher-power e-bikes can have traction issues with front motors, but I doubt that will be an issue with these models.The $3K price certainly isn’t cheap, but you’re paying for more than just an e-bike here. So if you’re on a budget, this likely isn’t the e-bike for you. But if you have the cash and want something that looks better and packs in more useful tech, this might be the one. It appears to me that VanMoof is maintaining its position near the top of the pack for smart e-bikes.",ebikes
2022/04/05,"ONYX Motorbikes, a California-based electric moped manufacturer, has just unveiled a new step-through bike known as the ONYX CTY2.It follows the original ONYX CTY, which was unveiled as part of the Indiegogo campaign that originally launched the electric moped manufacturer nearly four years ago.Company insiders explained to Electrek that the 30 mph (51 km/h) ONYX CTY was outsold over 10:1 by the higher-spec’d top tank style ONYX RCR, which could reach twice the speed of the step-through CTY.Ultimately just a few dozen of the CTY were produced to fulfill orders from the Indiegogo, after which the model was put on indefinite hiatus as ONYX went full speed ahead on local California production of the RCR. Ever since, ONYX focused solely on the RCR, racking up sales and improving the design over the years including doubling its original battery size and range.Now ONYX has announced that the lower-spec and lower-cost baby brother electric moped is back in the new ONYX CTY2.The CTY2’s 60V system is lower power than the 72V system on the RCR, though the 23 Ah battery packs in a hefty 1,380 Wh. ONYX says the battery is sufficient for 60+ miles (96+ km) of range, though that figure is calculated at a slower speed of 20 mph (32 km/h).The design has been updated from the original CTY in a number of ways, as the company explained:We’ve increased the volume of the battery carriage to accommodate a battery that delivers more power and capacity. We’ve moved the speed controller to the bottom of the frame for maximum cooling and airflow performance. Integrated LED Lights – The bike comes with both brake lights and our signature headlight with halo running light and ultra bright high beam.The CTY2 has pedals but touts its twist throttle as offering “instant torque.”As it stands, ONYX’s other electric mopeds retain pedals largely as a vestigial feature. They are functional, but pedaling the heavy bikes is not an easy task (the CTY2 will likely be just north of 90 lb or 41 kg). Instead, the pedals provide some marginal support for anyone trying to argue that the moped is in fact an electric bicycle.That might sound strange to Europeans, but rather lax US e-bike laws combined with police departments that are often ignorant of the particulars of e-bike regulations often allow such higher-powered electric mopeds to masquerade as genuine electric bicycles. In most jurisdictions in the US, electric bicycles can ride wherever pedal bicycles can, and are free from the hassle of licensing, registration, or insurance commonly associated with motorcycles and occasionally also mopeds.ONYX has never shied away from pushing the limits of e-bike regulations, and it appears they intend to stay the course with the CTY2. Describing it as “Part bicycle. Part Motorbike. Part middle finger to the world,” the company isn’t bashful about the high-speed and high-power nature of the electric two-wheeler.That being said, ONYX also isn’t coming out and saying exactly what the top speed is. The original CTY was marketed with a top speed of 30 mph (51 km/h) and was known to sometimes reach even higher speeds. ONYX hasn’t released the exact motor size either, though early reports indicate that it will be a more powerful motor than the original CTY’s powerplant, meaning the CTY2 could hit even higher speeds.The company claims the CTY2 can climb a 45 degree hill, which would be a 100% grade – something no rider would ever come across in daily travels (most of the steepest roads in the US are in the high 30’s for grade percentage). For that kind of climbing ability, expect a high-power motor with some serious torque behind it. The lack of detailed specs may seem off-putting, but it is par for the course with ONYX. Even for the 60 mph RCR, the speed and power aren’t listed among the specs on the company’s website and are instead just widely known figures. Despite the ambiguity, thousands of riders have plopped down nearly US $4,500 for the high-speed RCR. Now the CTY2 is looking to offer a somewhat lower spec’d but more affordable version with a pre-order price of $3,699.At that price, the CTY2 will compete with other 30+mph, full-suspension electric mopeds like the $2699 Juiced HyperScorpion,  US $3,299 Ariel Rider Grizzly and the US $3,495 SUPER73 R-Brooklyn. ONYX says the CTY2 will likely begin shipping in July or August of this year, and that international shipping will be available as well.ONYX is one of my favorite fully fledged electric moped companies. I don’t really consider them an e-bike company in the traditional sense. These are small electric motorcycles, and they perform as such. I will forever kick myself for not buying one of the original RCRs from the Indiegogo campaign, when they were first launched for just US $2,299, or roughly half of the cost today.I did manage to eventually test out the former version of the RCR and was blown away with what a fun ride it was.The CTY2 looks to bring ONYX back into the legal gray area between e-bikes and e-mopeds or light electric motorcycles. I have no doubt that there will be a 750W-limited version of the bike that maxes out at 28 mph (45 km/h), and thus would more or less fulfill the requirements for class 3 e-bikes in the US. That being said, the ability to flip a switch (or perhaps a slider in a phone app) to unleash significantly more speed and power is a tricky proposition for regulators. It also requires some serious responsibility on the part of the rider. Hitting the bike lane at top speed and buzzing someone on a Huffy isn’t cool, and increasingly crowded interactions between e-bike riders, traditional cyclists, electric scooters, and pedestrians make rider responsibility even more critical to avoid accidents.So while there’s some important gray area here to suss out, the reboot of the CTY2 is a great prospect for anyone looking for an electric moped with ONYX’s trademark styling, but that comes in at nearly $1,000 less than the company’s current flagship offering. Hitting 30-35 mph is likely enough for many riders that don’t need the extra-high speed of the RCR, and the CTY could prove to be a potent little electric moped that combines classy looks and emission-free urban commuting.And I guess if you ever run out of battery, you could grit your teeth slowly pedal your way back.",ebikes
2022/04/04,"Himiway, a popular electric bicycle supplier, has updated its Himiway Escape electric moped into the new Escape Pro, touting new improvements in design and performance.The 750W-rated Himiway Escape uses a step-through style frame that is reminiscent of classic mopeds from the 60s, 70s, and 80s. It is also often said to take inspiration from other popular electric bicycles, though the e-bike industry is full of shared designs and borrowed ideas.Regardless of the originality of the design, the updated Himiway Escape Pro certainly boasts some real improvements.The original model came with a 48V 14Ah battery with 672 Wh of capacity. The updated Pro version now has a 17.5Ah battery that bumps the capacity up to 840 Wh.The company says it can go 45 miles (72 km) on throttle-only riding, or over 60 miles (100 km) if using the e-bike’s pedal-assist feature to help assist the motor.Keep in mind that the throttle-only range is based on the out-of-the-box speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). The Himiway Escape is widely known to be unlockable via its display, allowing riders to reach speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h) or higher.The bike’s wide tires and full-suspension setup makes those higher speeds both comfortable and controllable, and the design feels almost like a small motorcycle at higher speeds. I say that from experience, having reviewed the original Himiway Escape last year.The improved battery is said to last for 1,000 cycles before reducing to 80% of its original capacity. The bike also now features internally-routed wires that the company claims reduces mechanical failures “in extreme weather conditions by up to 95%.”Himiway also updated the 6061 aluminum frame and now offers a 10-year warranty on the frame.Many of the bike’s popular features from the original version remain untouched. The 330 lb (150 kg) weight capacity allows heavier riders to feel confident on the bike, and the combination of built-in lighting and included rear rack/full fender package make the bike a high utility commuter for those that run errands or perform deliveries on their e-bikes.At 92 lb (41 kg), the e-bike isn’t exactly lightweight. But some may claim that it is relatively lightweight on the wallet at a price of $1,799. That’s not exactly cheap, but it’s on the lower end of the range for high-speed electric mopeds with large batteries like these. And with full-suspension and a pile of included accessories, it’s a pretty decent deal compared to other major players in the space.For those that want to get a general idea of the bike’s performance, check out my review of the previous version below, which is similar in many ways.",ebikes
2022/04/04,"UPS is testing out a new tiny electric delivery van, though calling it a “van” is a bit of a stretch. Technically considered a quadricycle, it’s basically a highly efficient van-shaped four-wheeled electric bike that can make urban deliveries in crowded areas.The vehicle is known as an eQuad and is built by the company Fernhay.The manufacturer refers to it as a “four-wheeled e-assist cycle,”  and says that it is designed for pickups and deliveries in places where a typical large delivery vans would be overkill or couldn’t reach.Measuring a slim 84 cm (33 inches) wide, the little eQuad can slip through nearly any area a bicycle can, making last-mile deliveries quicker and more efficient.The entire vehicle is less than 3 meters (10 feet) long, and most of that length is storage space. The “Cube” system that Fernhay uses consists of a 1.8 meter (6 feet) long cargo box on back.Powering the eQuad is a drivetrain similar to those seen in electric cargo bicycles. There’s a typical bicycle seat and handlebar setup, with an electric assist system that kicks in the power when the riders begins pedaling.Despite its striking appearance compared to conventional electric cargo bikes, the eQuad is designed to share the bike lane with other cyclists. As the company explained, “a low load area and high seat allow for our operator as well as fellow cyclists to see around or over the eQuad.”UPS is now trialing 100 of Fernhay’s eQuads for package deliveries in several EU markets with plans to expand that testing into the US, according to Reuters. This won’t be the first time UPS has turned to electric cargo bikes for creative urban delivery solutions. Even more creative solutions have involved UPS’s plans to purchase large electric drones for package delivery. In this case though, UPS is keeping its wheels firmly on the ground with the eQuads. And those wheels will be rolling at up to 25 km/h (15 mph), which is the electronically limited top speed of the electric four-wheelers. Considering they can carry loads of up to 200 kg (440 lb), that relatively slow speed is probably a good idea.Onboard battery capacity combined with good old-fashioned sweat labor should push the range of the eQuad to around 65 km (40 miles), making this an ideal delivery vehicle for local neighborhood routes.We’ve previously seen several delivery companies including Amazon and DHL, testing electric cargo bikes for urban deliveries, though they are usually three-wheeled electric trikes.These eQuads push mini-EV package delivery to a new level with increased stability, higher load capacity, and improved utility.",ebikes
2022/04/01,"The Cyrusher Kommoda looks like the e-bike equivalent of someone who got dressed in the dark. It seems to be wearing a bit of every different type of e-bike on the market. Nothing really matches, but damn if this powerful e-bike doesn’t somehow pull it off in an awesome way!When you first lay eyes on the Cyrusher Kommoda, there’s just so much to take in.That dual crown suspension fork looks like it came off of a motorcycle. The full-suspension design screams mountain bike. The fat tires give it that all-terrain flair, yet the tires come in a small 20″ size, which is much more common on electric moped-style e-bikes.The included fenders and lights position the bike as a functional street/commuter model. The geometry is practically a cruiser layout with an upright seating geometry.There’s a cargo rack thrown in for good measure, just in case you wanted to turn it into a utility e-bike. And there are even folding pedals, despite this not being a folding e-bike.On the one hand, pick a direction, Cyrusher! Yet on the other hand, wow this thing is fun just as it is! We live in a “come as you are” world, and the Kommoda fully embraces that belief. Check it out in my video review below, or keep reading for all of my thoughts on this word jumble of an e-bike.The Cyrusher Kommoda seems to give you just a bit of everything.Trying to step back and take a high-level overview, I’d say it’s pretty much a comfort cruiser e-bike. The laidback ride style and wide tires combine with tall and adjustable handlebars to create a comfortable ride.If dual suspension wasn’t already enough to give you a nice and cushy ride, those wide tires and the comfortable saddle seal the deal. You can remain in the saddle and still hit bumps without sending a shock up your spine.Interestingly though, the tires are only 20″ in diameter, which results in a much more nimble ride and a lower center of gravity. When you add in the step-through geometry of the frame, you really get a nice and approachable experience on a bike that is designed to fit a wide range of riders.On the electronics side though, Cyrusher definitely didn’t shy away from extra power. In fact, the company rarely does. I’ve reviewed several Cyrusher models, and there’s one thing in common across all of them: the company likes its excess.In this case, the 750W motor that really puts out 1,000W of peak power can get you flying quickly. They claim speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h) are possible, but I easily hit 28 mph (45 km/h) with either a twist of that half-throttle or using the highest level of pedal assist.The 672 Wh battery is rated for a range of up to 50 miles (80 km), though the company admits that you can easily cut that range in half if you’re heavy on throttle usage. I was definitely a throttle fan during my testing, but 14Ah of battery on a 48V system still gave me plenty of range. In an industry that still seems to offer plenty of 48V 10Ah batteries, it’s great to see 14Ah becoming much more standard.Would I have liked even more battery? Of course. And Cyrusher offers even larger 17Ah batteries on some of its models. But the integrated battery here has a limit of how big it can be before you run out of room in the frame. And the fact that it gets hidden away and isn’t an eyesore like a big bolt-on battery can’t be overlooked.Of course when you’re paying these prices, you certainly expect to get some good performance. The Cyrusher Kommoda is priced at $2,399, which is a hefty price for this hefty (74 lb) electric bike.While that price smacks me pretty hard in the face and brings me quickly back to reality, I can see how they got there.First of all, full-suspension e-bikes are expensive. They simply require more robust frames, not to mention the expense of both the rear suspension linkage and front suspension fork. In this case, neither are top-shelf designs, but they both work well for this type of recreational use.Then there are nice components like the hydraulic disc brakes, color LCD screen, included rack and fenders (easily another $100-$150 from other vendors that up-charge for those parts), the powerful LED lighting, etc.We’ve seen other cruiser e-bikes that come in at a few hundred bucks less, but that lack many of the features included on the Kommoda.So while this isn’t the best deal in town, it’s one of the only deals in town for a full-suspension step-through cruiser. And since many people are looking for that type of easy to mount, easy-to-ride  type of e-bike that combines the comfort of fat tires and full suspension with the upright geometry of a cruiser bike, this style of e-bike is becoming increasingly in demand.The Kommoda is an enigma, and not a cheap one at that. But if you can pay to play, you’ll have fun all day!",ebikes
2022/03/31,"Gocycle, the London-based manufacturer of premium folding electric bikes, has just announced a major new update to the way its popular G4 e-bike model is manufactured.The Gocycle G4 is known for many eye-catching design features, from its dual single-side-supported wheels and enclosed drivetrain to its hand-made carbon fiber mid-frame that makes up the center of its chassis.But now that last one is getting a major update with a more sustainable production process.The mid-frame is an innovative component on Gocycle’s already-unique electric bike design. The mid-frame connects the hydroformed aluminum front frame to Gocycle’s patented magnesium Cleandrive enclosed pedal drivetrain. From front to rear, three different structural components are built from three different materials that are each optimized for three different roles.The latest mid-frame design will see the original carbon fiber production eclipsed by an automotive-inspired injection-molded composite mid-frame. The new mid-frame replaces the hand-made carbon fiber mid-frame that was featured prominently on the G4 from its launch in 2021.According to GoCycle, the new mid-frame is produced “using an advanced automotive manufacturing technique that delivers automated precision, low weight, and class-leading stiffness. This innovative process offers notable sustainability benefits, with it being significantly less resource intensive than carbon production.”Carbon fiber has long been prized in the bicycle industry for its lightweight and strong design qualities, but the material also comes with its own set of environmental concerns regarding production and recycling.The new precision injection-molded composite mid-frame is produced from a proprietary blend of advanced polymers and fibers that combine to offer a lightweight and strong frame with a high level of stiffness.For now, Gocycle says that the even more premium G4i & G4i+ models will continue to use the carbon fiber production for their own mid-frames. However, the company indicated that the precision injection-molded composite design, which is slightly heavier than the carbon fiber version, may eventually become standard on other models as well.As part of the new update, the G4’s price will be dropping by $200 to $4,799. Still not an impulse buy, but then again Gocycle represents the crème de la crème of premium folding electric bikes.In 2020, I reviewed the lower-cost Gocycle GX model, and earlier this year I followed it with a review of the even more premium Gocycle G4i+ model, which you can see below.The bikes cost a pretty penny, but they offer a level of quality and convenience that is unmatched in the industry.",ebikes
2022/03/30,"Redmond, Washington-based electric bicycle company Propella has just launched the brand’s most up-market e-bike yet, the Propella 9S Pro. It builds upon the company’s lightweight, messenger-style e-bike design legacy, yet adds in the highest-quality parts we’ve seen yet on the brand’s e-bikes.We’ve long been Propella fans here at Electrek, having tested both the full-size 700c models and the smaller 20″ mini e-bikes from the brand.Starting at sub-$999 pricing and offering lightweight, easy-riding electric bikes for the city, Propella has become known for its high value in the urban class of e-bikes. Such lightweight e-bike offerings have become even more important in the face of trends over the last few years that have seen many e-bikes balloon in size and weight.Now the brand is stepping out of its budget territory and heading for higher performance with the new Propella 9S Pro.Don’t expect to be laying down rubber snakes in the bike lane though. The 9S Pro is the highest performance e-bike yet from Propella, but there’s a limit to just how much power you can pack into a lightweight e-bike. These are still meant to be modestly powerful commuter e-bikes that are designed for cyclists that like to pedal but that want some extra “oomph” added to their ride.Compared to the company’s existing 7S e-bike, the 9S Pro gains 4 lbs. (1.8 kg), increasing to a still svelte 41 lb. (18.6 kg).That increased weight largely comes from a bigger capacity battery and a more powerful motor.The battery increases from 250 Wh to 350 Wh, thanks to the inclusion of larger 21700 format Samsung battery cells. A higher power charger included with the bike will see charge time drop to just 2.5 hours. 21700-format cells have been gaining in popularity for e-bike use over the last several years. Compared to the more common 18650-format, these larger cells cram in more capacity, which can help e-bike battery designers offer longer run times.The battery should provide between 25-45 miles of range (40-70 km), depending on how powerful of a pedal assist level is selected. There is no throttle on these e-bikes; they’re Class 1 pedal assist e-bikes.That Class 1 designation also means they max out at 20 mph (32 km/h), which is an improvement from the previous 18.5 mph (30 km/h) top speed. That faster speed is made possible due to both the larger capacity battery that is able to provide more power, as well as the new higher power Vinka motor (now 500W peak-rated, increasing from 400W peak-rated) found in the rear hub.It’s not just the electronics and powertrain that got an upgrade on the Propella 9S Pro. There are also a number of interesting new components found on the bike as well.The mechanical disc brakes have been upgraded to hydraulic disc brakes, which provide stronger stopping power and reduced maintenance. Unlike mechanical disc brakes that are prone to cable stretch and need to be occasionally tuned to maintain the proper braking force and pull stroke, hydraulic disc brakes basically stay perfectly tuned until the brake pads are finally worn out and need to be replaced.The front quick release skewer has been replaced by a stronger and higher-quality 12mm thru-axle, something rarely seen on e-bikes in this lower price level.The tire size has also been updated with a slightly smaller diameter yet wider tire. Propella went with CST BROOKLYN PRO 27.5” x 2” tires, which give an urban tread that can still handle light trails. The larger air volume will certainly provide a nicer ride for more comfortable cruising, matched by another comfort feature in the handlebars that have a slight rise to them. That should give just a bit of a more upright ride position to the bike.The handlebars also come with a new color LCD display instead of the previous monochrome display. Riders can use the display-mounted buttons to navigate through five different levels of pedal assist.The pedal drivetrain has been upgraded with a 9-speed Shimano Altus transmission, giving riders a bit more range of gears to choose from.Compared to the current Propella 7S’s price of $1,299, the new Propella 9S Pro gains just $200 to reach $1,499 for the first pre-order customers. Those bikes are estimated to ship in early July, and pre-orders have free cancellation if you end up not wanting to wait that long. Word to the wise though: The bike’s price will increase to its full $1,699 MSRP after the initial pre-order group. So if you like the bigger motor and battery, higher speed, and nicer parts, you may want to jump on this new model quickly before the price goes up. Though even at $1,699, a lightweight commuter e-bike with this level of parts is hard to come by at this price these days.What do you think of Propella’s upgrades in the 9S Pro?

2022/03/29,"Many electric bicycles come in multiple frame sizes to fit both short and tall riders. But like any good bell curve, the extreme ends of the spectrum often get left out. DirtySixer may not be able to do anything for the vertically challenged riders among us, but the favorite bike company of walking giants like Shaquille O’Neal has just released a massive electric bicycle built on 36″ wheels.Extra-tall fans of electric bikes, rejoice!DirtySixer, a bicycle manufacturer founded by the 6’6″ (198 cm) David Folch, has been building bicycles for particularly towering individuals since 2013. DirtySixer riders include such famous names as Shaq, Lebron James, and Kevin Durant, but you don’t have to be a pro baller to ride a bike with massive 36″ wheels. You just have to be extra leggy.For nearly a decade, DirtySixer’s massive bicycles have been purely Wheaties-powered. That is, until now. Because as Folch explained in a conversation with Electrek, DirtySixer is going electric and releasing its first massive e-bikes.And fittingly, the new model will be known as the eDirtySixer.The eDirtySixer is still in its prototype stage, but this isn’t merely a scaled-up e-bike. From the specs that Folch shared with us, it is shaping up to be a very nicely outfitted e-bike as well.The colossal e-bike will feature a Shimano E8000 mid-drive motor paired with Shimano’s internal yet removable 500Wh batteries. The motor may be fairly standard, but you’d expect there to be a few extra links in that chain compared to a “normal” e-bike. Except for one little detail: there’s no chain at all.Instead, the Shimano mid-drive motor is connected to the rear wheel via a Gates carbon fiber-reinforced belt drive. Compared to a typical chain, the carbon belt is quieter, cleaner, and maintenance-free, capable of lasting for tens of thousands of miles.The belt gets paired with a fancy Rohloff XXL 14-speed internally geared hub, giving riders a high-end transmission that can shift from a standstill and removes any maintenance or damage concerns of a hanging derailleur, though at least such giant wheels would keep a derailleur fairly high off the ground.Just in case you’re still having trouble wrapping your head around what 36″ wheels look like compared to typical bicycle wheels, here’s a better idea of the scale.That electric drivetrain helps the bike reach 20 mph (32 km/h) on pedal assist, maintaining the e-bike’s Class 1 status and ability to ride just about anywhere bicycles are allowed. And with the 500Wh battery, DirtySixer says the e-bike should get up to 60 miles (96 km) of range per charge in low-power mode. That Shimano mid-drive motor is capable of higher-power operation as well, though riders might not make it the entire 60 miles when pulling more watts.Those giant 36″ wheels will roll on carbon Nextie rims, and the aluminum frame will feature custom dual crowns for the inverted 80mm suspension fork on the mountain bike version of the eDirtySixer. There will also be a street version without a suspension fork.Both models feature front and rear hydraulic disc brakes with 203 mm rotors, though the front wheel gets a pair of those rotors. Ironically, 203 mm disc rotors are some of the largest available on the market, and yet they look like cute little 160s on those massive 36-inch wheels.The mountain bike version of the eDirtySixer will weigh 65 lb. (29 kg), while the road version will weigh just under 60 lb. (27 kg) thanks to its rigid fork and single-speed setup. For such a large bike, that’s a surprisingly low weight.While the current prototype uses Shimano’s electric bike drive unit, Folch says that he will also be testing motors from Bosch and Valeo as other potential suppliers for the massive e-bikes’ drive systems.As far as a timeline, we’re likely still around one year out from the eDirtySixer being released to the public. When it does become ready in mid-2023, it will carry a tall price to match its tall wheels: something in the neighborhood of US $8,000.There are definitely some high-end components in the bike (that rear hub is a $1,000+ part by itself), though you’re also paying for specialty manufacturing and a unique design. And considering the company’s pedal bikes already start at $5K, you’re getting off relatively easy.But don’t worry, those NBA contracts should cover it.Speaking of, if you want to see one of DirtySixer’s other bikes in action, check out Shaq riding his in a credit card commercial below.",ebikes
2022/03/28,"The Morfuns Eole S is an interesting departure from many of the budget-end folding electric bicycles on the market. It features both a lightweight design and some nice components that should make it an awesome urban e-bike for someone on the lookout for a small and unobtrusive folder.To be fair, we’ve of course seen plenty of lightweight folding e-bikes before. But when you cut the weight and the battery capacity to shave off the ounces and pounds, throttles rarely tend to survive the chopping block either. That’s usually because small, weak batteries wouldn’t be able to offer very good range on throttle-only riding.However, unlike most pedal assist-only lightweight folding e-bikes we’ve tried before, Morfuns does us a solid and lets us keep a throttle in addition to the very nice torque sensor-based pedal assist.There’s even more under the hood here, so to speak. You can see it all in my video review below, or you can keep scrolling to read all of my thoughts on this fun e-bike.First and foremost, the Eole S is a folding e-bike. It is designed to be small and lightweight, just like an urban folder should be.The carbon fiber frame and small-ish motor and battery combo help to significantly reduce the weight of the bike down to just 15 kg (33 lb). When you take the battery out, you take a few more pounds off the bike as well, making it even easier to lift. If you’re regularly putting the bike in a car, removing the battery is certainly possible.In this case, though, removing the battery doesn’t mean popping it off of the frame like a traditional e-bike. That’s because the battery is actually housed inside the seat post. You remove the battery by taking the seat post all the way off.You can get an optional seat post lock with a little tubular key if you want to ensure no one else has the ability to take your seat and battery off, which is a good idea if you’ll be locking the bike outside. Though with a bike this small and lightweight (and this expensive, more on that in a moment), perhaps you shouldn’t make a habit of locking it outside too much.The little battery in the seat post is only capable of holding 230 Wh of capacity, which is less than most e-bikes. With the torque-sensor enabled pedal assist, you can stretch that out to around 50 km (31 miles) of range, or perhaps even a bit further if you keep it in the lowest level pedal assist. At Level five pedal assist, you might drop below 40 km (25 miles). If you use the optional throttle accessory, definitely expect to get less range.The range won’t drop as quickly as you’d expect though, partly because the bike just isn’t that fast or powerful. It maxes out at an EU-legal 25 km/h (15.5 mph), meaning it doesn’t need a particularly powerful motor. The little 250W motor in the back applies the power slowly, but it gets you up to speed after several seconds. This is absolutely not a powerhouse of an e-bike, but the slow application of power makes it more efficient, as does the torque sensor-based pedal assist.If you need even more range, there’s a nifty little auxiliary battery option that straps right onto the frame and looks like a water bottle. You have to swap the connector from your main battery (which plugs in at the bottom of the seat post) over to your spare battery whenever you want to use it, but it isn’t a terribly clunky operation. And the ability to instantly double your range is a very nice feature to have.Other nice parts on the bike include the hydraulic disc brakes, the nine-speed transmission, the included fenders, and the LED lights.You’ll have to pay extra for that second battery, the rear rack, and the throttle. The $59 charge for the rack feels a bit steep, though the $259 second battery is fairly reasonable, as far as extra battery prices go. The $29 throttle upgrade isn’t terribly expensive, though it’d be nice if that was just included standard.Since the bike itself is on sale for $1,999 (down from its $2,199 MSRP), you’re looking at a serious investment here. Though you can take 10% off with the code D863JZSQ49JC. [Update April 27, 2022: The price has since increased to $3,099 but the 10% discount code remains active.]But in the realm of lightweight folding e-bikes, they’re already going to be expensive. The last carbon fiber folding e-bike I tested cost 3.5x the price of the Morfuns Eole S, so keep in mind that everything is relative. You’re not going to get a lightweight carbon fiber e-bike with some pretty nice tech for a bargain-basement price. And even though the performance isn’t peppy, that’s not really the point of the bike. It’s not a high performance design. Instead, it’s all about being as light and easy to use as possible for urban dwellers with limited space.So for a fraction of other ultra-light electric folders, Morfuns seems to have done a very nice job here.

2022/03/25,"The Addmotor M-430 may not look like much of a performance e-bike, but the don’t judge a book by its cover adage holds with electric bikes as well. Believe it or not, this relaxing-looking cruiser e-bike is actually a peppy ride when you open it up.That’s not something we often associate with cruiser bikes. Generally they’re more for the low-and-slow crowd, offering a comfortable ride in exchange for somewhat lower tuned performance.That’s not to say I haven’t ridden my fair share of high-power electric cruiser bikes. But they’re the exception, not the rule.The Addmotor M-430 needs to get added to the exception list though because this fat tire electric cruiser bike has some real pickup and makes for a thrilling and yet still comfortable ride.You can see it in action in my video review below.The Addmotor M-430 may look like a fun cruiser for a lazy day, but it has some real performance to it as well. When you unlock the top speed, you can boost it from the 20 mph (32 km/h) out-of-the-box setting to a much more fun 25 mph (40 km/h).At that speed on throttle or pedal assist, the bike really starts to fly. The 750W of power on startup makes the acceleration feel peppy, too.What really surprised me though was that the M-430 was more nimble than I expected, likely due to the somewhat smaller 24″ wheel diameter. With a laidback geometry, cruiser bikes are generally a bit slower to respond. They are known for a lot of things, but responsive handling isn’t one of them.The M-430, on the other hand, did great on light trails and grassy fields – not just smooth bike lanes. It was responsive and handled much better than I expected. I usually run fat tires with a bit lower pressure (in the 15-ish PSI range), but I pumped these up a bit higher to just over 20 PSI and the bike seemed to love it. I still had a fairly cushy ride thanks to the 80 mm front suspension fork, but the extra firmness improved the handling and made for a great light-trail experience as well as maintaining the asphalt performance. I did a little bit of sand riding, but the higher pressure doesn’t lend itself quite as well to sand shenanigans. Even so, the M-430 held its own admirably well.The bike’s big battery offers 768 Wh of capacity, which is above average for these types of e-bikes. You’ll never get that 65 miles of range that the company claims, but you’ll still do much better than the ubiquitous 500 Wh e-bikes out there.Another thing I loved about the M-430 was the rear rack. It’s a well-made rack that looks like it can carry a serious load. And you don’t even have to pay extra for it! Many companies charge you big bucks to add accessories like racks, fenders, or LED lights. But Addmotor includes all of those as standard equipment on the M-430. Cha-Ching!There’s even a mount for a front rack or basket, if you want to add one. That’d be the first extra accessory you’d need to buy, but it could turn this thing into nearly a cargo e-bike.Things aren’t all rosy here with the M-430 though. If there’s one area where the bike falls short, it’s weight. At 73 lb (33 kg), this is one seriously hefty e-bike. It’s a bike that I know my wife would love to ride, but that she’d never be able to lift if she needed to. And while I could lift it onto a bike rack if necessary, it’s not something that I’d want to carry up more than a single flight of stairs.The other interesting thing that comes to mind when I think about my wife riding the bike is that the step-through frame isn’t that step-through. Sure, the frame drops in the middle. But it doesn’t go as low as most step-through frames. I love a low-slung frame because it’s a nicer and more comfortable way to mount a bike. But I also hit my heels several times while hopping on, as I often expected more clearance than I found. So if you have leg or hip issues that require an ultra-low frame to mount the bike, consider whether or not that might be an issue for you.Once you hop on though, you’ll definitely have a comfy ride. The seat is nice and big like a cruiser e-bike’s saddle should be. The bars are only slightly curved back, which is a nice compromise, in my opinion, to give a comfortable and not overly swept reach to the bars.Even the wide range of color options is a nice touch. I tested the pretty cyan option, but they’ve also got options of Pearl White, Estate Blue, Cyprus Green, Rose Gold, and Black. I guess they ran out of adjectives on that last one.At $1,899, this isn’t the most affordable option on the market, but I don’t think it’s terribly over-priced either. I would have loved to see the mechanical disc brakes upgraded to hydraulic brakes at this price, but at least we get a big battery, 25 mph speeds, and a seven-speed transmission at this price.If the bike were to go on sale by a couple hundred bucks, I’d call it a no-brainer. At this price, it’s fair but not necessarily a killer deal. Even so, there just aren’t that many electric cruiser e-bikes out there that offer this level of performance. You can spend the same money and get a weak 36V e-bike from many brands. Plus we’ve tested several Addmotor e-bike models by now, and the company has proven that it can deliver time and again.So if you’re on the lookout for a comfortable electric cruiser with good range and power, the M-430 should absolutely be on your list.",ebikes
2022/03/24,"Bianchi is one of the oldest bicycle companies still in existence, but today’s announcement is decidedly new-tech. The storied brand has just unveiled two new electric bicycles in the Bianchi T-Tronik line: The T-Tronik C-Type and T-Tronik T-Type.The new models, designed as city bikes and touring bikes respectively, make use of Shimano E6100 mid-drive motors to provide electric assist.That motor is rated for 250W of continuous power and provides a maximum of 60Nm of torque, placing it near the middle of the range of mid-drive power levels available from major e-bike drive system manufacturers. The bikes reach a top speed under electric assist of 25 km/h (15.5 mph), which is the maximum allowable speed under European e-bike laws. Riders can still pedal up to higher speeds, but the motor will not provide assist past the 25 km/h electronic limit.For energy storage, the bikes come paired with a 417 Wh battery produced by the major e-bike battery manufacturer Phylion. With many e-bikes featuring 500 Wh or higher batteries, the new Bianchi e-bikes appear to fall just below average for city or touring e-bike battery capacity.But that doesn’t mean riders will need to worry about range anxiety. The removable battery is still said to provide a maximum range of 95 km (59 miles) under low power assist.The two models are designed to cover most e-bike riders needs in the city as well as for light trail use. As the company explained:The Bianchi T-Tronik’s mission is to simplify people’s lives and travels, both in the city and beyond. This new range of e-bikes is available in Urban (C-Type) and Touring (T-Type) versions, and offers a new approach to sustainable e-mobility.The two models of bikes have slightly different frames, with the urban C-Type coming in a step-through variety and the touring T-Type offered in both a step-over and mid-step frame. Both bikes feature high output LED lights with a 100 lumen headlight visible from 400 meters and a rear tail light visible from 500 meters.The two bikes also share the same fender set, covered chains, Sunrace 9-speed transmissions, Suntour suspension forks, Radius hydraulic disc brakes, 700c wheels wearing Chaoyang E-Liner City 700x45C tires, and 25 kg-rated (55 lb) rear racks.The prices for the new models have not yet been announced.The new e-bikes follow Bianchi’s previous big e-bike drop early last year, when the brand showed off new mountain, touring, and city e-bikes in Europe. Those models were announced to have their US debut a few months later, meaning these new 2022 models could end up seeing a similar rollout stateside. That would certainly save me the trouble of having to go all the way to Europe to try out a new Bianchi e-bike like I had to last time.Urban and touring bikes have proven to be some of the most popular electric bicycle variants in Europe, with several companies releasing their own models in these sought-after categories.Brands like Peugot, Gazelle and Greyp have launched several crossover-style electric bikes in the last few years. Such e-bikes, which can serve as both daily commuters and weekend excursion e-bikes, often serve double duty for many riders.And with the rate at which e-bike use has soared in Europe, serving double duty sounds like an excellent plan.",ebikes
2022/03/23,"The Model E offers a great balance of quality parts and economical pricing. It’s right there in the name: Model E. The ‘E’ is for Everyone, as Electric Bike Company’s founder and CEO Sean Lupton-Smith explained to me as I tested the bike out on a cool winter morning in Newport Beach, California. That’s where EBC builds its e-bikes, assembling them locally from a combination of US and internationally sourced components. Not only did I get a chance to tour the company’s factory and watch how e-bikes were being built in front of my eyes, but I got to spend a few days riding around Newport on the Model E, getting a sense of just what makes this e-bike special.Technically the Model E is a cruiser e-bike, as that’s EBC’s specialty. But it feels a bit more like a city cruiser, as in something I could use both for lazy boardwalk rides and brisker city commutes. Even the inclusion of the battery within the frame instead of a rack battery helps to give it that sleeker, relaxed look.The bike is powerful when you need it to be, but it doesn’t feel over-powered in an “I’m going to get myself in trouble” kind of way. 1,000 watts of power from that rear hub motor is definitely peppy, but the bike feels plenty controllable.Part of the comfort comes from the wide handlebars that offer confident steering, and part of it comes from the high-quality hydraulic disk brakes that make stopping quick and easy. Even the platform pedals contribute to that laissez-faire attitude; if it hadn’t been so chilly out on my visit then I might have wanted to pedal it barefoot!And at 56 lb (25 kg), the bike is even lighter than I expected. It looks massive, but it only feels semi-massive. Any e-bike above 50 lb will definitely feel heavy, but this is practically svelte for a big cruiser e-bike.Basically, it’s a powerful e-bike but packed into a manageable package. You can get an honest 25 mph (40 km/h) of speed out of it when you need to go fast, or you can have a relaxing, easy-going ride. It’s all up to you and how you want to ride it.I really like the step-through design of the Model E, which adds to the laid-back feel of the bike.My wife joined me for the testing, and while she spent most of the time on a Model Y, she also got a feel for the Model E when we’d switch off. As a short rider (5’3 or 160 cm), she could easily lower the Model E’s saddle to a point that she felt perfectly comfortable on it. That’s not true of many e-bikes, so I have to give EBC props there. It’s hard for my wife to find a bike that fits her well. But the Model E feels good for tall and short riders alike. In fact, they say it fits riders from 4’6″ to 6’8″ (137 to 203 cm), which seems to be just about everyone.The touch points all felt great too. From the wide cruiser saddle to the comfortable leather grips, the bike didn’t feel like what you’d expect the most entry-level model in an e-bike company’s lineup to feel like, that’s for sure. It definitely has a higher-quality feel.The only comfort thing that struck me as odd was just how cruiser-ish the cruiser bars were. They sweep waaaay back, and I’m definitely a straight bar kind of guy. I got used to it, but having my hands back so far and my wrists angled is not the most comfortable ride for me. But to each his own when it comes to handlebar styles.The Model E obviously offers good performance from that big 1,000W motor, and the comfort is there in spades, too. But the real take-home from EBC is the quality.Electric Bike Company has perhaps the best quality oversight of any US-based electric bicycle company because it actually assembles the e-bikes itself on site. That means it can ensure that every component is perfect before it goes into the e-bike, and no parts have been swapped out along the way for cheaper materials or have been installed incorrectly. You can learn more about the attention to detail enabled by US assembly by checking out my EBC factory tour here.Even the packaging is top-notch. The bikes get shipped fully-assembled, meaning you just roll the bike out of the box, straighten the handlebars and ride away. Most e-bikes require between 15 minutes to an hour of final assembly by the customers, installing things like pedals, handlebars, fenders, lights, and other components. But EBC uses its own custom packaging to ensure that bikes can be delivered in fully-assembled form and without damage.That means everything from the dual tail lights to any optional racks or other accessories are already set up and ready to go, right out of the box.The E in Model E may be for Everyone, but it’s also for Economical. At $1,799, the Model E offers a very fair price for a US-built electric bicycle. Not only are you paying for local assembly and the best quality control that such close oversight can offer, but you’re getting a lot of good parts too. The powerful motor, full-color screen, hydraulic brakes, and quality hardware like stainless steel fasteners and sealed bearings all add to EBC’s costs, yet the final price is more than reasonable compared to the rest of the market. And when you factor in the company’s five year battery warranty and 10 year frame warranty, that price is even more impressive.Depending on how sophisticated you want to go with customizations, the price can bump up though. EBC has its own in-house paint facility that allows customers to create truly one-of-a-kind e-bikes with custom paint jobs. Then there’s a huge array of accessories from baskets and racks to cup holders, GPS trackers, and more. Even components like a single-speed or seven-speed drivetrain or an upgraded suspension fork can be customized. So don’t be surprised if the price floats up several hundred dollars if you get fancy with your customization options. But for the base level model at $1,799, you’re getting a well-made and excellent riding e-bike built by fellow Americans earning a living wage, and all for a fair price.It still amazes me that you can build such good e-bikes in the US for under two grand, but I’m not about to start complaining!Whatever formula EBC has landed on, it is definitely working for them.But enough of me yammering. Let’s hear what you think of the Model E in the comments section below. And before you leave, check out my video below giving a behind-the-scenes walk-through of EBC’s Newport Beach-based factories to get a better sense of each step in the production process.",ebikes
2022/03/21,"Electrek had the chance to tour EUNORAU’s main USA eBike facility earlier this month. This Chinese importer has undergone a transformation from a white-label startup to a recognized USA brand in its own right. It was a great opportunity to meet some of the people who have steadily built the company at their workplace.If you’re wondering what the word ‘EUNORAU’ is, you’re not alone. The name is a mix of the first sounds from the words: Europe, North America, and Australia. In Mandarin, it winds up sounding like “you know row” (优诺若 Yōu nuò ruò). The unique name is to convey that this company ships to these places around the globe. About half of the company’s bike business is in the USA, if you’re curious.We’ve covered many EUNORAU bikes here on Electrek. More recently, we reviewed the Defender S. This fat tire, dual motor, dual suspension beast definitely falls in the “more is more” mindset. Conversely, we’ve also covered the announcement of its sleek roadster electric bike with looks that could kill. Even with these bookend bikes of its lineup, EUNROAU specializes in bargain versions of popular electric bikes.Touring the facility was a trip to a castle built from bike boxes. From floor to ceiling the warehouse was stocked up on the first wave of orders for the coming riding season – everything from trikes to mountain bikes, cruisers, camo-clad hunting bikes, scooters, and stacks of spare parts. EUNORAU says that it can get orders throughout North America in about a week or less. The location we visited is one of four locations in North America that ships out bikes and parts to customers.Service needs are also handled here, where the staff is armed with spare parts and even spare bikes. Next door is a fully operational bicycle service center, including custom battery repair, which EUNORAU leans on from time to time. While this tour wasn’t terribly eventful on the business side, there’s a lot to talk about on the customer-facing side. Really, it was a backward mullet: business in the back, party in the front!If you’re in the Las Vegas area, you can schedule a time to visit EUNORAU for yourself. Although the company has a tiny showroom, it’s packed with all sorts of electric bikes to try out. The current and popular line of bikes is right in front, ready for a quick spin around the block. These 10 or so bikes were fun and all, but I had even more fun in the other room, where EUNORAU has a wealth of older bikes and prototypes that didn’t make it to market (…yet…?). While I was there I tried out a two-seat mini-bike, a pink 1,000w fat tire beast, a torque-sensing hybrid that fits like a glove, and a folding bike that I think I’ve seen before somewhere.Overall, I had a lot of fun meeting the staff and seeing a bit behind the curtain of this international eBike importer. What I will remember from this trip was trying out new and interesting bikes, seeing the different directions this company might go in the future. Stay tuned to Electrek, where we’ll be coving the upcoming EUNORAU D6, along with other news and reviews.",ebikes
2022/03/18,"EUNORAU, a value-oriented electric bike maker, is back again with a new model of e-bike. The new EUNORAU D6 might the brand’s lightest model yet, taking the form of something between a road bike and a gravel bike.The 18 kg (39.7 lbs.) EUNORAU D6 electric bike is quite lightweight, at least by e-bike standards.And with a promotional introductory price of $1,199, it’s one of the cheapest electric gravel or road e-bikes we’ve seen yet, barely edging out the Ride1Up Roadster V2 gravel edition.But despite the low weight, the D6 still manages to come loaded with some very nice parts, like a 250 mid-drive motor feature a torque sensor. The real power of that motor may be higher, but the bike is sold internationally and thus these motors are normally listed at “250 watts” to meet strict European power limitation.The 60Nm rating of the motor is a better gauge of true performance since torque figures are not regulated. At 60Nm, it has higher than average performance compared to most other electric road bikes.The drive system uses both a torque sensor and a cadence sensor that measures wheel speed 104 times per rotation. Most cadence sensors in e-bikes measure pedal speed just 12 times per rotation. The higher-precision cadence sensor combined with the torque sensor should provide much more intuitive and responsive motor application compared to most low-cost electric bikes.The removable battery is rated for 360Wh of capacity and sits down inside the downtube, making for a sleek yet removable pack.EUNORAU claims a range of 50-75 km (31-47 miles), which is certainly reasonable in the lower power settings. Since there’s no throttle on this model, it will be hard to pull too much power out of that moderately sized battery at once.That responsive pedal assist will likely be plenty for most riders, as these types of e-bikes are more common among cyclists-turned-e-bikers. The electric assist can be useful for pushing out on longer exercise rides or just giving a little extra help on steep hills, with the rider still doing the brunt of the pedaling himself or herself.The US version will reach 20 mph (32 km/h), while the European version of the bike will be limited to just 15.5 mph (25 km/h) to comply with local regulations. Both models can of course be pedaled faster, but you’ll be on your own at higher speeds without any extra motor assist.The EUNORAU D6 is rated for a max load of 150 kg (330 lb) and comes with hydraulic disc brakes, a choice of a Shimano 9 or 11 speed drivetrain, flat or drop bars, 700x28C road tires, a color LCD screen, and a smartphone app for ride data.The bike is available in two frames sizes and four color options.EUNORAU is taking pre-orders for the $1,199 e-bike on Indiegogo, and the campaign started this morning. Here at Electrek, we only cover crowdfunding campaigns if the company has a history of delivering similar products or if we’re able to test the new product in advance.In this case, EUNORAU has pedaled around the block several times, claiming to have delivered over 100,000 e-bikes so far. We’ve also tested a handful of other models from the company. While pre-orders are already open, the EUNORAU D6 won’t start production for another two months, and deliveries are estimated to begin in September.What do you think of the D6?

2022/03/17,"Leading Dutch electric bike manufacturer VanMoof says it will announce “something new” on April 5. All signs point to it being the next generation of VanMoof’s sleekly designed urban e-bikes. And we may already be getting a look at them in a video teaser from the company.VanMoof’s cofounder Taco Carlier announced onstage at SXSW that April 5 would be the date we’d all get to see VanMoof’s next electric models.The company’s website was then updated with more info:“All new, all electric. Are you ready for what’s next? We can’t wait to introduce you to the new generation of VanMoof e-bikes on April 5, 2022.”But the best info yet may come from the video embedded in VanMoof’s teaser page.It’s an orbiting view around a VanMoof e-bike, as you can see below.Immediate differences from VanMoof’s current X3 and S3 e-bikes are apparent.Besides a new colorway, the detailed views of the headlight and taillight look updated. The two lights now feature an LED halo around the outside and side cutouts that likely help improve side visibility for cars approaching at 90 degrees to the rider.The rear chainstay certainly looks modified, though it’s a bit unclear how or why. Touch points including the bars and saddle look similar, though the teaser makes them a bit hard to gauge.The company also shared a couple of GIFs in email teasers sent out on VanMoof’s mailing list.The GIFs show a few more updates, like a clearly reworked rear dropout that sees the kick-lock button shifted higher.There’s of course no word on performance or features, but we expect VanMoof to come out swinging fairly hard. The current edition of the bikes include automatic gear shifting, hydraulic disc brakes, an innovative kick lock to immobilize the rear wheel, wireless connectivity, a unique dot matrix-style top tube display, built-in anti-theft alarm and Find My integration with Apple, to name a few of the nicer features. All of those and more are expected on VanMoof’s next-generation e-bikes.Electrek’s own Seth Weintraub got up close and personal with a current-gen VanMoof S3 to test out the unique technology firsthand.VanMoof has also shown off a 30+ mph hyper e-bike known as the VanMoof V, though this unveiling is unlikely to be that model.We’ve already seen concept art for the VanMoof V (below), and it is a much more ambitious two-wheeler, complete with full-suspension and moto-inspired tires.The model has over 10,000 reservations, so there’s obviously some serious demand in the market for it. But VanMoof has said that the bike is only “expected by the end of 2022,” so there’s no telling when we’ll actually see it.In the meantime, VanMoof’s next-generation e-bikes look like a more sure bet.",ebikes
2022/03/16,"The Veego 750 from Florida-based RideScoozy may not look like a powerhouse at first glance, but this e-bike rocks some serious giddy-up. Combined with its nice loadout of comfortable touch points and quality components, the Veego 750 makes for an awesome ride that doesn’t skimp on the performance.I previously checked out the former version of the Veego 750 a few years ago, but RideScoozy has made some serious upgrades since then. The bike started out great, but the new updates make it an ever better offer – and an even better deal.I’ve seen a lot of comfort e-bikes, and I’ve seen a lot of powerful e-bikes, but I rarely see them combined so well, and that’s exactly what the Veego 750 offers.The true 750W motor really offers a peak power output of 1,400W thanks to that 52V electrical system and high current controller. This means that the bike can dump a lot of power at the twist of the throttle for speedy acceleration or more powerful hill climbing. The motor’s 80 Nm of torque make quick work of both. The bike also gets up to 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist, making it a Class 3 e-bike – or, you can stick to Class 2 throttle operation at 20 mph. Whatever floats your boat.But the bike isn’t just a hot rod – it’s also a comfortable cruiser. The Cloud-9 saddle is about as big as cruiser saddles can get. Between the soft material, padded sections, and the springs underneath the saddle, you’re basically settling your caboose into a cloud – then, the front air suspension fork helps smooth out the front end, and the big 4″ wide tires soak up anything the suspension or saddle miss.The tires have a lot of air volume thanks to their fat tire nature, but the 20″ diameter is still fairly small to keep the bike nimble. It also reduces the bike’s height meaning a lower possible saddle height; RideScoozy says it will fit riders from 5’4″ to 6’2″. The step-through design makes the bike easy to mount as well, especially for shorter riders. But even taller folks will enjoy not needling to throw a long, gangly leg over the entire bike.I also love the way the rims use a cast wheel design instead of spoked wheels., which means that you never have to deal with spoke maintenance, and in my opinion it just looks cooler too.The bike doesn’t necessarily fold in the traditional sense, but the handlebars do fold down. That makes the bike shorter, meaning you might be able to slide it under a desk or table.Another note about the bike’s design is the frame-integrated rear rack. It’s extra sturdy because it’s not a bolt-on rack, but rather it’s part of the frame. They say it can support up to 100 lb (45 kg), so that means you can easily get a seat on back for carrying kids, or potentially even a very lightweight adult (though there aren’t any footpegs for adult feet).I hate to keep saying, “But wait, there’s more!”. But there really is. The list of nice parts just keeps going on. There are hydraulic disc brakes for low-maintenance and high power stoppers. There are included fenders so they won’t nickel and dime you for adding fenders to the bike. The LED lights are nice and bright, not just dinky lights that check the box but don’t throw much of a beam.And I haven’t even gotten to the battery yet! The dang thing is massive at 910 Wh. The 52V system means it has more power than a typical 48V battery (though its only about 7-8% more power than a 48V battery – some people might not feel the difference). But the 17.5 Ah is definitely perceptible because it means extra long range. They say 30-50 miles, and that’s absolutely doable. On throttle-only riding at 20 mph, a big ol’ battery like this can easily net you 30 miles of range. If you want to add some pedal assist, you can go even further.At the bike’s price of $1,999 (currently on sale from the $2,299 MSRP), this is a solid option. Yes, there are cheaper e-bikes out there. I know someone’s going to throw the Lectric XP 2.0 at me in the comments, but I’d argue that the Veego’s price makes it worth it thanks to its nearly twice as much power and twice as much range, plus high quality parts like the hydraulic disc brakes and super comfortable saddle. Those upgrades give you a better riding experience that lasts longer and is frankly more fun. This isn’t a budget e-bike, and so if you’re looking for bang-for-your-buck, there are more affordable options out there. But as a high quality yet still affordable fat tire e-bike, the Veego 750 sticks the landing in pretty much every metric.",ebikes
2022/03/15,"SUPER73’s highly anticipated (and then cancelled, and then rescheduled, and then delayed a bit again today) debut occurred just minutes ago in Los Angeles. The brand had teased multiple new electric bicycle models and hinted at a light electric motorcycle. Fortunately for anyone who values their e-bikes with an extra side or two of excess, SUPER73 delivered. The SUPER73-C1X electric motorcycle concept was unveiled alongside a new entry-level Z-series e-bike, an updated R-Series bike, and a new kid’s electric balance bike.Anyone who is familiar with SUPER73 already knows that the brand walks a fine line somewhere between “high-powered electric bicycles” and “electric motorcycles that you can park at the bike rack”. Look no further than the 2,000W and 30+ mph R-Series electric bikes that SUPER73 unveiled as the brand’s first full-suspension models.But now the new SUPER73-C1X ratchets up the power even further, in the process kicking away the pedals and any remaining electric bicycle charade with them.Instead of a high-powered electric bicycle, the C1X gives us a low-powered naked electric motorcycle. SUPER73’s disclaimer underlines the fact this ain’t your typical e-bike anymore: “License, Registration, & Insurance Required”.Taking it a step further, CEO LeGrand Crewse described it on stage as the “natural evolution of a SUPER73.”The smallish size and 31″ seat height puts it closer to a Honda Grom than a full-sized street bike, and the smaller-format 15″ wheels should keep it fairly nimble. The bike should be lighter than full-size motorcycles as well, as the company says it has a “target weight of under 300 lb.”The C1X features a mid-mounted motor, though the company has not yet released a power figure for the motor. SUPER73 did say that it should get riders up to a max speed of “over 75 mph,” or at least 120 km/h for anyone keeping track across the pond. SUPER73 opted for a chain drive on the C1X, so don’t expect this to be a silent electric motorcycle. Unlike most e-motos that use belt drives, chain-driven electric motorcycles tend to have a bit more chainsaw sound than motor whirr.There’s no word yet on how large the battery pack on the SUPER-C1X is, but the company claims it can eke out a maximum city range of 100 miles (160 km). What’s the range at its top speed of 75 mph? Your guess is as good as ours, but around half of that figure or less would be a wise wager.Recharging should be fairly quick though, as the company claims an 80% charge in less than an hour. Adding to the lack of information released for the C1X is the price. SUPER73 didn’t reveal a final figure for the brand’s first street-legal motorcycle, but they are taking $73 deposits for reservations. Production is expected to begin in “late 2023.”The SUPER73-R Brooklyn was unveiled as the latest full-suspension e-bike in the brand’s lineup. While the previous R-series e-bikes from the brand have had a more off-road focus, the Brooklyn model will be destined for road use. The street-specific SUPER73 LZRD tires and new handlebar should combine to offer better road performance.The bike also includes a healthy combination of new components as well as popular retained features, as the company explained:“The SUPER73-R Brooklyn now includes a front and rear lighting package plus a horn – items that were previously reserved for the RX. The R Brooklyn also gets air assist for its inverted coil spring fork to enhance comfort and control, while its two-piston hydraulic brakes are retained. As before, the SUPER73-R Brooklyn has a powerful internally geared brushless DC hub motor capable of 2300 watts peak output. Powered by a state-of-the-art 960 watt-hour battery, the R can deliver more than 40 miles of range at 20 mph under throttle activation, or in excess of 75 miles using ECO pedal assist mode, selected via the SUPER73 phone app.”The bike may get 40 miles of range at 20 mph, but many riders will surely be keen to unlock its top speed to a more thrilling 28+ mph.The new Super73 Z-Miami may look like a familiar Z1 e-bike like we’ve seen before, but it sports some key updates.A removable battery, new tire tread pattern, new lightweight aluminum frame, and novel paint colors adorn the updated bike.The bike also sports some healthy performance, as the company explained:“The internally geared brushless DC hub motor is capable of 1200 watts of peak power. Coupled to a durable 615 watt-hour removable battery, the SUPER73-Z Miami is capable of providing more than 30 miles of range at 20 mph under throttle-only operation, or approximately 50 miles of range using ECO pedal assist mode via the selectable riding modes in the SUPER73 phone app. Additionally, it will be supplied pre-wired for easy installation of optional accessory lighting.”SUPER73’s new electric bike for kids is a bit more motorcycle than balance bike, though SUPER73 CEO LeGrand Crewse certainly pitched it as a balance bike to help kids ages 4-8 learn to ride a bike and develop key balancing skills on a two-wheeler.The bike features a right-side twist throttle, low seat height, large foot platforms, and an adorable little removable battery with 60 minutes of ride time. There’s even a hydraulic disc brake setup on the rear – a surprisingly nice component for a kids’ bike.There are multiple parent-controlled ride modes that should allow moms and dads to adjust the ride intensity as junior’s skills improve.With a maximum rider height listed as 48″ inches, it seems some bigger kids might be able to enjoy it for more than just “learning.” Cruising the block on the tiniest little electric motorcycle you’ve ever seen sounds like a hoot.Better get your parents to pay for it though – the Youth Series will be priced at $995.The design of the C1x is definitely going to be divisive. In fact, SUPER73’s EU website accidentally leaked the design when someone found a cached version of the C1X’s launch page and posted it on the SUPER73 subreddit. The mods made quick work of taking the Reddit post down, but not before comments poured in largely panning the bike’s aesthetics.Then comes the price. It was always going to be tough for SUPER73 to compete on price – it’s just not in the company’s playbook. SUPER73 has always charged a premium over comparably performing bikes like those from Ariel Rider. Then you have to consider that something like CSC’s City Slicker electric motorcycle, which does nearly 50 mph (80 km/h), is priced at just $2,795. Not to mention a more comparably-spec’d Kollter ES1, which can do 75 mph (120 km/h) for just $5,995. Without yet knowing what SUPER73 will charge, it remains impossible to say if it can compete with the many new entrants into this growing market. But with world markets in a tailspin and the company likely keenly aware of SONDORS’ Metacycle debacle, not announcing a price until the years-out production grows closer was probably a wise move.The Youth Series is an interesting move for the company. I’m not sure how much of a need there was for an e-bike in the ages 4-8 demographic, but I sure do want to try riding that little thing.The Brooklyn version of the R-Series definitely seems like a nice move, as that bike is going to be a great e-moto in an e-bike package for street commuters.All in all, SUPER73 had some solid showings. Now the waiting game begins to see if we ever get a C1X and if it comes in at a reasonable price.",ebikes
2022/03/15,"The multiple award-winning Honbike is just about as steep of a departure from typical electric bicycles as I can find. Having tested hundreds of different e-bikes, the Honbike is unique in so many different ways that it marks a refreshing new entry to the market. Now launching on Indiegogo, we got to test out the revolutionary new driveshaft e-bike ahead of time to let you know if it’s worth a second look.Spoiler alert: It definitely is, *if* you’re a city dweller.While there’s a lot to take in on the Honbike, the single biggest technical difference between it and all the other e-bikes out there is the driveshaft transmission. There’s no chain or belt-drive on this one – just a spinning shaft sealed away inside a protective case. They say it will keep you rolling maintenance free for 40,000 km (25,000 miles), which is probably longer than anyone will actually own the thing. Assuming a 10-mile commute five days a week, that’s 10 years of riding.But this is more than just a driveshaft e-bike. Check out all the awesome features that make this e-bike unique in my test riding video below. Then read on for my full thoughts on the Honbike.The Honbike comes from a Japanese design that won several international awards and has now been reworked for a European and North American audience. In fact, the Japanese model was so successful that some companies apparently jacked the design to rebadge it internationally, trying to beat Honbike to the punch. The motor power has been increased from the 200W Japanese version to the EU limit of 250W (there’s no higher power version for the US market). It also received a few other upgrades, like a triple sensor for the pedal assist (more on that in a moment), increased height in the seat tube for taller Westerners, and foldable pedals with a new folding stand.The little Honbike is surprisingly tech-savy.That triple sensor pedal assist I mentioned makes the e-bike extra responsive. There’s not only a cadence sensor to measure pedal speed and a torque sensor to measure how hard the rider is pedaling, but there’s also a gyroscope sensor. That gyro is used to measure the hill incline and apply extra power when attacking a hill. It’s something we’ve only seen in high-end electric bikes before, and even then it’s not very common.More than just the electronics though, the e-bike features an innovative design.The Japanese engineers must have taken an origami influence, because the bike folds up nice and tight. It also features a cool little flip-out stand to support it in the folded position (separate from the normal kickstand to support it in the unfolded position).The wheels are single-side supported, which is part of what gives it that unique look. The front wheel gets a “righty” fork, while the rear wheel is supported on the left side. There’s no suspension, but this is very much an urban e-bike, so suspension wasn’t necessarily a requirement.The lack of suspension helps keep the bike fairly lightweight, at just 20 kg or 44 lb. Compared to many folding e-bikes, that’s a solid 25-50% lighter than we’re used to seeing.Then there are all the unique components on the bike. Check out that saddle. I have no idea why they needed to reinvent the saddle, but it looks pretty awesome, in a funny/quirky way. I thought it would feel weird, but to be honest it feels fine. There’s no nub between your thighs, which will likely feel nicer for some people. It’s more like sitting on a stool. Sure, it takes a day or two to get used to, but then it just feels fairly normal.The brake levers are also novel and take a bit of getting used to. They have their fulcrum on the opposite side, meaning the longer part of the throw is more towards the center of the bars. Since I like to do one or two-finger braking, that actually works pretty well.The real winner on the Honbike is the design and folding, not the performance. The performance is fine, but nothing more than a typical folding e-bike with European-level specs.The speed tops out at 15.5 mph, which is the 25 km/h EU standard. It’d be nice to have a US version that went faster to 20 mph, but maybe that will come in the future. As it stands, 15.5 mph isn’t bad for city riding, especially when you’ve got a nice bike lane or trail. If you’re trying to share the lane with traffic and keep up with cars, 15.5 mph feels mighty slow.The driveshaft means it is a single-speed, and I have to imagine that the 20 mph speed would have your legs spinning pretty fast.The range is also mediocre due to the small battery. The 216 Wh battery is tiny, which is nice when you want to carry it in your bag without taking up much space. But if you use the highest power level, it will drain quickly. You can get the advertised 40 km (25 miles) range if you stick to the lowest pedal assist level, but most people will find themselves somewhere in the middle, which means you can’t ride quite as far.Again though, this is an urban e-bike. Most people aren’t riding more than 10 miles in the city, so the Honbike certainly has more than enough capacity for that. A bigger battery would mean better long-range cruises for leisure or recreational riding, but I just can’t see anyone getting this specific e-bike for that use. There are too many other recreational e-bikes out there.So for the type of riding it is designed for, the Honbike makes a lot of sense. It has city specs to get you through your commute with ease, plus the zero-maintenance drivetrain. The included fenders, bell, and other commuter niceties also increase the utility for city riders.But the real winner here is the price, at least with the Indiegogo pre-sales. While the Honbike’s MSRP of US $2,399 feels a bit high, there’s a $1,100 discount if you pre-order on Indiegogo. At $1,299, that’s a much better deal! There’s an extra US $100 shipping fee (or €100 fee in the EU), but that’s still a nice deal for a unique and innovative electric folding bike, if that’s what you’re after.I already know there will be people in my comment section saying “why don’t you get a faster e-bike for less money?!” but that’s kind of missing the point. No one is claiming that Honbike offers the best $/watt ratio here. That’s the beauty of having such a diverse e-bike market. If you want something unique, lightweight, easy to fold, and easy to use, the Honbike does it for a song. If you want to hit 30 mph or ramp over pot holes with fat tires, then you’ll need to look elsewhere.",ebikes
2022/03/14,"The Babymaker II electric bike from FLX was unveiled last month when it went on pre-sale, and it shocked the market with more than just an edgy name and low price. The bike was also said to be destined for US manufacturing in Detroit, Michigan. Now that early production has begun, and we’re getting a behind the scenes look at just what goes into assembling these e-bikes in the US. FLX certainly isn’t the first company to claim US assembly of e-bikes. We’ve had the chance to check out locally built e-bikes from California-based Electric Bike Company, plus other companies like FattE-bikes and WattWagons boast US manufacturing as well.But the proof is in the pudding, and that’s what FLX founder Rob Rast tried to show in the company’s latest video, which is said to be filmed in FLX’s Detroit-based manufacturing facility.In this case though, the video largely focuses on the inspection steps of the e-bikes, as opposed to sharing concrete details regarding any nascent assembly line for the Babymaker II electric bikes.Quality control via rigorous inspection is of course an important step, and it’s arguably one of the biggest advantages of building locally in the US.As Rob explains:“There are several quality control processes here. One is at the factory of origin where these parts are built. Those are examined before they ship out. And then when they get here, we inspect them again – that’s called an ‘entry inspection’ – and comb out any parts that have been damaged in shipping or were missed in the first inspection. They’re inspected again when they are assembled into the bikes, and finally once completely assembled there is a final inspection.Many of the rejected components seem to suffer from cosmetic issues like chipped paint, surface scratches or blemishes in the rim finish.One example shows a wheel with a cross-threaded bolt hanging out of the front hub. That is presumably an assembly error and not something that was caught as part of an entry inspection. If not, you have to wonder how something like that made it out of the factory of origin in Asia.We then see how the final bikes are inspected, covering most of the components from the hydraulic disc brakes and handlebar mount to the trueness of the wheels and tension of the Gates carbon belt. What we don’t really see is the actual assembly of the e-bikes, which are currently still taking pre-orders. That begs the question, “What goes on in between parts delivery and final inspection?” That’s a seriously large portion of the build process that seems to be conspicuously absent from the video.We do briefly see racks of wheels that appear destined for assembly on bikes, but no actual assembly takes place during the video.Another odd note is that the factory appears to be half full of Bird’s electric scooters. Multiple models of Bird scooters are seen in the background, including dozens of seemingly brand new electric scooters lined up next to open boxes.It could be that this is also a depot used by Bird, with both companies renting space. However, it seems a bit odd that there isn’t any form of partition between the various operations from different companies.With any luck, we’ll get to learn more about the actual assembly process to see how much is performed locally and how much production occurs in advance in Asia.Until then, let’s hear your thoughts on what we know so far from this behind-the-scenes look at the Babymaker II’s production facilities. Feel free to share your opinions in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/03/13,"Gazelle Bikes, a popular Netherlands-based bicycle manufacturer, is reintroducing the company’s Arroyo electric bikes for US customers.The Arroyo line of electric bicycles, which includes the Arroyo C7 and Arroyo C8, is a comfort e-bike line that likely aligns with the image in your head of a typical Dutch bike.That means a step-through frame for easy mounting, upright handlebars for a tall and laid-back ride, and big wheels to roll over uneven road material or potholes.Both bikes available in this model line include frame-integrated 500 Wh removable batteries that offer a sleeker design, unlike the eyesore of bolt-on batteries that sit on top of the frame. The two models come with Bosch Active Line Plus mid-drive motors with 50 Nm of torque that propel them to a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) on pedal assist. There is no throttle available on these models, so riders will need to select from several different levels of pedal assist that range from a gentle boost to more powerful motor assistance. The two models of e-bikes also include racks, fenders, adjustable handlebar stems, rear wheel locks, and LED lights as standard equipment.The Arroyo line is popular with those looking for a comfortable, relaxing ride experience, as Gazelle North America’s General Manager Ewoud van Leeuwen explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“We are thrilled to be reintroducing the beloved Arroyo line to North America. This iconic ‘easy category’ bike boasts our most accessible frame and comfortable seating posture, especially appealing for older riders, people with more limited mobility, riders who carry a lot of cargo, or anyone simply seeking a relaxed ride experience. We have preserved the best parts of this bike, from the classic shape to the cushy components, while making meaningful updates, like the introduction of hydraulic disc brakes, to better meet the needs of this market.”The Gazelle Arroyo C7 and Arroyo C8 offer unique loadouts that will fit slightly different budgets.The more entry-level Arroyo C7 offers a “lightweight suspension fork” and basic LED lighting, while the higher-end C8 swaps in a nicer unicrown suspension fork and adds a suspension seat post. The C8 also features “fendervision” lighting, where the LED headlight is actually housed within the fender assembly. For transmissions, the C7 gets a seven-speed Shimano Nexus internally geared rear hub, while the C8 has a similar hub transmission in the eight-speed variant. Both bikes offer hydraulic disc brakes. The bikes are each available in three sizes, with the C7 priced at US $3,299 and the C8 priced at US $3,699.",ebikes
2022/03/09,"SUPER73 definitely has something coming next week; we just don’t know what. But a new teaser released by the lifestyle electric bike brand sets the date for March 15 and hints that it could be the company’s highly anticipated (and yet unconfirmed) electric motorcycle.While we haven’t been able to confirm that SUPER73 has an electric motorcycle in the works, signs point to it being a pretty good bet.The SoCal e-bike company originally teased a big announcement to take place at CES 2022 in early January, but that unveiling was canceled amid the surging Omicron variant and a considerably toned-down CES convention.The original teaser ahead of CES showed off what appeared to be an electric motorcycle formed into a neon light sign, fueling speculation that SUPER73 was headed in a larger direction.At the time, SUPER73 shared that “the company plans to turn two-wheeled transportation on its head by unveiling a bold new concept, segment-busting new models, as well as new accessories and apparel lines.”SUPER73 has fairly consistently rolled out new versions of its electric bikes over the past several years, so the new models themselves didn’t sound like too much of a surprise. The “segment-busting” description certainly piques my curiosity, though I think it’s fair to describe all of SUPER73’s current electric bikes as “segment busting” already.That “bold new concept” that the company mentioned was the real kicker. It was widely believed to be a possible electric motorcycle, perhaps something akin to an ONYX electric moped or even a City Slicker light electric motorcycle.SUPER73’s latest teaser shows off four dimly lit e-bikes shrouded in fog. In true teaser fashion, SUPER73 has done its best to show us as much of the bikes as possible while revealing as little as possible. I can’t tell you how many times I paused and replayed the 15-second clip, but I’m fairly confident these four bikes are all based on the SUPER73-R platform. They’re all outfitted with top tube batteries, and I’m pretty sure I can make out a fuzzy rear shock on all of them, which again fits the R platform.The full-suspension R platform was first unveiled in 2020 and opened the door for higher-performance e-bikes from the brand.None of the bikes in the teaser appear to be a potential SUPER73 electric motorcycle platform. That means that if I was a betting man, SUPER73 may also be releasing a new high-end electric bike on the R-platform, or something similar. The SUPER73 universe is about to expand…set your clocks, mark your calendars, flip your hourglass, and sign up for our emails so you’re not left in the dust…3.15.22 ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/rWZj0TcPkaThen of course we’ve still got that potential electric motorcycle hanging over our heads.Again, if I were a betting man, I’d put my money on some type of electric moped akin to ONYX or Huck Cycles. While it would be awesome to see SUPER73 come out with something that could challenge the SONDORS Metacycle or NIU RQi, that would be a big leap for the electric bicycle company.Sure, their electric bikes are arguably electric mopeds or light electric motorbikes already. But they’re still very much electric bicycles, both nominally and functionally. SONDORS shocked the industry when it unveiled the affordably priced Metacycle electric motorcycle concept, but 14 months later the bike is well behind schedule and we haven’t heard of any updates in months. SUPER73 surely doesn’t want to wind up in the same quagmire.So either they’ve got a legitimate electric motorcycle and have waited before revealing their hand as early as SONDORS did, or they’ve got an electric moped that will be much easier to produce as it would essentially be just a step or two up the power and manufacturing ladder compared to the brand’s existing R-series e-bikes.Or I could be wrong about all of this. I guess we’ll find out in five days.While we wait to see just what SUPER73 has up its sleeve, I’ll leave you with the video above of my wife and I having a blast testing out the company’s last debut, the SUPER73-ZX.And be sure to leave your thoughts in the comments section below, letting us know what you think SUPER73 will unveil next week.",ebikes
2022/03/09,"Rad Power Bikes didn’t become the largest electric bicycle company in North America by resting on its laurels. The Seattle-based company has been hard at work on a new model to be added to the lineup. The RadExpand 5 electric bike has just been unveiled, and it comes with an attractive price of just US $1,299.That price makes it the second most affordable model in Rad’s lineup’s, right after the $1,199 RadMission. But unlike the RadMission, the RadExpand 5 comes with Rad’s highest power motor at 750W and highest capacity battery at 624Wh, plus a seven-speed transmission.That means the RadExpand 5 will offer similar performance levels to the rest of Rad’s Class 2 e-bike lineup. A top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) will be possible with both the bike’s half-twist hand throttle and its cadence sensor-based pedal assist.The range rating is estimated at 25-45 miles (40-72 km) depending on the type of riding, speed and terrain. If the RadExpand 5 looks a bit like the RadMini, that’s no mistake. It draws upon much of that bike’s DNA and will actually be replacing the RadMini and RadMini Step-Through models in Rad’s lineup.With fat tires and a folding frame, the RadExpand 5 incorporates much of what consumers loved about the original RadMini. To help shave off some of that bike’s price and poundage, the RadExpand 5 also removes a few parts.While you still get a -speed transmission and it doesn’t go full single-speed like the RadRunner, you do get a solid fork and simplified LED display like you’ll find on the RadRunner.The fat tires should likely help make up for the lack of suspension, as that increased air volume provides a cushier ride than typical narrower bicycle tires.Removing the suspension fork was also part of helping to shave off around 4.5 lb (2 kg) of weight compared to the RadMini. The RadExpand 5 tips the scales at 62.5 lb (28.3 kg).Other unique upgrades include fatter 4″ tires than the RadMini’s 3″ tires and a new handlebar adjustment method, allowing riders to adjust the handlebars forwards and backwards rather than just up or down. That adjustment will likely be more useful in real world applications as it helps adjust for longer or shorter arm lengths. The updated LED headlight and tail light are both photosensitive, so they’ll automatically turn on at night when you need them.There’s a new headtube angle that should provide more relaxed handling, and the bike also includes a rear rack and fenders in the $1,299 price (or CAD $1,499 for our neighbors to the north). Rad has typically not provided included fenders or racks on its lower-priced bikes like the RadMission. The base-level RadRunner also comes without fenders, though it does include a rack since it is part of the bike’s frame. The inclusion of fenders and the rear rack on the RadExpand 5 provides added functionality and saves riders over $100 in would-be accessory charges to add those features. We’ve of course already got a RadExpand 5 on order for review so we can let you know how the new e-bike rides. But until then, we’ll be interested to hear your thoughts on the new e-bike in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/03/08,"When I think of Tern and its popular electric cargo e-bikes, I think of two things: Incredible quality and incredibly expensive. But with the launch of its latest model today, the Tern Quick Haul, one of those things is fading away, and it’s not the quality.The new Tern Quick Haul electric bike is the brand’s latest entry into the growing electric cargo and electric utility bike market.The e-bike combines impressive cargo-hauling abilities with a small format to provide a serious car replacement candidate for urban riders.Rolling on 20″ wheels, it has a smaller footprint than a typical full-size bike, yet it can carry more gear or passengers. And it’s not only smaller in its typical footprint, but it can actually be parked standing on its tail thanks to Tern’s innovative rear rack. That can help it fit in a tiny elevator (think: Paris apartment) or in the corner of a small room or office. That rear rack also provides plenty of room for strapping down gear, adding passenger seats, or even using Tern’s pet-carrying accessories. It’s the SUV of the electric bicycle world, yet in a somehow conveniently-sized package.Tern’s Team Captain Josh Hon did an awesome job summing up exactly what type of uses e-bike the Quick Haul was designed for:“The Quick Haul is how an e-bike optimized for city life should be designed. It should have a low step through frame for convenience, it should have plenty of room to carry stuff or even an extra passenger, and it should be built tough, so you can count on it for reliable long-term usage. And it should be compact so it can easily navigate stairwells, elevators, crowded bike parking areas, and busy streets.”The Quick Haul is designed to carry loads of up to 150 kg (330 lb). And they surely can’t say this themselves, but you know if their lawyers will let them state that it can carry that much, they probably loaded twice that weight on it during testing. Tern often shows its electric cargo bikes carrying kids, but I can vouch for the fact that they can carry adults on the back too. Josh Hon even took me for a spin on a GSD once, and it was perhaps even more fun (and a lot less responsibility) to watch life going by from the back seat.In fact, to ensure safety under such heavy loads, Tern even applies its e-bikes to the most rigorous testing standards in the industry.As Josh continued, Tern places serious importance on holding itself to a higher standard:“We put our bikes through some of the toughest tests in the industry, and often, we design even more severe tests when we think existing standards aren’t tough enough.”You may already be familiar with the Tern HSD and GSD electric bikes, two incredibly well-outfitted models that we’ve featured before. But those e-bikes are quite pricey, starting at nearly $4k and increasing quickly from there. But the new Tern Quick Haul will start at US $2,999 in the US and €2,999 in Europe when it becomes available in Q2 of this year.That’s a pretty low starting price for any Bosch mid-drive electric bike, let alone one from Tern. It looks like the company was able to get to that low price by cutting out a few of the fancier components we’re used to seeing. There’s no internally geared hub or electronic shifting on the entry-level Quick Haul D8. Instead, we’ve got a Shimano Acera derailleur with an eight-speed drivetrain connected to Bosch’s more affordable Active Line Plus motor. That means the bike will top out at 20 mph (32 km/h) in the US.Upgrading to the US $3,299 Quick Haul P9 nets riders higher speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) thanks to the inclusion of Bosch’s Performance Line or Performance Line Sport (likely depending on the location) motor, plus a nine-speed drivetrain. There will eventually be an even nicer Quick Haul P5i added to the line as well, and that model will feature a Shimano Nexus 5 internally geared hub with a chain or Gates belt drive (likely depending on the specific model chosen upon release).Of note is the fact that at its US $2,999 price, the Quick Haul D8 ekes out the best possible tax credit under the E-BIKE Act, which if passed will provide a 30% tax credit towards the purchase of a new electric bike in the US, up to a $900 benefit. The chance of passage doesn’t look as rosy as it once did, but there’s always hope.",ebikes
2022/03/08,"Arcimoto recently unveiled a fascinating new electric bicycle-like vehicle known as the Mean Lean Machine, or MLM for short. The unveiling left us with plenty of questions about the radical new electric three-wheeler, and Arcimoto has delivered again in the form of a video overview with designer Leo Cruces.Upon its unveiling last week, the MLM was pitched as a major improvement to typical micromobility vehicles like e-bikes and e-scooters. The new vehicle’s novel design was said to offer many advantages that alternatives simply can’t offer.The first major takeaway from Cruces’s showcase is, of course, that the vehicle is a leaning trike. Unlike rigid trikes that have an uncanny ability to toss the rider off of the vehicle during sharp turns, the leaning nature of the MLM retains the intuitive cornering feeling of a typical bicycle.As Cruces explains:The feeling of riding it, it’s very natural just like a bicycle. You have an enormous amount of stability at high speed and low speed.That leaning ability comes to Arcimoto by way of Tilting Motorworks, a company that Arcimoto aquired last year to incorporate its leaning engineering into Arcimoto’s three-wheeled electric vehicles. While we thought at the time that the larger and faster 75 mph FUV could also benefit from the leaning treatment, we now know that Arcimoto is starting smaller with the single or double passenger MLM here.As Cruces continued the walk-around on the squeakiest floor known to man, we also learned a bit more about the power and braking of the MLM, including the fact that it will use torque vectoring.Each wheel is equipped with a high torque hub motor. Torque vectoring will allow us to deliver the exact amount of braking force or driving force that each wheel needs as the vehicle adapts to the conditions of the road. This is will provide greater stability, shorter stopping distance, better turning, and better acceleration.The dual front wheels also seem to make quick work of wet or slippery roads, significantly increasing the traction. In the wet Pacific Northwest of Arcimoto’s Oregon-based factory, that is definitely going to be a big advantage.In terms of traction, your front wheel traction is incredible. I’ve ridden it on gravel, on wet roads, on bumpy stuff. It filters out everything. You kind of forget that the world is slippery and bumpy.Among the many novel features we saw in the MLM upon its unveiling was the drive-by-wire system. The pedals aren’t connected to the wheels by a chain or belt, but instead by an electrical generator as a form of pedal assist system.That also means that the handlebars can be free from clutter, without any visible shifter or throttle. There’s a single input in the form of a right-side brake lever with a single brake cable running down the stem. That seems to imply that acceleration and shifting is all performed somewhere else, as Cruces then confirmed.I don’t have to shift. I don’t have to think about throttle inputs. I just pedal and it goes. The pedal generator is putting useful energy into the drivetrain. It can also be used in stationary mode to recharge the battery without moving the trike.Cruces also revealed that this is in fact the third prototype of the MLM and that it is much closer to the final production version. There will still be several design changes on the final version though, including relocating the battery down inside the body panels to create a sleeker profile and lower the center of gravity. The drivetrain will also be more compact and enclosed.There will eventually be a two-seater saddle option that includes flip-down foot pegs for the second rider’s feet. The design team has already experimented with two-up riding, and Cruces says that the MLM “handles beautifully” with two riders.We also know that the company is targeting a massive range rating of 200 miles (322 km), though that will be with additional auxiliary batteries installed.Those already interested in getting on the waiting list for the MLM can plop down a refundable $100 deposit toward the yet-unknown purchase price.As we wait to learn more about the MLM and hopefully see a production version soon, let’s hear your thoughts on this wild new vehicle in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/03/07,"Stylish urban electric bicycle company Ampler has just unveiled two all-new city e-bike models that offer both work and play options for urban riders. The new Ampler Juna is a relaxed comfort bike for cruising the city, while the new Ampler Axel offers a sportier, more responsive ride that is more likely to strike a chord with daily city commuters.Both bikes are pretty darn sleek looking, featuring hidden batteries and controls to offer a stealthy appearance.The Estonian-based electric bicycle company Ampler is a direct-to-consumer manufacturer that has been building and delivering e-bikes since 2016. They offer some of the lightest and sleekest European-built electric city bikes on the market.Now Ampler is stuffing their new e-bikes with even more features and built-in technology as they also expand their operations further across Europe.As Ampler’s CEO and cofounder Ardo Kaurit explained in a statement provided to Electrek:Launching the second generation marks a huge milestone for Ampler. It celebrates years of development based on our own experience of riding bikes. It combines the learnings from servicing and assembling them including all the feedback we have gathered from thousands of Ampler riders. We call it the second generation because almost everything is new, including fully in-house developed frames and electronics systems built to deliver the full Ampler experience. It is our passion to create electric bikes that serve the urban commuters – bikes that are exciting, long-lasting, safe and built responsibly. I believe we made a big leap towards our goal with the new generation.Both of Ampler’s new models, the Juna and the Axel, include Gates carbon belt drives that replace conventional bicycle chains as well as puncture-resistant 50mm tires. Combined with the hydraulic disc brakes, the bikes have opted for just about every component to be as maintenance-free as possible.The bikes share the same powertrain, consisting of a rear hub motor powered by a torque sensor-based pedal assist system for highly responsive and natural feeling motor assist. A 48V battery with 336 Wh of capacity is hidden in the downtube. It is removable for servicing, but not for daily charging. Instead, the battery is charged inside the bike using a magnetic connector down by the bottom bracket. With the motor hidden by the rear disc rotor, the small waterproof cover on the charger port is one of the few visual cues that the bike features electric assist.The battery is rated for a range of 50-100 km (30-60 miles), with an average of 70 km (43 miles).Both bikes come standard with lights and fenders, but it is the higher-tech features that really help the bikes stand out. GPS connectivity is included with both models, meaning riders can check the current location of their e-bike at all times from Ampler’s smartphone app. If the bike is ever stolen, owners can track its location as well as remotely lock it. The app is also useful for adjusting motor performance and tracking ride statistics.The bikes can also be used without the smartphone app, as they integrate an unobtrusive screen right into the top tube. The screen provides key riding data like battery capacity and power level without cluttering up the handlebars like most e-bikes. The bikes also hide their “On” button underneath the top tube. While the two new Ampler e-bikes share a lot in common, their differences largely come down to their designs and intended uses.The Ampler Axel is definitely what comes to mind when you think of a commuter bike. Weighing in at just 16.3 kg (35.9 lb), the e-bike is ultra-light for a full-featured electric bike. The Ampler Juna isn’t much heavier, at just 16.5 kg (36.4 lb).Unlike the Axel though, the Ampler Juna is all about a relaxed ride. In fact, it’s the most relaxed and upright riding position that Ampler has ever built into its e-bikes. It also features a lower step frame to make it easier to mount and dismount, especially for shorter riders.The Ampler Axel and Juna are both priced at €2,590 (approximately US $2,810), making them some of the more affordable European-produced electric bicycles on the market.Ampler has also continued its physical expansion across Europe with plans to open new showrooms in Amsterdam and Zurich. Those will be added to the existing Ampler showrooms in Tallinn, Estonia; Berlin, and Cologne.The company is also in the process of opening its own brand-new 1,300-square-meter (14,000-square-foot) painting facility in Tallinn. The facility will be used to help Ampler ensure even higher standards of quality control for the durable powder coating on their bike frames.All of Ampler’s bikes are exquisitely built; I know because I’ve thoroughly tested one. Having ridden (and drooled over) the Ampler Stellar, I can tell you that the company’s attention to detail is superb. It goes even further beyond just high-quality fabrication, including nice finishing touches such as a laser-cut wooden case for holding the bike tools and an Ampler chocolate coin included in the owner’s package. Now that’s class!You can see my review of the Ampler Stellar here, or check out the video below.",ebikes
2022/03/05,"Iconic motorcycle company Indian has teamed up with the equally iconic electric bike manufacturer Super73 to leverage the branding of the former with the high power e-bikes of the latter. The result? An Indian-themed e-bike known as the eFTR Hooligan 1.2.No motorcycle license necessary.Indian Motorcycle has teased us with electrification plans in the past.When we first stumbled upon the company’s trademarking of the name eFTR, we thought the company was building a real electric version of their FTR motorcycle.As it turns out, we were way off. The eFTR turned into a kid’s electric dirt bike that was released as a partnership with Razor.Now a new partnership with Super73 is bringing the eFTR badge back, this time on something big enough for adults to ride too.The eFTR Hooligan appears to be largely based on Super73’s well-known S2 electric bike. Here at Electrek, we had the chance to put some serious miles on that bike when we Eurotripped it across Germany last autumn.This is far from a stock S2 though. As Indian explained, it modified the bike by adding the “inverted front forks, mid-height, moto-style handlebars, a unique LED headlight with an FTR-inspired wind deflector, and more aggressive tires.” It appears the eFTR Hooligan 1.2 also loses the stock front and rear fenders, lowers the battery to the downtube (which likely results in improved balance), and added a gold chain to give it that authentic Indian Motorcycle look.The Super73 bones are still there, but they look a lot more Indian now. And that’s exactly what Indian was going for, as explained by Ross Clifford, Vice President of Parts, Garments, and Accessories at Indian Motorcycle:“No other electric bicycle brand has defined itself as vividly as SUPER73. Its moto-culture DNA and outgoing, adventure-seeking passion for two-wheels make them the ideal partner for Indian Motorcycle. But it’s far more than just brand personality. Like us, SUPER73 shares an unwavering commitment to their loyal and passionate customers, as well as to quality and innovation, marked by its sophisticated electric powertrain and an unmistakable product design that resonates with both non-motorcyclists and avid motorcycle riders.”Just don’t expect the eFTR Hooligan 1.2 to ride like any other Indian (or sound like one, either). It rolls on 20″ fat tire bike wheels and zips along nearly silently, despite a powerful electric motor that puts out a peak rated 2,000W of power.It will reach a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle operation, but riders who engage the pedal assist by using the pedals can open up the 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed. That’s the fastest allowable speed by law in the US, which keeps the eFTR Hooligan 1.2 legal as an electric bicycle. That means you won’t need a motorcycle license to ride one.The large 960 Wh battery comes with a rated range of 75 miles (120 km). But if you’re new to the electric bicycle world, you should know that you’ll never actually see 70 miles on a charge.Sure, it’s possible. But that requires keeping the e-bike in its lowest power mode and forgoing that fun throttle. If you plan on riding around at 8 mph on pedal assist for half a day, you might squeeze out the max range. But if you’re like the rest of us and can’t resist that fun throttle and higher speeds, expect to get a lower range in the 20-40 mile ballpark.Even so, that 960 Wh battery is much larger than the average battery pack in today’s e-bike market. So you’ll have plenty of power for hours of fun.That’s fairly standard for Super73, which has built its reputation on fun, sexy, and powerful e-bikes that offer better performance than most of their competitors. The bulky e-bikes are built with a moped or motorcycle influence as compared to most city or mountain-style e-bikes we regularly see on the streets and trails. And that makes Super73 a natural partner for Indian.As Super73’s Co-Founder and CMO Michael Cannavo explained:“With a rich heritage and racing DNA dating back more than a century, Indian Motorcycle is among a rare group of brands that can truly be defined as an ‘American original,’ and the team did an incredible job redesigning the SUPER73-S2 to capture the spirit of the iconic Indian Motorcycle brand. As a company that lives and breathes life on two wheels, everybody at SUPER73 appreciates the significance of Indian Motorcycle’s history, as well as its triumphant return and success in recent years. And that’s why we’re honored to align our brands with the introduction of the eFTR Hooligan 1.2.” The eFTR Hooligan 1.2 won’t come cheap, priced at US $3,999.99 (and available in the next few months at Indian dealers or on Indian’s website). The S2 is already a pricey bike at $2,995, and the Indian additions obviously aren’t going to make it any more affordable. But they do add some interesting styling and performance improvements, not to mention turn it into a limited edition bike with an obvious connection to Indian’s heritage.So while this isn’t the cheapest way to get yourself on a Super73, it’s one of the cooler ways to do it.Oh, and it’s definitely a cheap way to get on a new Indian!",ebikes
2022/03/04,"We knew that Yamaha was going to have a big unveiling coming up soon as part of the brand’s new “Switch ON” campaign to showcase its electric vehicle, but we were surprised by the number of vehicles that Yamaha ultimately rolled on stage. With six new electric two-wheelers to show off, Yamaha made a splash and underscored its commitment to light electric vehicles ranging from electric bicycles to electric scooters in the 50cc to 125cc equivalent class.Perhaps the star of the show was the most radical looking two-wheeler on stage, the Yamaha B01.The eye-catching truss frame creates a step-through bike that fits nicely in the electric moped category with its large street tires and mid-mounted electric motor tied to a pedal drivetrain.In fact, the bike looks so good that it even conjures up memories of another recently revealed electric bike, the Fantic Issimo. I recently saw the Issimo in person at the Milan Motorcycle Show and it is a beauty of an electric moped.As it turns out, Yamaha appears to have partnered with Fantic, resulting in the Issimo finding its way onto Yamaha’s stage adorned with a new Yamaha badge.Whatever it’s called, the bike certainly embodies a fresh new design to challenge many of the same old recycled moped designs we’ve seen over the years.Yamaha floated specs of up to 45 km/h (28 mph), making this a speed pedelec in Europe (similar to a Class 3 electric bike in the US).It definitely sounds like Yamaha plans to bring the B01 concept to life.As President of Yamaha Motors Europe Eric De Seynes explained:“Its future will become true sooner. We will start the production of this vehicle within one year, beginning in 2023.”It’s hard to say what motor and battery Yamaha plans to put in the B01. The Fantic Issimo came with a Bafang M500 mid-drive motor in the urban version of the bike, and the company paired it with a 630Wh battery. Yamaha very well may want to use its own brand of motor instead of opting for a Chinese alternative like Bafang, but that remains to be seen as the B01 works its way towards production.Yamaha also showed off three electric bikes in the categories of gravel bikes, road/commuter bikes, and mountain bikes.The gravel bike is the Yamaha Wabash RT and the commuter bike is the Yamaha CrossCore RC. Both were also unveiled in the US, where we got to see the complete specs. The bikes share the same 500W mid-drive motors developed by Yamaha as well as the same 500Wh batteries.The third bike, a dedicated full-suspension electric mountain bike, appeared to be shrouded in some kind of digital camouflage. While the Yamaha Motor Europe team made it seem like this was a new model, it might just be new to Europe since it looks suspiciously similar to the Yamaha YDX Moro unveiled previously in the US.  That e-bike uses an innovative wishbone frame that tucks the rear suspension up inside of the two-part top tube. It’s a clever way to increase the suspension travel and save plenty of room for the battery at the same time.Lastly, we finally got the chance to see the two electric scooters we were actually expecting.The Yamaha E01 concept that we first saw back in 2019 was finally launched as the new NEOS. A second NEOS scooter was also unveiled alongside the E01’s offspring, though we weren’t given any detailed tech specs on either model. Instead, we’re told we’ll have to wait “another few weeks” to learn more.Both scooters will likely compete well in the European market, leveraging Yamaha’s brand heritage and technological prowess when it comes to two-wheeler design.What do you think of Yamaha’s new electric two-wheelers? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below.And to help you get your thoughts together, check out the full unveiling ceremony in Yamaha Motor Europe’s video below.",ebikes
2022/03/04,"The EMOVE Roadrunner from Voromotors seems like what an engineer would design for a seated electric scooter if they didn’t have to follow any rules. It’s basically two wheels strapped to a battery, and it goes faster than it probably should. It’s small. It’s powerful. It’s probably dangerous in the wrong hands. In other words, it’s perfect.Okay, I’m saying “dangerous” in a bit of a tongue-in-cheek way. Any two-wheeler can be dangerous. Hell, any car can be dangerous. In the same way any operator should exercise caution when wrapping their fingers around a steering wheel or mounting a motorcycle, so too should you be careful when deep squatting down onto this funny little seated electric scooter.But since the unassuming little Roadrunner hides much more power and speed than it would appear, this is definitely not an electric scooter to take lightly. I promise, you’re going to want to see this thing in action in my video review below before continuing on for my full written thoughts.The Roadrunner probably shouldn’t exist, but I’m glad it does. It’s just such an odd product category.It’s not a standing electric scooter, that’s for sure. But it also doesn’t fit with the other seated electric scooters because it is just so much more powerful.That leaves it as this hard-to-categorize little pocket rocket that doesn’t care what you call it, it just wants to go!There are three speed settings, and you may actually use all of them. Most scooters are left in their top speed setting all the time, since who wants to ride around at 8 mph in slowpoke mode? But the Roadrunner actually gets up to higher speeds in settings 1 and 2. For the fastest riding though, level 3 is where the party starts. They claim a top speed of 34 mph, but I used my phone’s GPS to clock speeds of 34-37 mph (54-55 km/h) on flat ground, depending on conditions (the blips above 34 mph could have been a bit of a tailwind). That would be fast for any e-bike, but it feels especially fast for a small seated scooter with 14″ wheels.Between the front suspension and cushy saddle, the ride actually feels decent at full speed. I wouldn’t want to hit any self-respecting pot hole, but smooth roads gave me zero pause about riding this contraption full out. This exact scooter has been modded to go around 50% faster, so don’t go thinking it can’t handle its stock 34 mph speed.With a 48V battery underneath, it has plenty of power between the dual motors to accelerate quickly and get you rolling fast.In fact, the battery is so large that it basically feels like it’s a scooter built around a battery. The frame isn’t really there to hold you, it’s there to hold the battery. You’re just sitting on it.We almost never see a battery this large. A 48V and 26.1Ah pack is industry leading, or at least I think it will be, if I can just figure out what industry the Roadrunner fits into.Regardless, that’s a lot of battery capacity. They say you’ll get 50 miles (80 km) of range from the thing, or as they cheekily put it, “100 miles with a battery swap.” Since the battery is removable, they’re gently suggesting you buy a second one so you can double your range.I’m here to tell you that you probably won’t need the second battery, as the first is so gigantic that it will likely give you everything you need. But if you want the best range out there in the wildly fast-seated-electric-scooter category, then by all means, grab a second battery.When it comes to braking, Voromotors made the wise decision to outfit the EMOVE Roadrunner with hydraulic brakes. You don’t want to try and stop 14″ wheels from 35 mph without some extra power. The brakes are technically hybrid hydraulic brakes, meaning there’s a mechanical pull from the bars and then a hydraulic piston down at the brake caliper. I’d have preferred to see hydraulic lines run all the way up to hydraulic levers at the bars, but this definitely gets the job done. Braking is quick and confident, just like I’d want to see on this little bad-decision-machine.Speaking of the bars, there’s also a cool folding feature that lets them fold in to make the scooter even more narrow. For such a little vehicle, being able to fold the bars in and slide it closer against a wall is a nice feature to have.There’s a lot to like here. A nice comfy seat. Big battery. Hydraulic disc brakes. Dual motors. Suspension. LED light package. The dang thing even comes with turn signals. They’re not very far apart so I’m not sure they’ll be readily recognized as turn signals, but it can’t hurt!The only real downside I can see here is that it’s not going to fit some big and tall riders as easily as shorter riders. Well, big riders might be fine. It’s rated for up to 150 kg (330 lb). But tall riders might find it a bit of a squeeze. You can scoot farther back on the scooter’s seat to stretch your legs a bit more, but there’s a limit.I’m 5’7″ (170 cm) and I felt great on it. My nearly 6′ (182 cm) brother looked a bit sillier on it, but it seemed to ride just fine for him. Much taller than that and I’m afraid you’ll be a bear on a circus tricycle, though that doesn’t mean you can’t make it work. That bear rocks that thing!So here’s the bottom line. The EMOVE Roadrunner is priced at $1,695. That’s definitely more than most cheaper seated electric scooters, but it also has much more power, speed, and range.So for the price, you’re getting a lot here. The performance is undeniable, and the utility is great too. While it lacks storage space, the thing is nice and compact to hideaway in your apartment or office. It doesn’t have the bulk of an e-bike (or the speed restriction), though it does look a bit wacky.If you don’t mind the funny look (or even prefer it), then I think the Roadrunner is absolutely worth the price. It’s fast, fun, powerful, and simply a blast to ride. ",ebikes
2022/03/03,"The Ducati Futa was just unveiled today as the Italian motorcycle maker’s first-ever racing electric bicycle. The move marks an even stronger push by Ducati into the e-bike industry, expanding its offerings with a new format of e-bike.Unlike the high-end electric mountain bikes we’ve seen from Ducati before, the newly unveiled Ducati Futa is purely a road bike – and a racing road bike at that. It’s designed for going fast and riding efficiently.Or as Ducati puts it:The carbon fibre monocoque frame has a sport endurance geometry, but with technical choices oriented towards aerodynamics and speed. The compact rear stay, with lowered sheaths, makes the bike comfortable, while generating less aerodynamic drag. The rear triangle is rigid laterally, precisely by virtue of the choice of the position of the sheaths and favours a better transmission of power to the wheel, as well as increasing the responsiveness of the bike. Down tube, seat post and fork sliders are expertly profiled and their reliefs are highlighted by the play of colours of the livery which sees grey and black as the main colours with accents in Ducati Red.It’s not just designed for those that want to ride fast; the bike is also designed for those with deep pockets. You won’t be throwing a leg over the Ducati Futa without forking over €7,690 first (approximately US $8,470).The 12.4 kg (27.3 lb) electric bike features a 250 Wh battery pack, which is fairly standard for lightweight electric road bikes. There’s also a 250 Wh extender battery pack that can be added to double the bike’s range. That’s another move that is becoming increasingly common in the e-bike industry, as many companies seek ways to help riders go even further once the main battery is exhausted.With an ultra-efficient e-bike like this, power draws in the 3 Wh/km (5 Wh/mi) ballpark are common, meaning that the Futa’s battery could easily last for 80-ish km (50-ish miles) in low power mode. A second battery would of course double that range.The FSA System HM 1.0 motor puts out 42 NM of torque and provides 250W of electric assist, keeping it on the lighter and lower power end of the spectrum. It’s just enough to give a nice tailwind to the rider without taking over the lion’s share of the effort.That rear hub motor is paired with a K Force WE groupset featuring a 2×12 speed wireless electronic shifting setup. There’s nothing between you and the transmission except for air and electromagnetic waves.There’s also carbon fiber everywhere, from the frame to the wheels to the handlebars and even the seat post. Making up for the added bulk of a motor and battery, the carbon fiber creates a strong, stiff frame that sheds as many grams as possible.Stopping power is provided by K-Force WE hydraulic disk brakes on cute little 160 mm FSA rotors. Garmin supplies the GPS-enabled remote.For those that aren’t happy with a simple $8.5K Ducati racing e-bike, there’s a limited edition Futa available too.It will apparently feature even nicer components to shave off a few more grams.As Ducati explains:Produced in only 50 numbered examples, the new Futa Limited Edition retains the features of the Futa but is enriched, in addition to the special Ducati Corse livery, with standard components that make it even lighter.The Futa Limited Edition was created for the most demanding riders who want to enjoy the best in terms of technological innovation and performance.How much does the limited edition Futa cost? Well, you know what they say. “If you have to ask…”But seriously, it’s €11,990 (approximately US $13,200).Ducati is of course no stranger to electric two-wheelers.The company dragged its feet for years on electric motorcycles, only committing to produce one after apparently learning from Energica’s racing electric motorcycles and supplanting them as the sole supplier to the FIM Moto E racing series.After that announcement, Ducati declared that its work on racing electric motorcycles would eventually lead to consumer electric motorcycles as well.Testing the waters before committing to a full-scale electric motorcycle, Ducati has lent its name to a series of electric scooters and e-bikes.",ebikes
2022/03/03,"Yamaha Power Assist Bicycles, the electric bike division of Yamaha, has just announced two new updates to the brand’s US electric bicycle line: the Yamaha Wabash RT and the Yamaha CrossCore RC.Both new e-bikes are the first US models to make use of Yamaha’s PWSeries ST mid-drive motor.The PWSeries ST motor offers four levels of pedal assist and powers the bikes up to a maximum speed of 45 km/h (28 mph) with 500W of power. It uses a combination of four sensors (torque sensor, crank cadence sensor, wheel speed sensor, and bike angle sensor) to continuously calculate and apply the precise amount of power for constantly changing riding scenarios.The bikes are both built on all-new frames that incorporate Yamaha’s 500Wh internal batteries and are weight balanced for their specific types of riding: gravel riding for the Wabash RT and road fitness/transportation for the CrossCore RC.As Yamaha Power Assist Bicycle’s sales and marketing manager Drew Englemann explained:Both of our new models are stylish performance e-Bikes that bring rider and machine together as one for adventures right out of the garage. Built on Yamaha’s heritage as a pioneering leader in e-Bikes, the Wabash RT is made for paved and unpaved exploration and adventure, while the CrossCore RC redefines ‘commuting by bicycle’ and serves the growing fitness and transit e-Bike market, which grew by approximately 50% in the last year.I had the pleasure of testing out the original Yamaha Wabash electric gravel bike back when it came out in 2019, and it was an absolutely joy to ride. Now the new Yamaha Wabash RT looks to improve upon that bike even further.The bike uses a traditional drop bar setup, though opts for wider flared bars that make room for optional handlebar bags. The bike is also designed to receive front and rear racks, making it a great option for bike-packing trips.A built-in dropper seat post helps riders find the exact seat height for every section of the trail, or drop it out of the way quickly for when the trail gets extra rough. The last thing you want when traversing a tricky obstacle is for your bike saddle to punch you where the sun don’t shine.Other high-end parts found on the Yamaha Wabash RT include quick release thru-axles for higher strength and more reliable hub connections, Maxxis Rambler 700 x 45c TR EXO 120tpi tires, Shimano GRX RX hydraulic brakes with 180mm centerlock rotors, and a Shimano GRX drivetrain with a 44t chainring, 11-42t 11-speed cassette, 11-speed ST-RX600 shifter, and KMC e11 Turbo EPT Chain.That’s a lot of nice kit.The Yamaha CrossCore is designed more for city riding, where it can be just as effective as a fitness bike or a quick commuter e-bike for urban rides.The flat handlebars will be more familiar to most commuter bike riders. On those bars is mounted the color-coded display that makes it easier to determine your pedal assist setting at a quick glance. That means less time looking down at the display and more time watching the road for cars trying to run you off of it.The CrossCore RC features a Shimano Alivio drivetrain with a 44t chainring, a 9-speed cassette, and a Shimano Altus shifter. The bike also comes with hydraulic disc brakes with centerlock rotors as well as quick-release style thru-axle hubs for easy tire removal without sacrificing quality or strength like more budget-level e-bikes’ quick release skewers.Rolling on CST Brooklyn Pro tires, the CrossCore RC features e-bike specific rubber with stiffened sidewalls and puncture-resistant layering.Both of the new bikes are aimed at the cycling sectors showing the highest growth rates, as Yamaha Power Assist Bicycle’s group lead Rob Trester explained:These new models will offer great riding experiences to bicyclists for all of the three fastest-growing segments in cycling: electric bicycles, gravel riding, and bicycle commuting. They’re versatile, do-anything bikes with 28-mph class 3 speed assist. Yamaha’s pioneering experience, quality and reliability will give riders both the performance and the confidence that they’re on the best e-bikes available.Both models will be available this summer. The CrossCore RC will be priced at US $3,099 and come in the creatively named color options of Shiver White, Painted Desert, and Urban Sage. The Wabash RT with its higher-spec loadout will be a bit pricier at US $4,099 and will be available in solely the Blue Steel colorway.If you’ve never been gravel biking (or ridden a gravel bike, for that matter), then I highly recommend it. Unlike the big, heavy mountain bikes that many people are used to for trail riding, gravel bikes offer a lighter, nimbler machine while still functioning great for on-road riding. It’s the kind of bike you can ride from your driveway through several miles of suburbia until you hit the trail head, and somehow feel comfortable on both terrains.And if you’re like me (meaning you’re not an extremely accomplished road cyclist who does 50-mile rides every weekend), then you’ll enjoy the added electric assist of a gravel e-bike. My best friend is one of those Lycra-clad road cyclists who thinks a 50-mile ride is a nice warmup, and so being able to keep up with him by riding my gravel e-bike is a fun way for us to both enjoy a ride even at different skill and fitness levels.Granted, my low-cost hub motor gravel e-bike costs less than a third of the new Yamaha Wabash RT, but it’s also not nearly as nice of a bike, nor do I expect it to last anywhere near as long. The Wabash RT is a beautiful bike with very nice parts, I have to hand it to them. And the CrossCore RC looks every bit as nice for the more urban-style riding it is designed for.With the bikes coming out this summer, I’m hoping to get a chance to test them both and report back on if they ride as good as their spec sheets look. Until then, let’s hear what you think of the new Yamaha Wabash RT and CrossCore RC in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/03/02,"One of the many nice things about riding electric bicycles in the US is the freedom to choose from an amazingly wide selection of e-bikes, including some very high power options. I feel for my European cousins who are stuck with their 250W motors, but not as much as I feel the awesome seat-of-the-pants acceleration that I get on the CSC FT1000MD, with its 1,000W mid-drive electric motor.That massive motor, officially referred to as the Bafang M620 or more infamously known as the Bafang Ultra, is one of the most powerful and highest torque e-bike mid-drive motors on the market.While e-bike engineering outfits around the world are working hard while trying to top it, that motor remains the cream of the crop for high-powered e-bikes. And it is expertly employed on the CSC FT1,000MD, a fat tire e-bike developed by a motorcycle company to blur the line between high power electric mountain bikes and light electric dirt bikes or trail bikes.Don’t get me wrong, it’s an electric bicycle for sure (even if the purists out there would argue differently.) The torque-sensing pedal assist makes for a fun, high-response ride should you decide to pedal it. Or the throttle will open up true motorbike feelings if you just want to go full bore, getting in some truly balls-to-the-wall fun.I definitely got some serious fun riding in, as you can see in my video review below! But keep reading after the video for the rest of my detailed review.The beautiful thing about the FT1000MD is that despite being such a high-powered electric bike, the power is manageable. You can dial it up or roll it back to fit your riding style.When I’m just enjoying a local field or park, moderate power is plenty. That’s especially true when I’m using pedal assist and heading out for a fun, fitness-ish leisurely ride. I enjoy have the power and torque, but I’m not going nuts with it most of the time. Occasionally, when I really want to have some fun, I’ll unleash the kraken to experience the over 1,000W of continuous power that the bike can supply.On a flat road, that power level can push the CSC FT1000MD up to 34 mph (54 km/h). I know because I did it. But just as often though, I’ll use the power for off-roading and preventing my fat tires from getting bogged down in sand and loose soil. The answer isn’t always “more power.” But sometimes it is.The FT1000MD isn’t just a powerful e-bike though. It’s also well made and designed to last. The company CSC Ebikes may know their way around electric bikes, but that’s because they come from CSC Motorcycles, and thus have decades of experience in two-wheelers. That knowledge gets applied to its e-bikes as well, resulting in quality parts like a suspension fork that isn’t just ornamental like we see on a bunch of quasi off-road e-bikes, but rather actually soaks up the off-road bumps nicely.Quality hardware and e-bike equipment designed to match the power of such a motor is also a key part of the equation. Even bike parts like the hydraulic disc brakes are designed for the extra power that a massive motor like this can create – stopping from 30 mph is a much more daunting prospect than stopping from 20 mph. There’s a lot more energy that needs to be scrubbed off. It’s the whole velocity squared thing; physics isn’t kind to higher speeds. Fortunately, the FT1000MD has the brakes to do it.That being said, the bicycle side of the components do have one area that you’ll still want to keep watch over. The pedal drivetrain is always the weak link when it comes to such high power motors, whether on the CSC FT1000MD or any other mid-drive e-bike. While CSC did opt for a slightly higher end Shimano 8-speed Altus derailleur than we see on many budget-level electric bikes, it’s certainly not the highest end of the Shimano spectrum. Shifting under high power is a no-no, unless you want to eventually strip teeth off your gears or break a chain. Keeping the bike in high gear 100% of the time should also be avoided. Many riders will just leave a mid-drive e-bike in top gear because that’s the “fast gear”, without realizing how much wear it puts on the drivetrain due to the extra torque. Unlike a car or motorcycle, which generally can’t be started in top gear and thus requires shifting through the gear range like a normal person, electric motors have full torque right at startup and thus can simply power their way to full speed in their highest gear. But I’ve seen plenty of people wear through that gear by using this motor on other bikes, so let this serve as a warning to you. Make sure you’re shifting properly with a heavy duty motor like this.Another thing I really enjoy about the FT1000MD is that it includes a lot of nice-to-have components that you don’t find on other e-bikes. The adjustable stem lets you raise and lower the handlebars to find the perfect fitment and ride orientation for you, and the bright Buchel headlight is more than a glorified keychain light to warn drivers of your presence. The color display looks great and is easy to read at a glance, even in bright light.Even the battery is larger than we typically see, coming in at 48V and 16Ah. Depending on how you ride the CSC FT1000MD and how much power you have on tap, the range from one charge will vary from “pretty darn far” to “almost nothing”. Such is life with a high power e-bike. But as long as you aren’t unreasonable with your demands, 25 miles (32 km) on throttle should be a good minimum, and 50 miles (80 km) is possible with conservative pedal assist.Anyone intending to toss the bike up on a car rack or into a truck should note that it isn’t lightweight, tipping the scales at 75 lb (34 kg). You can remove 9 lb (4 kg) of that just by taking the battery off. With a massive motor and large battery, you didn’t expect it to be a featherweight though, did you?Outfitting the bike with massive 4″ fat tires didn’t do the weight any favors either, though it certainly helps the FT1000MD cover just about any terrain. With that much air volume, the damn thing almost floats.The CSC FT1000MD is obviously not going to be a cheap bike. And the $3,295 price tag confirms it. I always look out for my readers when I can though, and so you can take an extra $200 off the price with the discount code ELECTREK.While it certainly sounds high to outsiders, the $3,295 price is about par for the course when it comes to Bafang M620-powered e-bikes. Many e-bikes with this drivetrain cost even more. It’s a specialty motor that requires powerful batteries and high enough quality parts to keep the bike safe at these performance levels.I’ve ridden plenty of M620 e-bikes that cost more. And so while I’m sure seeing a $3k price tag will shock anyone new to the e-bike industry, this is just the going rate for something on the highest end of the power scale. And don’t even get me started on the $6,000 fat tire e-bike coming out later this year that packs in even more power…Obviously this is not an e-bike for everyone. CSC has some great 750W fat tire e-bikes that will take you to a comfortable 28 mph (45 km/h) and use more economical hub motors, bringing them in at $1,500 less. But if you want a crazy powerful mid-drive motor with built-in torque sensor, larger batteries, better parts and the most extreme performance you can get, this is CSC’s top of the line offering.It requires a responsible rider, not just one with deep pockets. This much power can be dangerous to the rider or others around them if not used responsibly. But if you can handle it, the CSC FT1000MD can deliver it. And then some.",ebikes
2022/03/01,"It may come as no shock that the Netherlands is solidly aboard the pro-bike bandwagon. But new figures show just how heavily the Dutch have embraced electric bikes.The latest numbers show that 4.6 million residents of the Netherlands own an electric bicycle, according to the Light Electric Vehicle Association (LEVA). And, with 4.9 million e-bikes in the country, many owners appear to be doubling up. (I can’t blame them – I own a few e-bikes myself).With an electric assist motor that helps e-bikes travel faster and farther with reduced effort, electric bicycles have quickly become a go-to alternative to cars and other forms of conventional transportation.They’ve proven particularly popular among commuters who wouldn’t have otherwise chosen to travel by conventional bike due to the extra exertion that non-electric bikes require. That means e-bikes have helped reduce the number of cars on the road, which studies have found can significantly reduce traffic. In fact, a study in Brussels found that a 10% switch from cars to two-wheelers could reduce congestion by up to 40%.In the Netherlands, figures point to a clear demographic trend among electric bike owners. They tend to skew older, usually above 50, and are also of average or above average income. That tracks, as e-bikes are often used as a way for riders to return to cycling after they no longer have the stamina or range of motion for traditional pedal bicycles.European e-bikes are typically more expensive too, often opting for local manufacturing and higher quality components that combine to elevate prices. In comparison, the US is largely dominated by value-oriented electric bike companies that produce their models in Asia and use lower to mid-tier parts, resulting in e-bikes that often cost half of their European counterparts.In the Netherlands, the e-bike market grew to a staggering €9.5 billion in 2021 (approximately US $10.5 billion).Among the most popular electric bicycle styles in the Netherlands are electric city bikes, which, according to the LEVA, account for around 75% of the market. Hybrid electric bicycles also account for a sizable share at 17%. More speciality e-bikes like cargo e-bikes and electric mountain bikes account for 2% of the market each. Folding e-bikes and electric tricycles each account for 1% of the market, according to the LEVA.After much of Asia, European countries lead the way when it comes to electric bicycle adoption.European electric bike brands are landing significant investments just like their US counterparts, and many countries in Europe have incentivized electric bicycle purchases or use.

2022/02/28,"San Diego-based Juiced Bikes already offered a seriously fun ride with the original RipCurrent S electric fat tire e-bike. But now the company has unveiled an updated 2022 version that adds a number of new components.The fast and powerful e-bike’s upgrade list starts with a new motor that offers more power than ever for Juiced’s best-selling model.The new motor carries a 1,000W rating for its continuous power, but it can pull an actual 1,300 watts of peak power during acceleration and hill climbing.The thumb throttle on the e-bike has been updated to make it more responsive, though riders who prefer to pedal will also get special treatment thanks to the upgraded torque sensor programming in the pedal assist. Torque sensors result in the most natural-feeling pedal assist by applying the motor power based on how hard the rider pedals. Want more assistance? Just pedal harder and the bike is smart enough to sense it.The RipCurrent S now comes with Race Mode, which we’ve seen on some of Juiced’s other high performance e-bikes. When selecting Race Mode, riders can push past the 28 mph (45 km/h) Class 3 limit on the bike (though this is meant only for off-road riding and not intended for public streets or bike lanes).As Juiced Bikes founder and CEO Tora Harris explained:“The RipCurrent S has been one of our best-selling and most popular e-bikes since it was first introduced in 2018. I’ve been excited about upgrading the primary components to make it even more powerful and fun to ride. With the larger 1,000W motor, the acceleration and torque is really incredible. I can’t wait for riders to feel the difference in these performance enhancements!”The updated Juiced RipCurrent S also receives the company’s new G2 battery pack that was unveiled on the Juiced RipRacer late last year. The battery features a higher waterproof rating and includes a special compartment designed for Apple AirTags to aid in finding a lost (or stolen) battery or bike.The high capacity 52V 19.2Ah battery boasts an industry-leading 998 Wh of capacity, which Juiced says translates into over 70 miles (112 km) of range. That’s of course the pedal-assist range. Riding on throttle-only will likely deliver around half of that figure, which is still an improvement over most e-bikes that have around 30-50% less battery capacity.The G2 battery is also designed to fit into Juiced Bikes’ upcoming docking station that lets riders charge the battery from the wall or output the battery’s stored energy to power DC or AC devices. That innovation is likely an industry first, but it makes sense for such high capacity batteries. We see portable power stations all over the place that rely on big lithium-ion battery packs. Tapping into the existing battery on an e-bike and combining it with an AC inverter to power appliances is an interesting use for all of that stored energy.Other changes on the 2022 RipCurrent S model include upgraded controller programming and an upgraded fender package with a rear rack, which comes standard on the bike. The weight capacity of the bike has also been increased to 300 lb (136 kg).Other nice-to-have’s on the RipCurrent S include a nine-speed transmission, hydraulic disc brakes, front suspension fork, and a bright 1,050 lumen headlight that actually illuminates the road in addition to warning cars of your presence. Most e-bikes come with much lower power headlights that are primarily designed to alert car drivers to the e-bike, but that don’t actually function well for spotting obstacles in pitch-black environments without street lights.The new RipCurrent S carries an MSRP of $2,699 but is on sale during the current pre-order promotion for $2,499. While the bike is available for pre-order already, it won’t begin shipping until May of this year.The standard frame is available in three sizes and three colors (black, red, and brushed aluminum), while the step-through version comes in a single size but offers four colors (black, white, yellow, and blue).The existing RipCurrent S models have been marked down to just $1,999, making them a great deal for anyone who wants a powerful, fast electric bike with quality parts, and who doesn’t need quite the newest piece of kit on the shelf.",ebikes
2022/02/28,"I was a huge fan of the affordably priced $1,045 Ride1Up Roadster V2 from the moment it launched last year. So when Ride1Up decided to release a modified version designed as a gravel e-bike, I was extra stoked. The updates, which include gravel-ready features like new disc brakes, a Gates belt drive, and higher-end gravel-friendly tires, pushed the price slightly higher to $1,245. But considering that my next favorite gravel e-bike costs 3x as much, I still call that an amazing deal!Going into a ride on the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition, you have to realize what it is and what it isn’t.Lycra-enthusiasts likely will have to make a few compromises. There’s no mid-drive motor, no hydraulic brakes, and no space-age carbon fiber anything (except for the belt – more on that in a moment).But what you do get is a nicely made, lightweight, and surprisingly peppy electric gravel bike that is just as fun on the road as it is off it.To see what I mean for yourself, you can enjoy the ride experience along with me by checking out my review video below. Then read on to see all of my thoughts on this awesome, low-cost entry into the gravel e-bike world.As much as the bike has to offer across in terms of ride quality and utility, the first thing people will likely notice is the price. It’s price at just $1,245, which is a mere fraction of what the big name gravel e-bikes tend to charge. And that means gravel e-biking is suddenly much more accessible to a wider range of riders.But let’s get past that awesome price and take a look at what you’re really getting here.First of all, this is a super lightweight e-bike at just 33 lb (15 kg).Lightweight usually means low power, but the 350W motor here is still powerful enough to get you up to 24 mph (38.6 km/h). There’s no throttle, so this is purely a pedal assist e-bike. Once you start pedaling, the motor kicks in at five different user-selectable levels depending on how much assist you need at the moment.The handlebar-mounted display on the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel lets you choose your assist level on the fly and lets you check your speed and battery level at a quick glance while keeping a fairly small and unobtrusive screen. Connecting your feet to the rear wheel is a Gates Carbon Drive system that consists of that famous Gates carbon-reinforced belt drive system. It’s whisper quiet and maintenance-free. They last for tens of thousands of miles without needing any upkeep, meaning most people will never have to replace a belt. Unlike loud and oily chains, the Gates belt system is a pure pleasure to use. The list of advantages goes on and on.The Gates belt drive is one of the main upgrades over the base-level Roadster V2. That bike still has a belt drive, but it’s not a Gates product. It’s good, but Gates is great. Just one more reason to choose the Gravel Edition of the Roadster V2.The other two major upgrades are the Tektro disc brakes and the WTB Resolute 700c x 42 tires. Just those tires alone would run you $120, or 10% of the bike’s cost. My friend’s several-thousand-dollar non-electric gravel bike actually came with the same tires, which gave me a laugh since his bike is world’s apart from this one, resting several steps up the quality ladder.Not that the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition isn’t a quality bike – it definitely is. But it won’t compare to the high-end bike store gravel bikes. Even compared to high-end gravel e-bikes, its lack of a mid-drive motor and the single-speed setup will likely cause traditional riders to furrow their brows. But with the torquey hub motor and enough speed to keep up with pretty much any other cyclist, the e-bike is well-positioned for both slower hill climbing and faster riding on the flats.The main area where I wish I could see improvement is the battery capacity. Hidden inside the downtube, the 36V 7Ah battery is quite small. That’s just 252 Wh of capacity. The pedal assist nature of the e-bike means you can drag that battery capacity out for some longer range if you’ve got the fitness. But if you’re planning to rely heavily on the higher pedal assist levels, keep in mind that this won’t be a long-range e-bike. Another important point to note is that the battery isn’t removable for daily charging (it can be removed with a few tools for replacing it once every few years), so charging has to be performed on the bike.Ride1Up lists the range as 20-30 miles (32-40 km) depending on assist level and terrain. On my first full discharge, I scored 17 miles (27 km), but that was also with a lot of level 5 assist to see what the most powerful end of the spectrum could do. Hey, if you give me a motor, I’m going to really test it.Subsequent riding with a more mixed variety of pedal-assist levels showed me that the 20- to 30-mile range rating is accurate, but you’ve got to be prepared to do your part.There was one ride that I got a little over my head on, as I was having so much fun on the bike that I definitely pushed it past the point of no return. Or at least, the point of no return with electric assist. The last eight miles of that ride were purely lunch-powered. And while I definitely missed having my electric assist, I was also surprised at just how well the bike rides with zero assist at all. Getting rolling from a stop at the bottom of a hill was a doozy without assist, but overall it went pretty well. And I’m not a particularly accomplished acoustic cyclist, mind you. Electric bikes are kind of my jam.If you’re the type of rider that wants an e-bike only part of the time, I think you’ll find that the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition makes a great e-bike and non-e-bike.The only other two complains I have besides the somewhat small battery are the lack of lights or a kickstand. Included LED lights that run off the main battery would have been a very nice touch. There are mounting points for a kickstand (you can score one that fits on Amazon for $19.99), but they don’t include one as standard equipment. There’s a reason all my photos of the bike are propped up next to something, and the reason isn’t aesthetic framing.Ultimately, I’d say that the Ride1Up Gravel Roadster makes an excellent all-around electric bike for anyone who enjoys lightweight, fitness-style riding and wants the ability to head off-road on the same bike that they’d use to cycle to the corner store.It’s not going to give you the comfort of a mountain bike, but you knew that going in. This is a rigid road bike frame that has been optimized for trail and gravel riding, which it excels at. With the right motor, brakes and tires, the bike handles beautifully in the dirt, sandy soil and gravel roads.And it even looks good, to boot. If you’re lucky, you might just fool your friends into thinking its not electric for the first few miles. Though once they’re huffing and you’ve only broken a light glistening sweat, the jig may be up.Of all the e-bikes I ride, I think the Roadster V2 Gravel Edition has now risen to the top of my list for affordable lightweight e-bikes. Its ability to cover a variety of terrains while maintaining a lightweight and stealthy build is a blessing. And the inclusion of quality parts like the Gates belt drive are the low-maintenance cherry on top of this gravel dust-covered sundae. ",ebikes
2022/02/27,"The first time I saw a JackRabbit, I couldn’t help but laugh. For someone that comes from the e-bike world, the proportions are just so funny looking. But the more I’ve thought about it, the more this funny little “micro e-bike” seems like it could solve a lot of problems for urban commuters.The San Diego-based mobility company refers to its JackRabbit as a micro e-bike, though I’m sure that my most pedantic readers will be quick to point out that it’s more accurately described as a scooter since it lacks functional pedals.But just like motorcyclists refer to their “bikes,” so too do the JackRabbit creators. And regardless of what you call it, there’s some interesting capability packed into this pint-sized electric two-wheeler.On the bike side of things, the JackRabbit features 20″ bike wheels with a wider tire on the rear to make up for its lack of suspension. There’s a rigid bike fork up front and a single disc brake on the rear. A bicycle seat and handlebars add to the bike credentials, but then the fold-up foot pegs put us back in scooter territory.There’s a small 158 Wh removable battery in the top of the frame and a (slightly larger) 300W geared hub motor in the rear wheel. With a push of the thumb throttle on the handlebars, the JackRabbit gets up to 20 mph (32 km/h) and carries a claimed range of 12 miles (20 km).That’s not a terribly large range compared to most e-bikes these days, but rather is more par for the course compared to scooters. Considering this is very much meant as an urban commuter, 12 miles seems like a nice balance for sufficient range while maintaining a low weight.And at just 24 lb (10.9 kg), it’s super lightweight. The JackRabbit also folds to a width of just seven inches, meaning you can lift it easily to carry into an apartment or dorm room, then fold it down to rest against a wall or under a dorm. “Folding” might not be the best word, since, despite the pegs actually folding up, the handlebars pop off and clip inline against the frame. Either way you slice it, the JackRabbit definitely tucks down into a thin little form factor when not in use.That’s the whole idea, which came to co-founder Tom Piszkin one day when watching his students show up late. As a coach at UCSD, he saw his athletes often struggling to navigate campus effectively. Parking was nearly impossible to find, bikes were regularly getting stolen, and skateboards/scooters were only good for smooth, manicured paths. He wanted to design a better solution that was small and lightweight so it could be brought inside a classroom or dorm room to prevent it from being stolen outside, yet still had the stable and speedy ride of a bicycle. With a bit of ingenuity, the frankenstein creation he came up with combined aspects of bikes and scooters into the JackRabbit.Today’s version is actually the JackRabbit 2.0, which is the new and improved version that followed a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Over a hundred backers pledged funds to help the JackRabbit team bring the new design to life, and now the new and improved version is in stock and shipping across the US. It’s priced at $999, and add-on accessories such as a rear rack, spare battery, and a fender set are also available.While it certainly has limitations such as the short range from a small battery, the company says that it performs great at the task it is designed for: short urban trips. Most e-bikes have much longer ranges than 12 miles, but most e-bikes are also designed for a combination of recreational cruising as well as urban transportation. The JackRabbit is purely designed to get riders from point A to point B, and then largely disappear against a wall when not in use. That’s also helped it become popular with RV owners, boaters, and others who require a light, small form factor transportation option when away from their main ride. The battery is even small enough to make it one of the only “e-bikes” you can fly with, since the battery capacity is below the 160 Wh limit imposed by TSA and many airlines.I had the chance to talk to JackRabbit’s CEO Jason Kenagy about the funny little micro e-bike, and he helped shed some more light on the design.In response to my first reaction, which was an involuntary chuckle, he took it in stride:“A new form factor will always raise a few eyebrows at first. Remember when scooters came out? People laughed at the idea and thought they looked dorky. But today, you can’t walk down a block in most cities without seeing a row of them. They’re now completely accepted by the mainstream.”That’s absolutely true. Not only are electric scooters everywhere in cities around the world, but they represent a multi-billion dollar industry. Heck, individual scooter-sharing companies have achieved billion dollar valuations by themselves.It’s about more than just acceptance though. As Jason continued, it’s about being effective:“But in all seriousness, the best part about the small size of a JackRabbit is its convenience. Our e-bike is only 24 lbs, so you can easily throw one into your car or carry it up stairs. And because a JackRabbit can fold down to 7 inches wide, it can easily tuck inside a closet or a small space. However, our “fun-size” doesn’t sacrifice performance or quality. Our e-bikes pack a punch with a top speed of 20 mph and are built with only top-notch materials, made to last.”I’ll admit that I laughed at the concept at first. But after a more critical look and speaking with Jason, I agree there’s real merit here.Obviously, this isn’t the e-bike you choose for a long Sunday cruise or to get in a workout. But for lightweight, simple urban navigation, this looks just about perfect. And if you really wanted to go further, just snag a spare battery for $199 and you’re all set to double your range. The spare battery even has a little holster so you can store it under your seat. If you’re especially quick and dexterous, you might even be able to swap it in without coming to a stop. Often when I write about conventional electric scooters, especially ones that hit higher speeds of 20 mph or more, commenters will mention how dangerous the small wheels look. Hitting a pot hole with eight inch scooter wheels at 20 mph is a recipe for disaster, sending the rider over the handlebars and hurtling to the ground. But 20″ bike wheels can cover most obstacles you’d expect to find in an urban jungle. And the short wheelbase of this thing looks so nimble that you could probably toss out a handful of change and then weave through each coin like a slalom. I also like that it comes in a bright yellow color option. Those in-your-face colors are hard to pull off for most any vehicle, e-bikes included (it takes a rare breed of individual to drives a bright yellow car). But something as wild and fun-looking as the JackRabbit seems to rock it perfectly.As our readers already know, Electrek has developed a reputation as a leader in e-bike and e-scooter reviews.

2022/02/26,"Anyone who has been following recent pricing trends in the electric bicycle industry has experienced quite a roller coaster ride. Prices over the last year or two have repeatedly climbed and dropped as leading e-bike companies jockeyed for position while simultaneously weighing the increasing pricing pressures on the industry.North American e-bike leader Rad Power Bikes is now raising eyebrows (and sending stomachs into chests if we want to keep that roller coaster analogy alive) as the company flirts with lower prices on two of its most popular models.Rad Power Bikes’ pricing news is particularly important, not just because the company sells more electric bikes than anyone else by a large margin, but also because Rad’s pricing is often used as a signal in the industry.Rad’s latest price increase announcement at the end of last year was followed by several other e-bike companies also announcing price hikes. Companies like VanMoof, Ride1Up, Aventon, Juiced Bikes, and many others have slowly walked up pricing or ended promotional pricing over the last year, effectively returning e-bikes to their higher MSRPs.Rad’s last price hike sent several popular e-bike prices soaring, such as the RadRunner 2 replacing the $1,299 RadRunner with a new $1,499 price, while the RadRover Plus bumped up from $1,799 to $1,999.But Rad is now walking those two price jumps back, at least temporarily, with a $200 reduction. While $100 sales in the US e-bike market are common, large price drops like these are rarely seen outside of standalone events such as Black Friday promotions.To take advantage of the price drop though, you’ll have to use the code SPRINGRIDE, which you can enter here for the RadRunner 2 utility bike or here for the RadRover 6 Plus fat tire e-bike.Rad has said that these price drops will only be temporary, lasting until March 8. However, Rad has run temporary sales in the past that have turned into permanent pricing, or at least semi-permanent until site-wide price hikes.The RadRunner was famously the recipient of one such price decrease, dropping as low as $1,199 for a long period of time.But a number of pressures on the e-bike industry have forced prices up over the last year. Rising prices of raw materials like aluminum and copper have made it more expensive to produce e-bikes, while a weakening US dollar versus the Chinese yuan has made it more expensive for US e-bike companies to import their e-bikes.One of the biggest key pricing impactors has been the cost of freight. US e-bike companies bring their e-bikes over in large shipping containers, stuffing many dozens or even hundreds into each container depending on the box sizes. Container prices increased by up to 5x over the course of a year, meaning e-bikes that had previously cost manufacturers around $50 to ship to the US were now costing them $250. And that was on top of the Trump tariffs that added an extra 25% to the cost of e-bikes, among other imported goods.But there’s light at the end of the tunnel for shipping prices, which appear to be slowly dropping from their peak last August. With a reduction in shipping costs, one of the biggest contributors to landed e-bike costs in the US, companies like Rad Power Bikes may be receiving much-needed pricing relief. At the same time, political factors that affect e-bike pricing remain on the table. A push to place electric bikes back on the tariff exception list could help reduce the cost of e-bikes to manufacturers, which could in turn be passed along to consumers. A proposed e-bike purchase tax credit could help reduce e-bike prices by up to $900, directly benefiting e-bike shoppers. However, that proposal is looking less likely to pass due to the lack of support from even a single Republican senator combined with the Democratic senator Joe Manchin helping to torpedo the proposal as part of the Build Back Better Act.Other companies, such as Lectric eBikes, have managed to keep prices low for several years in a row. Its popular Lectric XP 2.0 has remained at its $999 price since its release, with the exception of a brief $949 holiday sale.As more models of new e-bikes continue to enter the US e-bike market and political moves float in the air, the pricing games will likely remain afoot for the foreseeable future.

2022/02/24,"The Fiido T1 may not be the most revolutionary electric bike out there, but it still manages to stuff itself full of value, making it an interesting addition to the electric utility bike market.I say that it’s not terribly revolutionary because you don’t have to look far to discover what bike it appears to be based on: the RadRunner from Rad Power Bikes.But while it ostensibly shares a very similar frame – one that we didn’t really see on the market until Rad introduced it a couple years ago – the Fiido T1 isn’t a direct clone or even a copycat knockoff.Those exist, and plenty of players in the market try to just knock off popular e-bikes by producing 1:1 clones.Instead, Fiido actually added a number of features and components that increase the bike’s utility.You’ll see what I mean if you check out my video review below. Or keep reading below the video to get the full thoughts in my extended review.There are a number of key components that I really like about the Fiido.Those mag wheels don’t just look nice, they also mean you’ll never have to worry about spokes loosening up over time or breaking.The giant headlight mounted on the included front rack gives you tons of visibility up front and extra storage capacity. I also really like that they don’t charge extra for the front rack. A front basket is usually at least $50 extra from most companies as an added accessory, and sometimes even more. And while I’m mentioning included accessories, I love that fenders come standard too. Lights, fenders, and baskets as standard equipment… these guys know the way to my heart by not nickel-and-diming me on every extra component.The 750W motor is plenty powerful and takes me up to speeds of 40 km/h (25 mph) on throttle only, though I haven’t been able to hit the promised 50 km/h (30 mph). If there’s some secret unlocking mode that takes you past level 3 (the highest available speed mode), then I haven’t figured it out yet, and no one has been able to share it with me. Even so, 25 mph is already a nice bump over the typical 20 mph speeds we see in Class 2 e-bikes.The hydraulic suspension fork helps to improve the ride, especially when riding off-road. The big 4-inch-wide tires give you that fat bike feel with lots of cushy rubber and air under you, but don’t have the same bulk or sluggishness of 26-inch fat tires.They’re also street-oriented tires, so don’t go too nuts in the mud or you’ll be sliding around like a greased pig. These tires can handle some dirt and grass shortcuts, but they’re optimized for street riding. And that makes sense; this is a utility e-bike after all. It’s meant for running errands over bumpy streets, not launching you off the closest tree root.The giant 48V and 20Ah battery offers 960 Wh of capacity and tons of range. You’ll never really get the claimed 150 km (93 miles) of range unless you’re going suuuuuper slow in pedal assist mode, but you’ll definitely get more range than any other e-bike that comes with a typical 48V 14Ah battery. The Fiido T1 offers nearly 50% more battery than those e-bikes, which of course equates to more range.The battery is removable by unlocking and flipping up the seat, though I found that it often caught on the rail and didn’t release smoothly, even when the key was in the proper unlock setting. Small issues like those sometimes separate the higher-quality e-bikes from the good-not-great models, but isn’t a really a deal breaker, in my opinion.You also get a 7-speed derailleur, which gives you plenty of options for dropping down into a low gear, should you need it. Me? I pretty much found myself leaving it in on the smallest cog all the time for higher speed riding. If you’re in a hilly environment though, the taller gears might be nicer for hill climbing.I’m not a huge fan of cruise control, so the fact that the Fiido T1 offers it doesn’t do a lot for me. I always feel weird when I don’t have sole control over the throttle. I prefer my brain to be the only decision maker. I don’t want to share speed decisions as part of a committee with the Fiido T1’s brain. But of course it just takes a single tap of the brake levers to disengage the cruise control, and I’m sure it would be nice for anyone that has long and straight sections where they don’t want to maintain thumb pressure on the thumb throttle.The saddle is a bit odd-shaped, but I found it to be plenty comfortable. Between the springs on the saddle and the spring suspension seat, it has a lot of nice give under you.I also really like the rear rack, and the wooden touch is quite nice. The rack isn’t as tall as the one on the RadRunner, so it would be a bit more awkward for a passenger’s legs (plus there are no foot pegs for a passenger), but it does keep your cargo lower and thus lower your center of gravity. And there is of course no fancy passenger package with a cushy seat available like you can get with the RadRunner.The disc brakes are just fine. They’re mechanical, so you’ll eventually have to do some cable adjustment as they stretch and break in. But for the price of $1,599, it’s hard to complain too much and ask for hydraulic disc brakes.The price is only $100 above the RadRunner and yet you get a lot more, like the included basket/fenders, the 7-speed derailleur, the suspension seat and fork, the larger battery, and the higher speed.Ironically, despite the RadRunner having a very basic display without a speedometer, I actually prefer it over the Fiido T1’s display here. The Fiido T1’s display is awful; I can barely read it unless I’m in the perfect lighting condition. Usually that means the sun is behind me so I cast a shadow over the display. In direct sunlight, the display is completely washed out and thus often unreadable. Take a look at the video at the top of this review to see what I mean.That’s my one major complaint though. The screen is terrible. Everything else (battery latch notwithstanding) is actually pretty good. And the value here speaks for itself when you compare the price and features to the rest of the industry. [Update Feb 28, 2022: Fiido reached out and said they are working on a new update to the screen to improve the contrast and will be sending it out to anyone who owns a T1. Nice!]I’ve reviewed plenty of Fiido’s bikes before. While I’ve never considered them top-of-the-line, they’ve always been quite good, nicely designed, well packaged, and excellent all-around options for a mid-priced electric bike.The Fiido T1 remains true to the company’s positive reputation so far and is an excellent addition to the utility e-bike market, even if it definitely takes some strong inspiration from the RadRunner.These are not the Cadillacs of electric bikes (and I’m not even sure that analogy holds true anymore for Cadillac), but they are great options for value-oriented e-bike shoppers that want good performance without breaking the bank.",ebikes
2022/02/24,"In a bid to clean up the city and reduce the chokehold of traffic congestion, Paris plans to ban cars from much of the historic part of the French capital.The plan was announced by the city’s mayor Anne Hidalgo, though its expected 2024 implementation represents a two-year delay from the creators’ original goal.Vehicles banned under the new rules will include most private vehicles used for through traffic. Exceptions will be made for public vehicles, residents who live in the included areas, delivery drivers, and those accessing services such as shopping. That might sound like a lot of exceptions, but the move is still expected to take around 50% of cars off the road.While covering the development of the plan last year, Bloomberg estimated that the plan’s implementation could remove 100,000 cars per day from Paris’s streets.The goal is to turn much of the historic parts of Paris into a cleaner, less congested environment that is friendlier to local forms of transportation such as cycling, scooters, and good old-fashioned walking. The city has undergone a number of changes in its bid to become more bikeable. That included adding over 100 miles (160 km) over bike lanes during the COVID-19 pandemic.For years now, Paris has undertaken a push toward more environmentally-friendly transportation at the behest of Hidalgo.It mirrors similar moves across Europe that have sought to shift toward lower-emission electric forms of transportation as well as to de-emphasize the roles of cars in cities.Some countries in Europe have begun offering tax incentives that essentially pay citizens to cycle to work instead of using a car.Belgium recently made headlines when it increased its bike-to-work incentive to €0.25 per kilometer (approximately US $0.45 per mile), according to the Light Electric Vehicle Association.But Belgium isn’t alone in offering cash in exchange for pedaling to work. The Netherlands offers nearly as much, and the UK offers even more. A mileage allowance of around USD $0.26 per mile is available to British cyclists who use their bikes to commute to work, according to the World Economic Forum.The UK also offers a lease-to-own incentive program that rewards cyclists with discounted bikes and cycling gear.If Paris gets its way, residents of the city and tourists alike could be on the path to a cleaner, greener, and more locally accessible City of Light.",ebikes
2022/02/23,"Canadian electric bike company Biktrix has never shied away from high-power motors. Several of the brand’s e-bikes feature what used to be one of the most powerful mid-drive e-bike motors on the market: the Bafang M620 Ultra motor. I say “used to be” because it has now been surpassed by Biktrix’s own in-house developed Biktrix XD motor, and the new motor solves all of the major problems we’ve previously seen with such high-power mid-drives.High power electric bicycles are a blast because they allow new types of riding that wouldn’t have been previously possible. Hills that are so steep that they can be difficult to climb on foot can suddenly be biked up.But the problem with high-power mid-drive motors on e-bikes has traditionally been that they tend to destroy the bikes, or more specifically, the bicycle chains and rear gears that were never designed for those loads.A healthy mountain-biker can sustain several hundreds of watts each hour. A high-power mid-drive motor like the infamous Bafang M620 Ultra can sustain 1,000W for days and often peaks closer to 1,500W. That’s a recipe for breaking chains and ripping teeth off of gears, something that multiple Electrek staff have experienced.So when Biktrix went about designing its XD motor to be even more powerful than that, they decided to flip the script and totally remove the bicycle drivetrain – or at least add a second more powerful one next to it.Instead of transferring the motor’s power through the existing bike chain and gears, the Biktrix XD adds a second output from the motor unit on the opposite side of the bike. The traditional bike chain stays on the right side of the e-bike and transfers the human input to the rear wheel. The motor’s output travels through a left-side sprocket and motorcycle-style chain in a second independent power transfer system. The result: Human power stays on the equipment designed for humans, and the motorcycle power goes through a much beefier set of components – and beefy is the right way to describe it. Take a look at the comparison between bicycle chain/gears and the XD’s motorcycle-level second drivetrain below. The chain and sprockets are much thicker, specifically designed to handle these power levels.The Biktrix XD motor isn’t just designed in Canada, it’s built there, too. The team certainly prides itself on the local manufacturing, as Biktrix founder and CEO Roshan Thomas shared:I’m proud of my team for their steadfast efforts on bringing this project to life. We’re constantly striving to bring manufacturing back to North America.The powerful XD comes with a claimed “2,000+ watts”, and I’m guessing that plus sign is doing some heavy lifting, as the motor seems capable of much higher peak power levels.To continue the comparison with the Bafang M620, Biktrix’s team put the new Biktrix XD motor up against the M620 in a drag race that you can see at the beginning of the launch video below.Spoiler alert: the previously impressive M620 looks like grandma’s grocery getter compared to the Biktrix XD.And while you’re watching the video, stick around to 1:32 for a truly impressive showcase of the Biktrix XD motor’s climbing power. The motor seems so powerful that it could practically climb a wall if the bike’s tires were sticky enough.As an even more ridiculous demonstration of the system’s durability and power, Biktrix even showed it towing a highway-rated camper trailer. A job that normally would require a pickup truck was performed by an electric bicycle. Let that sink in.Equipped with the XD motor system, the Biktrix Juggernaut XD is capable of “50+ km/h” speeds (31+ mph), and again, that plus sign is likely hiding a much higher number. The motor will come internally waterproofed and with waterproof connectors, plus it is surrounded by bash guards to prevent it from taking direct hits when operating in rough terrain.The motor core is also modular to make it easy to service, when necessary. The Juggernaut XD will feature two frame sizes with an inverted front air-shock suspension fork. A 10-speed shifter will come standard, and riders will be able to choose between a right side half-twist throttle or a left side thumb throttle. Both 48V and 52V battery options will be available in capacities up to 25 Ah, or approximately 1,300 Wh.Coming out this summer, it will be priced at US $5,999, with an early-bird price of $4,999 for those that put down a $50 reservation.The Juggernaut XD will no doubt be an impressive piece of machinery.The power and torque put it at light motorcycle-levels, and the capability of the e-bike provides dirt bike-like performance. With such high power electric bicycles, I often hear people ask, “Why not just buy a motorcycle?” And while I understand the confusion, those people are missing the point. The crux of e-bikes like these is that they aren’t just for going fast, accelerating quickly, or climbing previously unclimbable peaks. They’re for providing a cycling experience. You get the feel of actually pedaling, just with the result being so much more powerful. Think of it like a mech suit for your legs.It’d be like asking a wing suit flyer, “Why don’t you just buy a plane ticket?” The point isn’t to just go high or fast in the sky – it’s to feel like you’re flying. And with high power e-bikes, it’s to get the cycling experience, but with much more extreme performance. Sitting on a 250 lb dirt bike isn’t the same as pedaling a 100 lb e-bike up a massive mountain.And believe it or not, you still get a good workout from high power 1,000+ watt e-bikes, when used in pedal assist mode. Sure, the bike is going much faster since the motor puts out more power, but your legs are still pumping along hard. You can get the same workout on a 250W e-bike as a 2,000W e-bike, if you try. The only difference is that the couple hundred watts of power you add personally means you’re cruising at 450W on the first and 2,200W on the second. Which one sounds like more fun?That being said, of course this type of power isn’t meant for bike lane commuting or even typical mountain bike trails. There’s some serious responsibility that comes with operating a machine like this. We hope to learn more about the this new motor tech ahead of the upcoming Juggernaut XD’s release.Until then, let’s hear your thoughts on Biktrix pushing the envelope with new power levels.

2022/02/22,"The folks over at the electric bicycle company FLX caught lightning in a bottle two years ago when they launched the original Babymaker electric bicycle. Now the company is back up on a hill in a thunderstorm, jar in hand, hoping to do it again. And this time they’ve brought and even better e-bike than the first time around.Meet the Babymaker II.The launch follows a teaser we saw earlier this month and fills in more info about the e-bike.And while we’re here, can we just all enjoy the fact that they launched the Babymaker II on Twosday? The second iteration of the Babymaker launched at 2:22 PM EST today on 22/2/22 (or 2/22/22 in a few parts of the world).As cool as it is, they had to go and ruin the $2,222 MSRP by offering $1,000 off for the first 24 hours. Oh, actually I’m cool with that.At that announced promotional price of $1,222, there’s a lot to be psyched about here. And it looks like FLX is psyched as well, hoping to recapture its famed triumph from the first time around.The original Babymaker e-bike was propelled to such surprise success when it raised over $13 million in pre-orders on Indiegogo in 2020.And so to one-up themselves this time, FLX has updated the bike with even more of what electric bike riders love: range and features.For starters, the stealthy e-bike’s hidden battery has grown by 40% to 360 Wh, increasing the range on a single charge to a claimed 70 miles (112 km). Just keep in mind that you’ll need to be doing the lion’s share of the pedaling power to achieve that top level range. For most riders enjoying the higher power settings, expect to get less range from a single charge.The bike’s cockpit is now “bigger and wider,” making for a more comfortable and less cramped ride.The frame is largely similar, opting for a minimalist road bike frame and a Gates Carbon Drive transferring pedal power to the rear wheel. That belt drive is highly prized in the biking industry, where it’s known to last for tens of thousands of miles without maintenance, and never rusts or requires adjustment like a chain or derailleur.The rear motor is still a 350W unit and the bike reportedly reaches a top speed of 25 mph (40 km/h). There’s no throttle, meaning you’ll need to put in some real pedaling effort yourself to cause the motor to kick in. But with user selectable power levels, riders can decide if they want a lower assist fitness ride or a higher power joy ride each time they go out.Other fancy-pants parts to compliment that nice Gates belt drive include Magura hydraulic disc brakes. These high quality brakes seem like overkill on a light bike like the Babymaker II, which weighs just 35 lb (18.5 kg), but who am I to tell the FLX team not to give us such high end parts?But the real story here is likely the US-based production, which Scott Anderson of FLX’s team tells me will be taking place in Detroit, Michigan. The company explained that despite the fact that “the overwhelming majority of electric bikes entering the USA come from China, theBabymaker ll is Born in the USA.” I tried to dig a bit deeper to determine what exactly that entails, and from what Scott explained, it sounds like the Babymaker II e-bikes will be assembled at a Detroit facility from imported parts. The whole “Made in the USA” label has some weighty nuance, and few companies claim to actually manufacture locally. Like most US-made products, these are often collections of both domestically and foreign produced parts.In the case of the Babymaker II, it sounds like they’re sticking with the term “US assembled” and that the parts are largely imported. That still means the last step is performed domestically though, which helps to create local jobs and offer better oversight as well as improved quality control. From talking to Scott, it also sounds like FLX is focused on growing that operation to bring it even more tightly into the American fold.And that’s a vision shared by FLX’s president and founder Rob Rast, who explained:“FLX is excited to continue along the path we’ve carved with the launch of the Babymaker ll. It builds on our commitment to design the sleekest most stealthy and easy to just get on and ride electric bike possible – and we nailed it. With the move to build our bikes in Detroit, Michigan, our customers will join us on our mission to bring 100% of our bike assembly back into the USA economy. It’s more than just a bike, it’s a movement.”Now that we’ve seen what the new Babymaker II has to offer, let’s hear your thoughts on the new e-bike.

2022/02/22,"The Aventon Sinch was already one of the best-quality small-diameter-wheel fat tire e-bikes in the value category, but now it’s gotten even better. That’s thanks to a host of new upgrades from the company, including an ultra-comfortable folding frame with low step-through design that makes it easier than ever to quickly mount up and ride.And of course Electrek made sure to have the first look at the new Aventon Sinch Step-Through, as I’ve been testing it out ahead of the bike’s launch today.The new Aventon Sinch Step-Through is the easiest-to-use version of the bike yet, offering a compact and fun e-bike that can get you to work or traverse the local park – no trails or pavement necessary.Fat tire electric bicycles are tons of fun for riding over all types of terrain, but their massive size usually makes them hard to transport when they aren’t being ridden.Folding fat tire bikes are more rare, but they seriously open the door to new possibilities such as tossing your fat tire bike in a smaller car trunk or backseat.And for city riders who don’t need to transport their bikes in car, the ability to fold means it takes up less space in a small apartment, perhaps fitting in a corner or under a desk. Plus, those fat tires make quick work of potholes and other urban obstacles.Check out the new Aventon Sinch in my test riding video below.The folding step-through frame is the most eye-catching of the updates to the Sinch Step-Through, and I love it. It makes hopping on and off the bike a breeze since you can just step right through the center of the ultra-low frame.Plus, Aventon always delivers a quality, well-made frame with expert welds on all of its models. I’ve yet to test an Aventon bike that didn’t look like it was just as beautifully constructed.A quick way to tell if an e-bike company cares about the quality of its frames is to look at how messy or clean the welds look. It won’t tell you the whole story, but it will let you know if they slacked off on using some cheap-o factory that didn’t want to pay enough for better welders that know how to do it right. And Aventon’s superbly filleted welds show how much the company cares about getting it right.But as nice as the frame is, there’s so much more to see here.The new battery is much easier to remove for charging, popping right out of the center of the frame without the need to fold the bike to access it.The new tires offer better street performance (which, let’s face it, is where most of us spend most of our time riding). And they’re elegant-looking tan walled tires, which I don’t see often but that I like the look of.The new display offers the nicest screen yet on the Sinch and now integrates with Aventon’s app to offer ride tracking and vehicle monitoring.The updated thumb throttle is more comfortable, incorporating the version now used on Aventon’s newest models of e-bikes like the Soltera. And the throttle now even powers from a stop, which wasn’t the case when I tested the original Sinch 18 months ago.I’m a big fan of the adjustable height handlebars, since they allow you to really modify the geometry of the bike to fit your body size and ride style. I would keep them pretty high to give me more of an upright cruiser-like ride, but I can see some people preferring to leave them low and have a more tucked riding position.The pedal assist and throttle both ease on rather slowly, ramping up the power over the first few seconds. That’s a programming decision by Aventon, and it’s one that I would love to be able to edit myself, giving me more instantaneous power for thrilling acceleration. But their programming will surely make the bike last longer since it’s easier on the bike, battery, and motor. And most people that seek a more leisurely ride over a heart-pounding thriller will prefer the relaxed application of power.The new tires ride as good as they look, offering a more road-friendly tread pattern. I still took the bike on plenty of grass and dirt trails, ensuring it could still handle the occasional off-road journey. It probably won’t be as good for beach riding like when I tested the original Sinch with its knobby tires, but I appreciate the improved road performance. Not only does the road tread give a better ride, but it also improves the range when riding on the road.And the range is already impressive. Compared to other leading fat tire folders, the Aventon Sinch Step-Through has nearly a 50% larger battery, meaning much more range.I’ve always respected Aventon for providing true range ratings, including real-world testing data for each of the pedal assist levels. I don’t know of any other major e-bike manufacturer that does this, and it really helps the company stand out.With an average of around 40 miles (64 km) of range if you’re using both pedal assist and throttle, or closer to 30-ish miles if you’re on throttle only, the Aventon Sinch Step-Through has enough battery to take you anywhere you’ll reasonably want to go.The average of 40 miles of range with mixed riding is fairly accurate, but if you slow down, you’ll go much farther. I went on a 10-mile ride with my young nephews on their little bikes, meaning we were sticking to speeds of around 10-12 mph. Somehow I only used 10% of the battery, giving a theoretical extrapolated range of 100 miles!The one thing I can’t believe Aventon left off were LED lights. They’ve been integrating tail lights into the frame on recent models, and they usually include a nice, bright headlight. It’s a bummer they didn’t put lights on the Sinch Step-Through.At a price of $1,799, the Aventon Sinch is priced slightly higher than a few other fat tire folders in its class. But it’s also made better, comes from a highly reputable company and sports better parts.So you pay a bit more to get a better product, which I find to be absolutely worth it in my opinion.As someone who works in the e-bike industry and rides both leisurely and professionally, I have a lot of bikes. But if I could only have a few e-bikes (it pains me too much to even imagine only having one), the new Aventon Sinch Step-Through would 100% be one of them. It’s just too well made and awesome performing to pass up. And its newly improved rideability only makes it that much better.",ebikes
2022/02/18,"Remember that time 14 months ago when French company Valeo announced the development of a new electric bicycle mid-drive system that included a built-in automatic transmission? Electrek remembers. And now that drive unit is ready for production. It will soon be available on several e-bike models thanks to partnerships with over a dozen electric bicycle companies.Fourteen, to be exact. That’s the number of companies that have signed on to incorporate Valeo’s new e-bike drive into upcoming electric bicycle models.The companies include players such as Fuell, Cycleurope, and VUF Bikes.Paris-based Valeo developed the new drive system with the help of transmission maker Effigear. Together, their technology combined to incorporate a seven-speed automatic transmission directly into the mid-drive motor, creating a single power and transmission unit.The resulting powertrain can be incorporated directly into OEM e-bikes similarly to typical mid-drive motors like those from Bosch or Brose.Its seven gear ratios are designed to operate on a 48V system, and Valeo offers a downtube-mounted battery as part of the complete powertrain package.The motor is quite powerful, with Valeo stating that it is capable of generating up to 130 Nm of torque. In fact, the company claims that the new drive is “up to 60% more powerful than competitors,” though you might not know it by looking at the sticker. Nearly all electric bicycle motors in the EU are listed as “250W continuous,” regardless of their true power. This is due to EU laws that restrict the maximum continuous power of e-bike motors to 250W. In actuality, many European-manufactured e-bike motors typically fall in the 400-750W range. Because there is no regulation related to the torque generated by different e-bike motors, the torque figure is more useful to actually compare the true power of various e-bike motors in Europe.Another advantage of Valeo’s system is that its automatic built-in transmission completely removes the need for a derailleur. That makes a belt drive setup an easy and effective option. Riders then benefit from a number of unique advantages over chain drives, such as quieter operation, longer lasting components, and cleaner operation without the need for oiling.According to the company, the new drivetrain will enter series production in May of this year. Based on its current order book, Valeo expects to deliver 100,000 units by 2024.The company will also be providing service to end customers who use bikes fitted with the system, as the company explained:“Alongside the launch of e-bikes fitted with the Group’s 48V technology, Valeo will also make its expertise available in the aftermarket. To make it easier to service and maintain the drivetrain system, Valeo will roll out the necessary technical assistance to all the bike distribution networks chosen by bike manufacturers, wherever the Group’s customers are located.”To get a better idea of how the e-bike drive and automatic transmission work, check out the company’s explainer video below.",ebikes
2022/02/17,"Electric bicycles can largely be grouped into two categories: Those powered by hub-motors and those powered by mid-drive motors. The former are generally seen as more affordable due to the simpler technology, while the latter are often increasingly premium offerings that employ more sophisticated drivetrains. But the upcoming EUNORAU D6 electric bicycle looks to bring that mid-drive performance in at a hub-motor price.Most mid-drive electric bicycles start at a minimum of $3,000, with the price increasingly steeply from there. They become even more expensive when they include a torque sensor, which is a more sophisticated way to engage the electric pedal assist to result in more natural assistance that better mimics human input.We’ve occasionally seen more affordable mid-drive electric bike options that employ lesser-known Chinese motors without torque sensors, but they’re the exception to the rule. The newly unveiled EUNORAU D6 looks to present a mid-drive road-style electric bike at a surprisingly affordable promotional price of $1,199. That’s even lower than most of the go-to hub motor e-bikes on the market right now.We are still learning more about the upcoming EUNORAU D6, and at this point, most of our information comes from the bike’s pre-launch page on Indiegogo. A few early images we’ve been able to obtain show both flat bar and drop bar options on the electric road bike.The new model is listed as sporting a 60 Nm motor, though the power level isn’t advertised yet. That 60 Nm of torque likely puts it in the mid-power range, with more power than most of the base level 250W motors. However, it will still likely come with a “250W nominal” rating to keep it street legal in countries that limit e-bikes to 250W of power.The bike’s motor looks to drive an 11-speed cassette on the rear wheel, with the bike itself rocking 700c tires.Other components that are easy to spot in the limited images include mechanical disc brakes and a frame-integrated removable battery. There’s no word yet on the battery capacity, but the size would suggest it likely falls in the 300-400 Wh range.The D6’s range is listed as 50 km (31 miles) and the bike weighs in at 18 kg (39 lb).There will also be an accompanying smartphone app that includes features such as Calorie consumption, trip records, social networking, and over-the-air (OTA) updates. The company also says that the D6 will come in “a wide range of sizes & color options so everyone – no matter your gender or body type – can ride a bike that fits and feels amazing.”EUNORAU describes the D6 as being designed for both pavement and gravel, meaning the company is likely targeting the gravel e-biking sector as well.Images from the page show a closeup of the bike’s welds, revealing nicely filleted joints normally seen on bikes with higher attention to detail, such as those from e-bike company Aventon.A short teaser video showing the D6 can be seen below. There’s no word yet on exactly when the D6 will launch, but its promotional price of $1,199 appears to be an early-bird offer for pre-orders on Indiegogo. Afterwards, the $800 anticipated discount will disappear likely, bringing the bike up to its $1,999 MSRP.Even at that price, these specs would make it competitive with other lightweight fitness e-bikes, especially with that mid-drive motor and torque sensor.While we await more news and a confirmed launch date, let’s hear your thoughts on the EUNORAU D6 in the comments section below.",ebikes
2022/02/14,"Electric bicycles come with added electric motors to make riding quicker, easier, and more fun. Throttle e-bikes don’t even require pedaling at all, turning them into little electric mopeds. And that easy operation also opens the door to serious utility possibilities, such as effortlessly carrying a second rider on the back.There are plenty of dual-passenger e-bikes out there to choose from, and this Valentine’s Day might be the perfect time to take a look.Several electric bicycle companies have come out with e-bike models that are either designed for two riders or can have a second passenger seat added as a factory-made accessory.Here are some of the ones we’ve tested out.Rad Power Bikes is the largest electric bicycle company in North America… by a long shot. And so they know a thing or two about e-bikes, including e-bikes built for two.There are three models of e-bikes from Rad that are perfect for carrying passengers.The RadRunner and RadRunner Plus models share the same moped-style frame and long rear rack built directly into the structure of the bike. That means they can support a lot of weight, as in your loved one riding on back (or a couple kids).The RadRunner starts at $1,499, but you’ll want to add the $99 Passenger Package accessory that lets you bolt on a comfy bench seat, foot pegs, and a clear wheel skirt that keeps any dangling feet out of the rear wheel.The RadRunner Plus is priced at $1,899, but comes with the Passenger Package pre-installed. It also has a suspension fork, 7-speed drivetrain, and LCD display. When I reviewed the RadRunner Plus, I called it one of the most utility-focused e-bikes I’d ever tried.Both can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) and have ranges of up to 45 miles (72 km), though you’ll definitely get reduced range with a passenger on back.If you want to go even bigger, check out the RadWagon from Rad Power Bikes. It’s a $1,999 longtail cargo e-bike that has a super-extended rear rack. You’ll want to add the Deck Pads to make a cushier seat on back. It’s a great way to carry a passenger since there’s tons of room to stretch out back there.Rad Power Bikes is also known for its great service and its nearly nationwide Rad Mobile support, which can send a bike shop in a van to your driveway if you ever need help with bike maintenance or if you ever require a repair.California-based Juiced Bikes specializes in higher power electric bikes, which is exactly what you want when you’re carrying a passenger – Juiced has three bikes that would be perfect for carrying a friend or loved one on the back.The most powerful (and most fun) option is the HyperScrambler 2. It offers a long bench seat, plus a super powerful 1,000W motor that sends the bike up to 30 mph (51 km/h) speeds.The $2,999 price tag is a bit steep for many new riders, but it also comes with two batteries offering up to 100 miles (160 km) of range in pedal assist mode. And with motorcycle-level parts like tires and hydraulic brakes, the HyperScrambler 2 is really bordering on moped or motorcycle-class quality.For a bit of a lower price without sacrificing too much performance, check out the $2,199 Juiced Scorpion X. You can add the passenger kit for $135, and you’ll have a 28 mph (45 km/h) electric bike that offers many of the same high quality parts found on the HyperScrambler 2.[Update: It looks like Juiced is including the passenger kit for free on Valentine’s Day. Sweet!]If you like the Scorpion’s step-through frame but want to go all “Hyper” with the highest performance, the HyperScorpion is for you. It’s currently on sale for $2,599, making it a nice compromise between the two.Last but not least, the base-level Scrambler costs just $1,799 but still offers great performance specs, and that long bench seat that makes it perfect for carrying a passenger!Ariel Rider is another high power electric bicycle company, and they’re known for a great balance between reasonable prices and impressive specs.The Ariel Rider Grizzly is the craziest of all of Ariel’s models, and it will get you well above 30 mph (51 km/h) even with a passenger on back. By yourself, speeds of up to 35 mph (56 km/h) are doable. The 3,700 watt e-bike also features dual motors, dual suspension and dual batteries for the highest power and longest range. It’s kind of amazing just how much power and capacity they fit into that thing.The Grizzly is a $3,299 e-bike though, so you may want to look at some of the company’s other models if you’re trying to save some cash.The 52V X-Class is priced at $2,399 and will still get you up to nearly as fast as the Grizzly, though it only has one battery and one motor. You know, like most e-bikes.It also has full-suspension and looks the part of a true electric moped. It’s definitely a crowd pleaser, and I loved it when I reviewed it last year.You might have noticed a theme here – dual passenger e-bikes aren’t cheap. Tern won’t turn that trend around, but at least you’d be getting an amazing quality e-bike for your money.The HSD is the more affordable of the two and starts at just over $3,000. The GSD will send you closer to the $5,000 territory depending on where you buy it and with what features. Both bikes come with mid-drive motors, hydraulic disc brakes, and high-end shifters. Some versions even have automatic transmissions – talk about fancy!The GSD and HSD are serious e-bikes designed for someone who plans to ride everyday, rain or shine, and replace thousands of miles a year that they used to do with a car. While Tern’s models are more e-bike than many people need, they are some of the best dual-passenger utility e-bikes out there.I even had the chance to personally experience how much fun they are from the back seat when Tern’s bossman himself, Team Captain Josh Hon, took me for a spin on one at Interbike (RIP Interbike).This one technically isn’t an electric bicycle – it’s an electric scooter. There are no pedals on the SWFT Maxx, but it still makes for an awesome ride with two riders. My wife and I had a blast testing this one out together, and she spent just as much time in the “driver’s” seat as I did.It is fairly small and lightweight, meaning it handles nicely and doesn’t feel like a big heavy gas scooter – the only downside is that it only goes 20 mph (32 km/h). While that’s the same speed as all of the Rad bikes at the top of this article, it feels slower when you’re on a motorcycle-like scooter. But with a price of $1,999, it’s less expensive than many e-bikes while offering motorcycle-style hydraulic disc brakes, full-suspension, complete light package, storage areas, and a big, comfy seat.Are there any other awesome dual-rider e-bikes out there that I missed? Be sure to let me know in the comments section below.Oh, and don’t forget to trade off on who gets the front seat from time to time![Update: It turns out that several e-bike companies are offering sales for Valentine’s Day, even if they aren’t two seaters. Lectric eBikes is offering two free comfort packages if you by two Lectric XP 2.0 e-bikes (and they’re an amazing $999 deal already). Zugo is offering $200 off their e-bikes when you use the code BUY2SAVE$200 at checkout. And we’ll update with more sales as we find them.]",ebikes
2022/02/13,"Porsche isn’t playing around when it comes to electric bikes. Not only has the German automaker already launched its own line of electric bicycles, but now we’re getting word that Porsche has bought up yet another company in the e-bike industry.This time Porsche set its sights on a company known as Fazua.You may not know them by name, but there’s a chance you’ve seen one of the 40 different e-bike brands that carry the company’s motors.While e-bike motors often bring to mind major players like Bosch, Brose, Bafang, Shimano, and Yamaha, Fazua has developed perhaps the most innovative electric drive systems of all.That’s because Fazua’s mid-drive motors are actually removable from the electric bike, along with the battery pack. That allows riders to remove essentially all of the extra weight of an e-bike when they want to go it alone, sans assistance or extra weight.And the latest news out of Fazua is that it’s got a new owner: Porsche.The deal sees Porsche purchasing an initial 20% ownership of the company for an undisclosed amount, with the option to buy enough additional shares to put Porsche in majority ownership of the company.Porsche also announced that it is establishing a strategic partnership with Ponooc, a Dutch investment company that specializes in sustainable energy and mobility solutions. Porsche says that it will establish two ventures with Ponooc. As the company explained:“The first joint venture is to develop, manufacture and distribute a future generation of high-quality Porsche e-bikes. The second company will focus on technological solutions in the fast growing micro-mobility market.”Porsche has already released a pair of high-end electric bicycles under its own brand. It also recently purchased a controlling stake in premium electric mountain bike company Greyp, which was developed by electric hypercar manufacturer Rimac.Electric bicycles may be Porsche’s newest electric focus, but it is far from the brand’s first. The all-electric Porsche Taycan was presented in 2019 as the brand’s first electric sports car. Almost 40% of the cars Porsche delivered in Europe last year were either all-electric or hybrids. Worldwide, that figure was nearly 25%.And Porsche isn’t the only automaker investing in electric bicycles.Peugot has its own extensive line of e-bikes, and Spain’s SEAT has partnered with Barcelona-based Silence to roll out its own seated and standing electric scooters.GM developed an electric bicycle in-house, though the project was killed off early in the COVID-19 pandemic.Jeep has gotten into the high-power e-bike game via licensing agreements, though its similar attempt to co-develop an electric scooter was significantly less impressive.Even motorcycle manufacturers like Harley-Davidson and BMW Motorrad have gotten into electric bicycles and scooters, though Harley’s results have been much more impressive than BMW’s.",ebikes
2022/02/11,"When Rad Power Bikes launched the RadRunner 2, it didn’t show off a laundry list of new updates. Instead, there were only a few key changes. And that’s because the affordably priced RadRunner was already such a popular e-bike that it only required a few small updates to make it better than ever before.As the old adage goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.If you’re new to the electric bike industry (welcome!) or if you just haven’t heard of the RadRunner platform (weird, but okay!), then let me give you a brief rundown.The RadRunner 2 here is basically a moped and a cargo bike all rolled into one bicycle-size package.It offers extreme utility for hauling cargo or companions, and yet still works great as a bicycle for either fun recreational riding or fitness-inspired assisted pedaling rides.To get a sense of all that the RadRunner 2 has to offer, check out my video review below. Then keep going for my complete written review below the video.The RadRunner 2 is not a large electric bike by any stretch of the imagination. Walk up to a full-sized RadRover and you’ll be taken aback by how much bike stands before you. But a RadRunner, on the other hand, is a much more approachable size for just about everybody.The 20″ wheels give you a lower bike than typical 26″ x 4″ fat tires would, and the 3.3″ width of the tires strikes a nice balance between fat and narrow tire options. The modest width keeps the tires more nimble without getting into ultra-fat tire territory.Even though the bike is small and approachable, it can still handle big jobs. It’s got the widest sizing range of all of Rad Power Bikes’ lineup, meaning it can fit both short and tall riders from 4’11” to 6’2″ (150-188 cm). It supports loads up to 300 lb (136 kg), despite itself only weighing 65 lb (29). That’s not a lightweight e-bike by any means, but it’s still a lot lighter than many cargo e-bikes.And that’s the beauty of the RadRunner 2, it’s part cargo bike, part pleasure bike. The tall rear rack is great for loading up with gear, and I definitely recommend grabbing the passenger package if you have kids/friends/partners in your life that you want to take for a ride. The passenger package adds a comfy bench seat, foot pegs, and clear protective wheel skirt. That allows you to carry both kids and adults back there, turning the RadRunner 2 into a handy little electric moped for two riders. I also added the passenger grab bars to give an even more convenient way to carry another person on back.Speaking of seats, the original RadRunner seat got an upgrade on the RadRunner 2, making it more plush and comfortable than ever. It’s a bit of an odd shape, but that’s because it meshes perfectly with the passenger kit bench when you drop the seat down, turning it into one long saddle the length of the bike’s rear.The RadRunner 2 is simply one of the coolest all-around do-anything types of e-bikes. It’s small and nimble enough for city riding, has big enough tires for trail riding, and has the utility and cargo capacity to serve as a work bike to haul just about anything you need.It even comes with pretty decent parts on the bike component side. None of this is top-shelf stuff, but the Tektro brakes come with high-grip pads for powerful stopping on the 180 mm rotors. The single-speed drivetrain with a 16-52t setup gives a comfortable pedaling ratio at lower and higher speeds, and the dual kickstand makes for a stable, easy-to-use way to park the bike on any surface.I’m not a huge fan of the pedals being composite instead of aluminum, but at least it does save weight. And I’d love to see accessories like fenders included on the base model, but at least we do get lights included standard. Many companies up-charge for lights to be installed, so I’m glad to see Rad still ensures you get all the proper safety equipment as standard components on the bike.The only thing I often hear people complain about the RadRunner platform, and something I empathize with, is the desire for more speed. Topping out at 20 mph (32 km/h) is fine in some areas, but I’d love to be able to eke out a bit more. Even just 25 mph (40 km/h) would be awesome, though I guess you could always upgrade to the RadRunner Plus and unlock it if you truly needed the higher speed. I don’t mind the simple LED display or the single-speed setup on the RadRunner 2, but the RadRunner Plus would be the option for anyone who wants this same bike, but with multiple gears and an unlockable LCD display – not to mention front suspension.As it is, the RadRunner 2 is a more stripped-down version with just what you need in an e-bike designed for getting things done. No speedometer, no extra gears. Just a responsive throttle and good cadence-sensor pedal assist on an awesome utility bike frame. Not to mention the fact that you get the bike delivered to you fully assembled using Rad Mobile, the delivery service and mobile bike-shop-in-a-van offered by Rad. For anyone that doesn’t want to assemble their own e-bike out of the box, Rad Mobile is an awesome option to have available. And it means the company will be able to take care of you in the future if you ever needed service or support to swap out a part.Before Rad was forced to raise prices by $200 at the end of last year, the RadRunner was an even sweeter deal. But this is the new reality we live in, and I still call the RadRunner 2 a buy at its current price of $1,499. It’s a bit steeper, but the bike is absolutely worth it. It’s a novel design that Rad created from the ground up, and you’re paying for that innovation, as well as for the service and support that comes with shopping from the largest electric bike company in North America.There are certainly cheaper options for e-bikes out there, but the RadRunner 2 is so nicely designed that it holds its own when compared to budget e-bikes. What do you think about the RadRunner? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/02/10,"There’s nothing more “personal” than an electric bicycle named the Babymaker. And after selling over $13 million worth of the original e-bike, FLX has announced that it’s coming back with a new and improved Babymaker II e-bike.The company looks to be teasing an upcoming launch of the Babymaker II electric bike, though there’s no word yet on exactly when the launch will take place.A page set up on the company’s site offers scant details, though the option to grab $1,000 off when the bike launches looks like a sweet deal.The original Babymaker was priced at closer to $2k (though it pre-sold at much less during its promotional period) when it launched on Indiegogo in early 2020. The crowdfunding campaign turned out to be a massive success for the company, raising over $13 million from thousands of soon-to-be Babymaker riders.We generally don’t cover new crowdfunding projects here on Electrek unless we’ve seen the product in person or the company has a history of delivering. After seeing FLX deliver on thousands of its first rendition of Babymakers though, the sequel seems like a fairly safe bet.The original Babymaker was an ultra stealthy e-bike that looked like a typical pedal bike, hiding away its electric-assist in a tiny rear wheel hub motor and frame-integrated battery.The updated model looks to be more of the same, though the teaser site shows a new battery that is 43% larger, which should result in an improved range.The page also shows that it will feature flat handlebars, high-end Magura hydraulic disc brakes, a Gates carbon belt drive, an “improved riding position,” and a 25 mph (40 km/h) top speed from a 350W motor in the rear wheel.There doesn’t appear to be a throttle, so this looks like a pedal-assist-only electric bike.There are also a few photos on the pre-launch page, though the company says that things could still change:“The FLX Babymaker II is still in development and its final launch price has not been finalized yet. While the images used are the latest prototypes & renders, the final components/design may differ slightly. We will publish any changes to appearance, cost, or function before launch day.”These single-speed electric bikes with Gates carbon belt drives are becoming quite popular lately.Ride1Up released its ultra-affordable Roadster V2 with a belt drive and then updated it with a Gravel Edition recently, including a bona fide Gates belt along with disc brakes.Other single-speed e-bikes like the RadMission from Rad Power Bikes and Rideal from Ariel Rider have also promoted simple, low-cost e-bikes as effective commuter solutions.This method of hyping an upcoming crowdfunding campaign is also popular in the e-bike industry. We have seen similar moves from other darlings of the crowdfunding world like Fiido, which hyped its futuristic-looking Fiido X folding e-bike significantly ahead of a successful launch on Indiegogo.With the original Babymaker proving how successful an e-bike campaign can be on a crowdfunding platform, FLX is surely looking for a repeat performance on the Babymaker II.But as with most e-bikes, the ultimate decider will likely come down to the final price and specs. It sure looks like a nice bike, with a sleek and stealthy design, but an ultra-competitive market like this is often won or lost on the price tag.What do you think of the Babymaker II so far? Do you have any experience with the original? Do you have a fun Babymaker joke that I probably wouldn’t have been able to sneak past my absolutely wonderful copy editors or HR?

2022/02/09,"I’ve long called the Lectric XP 2.0 the best bang-for-your-buck electric bicycle because it offers so much utility and performance for its modest $999 price. And with the step-through version of the e-bike, Phoenix-based Lectric eBikes has made the popular two-wheeler more accessible than ever before.The Lectric XP 2.0 is the follow-up to one of the most well-known budget electric bikes of the last few years, the Lectric XP.The team behind the e-bike started as a three-man garage company in 2018 but quickly shot to fame, selling over a hundred thousand e-bikes amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.And that shouldn’t come as a surprise. With many e-bikes costing several thousand dollars while offering mid-level performance, the Lectric XP 2.0 lets riders hit the highest speeds allowed by law while maintaining an extremely fair $999 price.Check out what it’s like to throw a leg over this fun little e-bike in my video review below. Then keep scrolling to read my detailed experiences from testing the bike.The Lectric XP 2.0 comes with so many upgrades that it’s hard to keep track of them all.The new suspension fork offers a hydraulic ride that softens big bumps and smooths out rough trails.The new 3″ tires provide a more nimble ride while maintaining enough air volume for comfortable cruising on nearly any terrain.The heavy-duty rear rack is rated for big cargo loads up to 77 lb (35 kg). And you know if they rate it at that, they’ve definitely tested it with twice that much weight on it. It’s so sturdy that a person could sit back there. They can’t tell you that, but I can say it. The new saddle is a big upgrade in comfort, but the available “Comfort Package” ups the ride quality even more with a giant cruiser-style saddle with spring suspension AND a new suspension seat post. Together, they give you the most suspended ride yet on a bike from Lectric.The new handlebars on the bike are now wider, and the whole bike is IP65 rated, meaning the electronics on the bars and everywhere else can go through a rainstorm without you having to worry about shorting anything out.The folding mechanism is much sturdier and more robust now, making for a much more rugged bike overall.The battery did take a small capacity hit, dropping from 10.4 Ah to 9.6 Ah. The battery is hidden inside the frame where it can be unlocked and removed. Like all internal batteries, they are capacity-limited by just how many cells can be crammed inside the frame tubes.While the company will tell you that the max range is 45 miles (72 km), don’t expect to actually see anywhere close to that. If you’re riding with pedal assist, you can maybe hit the mid-30 miles, but throttle-only riding will keep you closer to the low- or mid-20s. This is not a long-range e-bike, but that’s pretty much the one bummer you’ll find on the Lectric XP 2.0. After that, it’s all uphill from here, and that’s an electrically-assisted uphill!The 850W peak-rated motor (“500W continuous”) is powerful enough to offer 28 mph (45 km/h) speed when in pedal assist mode 5, though throttle-only riding tops out at 20 mph (45 km/h).The ride itself is super nimble thanks to those smaller 20″ diameter wheels. They flick around more easily than ever in the 3″ size, since you’ve got less rubber to move. They still seem to cover just about any surface you can imagine, even if they aren’t as fat as 4″ tires. I’ve tried riding on grass, asphalt, concrete, gravel, boardwalks, dirt, packed sand, and more. So far, I’ve yet to find something they can’t handle.The accessory packages that were introduced with the Lectric XP 2.0 make the bike even more useful.The cargo package adds front and rear baskets for hauling tons of gear. They make for a great reason to choose the step-through version of the bike, too. Once you have a tall basket on back and load it with objects, stepping through the center of the bike is a much nicer way to hop on and off. The last thing you want is to try and throw your leg over a basket loaded above the rails with cargo.To be honest, even the standard frame on the Lectric XP 2.0 isn’t that high, so it’s not too hard to step over it. But the actual step-through version of the bike is definitely easier to mount, and I think it has become my favorite.It’s interesting that step-through bikes used to be considered women’s bikes, but these days they have become just a normal alternative frame choice. The fact that they are easier and more comfortable to mount have made them a popular option for men and women alike of all ages. There even several models of e-bikes that come solely in step-through formats, further underscoring the popularity of the design.The Lectric XP 2.0 in either its standard or step-through design remains one of my top recommendations, and I often pitch it to people as a great first e-bike. When someone is curious about joining the e-bike party but doesn’t want to spend a fortune, the Lectric XP 2.0 has proven to be a great option. It offers performance that matches the fastest legal e-bikes out there and does it in a comfortable, nimble e-bike that even folds for convenient car transport. The quality of the bicycle components like shifters and brakes is good but not incredible. It’s enough for any casual rider, even if the components won’t impress lycra-enthusiasts that do several hundred miles per week on their bikes. As a $999 bang-for-your-buck e-bike, that’s exactly what you want. A good-not-great e-bike that offers the right balance of quality and price. And with the 2.0 version, Lectric eBikes has somehow pushed the balance to an even better point by upping the quality of the bike without letting the price float past the $1K barrier. That’s a hell of a deal on a hell of an e-bike.",ebikes
2022/02/08,"Electric bicycles have been putting more new and returning riders on two wheels than ever before. And in case anyone needed more proof that e-bikes are a key component of the future of transportation, the latest data and market research shows that sales volume and revenue are heading into the stratosphere.We’ve recently showcased data that indicates electric bicycles outsold electric cars and hybrids combined in the US last year.And the pace doesn’t appear to be slowing down.The Light Electric Vehicle Association projects that the US imported approximately 790,000 e-bikes in 2021. That’s a significant increase over the nearly 450,000 e-bikes imported in 2020 and closer to 250,000 in 2019.On top of the huge increase in imports and sales in the US last year, several e-bike companies have raised significant funding to grow their operations. The largest US e-bike company, Rad Power Bikes, even hauled in multiple funding rounds amounting to over $300 million.With such significant investments flowing into electric bicycle companies, it takes no stretch of the imagination to see the US soon surpassing 1 million electric bike sales annually.The sales figures in Europe are even more impressive.Electric bicycles are expected to outsell cars (electric and gas-powered) in Europe by as early as this decade.And with that level of growth, the electric bicycle industry is worth some serious cash. The global e-bike industry is expected to balloon to a value of $40.98 billion dollars by the end of the decade, according to Precedence Research.Asia is by far the largest e-bike market, selling tens of millions of e-bikes every year. Europe follows behind, while North America brings up the rear.But every market is seeing huge increases in sales volume, driven by several key factors.Many higher-end electric bicycles still cost several thousand dollars, but several companies are now offering high-performance e-bikes for under $1,000, making the technology more accessible for wider swaths of the public. Some companies have been forced recently to increase prices slightly due to supply chain issues and increased costs of materials, but value-oriented companies have kept most of their models at well under half the cost of fancier higher-end electric bikes.While the e-bike market was already expanding at an impressive rate before the COVID-19 pandemic, the new realities of a changing world helped bolster sales further. Many commuters who had previously taken cramped public transportation to work instead sought out electric bicycles as socially distant alternatives to risky crowded places. Others flocked to electric bicycles as a fun, healthy activity or a new hobby to take up during lockdowns around the world. Affordable trail-oriented e-bikes and electric gravel bikes can now be found for under $1,200, further expanding the hobby of recreational e-biking.Still more riders have discovered that electric bicycles can be effective cost-cutting measures when trying to reduce personal transportation costs. Although rare, some e-bike riders have been able to completely replace their cars, sometimes saving tens of thousands of dollars in fuel, insurance, car payments, parking, and other costs.Other times e-bikes have been used to replace one car in a household, turning two-car families into one car and one e-bike families.With the explosion in popularity of affordable cargo e-bikes and utility e-bikes, many families are performing more of their carpooling and shopping duties on two wheels.As electric bicycles continue to grow in popularity, expect to see these rising market figures continue their skyward trajectory.",ebikes
2022/02/07,"The Model Y from Electric Bike Company is one women’s e-bike that I’ll happily ride anytime, anywhere. And so will my wife.That’s the impression we came away with after getting the chance to test out a beautifully-outfitted Model Y electric bike recently in California.I say “beautifully-outfitted” because that’s exactly the point: Electric Bike Company’s e-bikes are designed to be ultra customizable. They build them locally right there in Newport Beach, California. That local touch means that riders get to customize just about every part of the bike, from paint and metal trim color to choosing from a million and one accessory options.Electric Bike Company graciously invited us out and put us on a decked out Model Y so we could get the full experience. And wow, was it an experience! Get a load of this awesome e-bike in my video review below. Then find even more detail in my complete written account further down the page.The Model Y may be known as a women’s bike, but that’s largely marketing speak. What it really is, in my opinion, is just a great step-through cruiser e-bike that exudes cruisery good vibes. The one I tested had a beautiful powder blue paint job, fuzzy basket liner, drop-dead gorgeous wooden fenders with matching wooden chain guard, leather carry pouch, super wide cruiser seat with matching bar grips and so much more. As someone who doesn’t actually live in California, it absolutely screamed “California beach cruiser” to me.This is great, because my wife and I happened to be visiting during an unseasonably cold and foggy period, so I could use all the warm Cali-vibes there are to offer.Even ignoring all the fun accessories that were added onto the bike, all of the standard equipment feels top notch from the moment you throw a leg over (or through, rather) the e-bike.The hydraulic disk brakes are strong and crisp, offering confident stopping power with nearly zero maintenance. The ultra-large 58T chainring makes it easy to pedal up to the bike’s top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), though we both often got lazy and relied on the throttle for extra help.That wide and comfy saddle I mentioned above? It is included standard. As are the high power lights, with the tail lights even mounted on either side of the bike to make them extra visible.Coming from a beach community, EBC knows how rough the salty environment can be on a bike. So all of the hardware is made from corrosion-resistant stainless steel and all of the bearings in places like the pedals, crank and headset are entirely sealed.The powerful 1,000W motor offers plenty of boost when you need it and even comes with a 10 year warranty. The basket battery that comes in multiple sizes also features an industry-leading warranty of five years. That kind of long term backing is nearly unheard of in the e-bike industry, and its very confidence inspiring to see EBC offer such long term support. A big part of it comes down to just how much oversight they have over the production of their bikes since they handle it all in-house right there in Newport Beach.We toured the various factory buildings where EBC builds its e-bikes and got an up-close and personal view of just how much effort goes into building these high quality rides locally in California.You can check out our inside look at the company’s factory in the video below.And you better believe that all of that attention to detail translates directly into the ride experience. The wide bars of the Model Y give you that old-school cruiser feeling as you whip around the boardwalk or the city.The big ol’ tires combine nicely with the front suspension to offer a surprisingly plush ride (and I suspect that giant saddle was also part of the equation).One note on the suspension fork though – while I enjoyed it, the fork made the front end of the bike a bit taller than it would be with the rigid fork option, which combined with the large wheels and big tires to create an even taller bike for my petite wife. She likes to be able to flat foot it at stops, which the pedal-forward design of the frame usually would allow. But for short riders like her (she’s 5’3), I’d recommend either opting for the 24″ wheel option or sticking with a non-suspension fork to keep the bike nice and low – if that’s your thing.Speaking of which, it’s pretty cool that you can choose your wheel size, so shorter riders or anyone who likes smaller wheels can get those factory installed on the bike.Even if the e-bike only came in a few set styles, it’d already be a great ride. But the ability to customize everything on the Model Y makes it that much more appealing.The base-level 432 Wh battery in the front basket will give most recreational riders plenty of range, but the option to double up on the battery for a full 864 Wh means riders can go even further without having a funky-looking extra battery bolted onto the frame.In fact, the battery being hidden in the basket is a big part of what gives the Model Y that classic look.It does make the bike a bit more front heavy, which you mostly tend to notice during slower speed maneuvering. When it comes time to lift the bike, the front battery offers a bit more balance for that rear hub motor, making a center lift possible. Well, possible for the strong armed. My wife couldn’t throw the nearly 60 lb. bike in the back of a truck if her life depended on it, but again, she’s pretty small. Compared to other cruiser-ish e-bikes, the weight is par for the course. Electric Bike Company even goes above and beyond in other ways. While we tested the bike on site and didn’t experience a delivery, I’ve had a bike shipped from EBC in the past, and the experience is night and day compared to every other e-bike company.The bike is boxed up completely assembled and wrapped in custom designed foam blocks that are cut to fit the exact shape of the bike.That means it not only arrives without damage, but you just roll it out of the box and can start riding right away (well, after you turn the handlebars straight). Most e-bikes arrive and require 30-60 minutes of assembly time, which can be daunting for new riders who aren’t used to bolting together bicycle parts. And considering these are machines that get ridden around cars at fast speeds, putting together an e-bike correctly is pretty important.That’s why its nice to have the peace of mind that comes from professional assembly at EBC’s factory – something you just can’t get from an e-bike shipped directly from Asia.All in all I have to say that I’m very impressed with the Electric Bike Company’s Model Y e-bike. It can hit those faster Class 3 speeds while still being a fun low-and-slow electric bicycle for leisurely cruises.The motor is powerful without being overpowered, and the ride is comfortable without feeling sluggish. It’s a great balance, and it’s quite fairly priced at $1,949. Sure, it’s more expensive than many budget e-bikes, but you’re paying American wages to produce the bike locally, and you’re also getting local support with a 5-year battery warranty and a 10-year frame and motor warranty.You get what you pay for – these good quality components combined with local manufacturing and support make a huge difference. And it’s a difference that I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing!What do you think of the Model Y from EBC? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below!",ebikes
2022/02/06,"Belgium-based urban electric bicycle manufacturer Cowboy has shared interesting data gleaned from its ridership, providing insight on how much fitness benefit is offered by electric bikes.Fitness is just one of the many draws of electric bicycle riding.Many riders have switched away from cars or buses for their commute, opting instead for electric bicycles.E-bikes, which include an electric assist motor and battery to add extra power to the rider’s own pedaling effort, can often travel at nearly car speed in many cities when factoring in traffic (and sometimes even arrive faster than cars by using the traffic-busting bicycle lanes).It is a common misconception that electric bicycles don’t offer exercise benefits, despite many studies showing the opposite. Some studies have even shown that electric bicycles offer even more exercise than pedal bikes because riders often end up riding longer than they would on a pedal bike.Cowboy’s recent data gleaned from its smartphone app that pairs with customers’ e-bikes paints an interesting picture of how its e-bikes are used by typical riders.Cowboy’s co-founder and CTO Tanguy Goretti explained that riders are traveling farther and riding longer after the company introduced a new app, saying that the company saw an 8% increase in distance traveling and 15% increase in moving time.To put that in concrete numbers, the company said its bikes saw an average of nine rides per week, each with an average of 4.5 km (2.8 miles) per trip.As Cowboy’s e-bikes are designed largely for urban riding, that seems to check out. Leisure or fitness e-bikes often see longer average rides, but city e-bikes are typically used for urban navigation where they often perform shorter trips that slice through the heart of densely populated areas. That 40.5 km per week (25 miles) equates to around 650 calories of riding. Keep in mind that Cowboy e-bikes don’t have throttles, and thus they require the user to pedal in order for the motor to activate.The company says that’s equivalent to a total of around 90 minutes of moderately intense running per week. Many people find it difficult (or annoying) to get in an hour and a half of running, but nine short e-bike trips sound a lot easier (and more fun).Cowboy, who is riding high on a recent $80M funding round to expand its electric bicycle operations, also referred to studies that indicate electric bicycles provide nearly the same cardiovascular benefit to riders as pedal bicycles. As the company explained:“After a month, differences in peak oxygen consumption, blood pressure, body composition, and maximal ergometric workload were within 2% for e-bike and regular bicycle riders.” Stated differently, pedal bicycle riders saw around 2% better improvements in cardiovascular measurements over e-bike riders.That’s pretty close.That data also aligns with what we’ve seen from other e-bike companies.Last year we reported on an experiment performed by Rad Power Bikes, where the company put five different riders on various styles of e-bikes while using various levels of pedal assist.Performing the same 30- to 40-minute ride, the calorie expenditures ranged from around 100 to 325 calories among the different riders.While pedaling a bicycle with zero electrical assistance for the same distance as an e-bike will undoubtedly result in more effort, e-bikes have proven time and again to still provide significant exercise benefits. And since electric bicycles are putting many more riders on two-wheels that would never have entertained the possibility of riding a purely pedal bike, they are arguably providing much more exercise as a result.via: T3",ebikes
2022/02/04,"The Eunorau Cargo Max uses a similar setup to the Eunorau G20 e-cargo bike that we previously tested, but swaps in a more affordable direct drive motor instead of the pricier mid-drive. Having put some good miles on the Eunorau Cargo Max recently, I’m ready to tell you exactly what I like (and don’t like) about this budget-friendly e-cargo bike.Electric cargo bikes are one of my favorite niches in the e-bike industry because of their extreme utility. While most e-bikes are for getting around or having fun, electric cargo bikes are for getting a week’s worth of groceries or helping a friend move. Or if carrying passengers is more your thing, they can be used for taking the kids to school or cruising the city with your partner. And the Eunorau Max Cargo electric bike is the latest heavy-hauling cargo bike I’ve tested that can perform all of these tasks and more.You can see my testing of the e-bike in my video review below, or keep reading for all of the details on this potent car-replacing electric bike.As a longtail electric cargo bike, you know what you’re getting into with the Eunorau Max Cargo here. It rides like a boat because it’s a stretched-out bike, but you get used to that handling pretty quickly.The 24″ tires split the difference between larger diameter bike wheels that give a smoother ride and smaller diameter alternatives that keep the bike more nimble.I love the half twist throttle as a comfortable way to apply power when you aren’t in the pedaling mood, though the cadence-based pedal assist and 7-speed Shimano drivetrain both work great when you do want to be an active part of the process.The braking is also more powerful than I found it to be on the Eunorau G20. Perhaps the company started supplying higher-quality brake pads as standard components. Whatever it is, I’m glad to see the brakes getting stronger.As usual, I really like the wooden accents that Eunorau includes, namely the rear cargo deck and the the side running boards. They look pretty snazzy and the running boards work great for either securing cargo or resting the feet of passengers.Speaking of passengers, I carried my nephews around as experimental payload and we all had a blast on the bike. Three riders was no problem at all, though we (or rather they) found that the wooden deck is not very comfortable to sit on by itself. I had a couple deck pads from another bike that I was able to use to make a more comfortable bench in back, though you could use any scrap of foam you having laying around to fashion a nicer seat if you wanted to.When I didn’t have human cargo in back, I lashed a variety of non-human cargo onto the bike. The variety of frame rails back there make it easy to bungee strap just about anything to the deck. The cargo and passengers are up a bit high, but you get used to the weight back there quite quickly.The Y-shaped double kickstand is great for parking while you have cargo strapped down, since it allows the bike to stay straight up and down instead of leaning to one side. And the low step-through shape of the frame on the Eunorau Cargo Max is also nice when you have passengers or cargo on back, so you don’t have to try and swing your leg over the bike and clear whatever obstacles you’re currently carrying. One easy step through the center of the frame is all it takes.The step-through section isn’t terribly low, but that’s also important on a long bike designed for heavy loads – you don’t want it accidentally becoming a folding bike.And did I mention the heavy loads? This thing is apparently rated for up to 440 lb or 200 kg! That sounds… like a tall order. Tern’s exquisitely-made bikes are rated for similar weights and they cost 3x as much. So I don’t know how I’d feel about loading this thing to the maximum all the time, but it is comforting to know that its built stronger than typical e-bikes.One of the main differentiators between this electric cargo bike and others is the motor. Eunorau is using a direct drive hub motor, which is why it is so much larger in diameter than most hub motors these days. The direct drive format was more popular several years ago but has since lost favor among many manufacturers due to its higher weight and lower torque. On the other hand, the giant size means it is much better at heat dissipation (important for cargo bikes that may generate lots of motor heat when hauling heavy loads up long hills). They also tend to last longer than geared motors since there aren’t any internal moving parts to break down. When geared motors start chipping teeth and running into problems, direct drive motors like these pretty much keep working forever, or at least until one day the magnets and laminations finally rust out – which could be several decades if you do a good job of not submerging your motor or riding in torrential rains all the time.Another nice feature of the new Eunorau Max Cargo is the ability to add a second battery. The entry level 550 Wh battery isn’t huge (upgrading to the 674 Wh battery helps boost your range), but adding a second battery gives you the chance to double your range. It’s as easy as screwing on three bolts and plugging the battery wire into a pre-installed receptacle that comes on each bike.As it stands, the entry-level model at $1,699 is a pretty good deal, though I’m not a huge fan of the 550 Wh battery. But if you upgrade to a larger battery or double up with two batteries, you’ve got some serious capacity to play with, though that also increases the cost significantly and makes it a harder sell in my opinion. To make it an even better deal though, use the code ELECTREK to take 3% off, or about $50 off of the base-level model!There are several options on the market now for electric cargo bikes, and I think Eunorau brings good value to the table. Smaller entry-level battery aside, the rest of the bike is good and you get nice included features like fenders and running boards that other companies sometimes charge extra for. While it doesn’t have the best fit and finish compared to the fancier e-bikes, it’s a solid entry in an important category, and you can call me a fan.Oh yeah, and the bike even came with a mystery gift inside, which was a fun little surprise to try and guess what it was. It had a very metallic sound and was super lightweight. I won’t ruin the surprise by spoiling it, but I’ll at least say that it wasn’t anything life changing. Still, a cute little idea that I’ve never heard of any other e-bike companies doing.So there are my thoughts, but enough of my yammering. What do you think of the Eunorau Max Cargo e-bike?Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/02/03,"It may sound foreign to Americans, but being paid to cycle to work on a pedal bicycle or electric bike is common in many countries.While bicycles are still popular forms of transportation, many more workers are now switching from four wheels to two thanks to the proliferaiton of electric bicycles.Electric bicycles work like traditional pedal bicycles, but include an additional electric motor and battery to assist the rider, taking the edge off of hill-climbing and higher-speed riding. Many riders favor e-bikes for allowing them to arrive at work without breaking a sweat, while still getting in some heart-healthy modest physical activity twice a day.The bike-to-work programs found in most countries usually take the form of a tax incentive, where tax-free bonuses are added to an employee’s paycheck each month for cycling to work instead of driving a personal car.And the programs are so successful that they’re continuing to grow.Belgium just increased its bike-to-work incentive to €0.25 per kilometer (approximately US $0.45 per mile), according to the Light Electric Vehicle Association. A five-mile commute to work could equate to over a thousand bucks a year, tax-free, straight into your pocket. And that’s not even including all the health benefits and the potential to drop a hole or two on your belt.Belgium isn’t alone in offering cash in exchange for pedaling to work. The Netherlands offers nearly as much, and the UK offers even more. A mileage allowance of around US $0.26 per mile is available to British cyclists who use their bikes to commute to work, according to the World Economic Forum.The UK also offers a lease-to-own incentive program that rewards cyclists with discounted bikes and cycling gear.Companies have to elect to partake in these programs, but the government refunds the incentives paid out to employees. Some companies even go above and beyond. When we spoke with GoCycle founder Richard Thorpe about the company’s high-tech folding electric bikes, he discussed how GoCycle had created a generous incentive to encourage its employees to bike to work.“At Gocycle, we introduced a UK-first policy that sees the business pay its employees 40p per mile [approximately $0.55] when they commute to work by e-bike rather than using their car. There are countless studies that show that encouraging cycling reduces sickness levels and contributes to a more productive, healthier and happier workforce.“Even tiny Luxembourg offers a tax incentive of around US $340 for buying a bicycle to commute with.Across Europe, there are over 300 tax-incentive and purchase-assistance schemes for bike-to-work programs, according the European Cyclists’ Federation.These programs are all aimed at realizing a number of advantages offered by replacing cars with bikes.With more people riding bikes and fewer cars clogging the roads, cities operate more efficiently. Studies have found that even a 10% switch from cars to bikes can reduce traffic congestion by around 40%. Fewer cars also means reduced emissions and cleaner cities. Then there’s the myriad of health benefits offered by cycling, which many studies have found are provided by both pedal bikes and electric bikes.All of this begs the question, Should the US incentivize cycling?In fact, it once did. An allowance of up to $240 per year for cycling expenses used to be included in the US tax code, but was removed as part of former President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.But that could be changing, even if chances look slim. In addition to the electric bicycle tax credit that was proposed as part of the Build Back Better Act, a pre-tax incentive of over $80/month is included for biking to work, according to the Sierra Club.Paying people to choose an alternative form of transportation that is beneficial to cities and citizens alike is a solid first step, but it isn’t enough by itself. Investments in safer cycling infrastructure are also key to helping move more commuters toward sustainable transportation options.The Build Back Better Act also includes provisions for badly needed cycling infrastructure, which may prove to be an essential piece of the puzzle.Unfortunately for riders, the BBB Act’s prospects don’t look great without the support of a majority of the Senate. Whether or not it passes though changes nothing about the need for such investments. As countries across Europe have proven, investing in cycling nets benefits for all. Perhaps it is time that the US woke up and smelled the roses on the side of the cycling path.",ebikes
2022/02/02,"I’ve always loved the way Aventon makes its electric bicycles. They exude a level of craftsmanship that far exceeds their modest prices. But the new Soltera offers a masterclass in building a lightweight, modestly powered e-bike for commuter use.The Soltera, which I tested in the single-speed variety but also comes in a 7-speed option, is a beauty to behold.I tested the Azure Blue model, which has some red and white accents that give it a real Frenchy vibe. But beyond the paint job,  the construction of the bike is exquisite. The welds are so smooth that the frame almost looks as if it was cast in one piece. The electrical wiring and brake lines are neatly routed inside the frame tubes. The tail lights are incorporated directly into the frame, hidden in the seat stay tubes and illuminating on either side of the rear wheel like true vehicle lights. The battery is nicely integrated to the point where you almost don’t even notice that the bike is electric.It all melds together beautifully into a bike that you’ll definitely want to see in action. Check out my video review below, but don’t stop there! Keep reading afterwards for my detailed thoughts on this unique electric commuter bike.The Aventon Soltera isn’t some high-powered e-bike designed for thrill rides. Instead, it’s got modest specs for modest riders. This is very much a commuter bike intended for urban riding, and it feels fitting for both avid cyclists and occasional riders who want an easygoing electric bike.The two different sizes of upright diamond frame with a rigid fork will feel familiar to any old-school cyclist (though a step-through frame is also available), and the cadence sensor-based pedal assist will turn the rider’s pedaling into either light or heavy assistance depending on the power level selected. Or the left-side thumb throttle can be employed for a surprisingly peppy assist without any pedaling needed.I call it “surprisingly peppy” because the motor is only a 350W unit, meaning it packs about half the power of the US legal limit. But since that’s the motor’s continuous wattage rating, the peak power is likely closer to 500 watts. I tested the single-speed version since it is nice and flat in Florida, but the 7-speed model only adds less than a kilogram (two pounds) to the bike’s 18.6 kg (41 lb) weight. Either way, it’s a nice, lightweight e-bike.There’s no suspension and the 700c x 35c tires aren’t terribly wide, but that’s par for the course if you’re used to road bikes. On smooth paths, it rides like a dream. On cobblestones, it would probably feel a heck of a lot bumpier. I took it over a few wooden bridges and while the ride was slightly bumpier, it still felt just fine and comfortable.The bike is solidly put together and gives a nice rugged feeling, almost like a gravel bike, so I have no doubt it can handle the pot holes that most of us have hiding around our cities. The bigger question is whether your teeth can.For an efficient and nimble ride, the lack of suspension and narrow-ish tires feel fine to me. What I do wish they had changed is the presta valve tubes that come with the bike. The e-bike community is very accepting (especially compared to the non-electrically assisted cycling community), so it’s not like we call out presta valves as being immediate cycling snobbery. But most basic bike pumps owned by us mere mortals come with a Schraeder valve head. If you need a top up on the road and swing by a gas station, there’s no way they have a presta valve pump on their machines – only Schraeders. It’s easy enough to swap the tube for one with a Schraeder valve (though the hole in the rim sometimes needs a slight widening with a drill bit), but why even make me do that?The Aventon Soltera tops out at 32 km/h (20 mph), and so it’s a Class 2 e-bike in the US (or it qualifies as a Class 1 e-bike if you remove the throttle). You can pedal up past 20 mph, but you’ll be on your own after the electric assist comes out.The bikes’ 36V and 10Ah battery isn’t overly large at just 360 Wh. That’s a bit below average compared to many electric bikes on the market today, but its saving grace is how nicely it integrates into the frame. Similarly-spec’d e-bikes like the RadMission give you more battery at 500 Wh, but they also bolt that big battery right on top of the frame. With the Aventon Soltera, you get it nicely integrated for a prettier package that also makes it harder for a thief to literally tear off of the bike. One more thing I love about Aventon as a company is they always give honest range ratings with real- world testing data. They tell you right off the bat that the range on pedal assist is anywhere from 35 km (22 miles) on the highest power setting all the way up to 101 km (63 miles) on the lowest power level settings. And they tell you that throttle-only riding will net you 32 km (20 miles). All of this data comes from flat ground testing with a 75 kg (165 lb. rider). You can likely adjust those numbers up or down depending on your own weight and local terrain. This has always impressed me, because Aventon is one of the only companies I know of that gives you this level of real-world range data across every power option. Good for you, Aventon. The Soltera’s color display is also impressive, plus the fact that it integrates nicely with the company’s smartphone app that allows you to track your rides. Check out the app in action in my video at the start of this article.The rim brakes were striking at first, since I rarely see those anymore on e-bikes. But they work really well. I know that some people see rim brakes and write them off immediately, assuming they’ll suck. But that’s not the case here. It’s all about the quality, and these are good-quality brakes. They even have that fancy de-tensioning system that allows you to quickly open them to remove a wheel without messing with the cable tension at all. I’d take these rim brakes over cheap disc brakes any day of the week. And if you really want disc brakes, just upgrade to the 7-speed model. An extra $100 gets you a 7-speed transmission and disc brakes.Which brings me to the price. The model I tested is priced at $1,199, while the 7-speed with the disc brakes comes in at $1,299. The step-through models are priced the same, though they come in different pastel colors (which seems a little on-the-nose to me). Folks, this price is a freak’in steal. Twelve-hundred bucks for a beautiful, well-made lightweight electric bike with frame-integrated wiring/lighting/battery, a color screen, and from a reputable company that stands behind its products? Sign me up.As much as I’d like to see a bit more battery capacity or some included fenders, there’s not much I can really fault the bike for here. The company took a big swing and connected hard, knocking it out of the park on this one. The Aventon Soltera is one of the best deals in quality, affordable commuter e-bikes right now, full stop.",ebikes
2022/02/01,"The idea of army vehicles usually conjures up images of battle tanks and Black Hawks, but there’s a long history of two-wheelers making the draft as well. But while bicycles and old motorcycles were the bikes of choice for decades, electrification is changing the face of two-wheeled army transports around the world.Electric motorcycles have already been growing in popularity for civilian use over the past decade. What started out as a niche industry dominated by all-electric startups like Zero Motorcycles has turned into a booming field drawing in major manufacturers like Harley-Davidson, Kawasaki, and even Ducati.Electric bicycles have also seen skyrocketing sales as the general public has flocked to the easier-to-ride alternatives to pedal bicycles. E-bikes’ electric assist motors and large batteries help riders travel faster and farther than ever before while serving as a much more environmentally friendly alternative to private cars.The growth of both industries has not escaped the notice of militaries around the world. Armed forces have jumped at the opportunity to test out all sorts of electric bikes and e-motorcycles for tactical use, and it has nothing to do with their green-ness. Instead, it’s all about their advantages over conspicuous gas-powered vehicles.Some of the latest examples of electric motorbikes making the draft have included the UK testing air-dropped Sur Ron electric trail bikes for paratrooper use and Australia running trials of Stealth electric bicycles with its own armed forces.In both cases, the electric two-wheelers were prized for their ability to insert unnoticed and perform quiet patrols or recon duty. Solar charging has even been tested to “refuel” the bikes in the field without having to hump in fuel supply.Electric two-wheelers have also proven popular among the special operations community, including an example where we saw modified Zero FX electric motorcycles mounted to a Black Hawk helicopter. Special operators are often inserted miles from sensitive targets to avoid alerting the enemy with a loud helicopter, but that requires long hikes with heavy equipment to reach the final destination. With the electric motorcycles, soldiers would be able to carry more equipment to the target while arriving faster and less tired. While that was a particularly creative use, most militaries have stuck to the ground while using electric bikes for patrols. That’s exactly how the New Zealand Defence Forces has employed its UBCO electric motorbikes, which feature all-wheel drive and are designed to carry heavy loads across grueling terrain.Even electric bicycles are seeing military duty, though they are usually much more powerful than typical recreational e-bikes designed for the public.Several countries are apparently testing QuietKat’s high-powered electric bicycles, which feature mid-drive motors whose peak power ratings are several times the legal power limit of many countries when unlocked.The powerful electric torque and lack of engine noise aren’t the only major advantages of electric two-wheelers. Militaries are also likely eyeing their lower costs. The US Army reportedly spends around a quarter of a million dollars for a Humvee, while an electric bike like a Sur Ron costs closer to $4,000. The capabilities of the two vehicles certainly aren’t equivalent, but each has advantages that the other can’t match. And as more militaries around the world begin testing and incorporating electric two-wheelers into their own fleets, we just may see the battlefield become a little bit quieter.While we used to see an occasional instance of an electric two-wheeler being trialed for military use, now it seems to be a monthly occurrence.And you know it’s getting popular when most other media find it hard to keep up. I routinely see other generalized outlets trying to cover the phenomenon, but whiffing hard on the electric tech or just confidently misidentifying the models in the photos. That’s how you know this stuff is going mainstream.It makes perfect sense to me that EVs – specifically two-wheeled EVs – are getting drafted. Their tactical advantages are just too great to ignore. They can’t be heard from a mile away, they don’t show up on thermal image sweeps, they can be refueled in the field with a packable solar panel, and they are surprisingly low-cost compared to most military vehicles.Obviously they won’t replace major gas-powered four-wheelers and tracked vehicles, but they serve as a useful arrow in a larger quiver of options.As a huge proponent of e-bikes and a vet myself, it brings me great pleasure to see these two worlds combining. And with the sky now literally being the limit for electric bikes in the military, I’m fascinated to see what major armies and their nearly unlimited budgets will come up with next for electric bikes.

2022/01/26,"It may be a new year, but many trends have stayed the course in the electric bicycle industry. Chief among them is a move we’re seeing where VCs and other investors have been tripping over each other to throw money at electric bike companies.Just today we’ve learned of two more big-name electric bicycle manufacturers touting tens of millions of dollars in investments.The first is Cowboy, a Belgium-based electric bike company that has announced a US $80 million Series C financing round. The round was led by Exor, HCVC, and Siam Capital, with investments from Tiger Global, Index Ventures, Eothen, Isomer Opportunities Fund, Future Positive Capital, and Triple Point Capital.That puts Cowboy at US $120 million in funding so far, and comes after the company unveiled a new higher-torque belt-drive electric bike and then expanded operations across Europe and into the US.San Diego-based electric bike company Juiced Bikes also announced a US $10 million deal with Aima Technology Group, one of the largest electric bike manufacturers in the world.According to Juiced, the partnership will include “growth investment capital, product development and manufacturing support, as well as the globalization of the Juiced Bikes brand in new international markets.”Juiced Bikes has also been busy rolling out new e-bike models, including the upcoming RipRacer fat tire e-bike that was unveiled late last year.That new e-bike also marked the debut of Juiced’s new proprietary battery cases, which feature interesting benefits such as compatibility with a docking station for providing AC power as well as an Apple AirTag tracking device holder for locating a lost battery or e-bike.This new funding is likely to help Juiced continue to develop more e-bike IP, as the company’s founder and CEO Tora Harris explained:Aima is a partner with e-bike experience and resources that are totally unmatched in the U.S. market. They are an ideal fit for Juiced Bikes because they have the resources, scale, and, most importantly, the quality at scale to ramp up our production rapidly, and at the same time improve the product the end customer receives. This partnership brings together the award-winning design capabilities and groundbreaking innovation of Juiced with the industry-leading production capabilities and manufacturing technology of Aima, while providing funding for a new dedicated R&D facility to produce our own proprietary IP on a much larger, global scale.Last year saw huge investments in electric bicycle companies, with several brands landing deals in the tens of millions of dollars.Rad Power Bikes, the largest electric bicycle company in North America, pulled in a record-setting haul of over US $300 million last year.Electric bicycle sales have positively skyrocketed over the last few years, causing many investors to jump on the bandwagon and line the pockets of major e-bike brands. Companies such as Super73 and VanMoof have also touted seven-figure capital raises since the beginning of the pandemic, further demonstrating that investors are seeking out e-bike companies that run the gamut of e-bike styles and markets.",ebikes
2022/01/26,"Electric bicycle sales have been on a skyward trajectory since early in the pandemic, and new numbers show they are selling more units than electric cars and plug-in hybrids combined.Those figures recently released by the Light Electric Vehicle Association trade group help bolster the case for personal electric vehicles as alternatives to larger cars and trucks.According to data released by the LEVA, the US saw nearly 790,000 electric bike imports in 2021. That marks a 70% increase from the 463,000 imports in 2020.Also in 2021, Americans purchased 652,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids, according to BloombergNEF.That data for electric bicycle adoption in the US sits far behind Europe, where e-bike sales have outpaced electric car and hybrid sales for years, and are on pace to outsell all cars (ICE included) in the next few years.Europe and Asia still handily outsell the US when it comes to electric bikes. The LEVA estimates sales of 3 million and 35 million electric bicycles annually in Europe and Asia, respectively.Electric bicycle sales have taken off for a number of reasons.Many commuters have switched to electric bicycles as a way to avoid crowded public transportation and maintain social distancing. In doing so, they’ve discovered other benefits to e-bike commuting such as being able to commute on their own schedule and arriving directly at their destination instead of a local transit hub. Others are combining the two, using lightweight folding e-bikes to extend their range from transit hubs.While traditional pedal bicycles offer some of the same freeing benefits as e-bikes, their sales have not taken off at rates anywhere close to the impressive growth of the e-bike industry. The reduced effort required by electric bicycles has tipped the scales for many commuters who had considered traveling by two wheels but weren’t prepared for the intense effort required by traditional cycling or the inconvenience of arriving at work in need of a shower. Commuting is a major factor in the skyrocketing sales of electric bicycles, but many riders have also taken to electric bicycles for recreation instead of for utility roles. Fat tire electric bicycles have seen rapid growth thanks to their ability to traverse both streets and trails, making them impressive dual-purpose vehicles for riders that enjoy both leisure riding and commuting by e-bike.E-bike prices have actually increased lately due to various factors including supply chain struggles and shipping challenges, but companies have also rushed to launch stripped down models that offer fewer fancy features yet come with lower and more attractive introductory prices.As electric bicycle sales continue to climb, the e-bike industry has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from investors chasing that rapid growth.That funding trend has continued nearly unabated since early in the pandemic.",ebikes
2022/01/24,"Fiido has just quietly launched the brand’s latest electric bicycle, known as the Fiido T1 electric cargo bike. And for anyone paying attention to the electric bike industry, you’ll likely know exactly which e-bike it is based on.There’s a fairly obvious visual connection between the Fiido T1 and the RadRunner from Rad Power Bikes. It’s not so similar to be a blatant ripoff, but there’s some serious homage being paid here (unlike any royalties that are surely not being paid).The step-through utility bike wasn’t invented by Rad Power Bikes, but the Seattle-based company propelled it to fame when it launched the low-cost RadRunner e-bike in 2019.The Fiido T1 takes a very similar design (and color), yet seems to include a number of interesting features and add-ons not found on the original RadRunner.For starters, the T1 uses a similar setup with 20″ wheels sporting fat tires, a non-suspension step-through frame, rear rack integrated into the frame, tall handlebars, and accessory mounts on the headtube.Fiido’s T1 uses a similar 750W motor in the rear and also sports mechanical disc brakes.The layout creates a short, nimble, and easy-to-mount electric bike with plenty of power for cargo or utility jobs, and so far all of these features are common across both models.But that’s where the similarities end, because Fiido differentiated the T1 in a number of ways.First of all, the T1 hits a higher claimed top speed of 50 km/h (31 mph), though that would put it just higher than the legal limit of 45 km/h (28 mph) in the US.To help keep up with pedaling at higher speeds, the T1 includes a 7-speed drivetrain instead of a single-speed setup like the one found on the RadRunner. The 7-speed should offer improved higher and lower range pedaling, though the bike’s three levels of pedal assist don’t match the five levels afforded by the RadRunner.The inclusion of a front suspension fork should improve the off-road comfort as well as smooth out some of the more imperfect roads that riders regularly face. There’s no rear suspension, but Fiido does include a suspension seat post and a suspended saddle.The rear rack is lower on the T1, which might help reduce the center of gravity when hauling heavy items on the rear.The Fiido T1 also comes with a large 48V and 20Ah battery with 960 Wh of capacity. The company claims a maximum range of 150 km (93 miles) on pedal assist, though real-world range is likely to be significantly less under average conditions.Fiido also uses cast wheels, meaning the traditional 36 adjustable bicycle spokes in each wheel are replaced by six cast spokes. That removes the need to perform spoke maintenance and prevents the wheel from becoming out of true over time (wobbling like a pizza dough thrown in the air).Included accessories such as a front basket and fenders that come standard as well as a wooden deck on the rear rack help add a bit more value to the bike and prevent the rider from having to pay extra for accessories.Speaking of paying extra, the Fiido T1 is currently on sale for $1,599, which puts it just $100 higher than the RadRunner’s $1,499 price.Want to make your own call on how similar the two e-bikes are built? Use the comparison slider to take a look at the two models side by side.That extra hundred bucks sound like a good deal for significantly more battery, higher speed, and more included accessories. But at the same time, the Fiido T1 doesn’t come with the same level of support and peace of mind that a giant company like Rad provides, and it’s hard to say if they’ll match Rad’s build quality.I actually have a RadRunner 2 I’m testing for a review right now, and it was dropped off fully assembled in front of my house thanks to the Rad Mobile bike-shop-in-a-van service they offer. Those kinds of features get factored into the price, which consumers often forget about.Even so, Fiido definitely nailed some key feature upgrades here. And I appreciate that if they’re going to copy a well-known e-bike design, they at least added to it instead of making a 1:1 ripoff like we’ve seen other companies do in the past.They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but that’s hardly comforting to the imitatee.

2022/01/23,"San Diego-based Juiced Bikes unveiled and then launched its newest e-bike model, the RipRacer, last November. Now the company’s founder and CEO Tora Harris is taking us on a behind-the-scenes look at how production is moving along in China.The RipRacer was launched as a ‘fun-sized’ e-bike with smaller 20″ fat tires and a similarly smaller frame.Unlike traditionally large fat tire e-bikes, the RipRacer is designed to be more nimble for agile urban riding, while still offering dirt and trail riding opportunities thanks to those fat tires. It was launched in two versions: a Class 2 version of the bike that reaches speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h), and a Class 3 version that pushes the envelope even further with a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).The Class 2 bike uses a 52V 10.4Ah battery rated for 540 Wh to offer a max range of 35 miles (56 km). The higher power Class 3 version has a larger 52V 15.6Ah battery with 780 Wh of capacity that should achieve a max range of closer to 55 miles (88 km) per charge. The bikes were launched for pre-order months ahead of when production was expected to be completed, which has become common practice in the e-bike industry.In a recent video, seen below, Harris walks us through the production line at the company’s factory in China to see how the bikes are produced.The frames can be seen passing through various TIG welding stations, where the main portion of the frame is welded on a jig before the rear triangle is welded onto the assembly.“So far the frames look really good,” explained Harris. “I’m very impressed with the quality of the frame this time.”From there, the finished frames pass through to the heat treatment section of the factory to strengthen the aluminum.Next we jump to an assembly area, where the frames can be seen already painted and being prepped with internal components. Wires and cables for the various electronics can be seen snaked through the frames as assembly workers in the background piece together more components on a moving conveyer belt.Harris explained that the company has begun with production of the Class 3 version of the RipRacer, which is the higher speed and longer range version of the e-bike.“We’ve got our first bikes already coming off the line,” explained Harris before adding with a chuckle, “only 4,000 more to go!”The RipRacer will debut with Juiced’s new battery case design, which comes with a carry handle and custom holder for an Apple AirTag to help locate the battery or bike should either go missing.The batteries will also be able to dock into Juiced’s new charging dock, which should come out later this year. The docking feature will serve double duty as a powerbank, as it will add AC and DC power taps to allow the battery to provide off-grid power for running other devices.That’s a feature we haven’t seen before in the e-bike market, but it could add huge functionality for the large battery packs. While many batteries have a single USB port that can allow them to serve as a powerbank for phone charging and other devices, the added functionality of both AC and DC power opens new doors for using e-bike batteries for off-grid power supply.The RipRacer went on sale back in November of last year, starting at $1,399 for the Class 2 version. The higher power and higher speed Class 3 version is priced at $1,599.Despite the seemingly good progress seen in production, Juiced’s website still lists April as the expected delivery timeline. That likely includes expected shipping delays from China as the country’s month-long spring festival will begin in February, as well as stateside shipping delays caused by long waits for container ships unloading off the coast of California.While we all wait for RipRacers to make their way to North America, let’s hear what you think of the pint-sized e-bikes.

2022/01/21,"The DYU R1 electric bike certainly wins points for a unique design, but how well does it work? That’s exactly what I set out to find out when I began putting some miles on this interesting-looking e-bike a few weeks ago.As a semi-folder with rather low battery capacity, the DYU is very much an urban-oriented electric bike. But when used in its element, it packs in a lot of convenience.The handlebars fold down, though it doesn’t fold in the middle of the frame like a traditional folding e-bike.That means you can still reduce the height of the bike to more easily fit in the backseat of a car or under a desk.But when unfolded, the bike offers all the utility you’d expect of a 20″-wheel electric bike, complete with front suspension and a rear rack. There are even some interesting security features built into the bike.Check it all out in my review video below, then continue on to read all of my thoughts on the DYU R1 e-bike!The DYU R1 lacks a throttle, so this is a pedal assist-only e-bike.Even so, the inclusion of a torque sensor means that the pedal assist actually works really well. It comes on responsively with almost zero lag from when you put pressure on the pedal to when the motor assist kicks in.The single-speed nature of the bike means there’s no gearing to select from, and so I would have liked a slightly larger chainring to get a better top end gear ratio. Even as it stands, the bike still feels comfortable to pedal up to its top speed. That top speed isn’t particularly fast though, as DYU stuck with the European and Asian limits of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). I played around with the display settings but couldn’t easily find a way to unlock more speed from it.As a city bike, as long as you’re sticking to the bike lanes then the speed feels appropriate. The motor is only 250W, so don’t expect to be flying off the line or through the air on any massive jumps. The performance is acceptable, but this isn’t a rocket. You’ll probably get passed by a hipster on a fixie in the bike lane, but at least you’ll be pedaling a lot easier.So if it’s not an e-bike for going fast or far, then what is it? In my opinion, this e-bike is a great little urban runabout. The integrated battery in the seat post is both convenient to remove for charging (plus prevents someone from stealing your seat while your bike is parked outside), and is lockable to the bike if you don’t want to bring the battery inside (and again, prevents someone from stealing your seat). The only issue with the seat post lock was it was occasionally finicky to get the lock and the pin lined up perfectly. In those cases, it took a few seconds of pushing the quick release lever higher or lower until the locking pin found its hole and seated itself.There’s also a nifty little lock down by the rear disc brake that prevents the rear wheel from turning. That means someone can’t ride away on your bike. Sure, they could throw it in a truck (or over their shoulder, as it’s only 20 kg), but that will at least cut down on theft of opportunity from someone walking by and seeing a nice-looking bike.Speaking of nice-looking, there are some cool features included in the design here. The tail lights are built into the rear dropouts, which looks like it belongs on a much classier e-bike. Granted, they didn’t design it as slickly as Harley-Davidson’s Serial 1 e-bikes with dropout-integrated tail lights, but you could also buy five of these DYU R1 e-bikes for the price of a single Serial 1. So there’s a trade-off, of course.Between the good saddle and responsive pedal assist, the e-bike definitely gives a comfortable ride. For a daily use e-bike like the kind that city commuters need, that’s key. This isn’t meant to be a weekend warrior – it’s a daily errand-runner. And so it better be a nice ride. And it is.I’d love to have seen some more battery built into it though. As nice as the ride is, a 180 Wh battery just isn’t going to last that long. 25 km (15 miles) is reasonable with pedal assist (remember there’s no throttle here and so the bike is actually quite efficient), though you could end up getting less if you stick to the most powerful pedal assist level all the time. And so I’d rather see a slightly bigger battery if possible. I just don’t know how possible that can be with a seat post battery like this. It’s a cool design and all, but it sure is limiting on the capacity front.At $999 though, how much more can you ask for? A torque-sensor e-bike with built-in lighting, front suspension, included rack and fenders, convenient seat post battery and other neat security features seems like a deal to me. If you need a faster or more powerful e-bike, then it doesn’t matter how affordable it is; the DYU R1 just won’t be for you.But if you’re simply looking for an affordable, simple e-bike for the city that won’t take up too much room in an apartment, yet provides more features than the cheapest Amazon e-bikes, then DYU might just have what you’re looking for.It’s a bit of an odd design, but the bike works quite well and offers good bang for your buck. That’s what I look for in an e-bike, something that gives me more than I expect at a reasonable price.It won’t compete with the fancy-schmancy e-bikes, but it’s not trying to. It’s just trying to get the job done, and it excels at that.",ebikes
2022/01/20,"Late last year, VanMoof unveiled the VanMoof V as a high-performance electric bicycle that the Dutch brand referred to as a “hyperbike.” Now the company claims to have surpassed 10,000 reservations, despite the bike reaching a top speed that isn’t legal in most countries.When VanMoof rolled out its concept for the VanMoof V last October, it did so partly to challenge existing policies around electric bicycles. In most of Europe, electric bicycles are largely limited to slow speeds of just 25 km/h (15.5 mph).In the US, riders have a bit more leeway with options for 20-28 mph (32-45 km/h), depending on the class of e-bike.But the VanMoof V concept was unveiled with a top speed of 31 mph (50 km/h) thanks to a pair of 500W motors. The company says that the bike will be capable of power and speed limiting to match local regulations in each country. But there remain few places where the e-bike would be street legal in its unlocked power mode.VanMoof cofounder Ties Carlier elaborated at the time of the launch, saying:The VanMoof V is our first hyperbike, an e-bike dedicated to higher speed and longer distance. I believe this new type of high-speed e-bike can fully replace scooters and cars in the city by 2025.We’re calling for policies designed around people, rethinking how public spaces can be used if not occupied by cars. I am getting very excited thinking about what a city could look like in the near future, and we are very proud to be part of the change by building the right tools for the transition.The move follows a trend we’re seeing more of lately: companies pushing for more inclusive electric bicycle registration that allows for higher-performance e-bikes that are more capable of fast and efficient on-road transportation. BMW did something similar with its own high-speed electric bicycle project last year, and more companies are pushing the limits of electric bicycle performance.In VanMoof’s case though, this wasn’t just a design exercise. The company says it will actually deliver the bike this year. They initially opened reservations as an invite-only affair for existing VanMoof bicycle customers.So far, 10,000 have apparently already placed a reservation for the $3,598 electric bicycle. Germany leads the market with a third of the reservations, followed closely by the US and the Netherlands. To be fair, $20 buys you a registration, so it’s not like people are risking their paychecks here. Even so, it shows that there is huge demand for higher-speed electric bicycles like these.As Carlier expanded:Getting such a large number of reservations in such a short period of time shows the incredible public appetite for a true car replacement in our everyday city lives. With traffic levels now back up to pre-pandemic figures this mass turning point can’t come soon enough. We’re so excited at the fresh potential this bike represents. The V will upend the hierarchy of our roads.Now VanMoof says they will be opening up reservations to the general public on February 8.True to VanMoof’s design legacy, the company has been sure to build a bike that isn’t just fast, but also feature-rich. The high-performance VanMoof V will feature full-suspension, large motorcycle-style tires, automatic shifting transmission, and VanMoof’s signature Kick Lock for easy anti-theft locking.Lighting will be built into the frame instead of bolted onto it, in a move that again invokes more of a motorcycle design than traditional electric bicycle construction. In addition to a headlight and tail light, frame lighting appears to run along the side of the top tube.The battery is only expected to be a 700 Wh pack, which would be fairly large by most electric bicycle standards but falls on the smaller end for high-speed electric bikes that consume more energy. Considering that VanMoof is hiding the battery inside the bike’s frame instead of bolting on a larger battery, the 700 Wh is still fairly impressive capacity.The company continues to roll out new features for the VanMoof V.Just today, VanMoof announced a new integrated phone holder that centers a user’s phone over the handlebars more like an electric motorcycle’s display.As the company explained:This will allow riders’ phones to be incorporated as a screen and dashboard and provide an intuitive visual reference for updates from the V’s onboard computer. With hardware and software design ongoing for over a year already, new product details are constantly being refined and developed ahead of the bike’s release – expected by the end of 2022.You can see the design in the short clip below.Take my money!I love the VanMoof V, both for its striking appearance and for what it represents: a new wave of higher-performance electric bicycles.I know this will be controversial, but I think it is an eventuality that we’re all going to need to accept. As more light electric motorcycles enter the market and electric bicycles increase their own performance levels, the line between them continues to blur.And since these are such important transportation solutions that help reduce car use, reduce energy use. and clean up our cities, I think that is a huge benefit for everyone.That being said, there are some serious rider responsibility and safety concerns that need to be addressed. I wrote an op-ed about how I believed we needed a new, higher-power class of electric bicycles in the US, perhaps up to speeds of 45 mph (72 km/h), but that it should also come with a special high-speed electric bicycle driver’s license requirement. With great power comes great responsibility, or something like that.I still believe that standard e-bikes up to 28 mph (45 km/h), which are known as class 3 e-bikes in the US and speed pedelecs in Europe, shouldn’t require a driver’s license. They are an important alternative form of transportation and should have as few hurdles to accessibility as safely possible. But when we start talking about these kinds of speeds on the VanMoof V and others, we are honestly entering moped and light motorcycle territory, and safe riding should be a top concern.So there are some legal issues to work out here. But as technology develops, that’s what happens. And I think we’re moving in the right direction.Now I just can’t wait to see a VanMoof V in the flesh!",ebikes
2022/01/18,"It’s a sign of the times (albeit a strange one) that electric bicycles are quickly expanding beyond mere transportation alternatives into fashion gear. Thanks to interest from many luxury brands, e-bikes are quickly becoming hot fashion items.Beginning well over a decade ago, electric bicycles spent years as niche transportation and recreation vehicles, providing many of the same benefits of traditional bicycles but with less required exertion thanks to an electric motor assisting the pedaling.In the early 2010s, sales in the US were comparatively low, and brands numbered barely in the dozens. But near the end of the decade, e-bike sales were climbing quickly as hundreds of smaller and larger companies competed for the growing market.Then came the COVID19 pandemic, which helped e-bike sales skyrocket even further as riders sought socially distant alternatives to public transportation or fun leisure activities to escape the boredom of lockdowns.Now luxury brands are cashing in on that explosion in popularity by partnering with leading e-bike companies to create exclusively licensed versions of hot-selling electric bicycles.It’s a move that we’ve seen begin as a small spark in the past but has now been kindled into a much larger flame that shows no sign of abating.E-bike companies like Super73 are famous for their brand partnerships, creating all sorts of interesting e-bikes as part of license deals with famous brands.While Super73’s partnerships often see the e-bike company teaming up with pop culture brands like HotWheels or sports teams, a recent partnership with fashion company Saint Laurent demonstrates a shift towards fashion-minded riders.Louis Vuitton has also recently collaborated with the cycling company Maison Tamboite, which also produces electric bicycles.Other partnerships between fashion companies and cycling companies include collaborations between Jacquemus and VanMoof as well as between Stella McCartney and Cannondale.But the partnerships aren’t only limited to electric bicycles. E-mopeds and e-motorcycles are also popular targets for luxury treatment.Feng Chen Wang has partnered with Piaggio on its new Piaggio 1 electric scooter.In that case, the partnership with the stylist expanded even further into an accessory line for the electric scooter as well.Accessories included a dedicated helmet and a collection of unisex streetwear garments. The fashion collection was presented during the 2021 Shanghai Fashion Week and is expected to become available for purchase next month.Another luxury collaboration saw DAB Motors jumping in bed with Burberry to create a unique light electric motorcycle with the fashion brand.In that case, the 10 kW light electric motorcycle got a new colorway, monogrammed upholstery, and other fashion notes.So what explains the shift towards luxury brands partnering with e-bike companies?According to Vogue, there are several reasons.For starters, luxury brands have seen a shift in buying habits of young shoppers, with many demanding more eco-conscious products. And e-bikes scream eco-conscious compared to nearly every other form of transportation.Pandemic pressures have also placed an emphasis on staying local and seeking out more from one’s own neighborhood. In such cases, electric bicycles have become prime urban vehicles for young riders.Vogue also pointed out that bike culture has grown much more female-inclusive. Women have become a much larger part of the two-wheeler customer base, both for electric bicycles and motorcycles. In the motorcycle industry, women have increased their ridership share from 10% to 20% in the last decade.Regardless of the reasons, the trends are quite clear. With more e-bike companies than ever before and a growing number of luxury brand partnerships, this likely isn’t the last time we’ll be seeing fancy, high-dollar e-bikes rolling by.Look, if you had told me a couple years ago that as an e-bike journalist I’d be citing Vogue as a reference, I wouldn’t have believed you.But of course I also probably wouldn’t have believed that we’d all be soon Lysolling our mail, an Empire State Building-sized ship would get stuck sideways in the Suez and that the President of the United States would tell us all to drink bleach. So it’s been a doozy of a few years.All things considered, fancy-pants brands getting in on the e-bike action is one of the less surprising things I’ve seen lately, and it generally makes sense to me. As e-bikes become more common, the more luxury e-bike brands began to set themselves apart. Establishing partnerships with actual luxury brands is a great way to do that.As more celebrities embrace electric bicycles as well, the industry becomes ripe for fashionistas to seek out their piece of the pie. Several weeks ago Britney Spears apparently posted a photo on Instagram of her riding a Super73 e-bike. I know this only because my e-bike newsfeed was then inundated with Britney Spears for days. I couldn’t hide from it even if I wanted to. That’s how strong it was. Imagine how many people had no idea what an e-bike was, then suddenly saw their favorite pop icon riding one. That’s a powerful marketing tool.Personally, I’m not about to be riding around on a Louis Vuitton e-bike, but I get that at least some people are going to be into that. And they are largely going to be coming from the new group of riders that aren’t used to the e-bike market as it existed for the last decade. They’re a type of new rider that is accustomed to buying fancy things with fancy labels, and they’re looking for something familiar in this newfangled world of e-bikes they’ve just discovered.",ebikes
2022/01/17,"The Polarna M4 electric bike may not look fancy, but it hides away a lot more e-bike than you bargain for. This fast and fun off-roader even folds to make it easier than ever to take a full-suspension fat-tire e-bike anywhere.Full-suspension fat-tire e-bikes aren’t rare, they’re just usually quite expensive.We usually see them start well above $2,000 and go up quickly from there.But at a price of just $1,399, the Polarna M4 brings that full-suspension fatty goodness to the masses at a much more affordable price.Whether you need a fold-up fat-tire e-bike to drive to a nearby trail network for your rides, or you want to keep an all-terrain e-bike in your RV for adventures at stops, or really any reason that would have you on the hunt for a less-than-gigantic e-bike, the Polarna M4 seems to fit the bill for high-spirited e-bike tomfoolery.   Take a gander at the e-bike in action in my review video below. Then continue on for the rest of my complete review.The Polarna M4 does exactly what a fat tire e-bike is meant to do: it rides over just about everything.While larger 26″ wheels are the kings of all-terrain riding, the 20″ tires here still do nearly as good off-road, especially when you keep the pressure down in the 10-12 PSI range. Depending on how soft the ground is, you can even go lower.When you’re back on the road (and using a bit higher tire pressure), the Polarna M4’s 750W continuous-rated motor uses every watt at its disposal to take you up to nearly 30 mph. The company claims that it reaches 32 mph, but after de-limiting the bike via the display I was mostly hitting 28 or occasionally 29 while riding on flat ground, with occasional spurts into 30 mph territory. Perhaps they had the help of a tailwind when they quoted it.The color LCD screen is easy to read both during the day and at night, and it actually looks quite good. I’m so used to monochrome screens that color displays often still catch me off guard. It’s definitely a sharp-looking screen.The headlight though, goes the other way. As nice and bright as the screen is, the headlight is a bit lackluster. It works, but it doesn’t really light your way that well. It’s a be-seen light and is pretty much only meant to let cars know that you’re there. That’s fine on an e-bike, but for something like this that is meant to travel off-road as well, a brighter light could have been nice.The real prize here is the suspension. Not that it’s particularly good quality (I’d call it just decent), but it definitely helps add to the ride. Without it, I would have been riding much slower on trails. But thanks to the suspension, I was able to increase my speed without breaking my wrists or shaking my teeth out.Again, it’s not going to win any awards in the quality department, but the perceptible front and rear suspension make a world of difference on rutted out or washboard terrain and helps smooth out broken asphalt or brick pavers as well.When it comes to braking, I was actually surprised to see hydraulic disc brakes included on the Polarna M4. Keep in mind, we’re talking about a $1,399 e-bike here, and hydraulic brakes usually aren’t part of the deal at this price point. But somehow they managed to give us full-suspension AND hydraulic brakes, so that’s a win. I would have liked some larger rotors than the basic 160 mm discs that we got, but I won’t gripe too much there. Plus I’m loving those cast wheels they’re mounted to, so they managed to distract me with pretty spinning things. And cast wheels aren’t just attractive looking, they remove one more maintenance issue: spokes. You’ll never worry about a spoke loosening up again!Also included are a big utility rack and a set of fenders. Both of those improve day-to-day usage of the bike by adding extra utility.They don’t do the weight any favors, and the Polarna M4 is a heavy bike at nearly 70 lb. But as long as you can lift it, those commuter-style accessories like racks and fenders are a big help.Lifting the bike is probably going to be important though, since this is of course a folder. And that’s kind of the point – it folds up small to fit in a vehicle.Instead of needing a bike rack on the back of your car, you could put the folded bike in a large trunk (assuming you can lift it).The folding mechanisms are basic and commonplace, nothing fancy there. It folds at the handlebars and in the middle of the frame. That’s how 95% of folding e-bikes work and it’s just fine. It’s not space-age, but it works well. And it’s nice and sturdy, which is exactly what you want on a bike that you’ll be bouncing over berms all day.The only downside to the folding aspect is that you are limited on battery capacity. The 615 Wh battery is acceptable, but not huge. I’d say that’s only slightly below average for e-bike battery capacity today. The company claims you’ll get 45 miles of range, which is laughably optimistic. I was getting closer to 20-25 miles on throttle-only riding. Granted, I was riding pretty much full-out, but still. Don’t expect to get close to 45 miles unless you’re slowing down and adding some good pedal power.Despite using throttle most of the time, I’d say the pedal assist is still quite comfortable. The eight-speed transmission is a welcome upgrade over the many single-speed moped-style fat tire e-bikes out there, so that’s another win. It also allows you to pedal fairly comfortably up to the bike’s top speed, which can’t be said for all e-bikes.Even so, I definitely made liberal use of the throttle because it’s just so much fun to gun it on loose terrain like grass or dirt, treating the M4 like my own little folding dirt bike.It’s not as powerful or rugged as a dirt bike, and the suspension of course can’t match, but I think it’s well specced for recreational use. As a fun, fast, and powerful folding fat tire e-bike, it fits the bill nicely. And there just aren’t that many folding fat tire e-bikes out there that offer full suspension. At this price, I’d say the bike gets two thumbs up from me, except that I’ve got one thumb nearly perpetually mashed down on that throttle!",ebikes
2022/01/12,"Electric mobility company Lime is rolling out a new 4th-gen electric bike, and it’s got a whole host of interesting updates to make the bikes more convenient than ever before.Compared to the previous electric bikes Lime received from Jump when it swallowed that company up, it wouldn’t take too much innovation to push the old e-bikes into the future.The previously low-powered motors got a power boost, which should help with both hill climbing and acceleration. The new motors are also supplied by a brand new battery. Or brand new to the e-bikes, at least.If the battery looks familiar, that’s because you’ve probably seen it on Lime’s electric scooters.The same battery is now used across both vehicles to better streamline operations and allow fleet-wide battery sharing.The new Lime e-bikes are also equipped with an automatic two-speed transmission to help users maintain the most efficient ride possible without complicating the bike’s controls.A new phone holder also makes it easier for riders to check map directions on their phone while keeping both hands on the bars. And the bike’s display also got an update, making it similar to the display on Lime’s scooters and further standardizing parts across the fleet.The new Gen4 e-bikes are rolling out this week in Washington DC, followed by Atlanta, Charleston, and several other cities this spring.As Lime CEO Wayne Ting elaborated:“The launch of our Gen4 e-bike is an important step toward achieving our mission of building a future where transportation is shared, affordable, and carbon-free. Standardizing our swappable batteries across modes is a leap forward for Lime and the broader micromobility industry, making operations more efficient and sustainable, while improving reliability for riders. In 2021, we saw massive jumps in Lime e-bike use in cities, helping to fuel a welcome e-bike boom globally. We’re excited for city residents around the world to try the Gen4 as a great way to leave the car behind.”Lime also announced that it was investing $50 million into the new electric bicycles in an effort to expand the rollout and offer electric bicycles in more cities.It’s all part of a larger push by Lime to further expand its services, including with its standing electric scooters and electric mopeds.The comapny’s electric mopeds, which are based on NIU’s sharing model, have expanded Lime’s higher power offerings, while its electric standing scooters continue to serve as the foundation of Lime’s lighter electric vehicle sharing program.The company says it has now powered over 250 million rides across its various vehicles in over 200 cities around the world.",ebikes
2022/01/11,"After bringing in €3.2 million in funding and raking in a list of pre-orders, Podbike says it will deliver its first electric bike-car known as the Frikar later this year.The Norwegian mobility company Podbike has attracted attention for years as its innovative and curious-looking four-wheeled electric vehicle has taken shape.The enclosed bike-car offers better all-weather protection and improved aerodynamics compared to a typical commuter electric bicycle, though the top can be removed for summer operation if all-weather protection isn’t required.Over 3,400 people have lined up to reserve the first model produced by the company, which can be pre-ordered with a €300 deposit toward the €6,429 starting price (approximately US $7,300).The Frikar is a single seater, though an optional child seat will reportedly be available, taking the place of the vehicle’s 160L (5.7 cubic feet) of cargo space.Now the company expects to begin deliveries in 2022, starting with its local customers:“The first deliveries will be in Norway as it is close to our R&D department. It is simply the smartest and easiest way to launch a new product. As we have a lot of German customers, Germany is also very high on our delivery list. As soon as we have more details to share, we will update you through podbike.com and newsletter.”In Europe, the Frikar is technically classified as an electric bicycle, meaning riders can use bicycle lanes to cut a quick path through city traffic.The Frikar has functional pedals like a bicycle, though they aren’t connected to a chain or belt like a typical e-bike. Instead, they power a generator and run a drive-by-wire system that connects to a pair of hub motors in the rear wheels. We’ve seen drive-by-wire systems for e-bikes before, but they are still quite rare in the industry.In fact, we’ve seen enclosed electric bike-cars before too. But again, not quite like the Frikar.The Frikar’s speed is technically limited to 25 km/h (15.5 mph) due to restrictive European electric bicycle regulations. But the company seems to have found a sneaky way around that. As they explain:We use three motors/generators, two that act as electronic transmission and one that acts as assist motor/electronic brake. The power to the assist motor is limited to 250 W continuous output and 25 KPH speed limit, while the other motor output matches the pedal generator input thus acting as the human powered transmission. This motor works beyond 25 KPH. However, when you use the electronic brake that can be triggered manually, for example by pedaling backwards while going forward, or automatic, when reaching max downhill speed, both wheel motors brake the vehicle.The assistance to speed from the battery is limited to 25 KPH. However, the pedal generator is not. So by continuing to pedal and thus supplying manmade pedal energy, speed may increase beyond assist speed depending on various factors like inclination, generator output, efficiency and rolling resistance. However, the max speed will be limited to 60 KPH for safety reasons. We store pedaling energy and braking energy using electric batteries. We do not use mechanical flywheel (s).So it sounds like one motor is limited to the draconian 25 km/h limit, while the other is permitted to go faster as it is more or less interpreting how fast your pedaling power would make the vehicle go if the pedals had been connected to the wheels by a mechanical drivetrain.That sounds like a bit of a legal gray area, but I’m also not a Norwegian traffic cop, so what do I know?The 877 Wh battery has a rated range of 50-80 km (30-50 miles), and a second battery can be added for extra range. The batteries can be charged either on the vehicle or removed for remote charging.The base version of the Frikar will include standard features like adjustable seat and pedals, light package including turn signals, and a single mirror. For an extra €650 (US $740), riders can upgrade to the Plus version of the Frikar. The upgraded version includes interior upholstery, air fan, two mirrors, side pockets, interior lighting, and an alarm.The company hasn’t listed a firm date for the 2022 deliveries yet, but we’ll be sure to update once we know more.Until then, let’s hear your thoughts on the Podbike Frikar in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/01/11,"Last month, San Diego-based electric bicycle company Ride1Up unveiled its Cafe Cruiser electric bicycle. While many new electric bicycle models these days feature similar mashups of common features, the new Class 3 e-bike offered a retro-inspired design and seating for two passengers in a form factor we rarely see. It also marked a stark departure for the commuter-oriented electric bicycle company that designed it.And the bike’s inclusion of parts, like a large 720 Wh hidden battery, hydraulic disc brakes, 80 mm hydraulic front suspension, and frame-integrated rack, made the $1,595 price even more impressive.We don’t have one to test quite yet, as the bikes aren’t expected to ship until next month. But in the meantime, I caught up with Ride1Up’s founder and CEO Kevin Dugger to learn more about what went into creating a novel design for the electric bike. The Cafe Cruiser’s fresh look is a welcome change for the industry. Many new e-bikes borrow heavily from established designs. And while the Cafe Cruiser isn’t entirely blameless (that top tank design looks very Electra-ish if you ask me), the bike is largely innovative in both form and function.When I asked Kevin what led to the design, he explained that one need look no farther than the name.“It’s all in the name: ‘Cafe Cruiser’. We tried to combine the two stylistic identities of a cafe racer-inspired bike and a beach cruiser. We didn’t want a standard short distance beach cruiser, but a more practical and functional beach cruiser, yet without losing the comfort that a beach cruiser offers. The end result is a beach cruiser that you can actually pedal for 40 miles and feel comfortable on at class 3 speeds.”While many other companies have focused on electric mopeds or lifestyle e-bikes, Ride1Up’s lineup is full of no nonsense e-bikes that are fast, efficient, and fully-specced for trips to work, school, or the local coffee shop. A beach cruiser-style electric bike is definitely new territory for Ride1Up. We’ve seen other companies produce beautiful beach cruisers, but Ride1Up has mostly stuck to what it knows: urban e-bikes. Of course that made me curious about what led the company to branch out from its core of road and commuter-focused electric bikes.According to Kevin, the company’s singular focus turned out to be the main reason that he decided to develop the Cafe Cruiser.“A lot of our lineup had design and functional redundancies. The 500 Series and 700 Series were very similar in the type of riding and use. Not all commutes or car replacing trips meet the same criteria, and living in a beach town myself, there are many trips where you just want a casual comfortable ride. Additionally, we really wanted a +1, passenger capable bike. Most passenger bikes are kind of bulky/ugly, so I think the cruiser design could lend itself well to a passenger bike. So that’s what we set out to design.”That passenger design is a rarity on full-size electric bikes like the Cafe Cruiser. While there are plenty of e-bikes designed to carry a second rider, most achieve that goal by dropping the wheel size.The Cafe Cruiser maintains large 26″ wheels and rides on wide 3″ balloon tires, which should offer a cushy ride when combined with that hydraulic front fork. How well will that work with a rider’s weight high up? We’ll have to determine that once we can test the bike.But as Kevin explained, offering a full-size e-bike with passenger capabilities was largely a logistics problem that had to be solved.“I think the difficulty of a full size bike that is also passenger capable is the overall size and weight of the bike and box for delivery. This will be our largest box by a significant amount which adds a bit to shipping expenses, but we were able to keep the overall bike weight and size down, much lower than the current RadRover or the Aventon Adventure. Both of those bikes will be significantly heavier, priced $400 more, not offering passenger capabilities, and offering cheaper components.We had the choice, just like other e-bike companies do, of whether to accept lower tier components (unbranded gearsets, etc.) and non-brand Chinese battery cells at lower costs, but we didn’t want to sacrifice our product. So we shifted our battery to 21700 cells where we are able to get the best performance per gram, avoid 18650 shortages and peak prices, and offer premium reputable Samsung cells. This bike will have only 39 cells and offer 720 watt-hours! This is a huge weight to battery size advantage for us.”And even though the Cafe Cruiser looks set for recreational and leisure riding, it is also designed with utility in mind.If not carrying passengers by using the passenger kit, the rear rack is still sturdy enough for cargo duty and can support up to 130 lb (59 kg).According to Kevin, that was all by design.“We don’t want to develop simply recreational bikes, but highly functional bikes. A lot of people here in San Diego were buying passenger capable bikes, whether that’s to take their kids to the beach, or take a date around town. They are demanding more from an e-bike, and honestly, e-bikes are perfectly positioned to support 2-passenger capabilities. I hope we see more unique, functional and stylish entrants in this field.”Lastly, I wanted to know if this new path towards utility and leisure e-bikes was a direction that we’d see Ride1Up expand into further.Could we be seeing more category-breaking designs from the company? A Ride1Up fat tire e-bike? Or perhaps a Ride1Up folding e-bike? Maybe a Ride1Up electric mountain bike?Kevin advised me not to let my imagination run too wild, at least not yet.“Well, our Prodigy e-bike is expanding our reach into the ‘mostly all-terrain’ market. We don’t want to become or compete with MTB companies by any means, but we have a lot more value and room to expand there. We’re a little ways out from offering a ‘compact bike’ or a true ‘cargo’ designed bike. I don’t think we will ever get involved in the fat-tire space. Personally, I think the fat tire shelf life will not be as long and currently there are way too many options if that is a must have for you. It adds too much weight for little return in my opinion.”Kevin and I will have to agree to disagree on that one. I love fat tire e-bikes and their ability to ride over just about any surface. He’s right that the weight disadvantage can be palpable, but for those that don’t need to lift an e-bike onto a car transporter or up stairs, the benefits outweigh the downsides – at least in my opinion.But that’s the beauty of the huge breadth we see in the electric bicycle market. There are so many manufacturers with so many designs that riders are all but guaranteed to find something perfect for them.With companies like Ride1Up beginning to expand into even more product categories, high value e-bikes are becoming even more attractive.And to all the fat tire e-bike manufacturers out there, it sounds like you can rest easy. Kevin isn’t coming for you anytime soon.",ebikes
2022/01/10,"I absolutely love moped-style electric bikes. They are just so much fun to ride! The format gives you that fun-loving motorcycle cruising feeling, yet keeps you legal as a bicycle without all the hassle of motor vehicle ownership. And rarely have I seen a moped-style electric bike capture the motorbike essence quite as well as the Biktrix Moto. This is one seriously exciting bike to ride, combining the convenience of the bicycle world with the cruising attitude of the motorbike industry.The Biktrix Moto also solves one of the biggest issues with electric mopeds: fitment. Moped e-bikes are usually a one-size-fits-all affair, which is a situation that rarely holds true.But the Biktrix Moto comes in either a medium (with 20″ wheels) or a large (with 24″ wheels).I’m 5’7″ (170 cm) so I jumped on the medium, but taller riders will likely appreciate the larger-size option.To get a better idea of how much fun this e-bike is, check out my review video below. Then read on for all the nitty-gritty details!The geometry of the Biktrix Moto puts you in more of a roadster seating position. You’re laid back with your feet forward and your tush rearward. The handlebars are also so high that they are practically ape hangers, though there’s an adjustable stem to drop them a bit if you wish.Me? I loved how high they were and it made for an awesome cruising feeling. It’s like a little motorcycle that carries all the legal advantages of an electric bicycle, namely no registration or insurance concerns.The bike’s 750W Bafang hub motor is a name-brand piece of kit that offers plenty of acceleration. Throttle control takes you up to a solid 25 mph (40 km/h). There’s also pedal assist, but to be honest I didn’t use it much. The bike is a single-speed and so pedaling is only really useful on the lower end. The 42T chainring is fairly small and the 22T sprocket on the rear is fairly big. That means you’re geared low, which is not great for high-speed cruising. If you’re riding slower, pedaling works fine. But I wasn’t riding slowly very often.Then again, this isn’t really a bike that’s meant to be pedaled, and I think we can all see that. The Biktrix Moto is a moped with an emphasis on the “mo” part. If your battery ever ran out of juice, you could pedal it home. But for all intents and purposes, you’re going to be using the throttle for everyday riding on this one.Oh, and your battery probably isn’t going to run out of juice very often. It’s huge. The 48V 21Ah battery has 1,008 Wh of capacity. That’s practically a record in terms of maximum capacity in a retail e-bike.But it doesn’t stop there. You can add a second battery (it slides in under the seat and looks pretty decently hidden) for a total of 2,016 Wh. That’s an insane amount of battery capacity but is a welcome sight on a heavy e-bike like this that isn’t meant to be pedaled much.Biktrix tells you that each battery gets 50 miles of range, though that’s likely measured at lower speeds. Realistically, you’re looking at somewhere around 30-35 miles of real-world range for anyone who is going to push this thing the way it deserves, or double that much if you get the second battery. That’s still some serious range for a moped. There are other e-bikes out there that go farther, but they’re lightweight models with effective pedal assist. The Biktrix Moto is basically a motorcycle with working pedals.And if it’s going to fulfill a motorcycle role, or at least a moped role, it better have the rest of the parts to match. Which it does.That bench seat is comfortable. The giant headlight looks awesome. And at 1,500 lumens, it actually functions well too – it’s not just for show like some big moped headlights.The suspension fork actually works well for such a heavy bike (just shy of 90 lb or 41 kg), and the dual piston hydraulic brakes with big ol’ 203mm rotors bring this rolling steed to a stop quickly.You even get included fenders and a nice, beefy utility rack on the rear. I’m not quite sure how much loose cargo you can strap on that rack since it doesn’t extend very far back, but adding a motorcycle-style cargo box would be a snap.At a price of $2,299, the Biktrix Moto isn’t cheap, but it also offers good value. Many good moped-style e-bikes start at higher prices and don’t offer batteries that are this large. Then consider that you already get your bright motor vehicle-level lights thrown in along with good fenders and a rear rack, and you’re set to start riding right out of the box. There’s no required gear that you have to spend extra cash on.So I think Biktrix did a great job with the Moto. The fact that it comes in multiple sizes and even a handful of colors is just the cherry on top. I think the blue really pops, but the orange color is probably my second favorite. With a bike like this, standing out is half of the point.Enough of my thoughts though – I want to hear what you think of the Biktrix Moto. Sound off in the comments section below!",ebikes
2022/01/07,"After beginning sales in the US and recently opening up sales in Europe, Harley-Davidson’s electric bicycle brand Serial 1 has now expanded into Canada, where its e-bikes will be available exclusively at 15 of Canada’s Harley-Davidson dealerships.Those dealerships, located in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, will offer test rides just like US Harley-Davidson dealerships.The current list of 15 participating Harley-Davidson dealerships is as follows:The three Serial 1 e-bike models will be priced at:Those figures are approximately 5% higher than US pricing when accounting for current exchange rates. That represents a slight premium for the exported bikes in Canada (though also likely helps achieve those pretty numbers that end in 99).Vice president of sales at Serial 1 Brandon Proctor commented on the company’s expansion northward:“Canada continues to show its enthusiasm for electric transportation and recreation, which we’ve seen in both government legislation as well as favorable tax treatment to the category. We’ve found a strong partner in the Harley-Davidson Canada dealers to introduce Serial 1 to the Canadian provinces and we are eager to become the brand of choice for discerning customers shopping for a premium e-bike.”In the US, Serial 1 e-bikes are available both at dealerships and online at the company’s website.The e-bikes offer premium components such as Gates carbon belt drives, Brose’s high-end mid-drive motors, custom batteries developed using the same battery technology from Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire electric motorcycle, integrated LED lighting built into the frame, and enclosed glove boxes, among other features unique to Serial 1.We’ve had several opportunities to test the e-bikes in person and have always come away impressed with the ride quality and innovation. The bikes are certainly more expensive than the usual suspects in the US and Canada, but Serial 1 generally benchmarks itself against higher-end electric bicycle companies like Trek and Specialized.Harley-Davidson’s expansion into electric bicycles foreshadowed its own electric motorcycle trajectory.The e-bikes were developed internally and were originally intended to be launched under H-D’s own nameplate. But after the COVID-19 pandemic forced many companies to rethink their playbooks, Harley ultimately spun off a new startup known as Serial 1 to focus exclusively on the e-bike project.Nearly a year later, Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire electric motorcycle became the first model offered by a second spinoff. LiveWire became a new brand owned by H-D, but that was pared off exclusively for the development of H-D’s electric motorcycle program. H-D announced late last year that it was taking LiveWire public, and the brand is now developing a new platform known as Arrow that will ultimately lead to several new electric motorcycle models. The first model build on the Arrow platform is expected to debut by the end of this year.",ebikes
2022/01/06,"The electric mobility company NIU has several interesting electric motorcycles and scooters headed to the US and Europe this year, yet the company’s new BQi electric bicycle has drawn just as much attention recently. And now we’re finally getting pricing and tech specs as NIU displays the new e-bike models at CES 2022.The BQi showcases a novel frame design, incorporating a step-through geometry that avoids the ubiquitous Dutch bike geometry in favor of a much more modern design.Powered by a 500W continuous and 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear, the bike will reach a top speed in the US of 28 mph (45 km/h).European versions will be more limited thanks to stricter e-bike regulations, forcing the bike to carry just a 250W motor and cut power at 25 km/h (15.5 mph).The US version will have both a throttle and pedal assist, while the European version will only operate on pedal assist.The bike will be app-connected and include similar security features to those already developed for NIU’s electric mopeds and scooters.The novel frame design allows for two lockable and concealed batteries without creating an overly bulky or bulbous frame.NIU had previously stated that a range of up to 60 miles (100 km) would be achievable but hadn’t released any battery capacity information. Now NIU has confirmed that each battery will provide 480 Wh of capacity (48V and 10Ah), making for a total of 960 Wh.The batteries will be constructed with 21700-format cells provided by LG, and the bike will feature a five-hour recharge time.A belt-drive setup makes the e-bike a single-speed, which is either an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your own cycling needs. The belt drive will remove any chain or derailleur maintenance and will likely last much longer than a chain. However, some riders in hilly areas prefer to have multiple gears to obtain a low gear ratio for hill climbing. Or at least that used to be the case. Many riders are now finding that e-bikes make hill climbing possible even on single-speeds, as the motor assist helps make up for the less-than-optimal low-speed pedal cadence.The BQi models on display at NIU’s CES 2022 booth show mechanical disc brakes, but a NIU representative confirmed to Electrek that the production bikes would actually come with hydraulic disc brakes.The 67.5 lb (30.6 kg) e-bikes have a load rating of 360 lb (163 kg), including both passengers and cargo. With a built-in rear rack, cargo carrying should be easy on the BQi.NIU has announced that the BQi will be priced at $1,499 in the US. That price stands to undercut many of the other leading e-bike options for commuter-oriented electric bikes.While this marks the first time that NIU has shown off the BQi in North America, we were able to get an early look at the e-bike at the Milan Motorcycle Show late last year. NIU used the opportunity to show off several new models such as the 60 mph (100 km/h) MQi GT EVO electric scooter and the upcoming RQi electric motorcycle. You can see them all and more in our video below.The NIU BQi’s novel design, combined with NIU’s impressive manufacturing capabilities and an attractive price point, could help NIU shakeup the e-bike industry in the US and Europe. The company recently announced its 2021 sales figures, which showed that NIU sold over 1 million electric two-wheelers around the world last year. That kind of manufacturing might can’t be ignored.While NIU’s major expertise began in electric mopeds and seated scooters, the company has now expanded into electric kickscooters as well. These standing electric scooters incorporate much of the technology developed by NIU, but in a smaller and more portable package. The lighter devices are easier on the wallet too, with NIU’s latest edition of the KQi1 electric scooter priced at a mere $349.While we’re checking out videos, you can see my review of NIU’s first electric kickscooter below.",ebikes
2022/01/05,"Electric mobility-giant OKAI has taken to CES 2022 to unveil its latest electric two-wheeler, the OKAI EB20.Following the company’s launch of a high performance electric scooter comes this new announcement from the company, revealing a slick-looking electric mountain bike.The EB20 features a carbon fiber full-suspension frame and uses an array of high-end components.The suspension is a four-link design that OKAI says is “fully compatible with a broad range of professional MTB components.”It’s a move towards a more premium-level product than we’ve seen from the company in the past.And that’s all part of the plan, explains OKAI’s founder Jiangto Lu:“At CES this year we are delighted to demo landmark next generation products tailored specifically for today’s modern mobile professionals. These products offer a unique experience that marries security and safety, with professional grade components, and innovation where it really matters.”The company claims the bike’s mid-drive motor is a 750W unit with a peak output of 950W. But a closer look reveals it to be the Bafang Ultra motor, which is one of the most powerful mid-drive motors available in the e-bike market. OKAI may be software-limiting the motor to a maximum of 950W, but it is known to surpass 1,800W on many e-bikes.The motor includes a torque sensor, which is a more refined and higher quality method of providing pedal assist on electric bikes. Instead of measuring how fast a rider is pedaling, which is how cheaper systems work, a torque sensor measures how hard a rider is pedaling and provides appropriate motor assistance to compliment the rider’s effort.OKAI also mentions that the motor can be swapped for 250W or 500W versions, presumably to match regulations in various countries that restrict e-bike power.The bike is powered by a 48V and 14.7Ah battery using Samsung cells. That provides 700 Wh of capacity, making it one of the larger batteries available in the electric mountain bike market.OKAI claims that it should provide a range of around 43 miles (70 km) per charge.When the battery is depleted, it can be removed from the bike to allow for remote charging or charged directly on the bike.Braking is accomplished with a pair of Tektro hydraulic disc brakes, and a Shimano XT deraileur is paired with a thumb shifter for the transmission.The EB20 will also include a 2.5 watt headlight.Rounding out the tech side of the bike, OKAI says that a 2.8″ touchscreen will be incorporated into the headstock. A foldable key and NFC unlocking options will provide riders low-tech and high-tech options for operating the bike.OKAI has yet to announce a price for the new model or its availability. The manufacturer is in the process of bring many new electric two-wheelers to market though, so we expect the EB20 to be among them soon.We had the chance to visit OKAI’s demo booth at Eurobike last fall, which you can see at 8:12 in the video below.",ebikes
2022/01/05,"Today marks the launch of two new electric bicycles from Momentum: the Voya E+1 and Voya E+3.Momentum is Giant Group’s “lifestyle-inspired” cycling brand focused on urban rides, and the two new models unveiled today certainly fit the urban bill.Both bikes focus on city riding and manage to hide away nearly all clues that they pack silent electric assistance.While many higher-end electric bikes incorporate a chunky mid-drive motor near the pedals, the two new Voya models use a pint-sized hub motor in the rear wheel.It’s the size of an internally geared hub and disappears behind the gear cassette. The motor only puts out a modest 250W and 25 Nm of torque, but propels the bike to 32 km/h (20 mph). That classifies it as a Class 1 e-bike in the US, meaning it can be used just about anywhere.The small size of the motor also helps to keep weight down, dropping the bike to a svelte 18 kg (39.7 lb).That was a big part of the design ethos, as Giant Group’s chief branding officer Phoebe Liu explained:Our goal with the Voya E+ series was to create the ultimate lightweight electric commuter bike, so people can make fast work of hills and city riding without breaking a sweat. The slim design, packed with the latest E-bike technology, makes the Voya E+ the perfect bike for people who want a fun, easy way to get around town, whether to work or play.The Voya E+1 takes the form of a drop bar urban bike with an 11-speed Shimano GRX derailleur, while the Voya E+3 has typical flat bars and a 9-speed microSHIFT ADVENT derailleur.    Both bikes include hydraulic disc brakes as well as hidden wiring and an integrated battery to further conceal their electric assist. A single button to control the electrical system is located on the upper surface of the top tube just behind the handlebar stem. The button allows the rider to select the riding mode as well as check the battery’s charge level.Riders that want even more control can mount their smartphone on the handlebars and use Voya’s accompanying app to receive more detailed information such as elevation, cadence, rider power, and functions including a quick maintenance check, adjustable power support, route planning, and navigation. The 250 Wh battery claims to provide a range of between 40-72 km (25-45 miles) on a single charge. A provided 4A fast charger can give the battery an 80% charge in less than two hours. A complete charge from 0-100% takes around 3.5 hours, as charging always slows down when a lithium-ion battery nears its full charge voltage.The battery looks like the style we often see on non-removable stealthy e-bikes, though the company says that a custom bottom bracket mount makes it possible to remove the battery for service.Additional accessories will be available, including all-weather racks and fenders. Both bikes come in three frame sizes and two color options. The Voya E+1 is available in Indigo or Asphalt Green, while the Voya E+3 is available in Yellow or Asphalt Green.The bikes will go on sale from Momentum dealers across North America this spring. The Voya E+1 will be priced at $2,800 while the Voya E+3 will be slightly more affordable at $2,300.These are pretty slick-looking bikes, I have to hand it to them.You’re paying a premium for the design, since this obviously isn’t the best deal in terms of watts per dollar. You can get somewhat-similarly spec’d bikes for half the price, mind you.But if you’re on the hunt for a lightweight commuter that looks like a non-electric bike (and thus might be less of a target to thieves), this could be it. These obviously aren’t for speed demons; they’re low-powered e-bikes for folks that already enjoy cycling but want a less sweat-intensive way to do it.I’d have loved to see some integrated LED lighting, though perhaps that would have spilled the beans on the electric aspect of the bikes.I’m talking to the company about getting a bike to test, so hopefully I’ll be back with some real-world testing experiences before the bikes go on sale this spring.In the meantime, I want to know what you guys think of the new Voya E-series electric bikes.

2022/01/04,"Aventon is highly-regarded in the electric bicycle industry for its quality manufacturing. With the newly launched Aventon Soltera electric bike, the brand is now bringing its expertise to the more affordable end of the spectrum. The lower cost model still features the company’s high quality manufacturing and looks like it may edge out other competitors in the category on features. The Aventon Soltera is primarily a metro-style e-bike designed for city riders. It is available in either a traditional step-over diamond frame or a more accessible lower-step option. Both frame styles offer two sizes to better fit a range of riders. Whereas most e-bikes these days are heavy models loaded down with big motors and batteries, the Soltera is a throw-it-over-your-shoulder-and-skip-up-the-stairs kind of electric bike.The lightweight new model tips the scales at just 41 lb (18.6 kg). While that’s fairly heavy compared to a non-electric hipster fixie, it’s well below the average for most city e-bikes in this class.The minimalist design includes both throttle-enabled electric assist and traditional pedal assist, meaning riders can provide as much or as little of their own effort as they wish.The Soltera is being positioned as a simple, low-maintenance metro e-bike for commuters.As the company explained:The elegant and minimalist design is reminiscent of Aventon’s performance cycling roots, but with an electric charge. The performance-inspired geometric frame allows for a more aggressive riding style with room to still enjoy a relaxing ride. Maneuver your way through the city with the help of the stealthy yet powerful motor, equipped with both a throttle and pedal assist. Or if you’re looking for a bit of a challenge, ride the Soltera using your own force and will.To give riders a choice of drivetrains, the Soltera is available in either a single-speed version (priced at $1,199) or a seven-speed (priced at $1,299).A 350W rear hub motor powers the bike up to a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), keeping the e-bike just within the confines of Class 2 regulations in the US.The Aventon Soltera rolls on 700C wheels and sports either rim brakes on the single-speed or mechanical disc brakes on the seven-speed. LED lighting is integrated into the bike with a bright headlight on the bars and a rear tail light built directly into the rear seat stay tubes (the part of the frame running down from the seat post to the rear wheel). It’s a move we’ve seen Aventon pull before, and it means that there is no bulky tail light hanging off the back of the bike. It’s also provides lighting on either side of the bike when viewed from either rear angle.One way Aventon helped save a couple pounds may be the Soltera’s somewhat smaller battery, rated at just 360Wh (36V 10Ah). The lockable battery is designed to be completely hidden in the frame, yet is also removable for charging off the bike. Thus, the design necessitates a somewhat smaller capacity battery.Aventon has always gone above and beyond with honest, transparent range specifications based on real world riding data, and this time is no different. The company says that the battery should provide 20 miles (32 km) of range on throttle-only riding, and somewhere between 22-63 miles (35-101 km) when using pedal assist, depending on the level of pedal assist selected. Real world range tests for each of the pedal assist levels and throttle-only riding are listed below.Aventon’s feature-rich smartphone app also integrates with the detailed LCD color display.The Aventon Soltera is available in five colors of black, red, blue, yellow or green.Riders can already place an order for the Soltera on Aventon’s website, though not all options are available yet.Electrek will also be getting a bike soon for a full review, so make sure to check back for that as well!There’s some serious value here, and I’m excited to see the budget-level commuter bike space starting to get some higher-end offerings.As much as I love the RadMission electric metro bike that is often used as a benchmark for minimalist city e-bikes, I’m not sure it can compete against some of these features. For the same price as the single-speed Aventon Soltera, you get a sleeker design, 15% lighter bike, a much nicer display, better lighting and app support. However, the 350W motor and 360Wh battery are both smaller than the RadMission’s, and no company can compete with Rad’s vast local servicing options. Perhaps the $899 Ariel Rider Rideal would be a better comparison, though it certainly isn’t as sleekly designed as the Soltera. And neither company has demonstrated manufacturing prowess that comes anywhere close to the beautifully produced Aventon frames with their buttery-smooth welds.As much as I like those tail lights that are built into the frame, I’m a bit worried though that they could be easily blocked by pannier bags. Though the number of riders with rear bags is of course a small percentage, so I guess they could just slap a blinky light on the back of their rack and call it a day (or night).And of course, we have to note that there are no racks or fenders included on the bike as standard equipment, though those can be added. All told, though, I think there’s some serious value here and the bike looks like a winner. If they tossed in a free rack and fenders, that’d be a truly sweet deal. But even as a naked bike, it looks good to me!",ebikes
2022/01/03,"As more e-bikes cram in extra features and components, they also start packing on the pounds. But what if you’re just looking for a lightweight, simple e-bike to get you where you’re going quickly and easily? That’s where Propella comes in. And the Propella Mini may be the best lightweight electric bike yet for urban residents.At just 33 lb (15 kg), the Propella Mini is about as light as you can get for budget-priced electric bikes.We’ve seen lighter e-bikes with carbon fiber frames and other fancy lightweight features, but their several thousand dollar price tags can’t touch the $999 Propella Mini’s value.For anyone that lives in an apartment and has to carry their bike up the stairs or wiggle it into an elevator everyday, a small and lightweight e-bike that doesn’t break the bank is key.And that’s exactly what Propella delivered.Check out my video review below to get an up-close look at the e-bike in action. Then keep on reading for all of the details below!The Propella Mini electric bike takes everything that I loved about Propella’s full-size V4 single-speed e-bike, and somehow wraps it all up in an even smaller, lighter package.The 400W peak-rated Bafang motor is plenty peppy for typical city riding, especially since there’s no throttle on this model. That means your legs are always helping to power the bike.With five levels of pedal assist, you can choose anything from a strong workout ride with very little motor assist to a breezy cruise where your legs provide minimal effort.If you’re one of those people that require a throttle, stop reading now and check out a different e-bike review. But if you enjoy cycling and just want a faster, easier way to get around, the Propella Mini hits the spot.The 250 Wh battery is small and compact, meaning it fits easily in a backpack if you want to take it with you when parking the bike. On the other hand though, the compact size also means it doesn’t have as much capacity as larger e-bikes, but then again it doesn’t need as much capacity since you aren’t using an energy-hungry throttle. Plus the bike rolls on narrow street tires that make the ride extra efficient.I found that with moderate assist, I was achieving ranges of around 35 km (21-ish miles). If you’re already a strong cyclist, you’ll probably use even less assist and get more range than me.The single-speed nature of the bike also helps keep the weight down by shedding unnecessary gears and a clunky derailleur.I’ve discussed before how single-speed electric bikes solve the issue of a “missing low gear” common in single speeds because the motor assist makes those first few pedal turns much less grueling. On particularly steep hills, popping the bike into the highest assist level using the handlebar display buttons helps take the pain out of climbing inclines with a single-speed bike.I was also surprised at how good the pedal cadence felt at the bike’s top speed of 30 km/h (18 mph). Many 20″ wheel e-bikes have uncomfortably fast pedal cadences at the top end, but the 46T front chain ring and 16T freewheel combine with the 20″ wheels to create a comfortable ride even at full speed.The ride also feels so nice and light since there just isn’t that much bike underneath you. The smaller diameter wheels result in a nimble commuter bike that accelerates quickly and handles responsively. The strong Shimano mechanical disc brakes also provide confident stopping power, giving you the feel of a much higher-priced e-bike. There are even nice touches like a hex bolt to secure the seat post instead of a quick release lever. Nearly anyone who rides in the city knows the anguish of coming back to your bike to find its seat missing. I’ve ridden home more than once while standing on the pedals, and so I know that a bolted seat post clamp provides better protection against annoying theft of opportunity compared to a quick release clamp. And yes, I know thieves can carry a 5mm hex key in their pocket, it’s not that hard. But more saddles are stolen when it’s easy to flip open a quick release, so this is an easy (and weight-reducing) step to keep your saddle around longer.I also like how solid the e-bike feels. When an e-bike’s price dips below $1,000, many models start to feel a bit cheaper. But the Propella Mini still feels like a higher quality e-bike. I was repeatedly getting air while hopping off of 6-inch curbs and I couldn’t believe how well the bike handled it. I almost felt like I was on a BMX bike, not a commuter e-bike.Maybe the bike is put together better. Maybe it’s the slightly higher quality parts that make the difference. Maybe it’s the lightweight design. It’s probably some combination of all of those things and more, but it just feels surprisingly solid.While the bike is certainly smaller than a full-size city bike, it doesn’t feel like a clown bike. I’m 5’7″ and the bike fit me like a glove. Propella says riders between 5’2″ and 5’10” fall in the ideal range for the Propella Mini, while riders up 6’1″ are in the marginal range. Really tall riders might want to consider the Propella V4, which has a larger frame and 700C wheels that better accomodate riders on the far right end of the height bell curve.Of course, there will always be trade-offs with bikes that are designed for lightweight or simple operation.As nicely as the bike rides on smooth city streets, the lack of suspension and narrow tires make for a more jarring ride on potholes or brick pavers. Cobblestones probably wouldn’t be a walk in the park either.I’d also love to see some lights and fenders added for more commuter-ready riding, though of course those are parts that can be added afterwards.But the Propella Mini was designed to do one thing: be a small but effective commuter e-bike, and it does that beautifully. And hell, it even looks quite nice to boot!So while there are always things I’d love to see added to any e-bike, the minimalism of the Propella Mini is what gives it its charm and effectiveness. And its low price. At $999, it’s hard to beat something like this for a reliable little commuter e-bike. There will always be faster and more powerful e-bikes out there. But if crazy power isn’t your main goal, the Propella Mini is a great option. It’s powerful enough for normal city riding and absolutely fits the city lifestyle. Just make sure you lock it up with two locks – it’s so pretty that those city thieves are bound to give it a second look.",ebikes
2022/01/02,"NIU’s claim to fame is its wildly popular smart electric scooters, which have taken off in Asia and continue to post strong sales in the European and North American markets. But the company’s tech has also been making its way into a wider range of lighter electric vehicles. Now NIU’s upcoming electric bicycle may be preparing to turn the e-bike industry on its head.NIU electric mopeds aren’t just sleek-looking, they are also packed with high-performance and high-tech features.The company demonstrated that it could successfully pivot that same technology into smaller rideables when last year it rolled out a sporty electric kick scooter known as the NIU KQi3.But one of the most interesting new products headed for US and European shores is NIU’s new BQi electric bicycle.We got our first detailed look at the bike around six weeks ago at the EICMA Milan Motorcycle Show, giving us a taste of what NIU has in mind for this radical new design.Just jump to 6:37 in the video below to see the NIU BQi up close.The appearance of the bike flips the script compared to the e-bike market’s usual suspects to which we’ve grown accustomed.While there are hundreds of e-bike companies each selling several different models, nearly all of these e-bike designs tend to follow predictable lines.The fat tire e-bikes all look like fat tire mountain bikes. The folding e-bikes largely look the same. All the step-through e-bikes look like Dutch bikes. All the electric moped-style bikes basically look like, well, mopeds. There are some exceptions to the rules, as well as some occasionally unique e-bikes that pop up from time to time. But by and large, the e-bike industry follows predictable paths.And fortunately for us, NIU isn’t part of the electric bicycle industry – or at least it has joined the industry as an outsider. With a history of building scooters and motorcycles, NIU came in with a different design approach for both the styling and tech behind an electric bicycle.The NIU BQi adopts a step-through design, hopping on the bandwagon of a recent trend that makes e-bikes more accessible to a wider range of riders. But it does so without falling back on a Dutch bike design or something that looks like a classic “women’s bike”.The U-shaped frame will not only make the bike easier to mount, but it should also make it easier to handle the bike when the rear rack is loaded down with heavy cargo or kids. Stepping through the frame will be much easier than swinging a leg over tall cargo.Another advantage of that unique frame is a unique way to store batteries. Yes, “batteries” as in plural. While the vast majority of all e-bikes use a single removable battery, NIU’s unique frame design makes it easy to fit two batteries. And it does so without looking bulky or disproportioned. The company hasn’t announced the capacity but says the dual batteries should offer up to 62 miles (100 km) of range. I’m guessing that means nothing less than 500 Wh each, which would mean a pair of 48V 10.4Ah batteries. NIU says it will use 21700-format cells, and thus perhaps the capacity will be even higher.On the performance side, the EU version will, unfortunately, be limited to boring 25 km/h (15.5 mph) speeds and a 250W rear motor. But in the US, NIU will swap in a 500W motor and offer speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). The bike will be programmable for either Class 2 or Class 3 regulations, which are the two most popular (and objectively most fun) e-bike classes in the US.A belt drive and hydraulic disc brakes will make the bike easy to maintain, which again takes another page out of NIU’s electric motorbike playbook.But perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of all will be the pricing. NIU said late last year that it is aiming for a sub €1,500 (US $1,705) price, and the company’s massive size means that could be a real possibility. Compared to other entries in the marketplace that offer somewhat reduced performance at higher prices, NIU could stand to gain some serious market share.And that’s before you consider all the additional tech that is likely to be built into the e-bikes. NIU has an advanced smartphone app that is used across its line of vehicles to monitor diagnostics and perform at-home updates. I use it all the time for my daily driver, which is a NIU NQi GT electric scooter. The same app will almost invariably make it into NIU’s upcoming BQi electric bike.What isn’t as clear is NIU’s timeline for releasing the new electric bike.It’s no secret that the electric bicycle industry is coming off of a rollercoaster year with regard to supply chain issues and shipping crises.But with NIU headed to CES 2022 next week and expected to bring its upcoming electric bike with it, we may get lucky with an estimated release date announcement.And if not, then we’ll all just have to keep pestering the company until they give us one.A post shared by NIU Official (@niumobility)",ebikes
2021/12/31,"Electric bicycle manufacturer Super73 has become the latest company to pull out CES 2022. The news calls into question the potential unveiling of an electric motorcycle from the company.Large and small companies alike have been canceling their plans to attend the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show, citing concerns over the rapidly spreading Omicron COVID-19 variant.Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and many other tech companies have all announced that they have pulled out of the show, scheduled to begin in less than a week in Las Vegas, Nevada.Canceled in 2021, the last CES event in 2020 is widely speculated to have been one of the first superspreader events for the new COVID19 virus nearly two years ago.Now, California-based e-bike company Super73 is the latest company to announce that it has pulled out of the trade show.As Super73 CEO LeGrand Crewse explained:“This was an extremely difficult decision. But with the latest COVID-19 outbreak deepening, the safety of our team is paramount.”The company had originally planned to reveal several new models of electric bikes at the trade show.One of the most anticipated unveilings was rumored to be an electric motorcycle, which would be a first for the company.It wouldn’t necessarily be a major leap though, considering Super73’s electric bikes already invoke moped and light motorcycle styling. Many models are high-powered and arguably possess light electric motorcycle performance, despite also having bicycle pedals and fitting into electric bike classifications.Speculation regarding the potential electric motorcycle unveiling began with Super73’s announcement for several new models to be unveiled at the event in Las Vegas.According to a marketing email sent out by Super73, the company announced that it “plans to turn two-wheeled transportation on its head by unveiling a bold new concept, segment-busting new models, as well as new accessories and apparel lines.”The “bold new concept” didn’t come with any extra details, but a Vegas-style neon sign in the shape of a motorcycle provided a fairly obvious hint at what Super73 had up its sleeve.It wouldn’t be the first time an electric bicycle company branched out into electric motorcycles. SONDORS famously unveiled an electric motorcycle known as the Metacycle nearly a year ago, marking that e-bike company’s first foray into full motorcycles.Now with Super73 pulling out of CES, it is unclear how or when the company may unveil its new models and potential electric motorcycle.According to an email sent out by the company:“Exercising an abundance of caution, the team at SUPER73® has chosen to withdraw its staff from the Consumer Electronics Show, which is scheduled to begin on January 5, 2022. With one week remaining before CES opens its doors, SUPER73 was preparing to announce a host of new products in Las Vegas. However, the company will now reveal everything at a later date. In the meantime, SUPER73 fans can visit the CES Digital Activation at the CES website from next week.”This is a tough blow. Every time Super73 has unveiled a new model, it has been quite epic.Even the company’s custom models, like an e-bike recently built for Santa Claus, are always impressive.A company like that branching out into electric motorcycles is surely going to yield something very interesting, especially in an industry that is yearning for more affordable light electric motorcycle options.So few options exist for a market that is seeing incredible demand, meaning market conditions are ripe for new companies to enter with game-changing options.Hopefully Super73 will still be able to roll out these highly-anticipated models soon, showing the world what they’ve been working on behind closed doors.",ebikes
2021/12/31,"Did you just get a new e-bike for the holidays? Or have you already been riding all year but now find yourself met with the cold new reality of winter e-biking? Here are tips from several e-bike manufacturers to get the most out of your e-bike and your winter riding experience.The single most critical component of any e-bike is the battery. And batteries require extra care in cold temperatures.The most important thing to remember is to not leave your battery outside in the cold for long periods of time. One night sitting outside won’t kill your battery, so don’t freak out if you forget it. But it’s not good for its longevity to make a habit out of letting it sit in cold, wet environments It’s also important to note that you should never charge the battery when its temperature is below freezing (32F or 0C).Electric bike company VanMoof explained that a “battery can’t charge below 0C/32F. That’s why it’s even better to store your bike inside at room temperature when temperatures outside hit an extreme low — it’ll charge better and take you further on those winter rides.”Of course if your e-bike has a removable battery, you can just bring the battery inside. If there’s space though, your entire e-bike will appreciate coming in from the cold, harsh winter weather.If you end up riding less in winter (or not at all), you’ll definitely want to store your battery inside. You should avoid storing it with a full charge though, as it’s not as healthy for the battery. Experts still debate the optimal storage voltage for batteries (usually claiming something in the 40-80% charge range), but it is generally accepted that a half charge is a good storage level, and that’s what e-bike manufacturer Juiced Bikes recommends.As Juiced continued:Ideally, you want to keep your charge at about 50% capacity when storing. Now, the battery will self-discharge over time – so if you’re not riding for two months or more, be sure to check the charge every so often and charge back up to 50% when needed.VanMoof also says that it’s important to wipe down your e-bike after riding to remove salty mud or snow. Most e-bikes use rust-resistant components, but there are still many areas that can corrode if left with a salty glaze.Again, you don’t have to go crazy with your routine. But occasionally adding some soap into the mix can help better remove the nasty things that winter likes to stick to your bike. As VanMoof explained, “If you ride every day, give your bike a weekly wipe-down with some water and soap.”Juiced Bikes also recommends starting slow with rides, especially if this is your first winter on an e-bike.As the company explained:“Riding in the winter is NOT like riding during other seasons. When you go out on your first winter ride, it’s essential to start off slow and acknowledge your experience level. Newbies should take a test ride without the motor on at first, just to get a feel for the terrain. No matter what, drive more slowly than you would in the summer and always give yourself more time for braking. You never know when you may hit a patch of black ice!”Ice can be a serious issue for e-bikes. While cars simply spin, e-bikes don’t have the advantage of four-wheel stability. Losing traction on ice usually means going down hard.To avoid that, Juiced Bikes recommends choosing winter tires based on the type of riding you do:“Change your tires to studded models for hard-packed snow and ice or fat knobby tires for softer snow. You may even want to heat-shrink your cable connections and LCD screen for extra protection from rain and snow. “Canadian-based electric bicycle company Biktrix’s founder Roshan Thomas described to Electrek how fat tires are the best option when it comes to riding in loose snow.The increased air volume allows lower pressures, which work better for loose terrain like snow.As he explained:A common 26″x4″, or 26″x4.8″ or 27.5″x4″ fat tire works amazing in the snow because you can run these at very low pressures. I find that 5-20 PSI makes the rubber just float on the snow. For riding conditions where there is underlying ice, it’s best to get these tires studded.Rad Power Bikes described how short days and limited winter visibility mean that bike lighting is more important than ever.As the company explained:In high traffic areas or roadways that require boosted lighting – such as trails absent of lampposts – additional brightness may help you navigate the winter months.While most e-bikes come with LED lighting that runs off the main battery, adding stronger lights can be a good idea.Rad offers more powerful e-bike lights with twice the lumens that can be swapped out for the basic lights that come with each bike.Other companies also offer higher power light upgrades, so it’s worth checking if your e-bike has that option. If not, some powerful mountain bike lights are a good idea.Rad Power Bikes also points out how important it is to dress for the weather:Ever biked in cold temperatures without gloves? Pro tip: don’t. Frostbite is a real condition that can happily be avoided with water-resistant gloves, apparel, and shoes.Your hands are exposed to the air rushing around the handlebars, quickly chilling fingers to the bone. Even good gloves can get chilly after a while. The warmest options are often big and bulky, making it hard to operate the brakes and shifters.Bar mitts are a great alternative option. They mount on the handlebars and protect your hands from the rushing cold air. That means you can get away with wearing normal, lighter gloves like you’d use on a normal day when not riding. Rad offers their own version that has extra wide hand holes to better accomodate the sleeves of your coat.Another area to protect is your neck. An old-fashioned scarf works well, but a tube scarf/neck gaiter or even a balaclava are even better options. Both can better protect the lower half of your face than a typical scarf, and the balaclava can pretty much cover everything. Or you could go full bank robber with a ski mask.If you want to keep riding your e-bike throughout the winter, then more power to you. It’s definitely possible, but you’ll want to make sure you consider these important tips to take care of your e-bike and yourself.Stay safe out there this winter and happy trails!",ebikes
2021/12/30,"Fat tire e-bikes are tons of fun for both on and off-road riding, but their large proportions don’t always look the best. The Gen3 Outcross manages to maintain a sleek-looking frame despite rocking big ol’ 4-inch fat tires.And while we try not to judge a book (or a bike) by its cover, I’ll never say “no” to a nice-looking fat tire e-bike.The Gen3 Outcross is even quite modestly priced in relation to its specs.The reasonably powerful e-bike is currently on sale for a great price of just $1,399 with the coupon code BF300, marked down from its MSRP of $1,699.Make sure to check out my test riding video of the Gen3 Outcross e-bike below. Then keep scrolling for the rest of my thoughts on this fun-loving electric bike.The thing that really makes the Gen3 Outcross stand out is that bright red frame with the nicely integrated battery.The shiny paint really pops, unlike most simple matte e-bikes.But the inclusion of the integrated battery pack results in surprisingly clean lines for a large-format electric bike.I got multiple compliments from strangers about how good the bike looked, which is a quasi-effective method I use for judging the looks of e-bikes I ride. The more people that are saying “Whoa, nice looking bike!” to me at intersections and parks, the more I trust my own subjective opinion.The downside of fully integrated batteries is that they are limited in size. There’s only so much battery you can shove into a bicycle frame before you run out of space.The Gen3 Outcross’s 500Wh battery is a bit below industry averages, especially for inefficient fat tire e-bikes that take a bit more power to get those big tires rolling through loose terrain.These days we’re usually finding batteries in the 650Wh range on fat tire e-bikes, and sometimes much more.The 35 mile (56 km) range rating granted by that battery is of course the pedal assist range, meaning you’re doing at least some of the work yourself. You can select the pedal assist intensity and max it out if you want an easy ride, or you can go throttle-only and ride it like a motorbike.The throttle is integrated into the display on the left side of the bars, which I actually like. One thing you should probably know about me though is that I’m a right side half-twist throttle purist at heart, so left side thumb throttles aren’t my favorite. Half-twist throttles simply offer the best control, especially on off-road or bumpy terrain where the thumb throttle would be bouncing up and down along with the handlebars.But if you’re going to give me a thumb throttle, then I at least like this design where it is incorporated into the display. It takes up less space on the bars by combining two components into one and it looks less busy.We don’t see this combined throttle/display setup often, but I like it.The bike is more powerful than I expected for a 500W motor, though they do point out that it’s a 1,000W peak-rated motor. That likely means a 20A or 22A controller paired with that 48V battery. I wouldn’t call it “wow” power, but it was plenty for all of my recreational riding on flat and rough terrain.The speed limit is capped at 20 mph (32 km/h), which is frustrating for those of us that like to go faster. But it keeps the bike legal as a Class 2 e-bike and also helps that battery last longer by not draining more power than necessary at high speeds. Trust me, 20 mph on off-road trails feels plenty fast!For what it’s worth, I did play through the settings in the display and did not see an easy way to hack the speed limit.The pedal assist is cadence sensor based, which is what you’d expect at this price. That means there’s a telltale lag of about a second from when you apply force to the pedals until the motor kicks in. It’s not a deal breaker, but it’s noticeable.Another thing that surprised me was how small the front chainring is. Pedaling at 20 mph (32 km/h) is a bit higher cadence than I’d like due to the somewhat lower gearing, and so perhaps it’s good that the bike doesn’t go any faster or you’d run out of gears. A few more teeth on the front chain ring would be a nice addition. But again, this is a 20 mph bike and so that’s probably why then went with a smaller chainring.The disc brakes are plenty fine, though they aren’t any brand name. I would have loved to see some basic Tektros there, but with supply chains being what they are, everyone is struggling for parts. The brakes worked well for me, even if the 160 mm rotors were a bit on the small side. I could still easily lock the wheel up and so braking force wasn’t a problem. If you’re doing long downhill sections, the smaller discs will warm up faster. But this is more of a recreational bike anyways. Even if you live in a hilly environment, you’re probably not going to be bombing downhills like a competitive cyclist on a fat tire bike.The one area I do want to ding Gen3 on is the battery-powered tail light mounted on the seat post.They went most of the way there toward good e-bike lighting by including a front headlight that runs off the main pack. But the rear light is AAA battery powered, which is a pet peeve of mine. I don’t want to have to change out little finger batteries when I have a giant freaking battery between my knees that I’m already charging up everyday. It just makes sense to run all your lights off of the main e-bike battery, doesn’t it?Though to be fair, many e-bike companies looking to save a few bucks simply leave off the tail light altogether and avoid the hassle of running wiring up the seat tube, so props to Gen3 for at least giving us something to let cars know we’re in front of them.Even though I’m complaining about the rear light, I’ve got to say that I’m quite happy with the bike as a whole. It’s super fun to ride on trails and even in the bike lane, and it looks darn good too.At a time when so many e-bikes still come with crazy graphics, bolt-on batteries, and a rat’s nest of wiring, the Gen3 Outcross’s attractive styling is a rare sight for sore eyes.The $1,699 MSRP is a bit of an ask, though not unreasonable compared to similarly priced e-bikes that don’t look this good. But the current sale of $1,399 with the code BF300 makes this a truly great deal for an affordable and slick-looking fat tire electric bike.",ebikes
2021/12/29,"Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes announced earlier this month that prices for its electric bicycles models would be increasing. The move is forced by major pricing pressures on the e-bike industry, including rising costs of raw materials like aluminum, a weakening dollar/RMB exchange rate and sky-high shipping costs.Now the company has provided full details on the new higher prices.The move could majorly impact the US e-bike market due to Rad Power Bikes’ size and influence.The company has sold over 350,000 e-bikes and recently raised over $300 million in investment funding for expansion.Rad isn’t just the largest e-bike company in North America – there’s a sizable gap before reaching the next companies in line.So when Rad Power Bikes makes moves on anything from a price shift to a new model launch, it is often seen as a signal in the industry.The company’s most affordable model, the single-speed RadMission, will increase from $999 to $1,199.That e-bike was launched early in the pandemic and represented a record low price for Rad Power Bikes. The RadMission eschewed some of Rad’s fancier features while still offering similar performance and quality to most of Rad’s lineup.The next lowest-priced offering in the lineup, the pair of RadMini e-bikes, will both also see a $200 price increase.The folding RadMini e-bikes, available in either step-over or low-step frames, increase from $1,299 to $1,499.The RadRunner 2 model that was just unveiled earlier this month remains at $1,499, though it already saw a price increase from the RadRunner 1’s former $1,299 price.The commuter-style RadCity and RadCity Step-Thru e-bikes both remain at their $1,599 prices, but the same can’t be said for the newly unveiled RadCity Plus.The RadCity 5 Plus increases from $1,799 to $1,999.That brings the new higher-spec electric bike in line with the $1,999 price of the new RadRover 6 Plus, whose price remains unchanged.The RadRover 6 Plus was unveiled a month before the RadCity 5 Plus, and both e-bikes ushered in a host of new features and higher quality parts, pushing the Rad lineup into more premium territory.The non-plus RadRover, known as the RadRover 5, remains priced at $1,699 though is currently still on sale for $1,599.The RadWagon, a longtail cargo e-bike, is getting a $100 bump to its new price of $1,999.The RadRunner Plus, which is a higher-end version of the RadRunner and serves as a shorter cargo/utility e-bike, also gets a $100 increase to its new price of $1,899.It’s always a sad day to see e-bike prices rising, especially after a rollercoaster few years that have witnessed prices rise and dip then rise again.Rad has always been a moderately priced option that didn’t necessarily offer the best performance out there but came with solid quality and impressive service/support.While the rest of the equation remains unchanged, the higher prices may significantly impact buying decisions, especially when some popular budget e-bike companies haven’t seemed to budge on their own low pricing.However, perhaps this will serve as the impetus for other e-bike brands to follow suit with rising prices, as some already have.And with the potential of an electric bike tax credit on the way for next year (though perhaps with less of a hope thanks to Joe Manchin), other e-bike companies may take this as even more of a signal.",ebikes
2021/12/28,"Earlier this month I had the opportunity to visit the sprawling new production facilities for California-based Electric Bike Company (that’s an advantage to being an early mover in any industry, you get to pick the good names). The company has been building electric cruiser bicycles in Newport Beach since the mid-2010s. And as founder Sean Lupton-Smith proudly explained to me as I toured the factory grounds, they wouldn’t have it any other way.This isn’t my first time visiting Electric Bike Company. Nearly two years ago I toured the previous EBC factory to learn about how e-bikes were being built in the US.Back then, the company was able to fit inside just one facility, though it was obvious it was bursting at the seams and using every cubic foot of space available (frames and wheels were literally hanging from the rafters several layers deep).That was also weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the US and turned many industries on their heads, including e-bikes. Sales of electric bicycles exploded as Americans sought out new forms of socially distant transportation and new ways to enjoy themselves during lockdowns. As the e-bike industry expanded rapidly, so did Electric Bike Company. Newport Beach is known for many things, but manufacturing is not one of them. That meant to find enough space for its sprawling e-bike production requirements, the company had to move into multiple buildings around town. Electric Bike Company’s operations are now spread across a half dozen buildings all within a few minutes of each other – an easy electric bike ride. Most contain e-bike production lines where the specially trained staff assemble e-bikes to order based on customers’ bespoke requests. Some contain specialty areas like wheel building sections, paint shops, and wood shops for producing custom fenders and chain guards, not to mention multiple e-bike showrooms.And that’s a big part of EBC’s advantage: local production means being able to build one-off e-bikes at nearly the same cost as its standard models.EBC’s electric cruiser bikes are available in several variations with step-through and step-over frame styles. Each model has a number of options for both the functional and aesthetic components. All of the options are selectable by customers during the order process, either online or in the company’s nearly 100-strong dealer network.The options for customization cover literally every inch of the bike. There are probably tens of thousands of combinations if you were to do the math.Multiple batteries of varying sizes can be added to several different locations on the bikes, offering up to 200 miles (320 km) of range in the fully-loaded option.Riders can select many of their components like the drivetrain, fenders, and baskets that come pre-installed. Metal trim colors such as the seat post, handlebars, rims, spokes, chainring, and pedal cranks can be selected.Perhaps most spectacularly, the colors of every part of the bike can be customized. Riders can select among dozens of colors for the frame, fork, fenders, chainring, rack, and basket. Even the battery case can be custom painted to match the bike or accent it with a complimentary pairing. Not only are there dozens of interesting, vibrant colors to choose from and even specialty options like metallic paints, but any custom color can be mixed and painted. Want your bike to match the color of your car, dress, or dog? Find the color code and send it in – they’ll make it happen.To achieve that, Electric Bike Company had to build its own paint shop complete with air scrubbers to clean the exhaust air from the factory. “The air leaving the paint shop is actually cleaner than the city air around us,” Sean explained as I toured the facility.I even had the chance to try my hand at painting an e-bike frame. After getting suited up, Alan gave me a crash course. He was preparing a couple of frames getting a bright yellow color known as Tweety, and I had the honor of laying down the paint. I was nervous about ruining them, but I think they turned out nicely. I’m also quite sure that Alan went back after me with several more professionally applied coats of paint. But if anyone out there recently got a Tweety-colored e-bike, there’s a small chance I helped paint it. You can critique my form in the video above.One of the things that amazes me about EBC is how its prices are so competitive with the rest of the industry, despite the local production.While the company’s flagship models start closer to $2,300, the new Model E has an attractive $1,699 price. And that even includes fancy parts like the hydraulic disc brakes, ultra-comfy saddle, and ultra-bright LED lighting. As Sean explained though, keeping manufacturing local actually helps reduce a lot of the costs associated with the production process. While labor is, of course, higher and rent is exorbitant in Southern California, local production means absolute oversight.Other companies have to deal with shipping errors, incorrect assembly, inferior part-swapping from penny-pinching third party factories and other issues that plague the industry. But EBC ensures that everything is built correctly using the right parts, each and every time. All bikes have unique codes that can be traced back to the individual bike builder, allowing the company to trace an issue to the source if it ever arises.EBC’s customer service team also benefits from the on-site production. The custom service teams answer phone calls and online chat requests in the same building where motors and being built into wheels and e-bikes are being assembled from bare frames. If a question comes in that they don’t know the answer to, they simply walk down the hall and ask the experts doing the production.Complete control of production also allows complete control of parts. Many third-party e-bike factories in China will slip in substandard parts or choose from a cheaper version of theoretically interchangeable components. “We ensure that we always have the best components for every bike we make,” Sean explained as he reached into a box full of hardware, emerging with a palm-full of shiny bolts. “Every piece of hardware is stainless steel so it will never rust. Each bearing is fully sealed so it won’t begin grinding months or years from now.”At the same time, EBC is honest and straightforward about what it means to be American-made.The company refers to its e-bikes as American-built with global materials. The complete parts list includes 11 countries that supply everything from the tires to the brakes to the battery cells.EBC does as much work as it can locally. Some of the components are actually fabricated from raw materials on site. The company’s woodshop churns out beautifully crafted oak and walnut fenders and chain guards. The wheel shops expertly lace motors into rims on site, combining the human hand and robotic truing machines in the work. And the company’s nearly dozen-strong team of engineers assembles battery packs safely and securely in a number of formats for the various e-bike models that EBC offers. Even small details such as using multiple temperature sensors in the battery assembly make a big difference in the performance.That also allows EBC to offer industry-leading warranties, like a 10-year warranty on the frame and five-year warranty on the battery.But EBC doesn’t construct everything in-house. Many components simply don’t make sense to try and produce locally. There are several industries that already contain world experts in their specific components. E-bike motors themselves are built in China, battery cells are produced in Korea, Japan, and China, brakes are made in Taiwan, etc.What the company doesn’t build itself, it specs itself. “Look at the controllers,” Sean said, excitedly pulling a silver box from a shelf, complete with a Medusa of wires coming out. “We have these built to our exact specs, even down to the millimeter length of each wire. When you see e-bikes with messy wiring, it’s because they just take stock components off the shelf, controllers and throttles and such. We know the exact length that every wire needs to be to sit pretty on our bikes and we have them made that way from the start.”The same goes for parts like tires. Sean wasn’t happy with many of the tires available on the market, so he bought all of the best ones and cut them open. He found what he liked best from each one, such as reflective materials, thick puncture protection, strong beads, higher speed ratings for e-bikes, etc. Then he combined all the best features from each tire into his own design. It’s not produced in the US (EBC has built impressive facilities, but those don’t include a vulcanized rubber plant), but it is manufactured to Sean’s exact design specifications.So while some of the components are necessarily imported, the local assembly of every single component on the bike ensures the highest standards for quality control. E-bike companies that produce their e-bikes overseas don’t actually see their e-bikes before they arrive at customers’ homes. The bikes are packaged abroad, shipped to a warehouse in the US, and then forwarded to customers. That means customers are the first to learn of any problems that weren’t caught at the factory. Electric Bike Company’s in-house production offers the ability to perform meticulous inspection and packaging processes. Bikes are built and then ridden for testing in the exact same location before being packaged by the company. If something doesn’t look or feel right, the test rider can talk to the builder and verify it on the spot before it ever goes into a box.Speaking of packaging, that’s one more advantage of local production. Many e-bikes that are built in Asia end up damaged in transport because they are shipped in small boxes without adequate protection for an arduous round-the-world journey via a paper carton. Electric Bike Company instead ships its e-bikes fully assembled. The larger box only costs a bit more to ship, and it doesn’t have to worry about trying to cram as many boxes as possible into a shipping container from China. When customers receive the bike, they don’t have to spend an hour assembling the bike, installing handlebars, mounting pedals, etc. The bike simply rolls right out of the box, ready to ride. I had an EBC bike delivered a few years ago, and it was literally tied inside the box with a bow.Most e-bike companies in the US account for a certain percentage of e-bikes that will arrive for customers with problems that need addressing by service or replacement. It’s unfortunately a part of the business model, and it’s simply factored into the cost. But Sean explained that EBC is well below 1 in 1,000 e-bikes that arrives with an issue – an unheard-of figure in the industry.US-based manufacturing isn’t without its downsides. EBC will likely never be able to compete with the most budget-level offerings in the e-bike industry on cost alone. But that’s why the company’s business model isn’t designed for a race to the bottom.Instead, EBC has relied on building high-quality yet affordable e-bikes that focus on providing the most customizable experience in the entire industry – something no importer could ever consider achieving.I see all the time that some people online unfortunately still question the American-built moniker of these bikes, suggesting instead that they are merely “American-assembled.” At a certain point, it becomes a semantics debate. Is a salad made in a California restaurant that uses an avocado from Mexico not still an American-made salad? Perhaps adding an asterisk with a note that “*salad made in USA from some global vegetables” might calm some pedantic keyboard warriors, but is that really where we are?The fact of the matter is that on my trip, I saw hard-working and diverse Americans building e-bikes from top to bottom. EBC’s team of over 100 employees touch every single piece of the bikes from the wheels to the batteries to the paint, then test and package them locally.If that ain’t American, I don’t know what is.",ebikes
2021/12/27,"The French company Moonbike is preparing to bring its fun-looking snow transporter to the US, just in time for winter riding.The Moonbike may have “bike” in its name, though it’s hard to call it a true snow bike.But don’t let that rear track fool you. It’s not really a traditional snowmobile either, in that it rides on a single forward ski instead of two.No matter what you call it, it sure does look like fun.Powered by a 3 kW electric motor, the Moonbike blasts up to a top speed of 42 km/h (26 mph). That’s not going to compete well with a true electric snowmobile, but it’s definitely easier to toss the 82 kg (182 lb) ride in the back of a truck or SUV. Thus the Moonbike seems better suited for local snow shenanigans than true snowmobiling duty.The single 2.5 kWh battery pack offers up a maximum of one hour of use on sport mode or 1.5 hour of use with easier riding in Eco mode. According to the company, that means around 20 km (12 miles) in sport mode or 35 km (22 miles) in eco mode. There’s also an option for a 5 kWh battery that doubles the range and adds another 12 kg (25 lb) of weight to the Moonbike.A full charge takes around five hours on a standard wall plug, or around half that time with the faster charger option. Pricing starts at $8,500 in the US, with deliveries listed as “in advance of and during the 2021-22 winter season.” I guess that means they’ll be rolling out soon, if I’m reading that correctly.The company says it is producing 400 Moonbikes for “both European and American markets,” so it sounds like they are currently in the process.We’ve seen other electric snow bikes before, but usually not quite this capable.Canadian company Envo has a neat snow-kart offering of its own, as well as a kit that allows riders to convert their own bicycle into an electric snow bike.And we’re also beginning to see the introduction of full-size electric snowmobiles with enough power to rival many electric cars.But the Moonbike definitely fills that gap as a bike-shaped tool for snow sports that’s likely to give riders one heck of an experience.",ebikes
2021/12/27,"CSC Electric Bicycles has a new mid-drive e-bike ready to enter its lineup. The new CSC FT1000MD e-bike will be the most powerful model launched to date by the brand.CSC Electric Bicycles is the e-bike arm of CSC Motorcycles, a popular motorcycle importer located on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The Azusa-based company has worked in the motorcycle industry for over 30 years. In 2018, they began incorporating light electric motorcycles and scooters into their lineup, starting with their popular City Slicker model.By 2019, they added electric bicycles to the mix with two fat tire e-bike models – that’s when the motorcycle company began CSC Electric Bicycles. New models followed including electric cruisers and cargo e-bikes.Now, CSC is stepping it up a notch further with more power than ever before.The new CSC FT1000MD e-bike (they apparently never lost the motorcycle naming scheme from their roots) will also be the brand’s first mid-drive e-bike.The centrally-located Bafang M620 mid-drive motor is famous for its power. The drive unit is listed as a 1,000W continuous-rated motor, but is known to put out even more power when pushed to the limit.The bike will ship in Class 2 mode with a 20 mph (32 km/h) speed limit, but it can be unlocked by the rider to reach 28 mph (45 km/h) on either throttle or pedal assist. The motor also puts out a maximum of 160 Nm of torque, which is more than any other consumer e-bike mid-drive motor on the market. That high torque makes short work of hills and powers the bike through quick acceleration off the line.Speaking of torque, the motor includes a true torque sensor to provide the most comfortable and responsive pedal assist. It provides a more natural motor response than cheaper cadence-based pedal assist sensors.The CSC FT1000MD e-bike combines the high power mid-drive motor with a stainless steel KMC chain for longevity and an 8-speed Shimano Altus derailleur.An adjustable handlebar riser helps riders dial in their bars to the most comfortable height and angle. Full aluminum pedals adorn the cranks and a hydraulic suspension fork up front provides added comfort and better handling when the trails get rough.Stopping power comes from Tektro’s Auriga E500 dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes clamping down on 180mm rotors.The e-bike system comes paired with a color display and five selectable levels of pedal assist, plus a thumb throttle for those that want to take a break from pedaling.LED lighting in the front and rear runs off of the main battery, so you never need to swap in AA batteries to stay lit at night.All of the parts seem to be of very nice quality from name brands. Sure, a Shimano Alivio derailleur might have been nice, but a Shimano Altus is plenty for almost any recreational or commuter rider out there. And while many companies have moved to off-brand components to save money and shore up dwindling supply lines, CSC seems to be sticking with name brand components.Energy comes from a 48V 16Ah lithium-ion battery. The battery is semi-integrated into the frame for a more streamlined appearance, and its 768 Wh of capacity are slightly above average in the industry.We’ve seen higher capacity batteries before, but many leaders in the market still use smaller batteries that we see here.The 76 lb (34 kg) e-bike is hefty, likely in large part because that massive motor and big battery aren’t lightweight components. Neither are those 4″ fat tires, though they make up for their weight with awesome performance in sand, dirt and snow.The bikes don’t come standard with racks or fenders, though there are mounting points to add them if you’d like.The Bafang Ultra M620 motor is not a cheap piece of kit. Most of the e-bikes we’ve seen that boast this motor are priced in the $4,000+ range, though they are usually full-suspension e-bikes as well.CSC has priced the FT1000MD with an MSRP of $3,295. To further sweeten the pot, the bike is currently on pre-order with free shipping and a $300 discount dropping the price to $2,995. Hell, my daily driver mid-drive e-bike costs more and has half the power.And unlike most e-bike companies that require an entire upfront payment, CSC just takes a $200 deposit to hold your pre-order.CSC’s new e-bikes are currently en route and expected to ship in early 2022. The company explained that they don’t have an exact shipping date to offer yet due to the bikes’ present predicament of waiting in a sea of cargo ships currently parked off of Long Beach. That’s a problem facing most e-bike companies in the US right now.Oh yeah, and you can have the e-bike in any color you want, as long as its green. Though you do at least get two different flavors to choose from: Moss Green or Wasabi.My past experience with CSC has been quite positive, both with their electric motorcycles and e-bikes. So I’d expect more of the same on these bikes.I previously tested out a couple of their 750W fat tire e-bikes last year and gave them two thumbs up. You can check out that experience in the video below. ",ebikes
2021/12/24,"When it comes to custom themed electric bicycles, US e-bike company Super73 pretty much always wins first, second, and third place. Everyone else is simply playing for an honorable mention. The brand has gone all out on probably more than a hundred custom themed e-bikes by now, often partnering with fun brands and sports teams to redesign its popular moped-style electric bikes. And this Santa-themed e-bike is definitely topping the “Nice” list this year.It appears to be built on top of a largely stock Super73-RX e-bike, the company’s most hardcore model, though the resulting e-bike is anything but stock. The 2,000 watt peak-rated e-bike that is known to hit speeds pushing legal limits has undergone a yuletide transformation in more ways than one.A Christmas-themed paint job adorns the “tank” (actually the high capacity battery), frame, fenders, light, and suspension arm guards. The latter even gets a pretty sweet looking peppermint cane treatment. The bench seat that has become a staple of Super73’s moped-style electric bikes received some new red-and-white upholstery for a custom Santa saddle, and the pedals and chain have been swapped out for color-correct options to better fit the theme.There are even jingle bells strategically mounted along the frame, which probably look better than they sound on an e-bike bouncing around at 30-ish mph.The cherry on top of this Santa sundae has to be the custom cargo bag in the center of the frame. The narrow form factor may be a bit limiting for some wider gifts, but I imagine that kids all around the world will cut Santa some slack once they see what he arrived on. That’s totally worth getting only three-inch wide gifts!As far as I know Super73 doesn’t offer any frame bag like this, but after seeing it in action I think they totally should!Super73 has been getting quite creative this year, and not only with the latest custom bike here.Like many other e-bike companies, Super73 has unfortunately had to inform many customers that shipping delays caused by long lines of container ships of the California coast meant that e-bikes destined for Christmas gifts might not be arriving in time.To at least give customers something physical to hand over on Christmas morning while waiting for the actual bikes to arrive, the company sent out some cheeky pins explaining the problem.Check them out below.lol I just learned that @super73 is sending these cheeky pins to customers whose electric bikes were delayed and will miss Christmas deliveries. Love it. Anyone know of other cute things like these that any other companies are doing? pic.twitter.com/n9hZEH2Tqp",ebikes
2021/12/23,"Rungu’s dual-front wheel electric bicycles are unlike anything else on the road or the trails. And now the company is releasing new updates to make them better than ever.I’ve tested a LOT of electric bicycles over the years. Like, hundreds of them. So when I say something is the weirdest I’ve ever tried, that means something.But just because it’s weird doesn’t mean it isn’t fun too! Rungu’s odd-looking electric bikes may take a few minutes to get used to. But then they become so addicting that you won’t want to get off. That’s exactly what I experienced when Rungu was kind enough to have me out to their Southern California facilities for some test riding back in 2019. And now things are looking even rosier for the brand.First off, I know the Rungu is going to be very divisive. The dual-front wheel setup may look odd, and the naysayers will certainly say nay. But they’re dead wrong.The whole point of the setup is to help the fat tire e-bike go where other fat tire e-bikes can’t go. When I rode it, I was carving hard in loose sand that would have washed out any other two-wheeled fat tire e-bike. And I was flying at breakneck speed over football-size rocks that would have had me checking my life insurance policy had I been on any other e-bike.Rungu has some great videos comparing their e-bikes to typical fat tire e-bikes with a single front wheel (so old-fashioned, I know). They’re pretty eye-opening. Check out the comparisons on mud, on sand, and on snow. The two wheels just freaking plow over everything. In mud and sand, the dual front wheels prevent sliding and keep you more stable. On rocky and uneven terrain, one front wheel may be in the air but the other is usually on solid ground, giving you a weirdly smooth ride as they trade off for traction.There are five models in the complete lineup of Rungu e-bikes, and the latest updates see several upgrades to make the ride even better.The entry-level Rungu Dualie Standard as well as the Rungu Steep model now both include a new frame design to integrate the battery. The new frame makes swapping out batteries easier thanks to the new 780 Wh integrated battery pack. The updated frame also increases the height of the Bafang BBSHD 52V mid-drive motor, giving better ground clearance to help clear more obstacles and better cross shallow water like creeks and streams.The next models up, known as the Rungu Dualie Rugged and XR models, both get new higher capacity lithium-ion batteries that offer 30% more range compared to the previous models. Actual ranges are notoriously hard to nail down on e-bikes due to the many factors that affect them, such as rider weight, assist level, terrain, tires, and other factors. On something as wild as the Rungu, the range spread is probably even wider. But any way you slice it, the new 936 Wh batteries have a lot more capacity in them to help take riders farther. They are also backwards compatible with previous Rungu models, meaning owners can upgrade to the new higher capacity batteries. Considering that Rungu’s e-bikes are designed for handling the trickiest and most challenging terrain, more battery is always a good thing. Riding through brush, snow, sand, and other loose terrain quickly eats away at an e-bike’s battery, making these large packs a necessity.As the company explained:The 2022 models continue to provide ATV-like “Go Anywhere” Performance that outclasses any comparable e-bike on the market today. Since 2018, Rungu’s patented double-front-wheel design continues to demonstrate its off-road bona fides conquering famous rock crawling trails like the Rubicon Trail, Poison Spider, Hells Revenge as well as mud and sand backcountry terrain like the Alpine Loop in Colorado and the Mojave Trail in Southern California. On iconic off-road terrain like this, Rungu Dualie Double Wheel Design virtually eliminates washouts and over-the-bar wipeouts common to more expensive fat-tire e-bikes of similar power.Rungu e-bikes have been sent to customers around the world, and the models have become increasingly popular with bow hunters. Rungu’s e-bikes are built locally in southern California. While the price certainly reflects their American manufacturing, they aren’t quite as steep as you might have feared – at least not for the entry-level models. The bikes start at around $4,900, and Rungu also has financing options for around $160 per month.If you want to see my own testing of the previous version of these e-bikes, check out my test ride video below where a young, starry-eyed Micah has his socks blown off by these things.",ebikes
2021/12/21,"The AM1000 has long been FREY Bike’s best-selling electric mountain bike platform. Now the company has released the sixth version, which features a number of upgrades to the 1,000+ watt e-bike.FREY Bike is based in Jinhua, China, and builds premium-level electric bikes designed to compete with Europe’s top eMTBs.The AM1000 has been a staple of FREY’s lineup, combining the super-powerful Bafang Ultra mid-drive motor with high-capacity batteries and high-end bicycle components.The newly launched AM1000 V6 marks the first version of the e-bike to incorporate a fully-integrated battery, among a slew of other updates.The large 48V 21Ah battery is entirely hidden inside the downtube of the frame, much like the popular FREY EX model.With 1,008 Wh of capacity, the AM1000 offers more battery than just about any electric mountain bike out there. FREY and Luna Cycle are virtually alone in the battle for top eMTB battery capacity.The reason that much battery is necessary is that both companies also use high power mid-drive motors. In the case of the FREY AM1000, the Bafang Ultra mid-drive motor puts out a claimed 1,000W of power. In actuality, peak power is often measured at closer to 1,500W in bursts.That helps the e-bike climb steep terrain that would normally only be accessible by dirt bikes or Sur Ron-style trail bikes and also offers fast acceleration.It doesn’t hurt in the top speed category either. FREY doesn’t publish an actual top speed, partly since it is quite variable depending on gearing, rider weight, terrain, etc. But when riding the AM1000 V5 on flat pavement, I hit around 37 mph (59 km/h).The V6 also now comes with a mullet-style wheelset offering a 29″ tire in the front and a 27.5″ tire in the rear. That setup offers the best compromise between ride and acceleration/nimbleness. It’s an increasingly common choice among the premium eMTB manufacturers such as Trek and Specialized.The AM1000 V6’s aluminum frame comes decked out in premium suspension components consisting of a RockShox Yari RC Boost fork and a RockShox Deluxe rear shock. Other drool-worthy parts include a dropper seat post, Quanta thru-axle hubs, SRAM NX 11-speed transmission, and Magura MT5 Ne quad-piston hydraulic disc brakes. FREY even offers a frame kit if you want to choose your own components, meaning you get just the frame, swingarm, rear shock, battery, motor, and charger. Then the rest is up to you to outfit the bike as you see fit.The AM1000 V6 is also available in three frame sizes and several new colors, such as Jet Black, Aero Blue, Rose Dust, and Sheen Green.Those parts don’t come cheap though, with the bike now priced at $5,180 before shipping. Considering that FREY is competing with several high-end electric mountain bike companies that charge several thousand bucks more, that price isn’t quite as painful as it may seem for the uninitiated. You can check out the new e-bike in the video below, which also shows off a look at FREY’s new bike part built in its home town.I’ve been a big FREY fan ever since I visited the company’s headquarters and factory on a trip to China in 2019.The company’s e-bikes offer something we rarely see in the e-bike industry, a combination of high power and high-quality builds.There are plenty of high power e-bikes out there, but most cut corners with budget-level components to keep costs reasonable.There are also plenty of high-dollar electric mountain bikes with top-shelf components, but they are often underpowered for the pesky reason of having to conform to European or US e-bike laws.A beautiful thing happens when you throw e-bike regulations out the window: you can get high power and high quality all at once!To be fair, you can easily program powerful motors like the Bafang Ultra to legal limits, which may or may not suffice in your local town or state. For me, when I’m riding trails, I’m more worried about keeping my line than whether or not I’m going to see red and blue lights on the single track. I’ll, of course, always check my speed when I’m around other riders, but heading off-road offers a bit of a respite from e-bike regulations designed for public roads.And I must say that my own experience with a FREY EX e-bike definitely helped me up my game. Fortunately, the AM1000 V6 incorporates a few things that I loved about the EX, such as that internal battery.I don’t really know what I’m doing, but I think I’m getting better. And my FREY EX is definitely helping! 1.5kW! (Though this was on Eco mode with just pedal assist) pic.twitter.com/lvCF6cH5rpWhile FREY’s bikes are pricey compared to much of what we see from China, they are a world away in terms of quality. FREY doesn’t cut corners when it comes to build quality – that’s for sure. And the e-bikes fill a comfortable niche that very few other companies can touch.High power motors and high quality suspension/drivetrain/brakes/etc are a match made in heaven. ",ebikes
2021/12/21,"The SWFT Maxx electric moped is one of those rare two-wheeled EVs that tries to have its cake and eat it too. On the one hand, it’s a scooter for all intents and purposes. On the other hand, it offers performance that most people would associate more with electric bicycles.So what’s it good for? Let’s dive in and see.First of all, the name itself is going to be divisive. Not the “SWFT” or “Maxx” part. It’s still the early 2020s and thus product names have to be consonant salads. That’s the law.Rather, it’s the moped designation.I can already tell you I’m going to get hate emails from grey-bearded moped purists that don’t want to see this thing classified in the same category as their 1960’s Puch moped. On the other hand, it’s literally called the “SWFT Maxx Electric Moped” by the company, so don’t kill the messenger here.It definitely embraces the newer moped classification, which basically means it has two wheels, a step-through design, and a big plushy seat. So yea, there’s that.Now let’s get to the meat and potatoes of this thing, because it’s a cool little electric vehicle. And at just $1,499 on its current sale, it absolutely deserves a look.You can take that look by checking out my ride video below. Then keep on reading for my full review!The SWFT Maxx really does fall in that grey area smack-dab in the middle of e-bikes and scooters.The performance feels like a Class 2 e-bike in pretty much every way.One twist of the throttle takes you smoothly but not slowly up to 20 mph (32 km/h). A pull of the brakes brings you right back down to zero. But on the other hand, the form factor is all moped.That big bench seat feels nice on your tush, just as it does on a passenger’s tush behind you. In my case, it was my wife’s. Most bikes aren’t designed for two riders, but we rode the SWFT Maxx together quite comfortably. As much as I love e-bikes, that’s another checkmark in the moped column.The moped feeling extends to the low seat height (you can easily flat-foot it at stops) and the convenient step-through design. The hydraulic shocks in the front and rear are surprisingly comfortable too.You also get the extra little features that mopeds are known for, like a bag clip for your shopping bags, underseat storage, mirrors for visibility, and a complete light package of turn signals, high and low-beams, hazard lights, brake lights, etc. There’s even a built-in alarm and wireless key fob to activate it. Plus there’s that road presence advantage, where car drivers tend to treat riders of bicycles and scooters/mopeds/motorcycles very differently. Whereas many drivers, unfortunately, see bicycles as encroaching on road space, that second group often gets at least implicit acceptance as belonging on the road due to their status as a form of motor vehicle, even if just a two-wheeled vehicle.Though therein lies the rub. The SWFT Maxx looks like a motor vehicle, as in a true scooter or moped. But technically, it’s kinda not. The 20 mph speed means most states won’t consider it to be a motorcycle, and thus you don’t need any license or insurance.Of course that’s a double-edged sword. The fact that it isn’t classified as a motorcycle doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a bicycle either. The lack of pedals can also be an issue for road-legal e-bike status in some states. Your mileage may vary, so its best to check your local laws.But whether or not it is technically classified as an electric bike, the SWFT Maxx sure handles like one. The rear hub motor is listed as 400W, but I can tell you that it feels way peppier than that. It accelerates like any other 750W e-bike I’ve ridden, so I think that 400W is likely underrated. The range is listed as 38 miles. I’m guessing that’s a bit high, especially since the 48V 20Ah lead acid battery only gives around 960 Wh of capacity. That’d be a lot for an e-bike that you can pedal, but the Maxx here is of course a throttle-only affair.I didn’t drain the battery too far because I didn’t want to get stuck, but based on my riding distance and how far the battery was draining each time, I think 25-30 miles at reasonable riding levels would be closer to accurate and a safer assumption.Again though, that sounds like e-bike specs. And the whole time I’ve been riding this thing, I just can’t help but feel like I’m in straddling two worlds: e-bike specs and moped comfort/utility.The downside to that is you don’t get the higher speed you’d associate with mopeds, and you don’t get the lightweight, ‘pick it up and throw it in the back of the car’ feature of an e-bike.As long as I’m not on big roads, the 20 mph felt fine. Cruising the neighborhood was a dream. But faster 30 mph roads can be a bit dicey.Then there’s the whole bike lane issue. Can I ride in it? I’m not a bike, but neither are those Lime scooters and they fly down the path at the same speed. Of course, they don’t weigh 160 lb like the SWFT Maxx here does.But both the SWFT site and the Best Buy page where you can actually buy it list the Maxx as a Class 2 e-bike, so they are definitely operating under the assumption that this is an electric bicycle.I’ve defaulted to skipping the bike lane unless it’s empty, as I don’t want to draw unwanted attention or needlessly frighten anyone with what admittedly looks like a gas scooter that should be going much faster than it is.If I had to make any changes to the SWFT Maxx, more speed and a lithium-ion battery upgrade would be at the top of my list. Removable batteries would also be a great option to extend the range.But at $1,499 (or $1,999 when it’s not on sale), it’s hard to add those features for this price. Keep in mind the other stuff you’re getting, like hydraulic suspension, seating for two, powerful brakes, mirrors, storage, full lighting package, etc. There’s a lot to love here.Ultimately, I can see this as a great ride for certain groups of people, like teenagers or college kids navigating their way to campus, or elderly folks living in planned communities. The 20 mph speed limit makes it hard for me to take it on busier suburban roads where cars go flying past me, but urban-only residents that are surrounded by crawling traffic will likely find that it can take them anywhere they want to go.What do you think? Let’s hear your thoughts on the SWFT Maxx electric moped in the comment section below.",ebikes
2021/12/20,"Electric bicycles have positively exploded in popularity this year. You don’t have to take our word for it – you can see that e-bike sales numbers are off the charts. Consumer interest in electric bikes continues to grow, and more riders are pounding the pavement and the dirt than ever before. Electrek alone brought in tens of millions of views for e-bike news stories this year, further demonstrating how much fascination there is in the industry. Now we’re looking back on the biggest electric bike news stories of the year.When BMW unveiled its i Vision AMBY electric bicycle, it did so fully knowing that the fast e-bike didn’t fit within any current legal definitions of an electric bike.The powerful motor gave it a top speed of up to 60 km/h (37 mph), which far exceeds the typical legal e-bike limits in nearly every country in North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. The top speed was technically modifiable via a smartphone app, allowing it to be dropped to anywhere from 25-45 km/h (15-28 mph) to fit various local speed regulations. BMW even floated the idea of having the speed limit be adjustable in real-time using geofencing, meaning you could go full speed on private roads and trails, then have the bike automatically drop back to local speed limits when you join a public road. Or the speed limit could be lower in the city center, then automatically boost higher when riders hop onto a larger, faster road.But BMW knew quite well what it was doing, stating that the e-bike concept was more about encouraging a conversation about updating electric bicycle regulations to include higher speed and more powerful offerings. As the company explained:“In the absence of any existing legal framework for a vehicle of this kind with a modular speed concept, the “AMBY” Vision Vehicles set out to prompt the introduction of such legislation and, by consequence, developments of this nature.”Good luck with that.The high-speed and geofencing capabilities of the e-bike weren’t the only head-turners. BMW also outfitted the e-bike with a 2,000 Wh battery, which is around 3-4x the average e-bike battery size today.The company claims that in the lowest power mode, the e-bike would be capable of 300 km (186 miles) of range on pedal assist.“Would be,” you know, if it wasn’t just a concept…If you weren’t already aware, I write a weekly column known as the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week. You pretty much either love it or hate it. The series is a largely tongue-in-cheek column where I find a fun, silly, or outrageous electric vehicle on China’s largest shopping website. It’s always awesome, weird, or both.This time I found a particularly intriguing electric bicycle designed for three riders. As awesomely weird as the design was, a big driver in its interest was likely the $750 price tag, combined with free shipping.That was for the “low capacity battery” option, which was just 384 Wh. But you could bump up to options including 720 Wh, 840 Wh, or a ridiculous 960 Wh pack, all without pushing the price over $1,000. That was pretty amazing by itself.The bike wasn’t overly powerful, with somewhere between 400-600W of power. But the utility of the thing really brought it home. Three seats, full suspension, a pet cage (which I think should probably never actually be used for a real pet), and more made this thing feature-packed.There was even a motor lock to keep someone from being able to use the bike if they stole it, rear footpegs, front folding footpegs, folding pedals (basically lots of places for three people to put their feet), and more!Just check out all the features below.I was in fact so enamored with this weird little e-bike after writing about it, that I went ahead and put my money where my mouth was by buying one. That turned out to be a rollercoaster of a ride after it took months to make it through the cargo ship backlog off of Long Beach, California. When it finally landed, the container it was in was “damaged” and my bike was “undeliverable.”I now have a replacement bike on its way, and hopefully this one actually gets delivered so I can share with you how the bike performs in real life.Sometimes the biggest EV news stories aren’t about a particular vehicle at all, but rather bold new technology.That was the case when Schaeffler showed off its new electric bicycle drive-by-wire system known as the Freedrive. It completely removes any chains or belts from an e-bike drivetrain. Instead of any form of mechanical linkage to the rear wheel, the pedals simply powered a generator that transferred electricity to the e-bike’s hub motor.It’s a really fascinating system that opens the door to wildly creative e-bike designs. One of the most applicable will initially be cargo e-bikes, which are often hamstrung by needing to connect a pedal drive through mechanical linkage to a rear-drive wheel that is located far away and many times out of line with the pedals. We saw the drive in action at Eurobike 2021 installed on a particularly large cargo e-bike and it worked pretty awesomely, though the team is still tweaking it to improve the performance across the entire gear range.It seems like people really love high-speed electric bicycles, or at least they sure do love reading about them. The top five biggest e-bike news stories of 2021 list counts two high-speed electric bicycles.Not to be outdone by BMW, Dutch e-bike manufacturer VanMoof announced a high-speed hyperbike known as the VanMoof V that would reach either 31 mph (50 km/h) or 37 mph (60 km/h), depending on which company rep or press release you read.The full-suspension electric bicycle isn’t just a concept though. While BMW made no indication that it planned to produce its wildly fast e-bike, VanMoof says it will actually bring its own hyperbike to market.Taking a page out of BMW’s book though, VanMoof also claims that the goal is to push the discussion of e-bike regulations forward.As VanMoof cofounder Ties Carlier explained:“The VanMoof V is our first hyperbike, an e-bike dedicated to higher speed and longer distance. I believe this new type of high-speed e-bike can fully replace scooters and cars in the city by 2025.We’re calling for policies designed around people, rethinking how public spaces can be used if not occupied by cars. I am getting very excited thinking about what a city could look like in the near future, and we are very proud to be part of the change by building the right tools for the transition.”Electric bicycle federal tax credits similar to those available for electric cars have been big news this year ever since they were first proposed in Congress back in February.While some thought that e-bike tax credits were a long shot, the proposal got a huge vote of confidence when it passed an actual vote in the US House of Representatives as part of the Build Back Better Act.The tax credit is capped at a max of $900, down from an initial plan for a $1,5000 limit. It would only apply to electric bicycles priced under $4,000. The original plan limited the tax credit to e-bikes priced under $8,000. The lower limit rules out some of the more expensive e-bike options that carry price tags related to their ability to spend years replacing cars for everyday commuting.While several models of e-bikes can still be found for under $1,000, most popular e-bikes cost several thousand dollars and would still fit within the pending framework.The inclusion of electric bicycles in the federal electric vehicle tax credits comes after extensive support and lobbying from the public and groups like PeopleForBikes.As PeopleForBikes President and CEO Jenn Dice explained:“The House’s latest vote on the Build Back Better (BBB) Act embraces bicycles as part of a climate solution thanks to new financial incentives for bikes and e-bikes and grants for climate and equity focused infrastructure improvements. We urge the Senate to take up the BBB before the end of the year so we can get to work on lowering transportation emissions while keeping all people, no matter how they travel or where they live, moving.”We saw plenty of new and exciting electric bicycles in 2021, along with new technology and pushes to reframe the question of what makes a legal e-bike at all. Now 2022 could be shaping up to become an even more exciting year as manufacturers begin to recover from crippling supply chain shortages, allowing them to bring new ideas and models to market.What do you think we’ll see in the e-bike industry in 2022? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below. And for a bit of a nostalgic journey back in time (by 12-24 months), check out last year’s top e-bike news stories of 2020.",ebikes
2021/12/18,"Shipping times for just about everything have been stretched to new limits thanks to pandemic-related supply chain constraints. While nearly every industry has been affected in some way, electric bicycles and other forms of personal mobility have been uniquely impacted.The pandemic has affected the e-bike industry in myriad ways. Commuters have sought out e-bikes as a cost-effective transportation alternative.Recreational riders have turned to e-bikes as a way to get outdoors and back to exercising on a bike, just like during their youth.And delivery riders have adopted e-bikes en masse as a way to satiate the pandemic-induced skyrocketing demand for home delivery of food and goods.The only problem is that almost all e-bikes come from Asia, and shipping times to the US have been creeping up for over a year now.While there is some local e-bike production in the US, the vast majority of electric bikes are imported on container ships.What used to be a four-week cruise from Asia to the US West Coast has often turned into a more than 10-week journey that involves long lines of container ships waiting off the coast near California’s busiest ports.One recent electric bicycle company, Ride1Up, recently shared more details than ever on why one of its popular new electric bike models won’t be arriving in time for Christmas.As the company explained in an email to customers obtained by Electrek:Thank you for your support and interest in our new Roadster V2 – Gravel Edition. We want to first express our sincerest apologies for the delay. It appears these will not ship by December 31, 2021 and will likely ship by January 2022. With the global pandemic’s impact on our supply chain, what used to be a 4-week delivery schedule from our manufacturers has turned into 4-8+ weeks (and counting). The Port of Long Beach is extremely backed up with no rhyme or reason for how they are accepting vessels. In fact, the vessel carrying these e-bikes left our manufacturer in mid-October and has been circling around the the Port of Long beach since mid-November. As of this morning and for almost a month, the vessel is currently outside the port waiting to be unloaded for almost a month. See photo below as of 6:00AM PST on 12/17/21. We are hopeful that the container will be unloaded and will clear customs without any additional, significant delays. We truly believed that even with an extra 5+ week shipping time as a buffer we would be able to get you all your bikes before the end of the year. We wanted to be proactive and share this information as soon as we determined end-of-year shipping will likely not be possible given the holidays. We could (and hope to) be wrong and these could unload sooner but we wanted to be realistic with you all. If you have planned to give this as Christmas or other Holiday present, please reach out to our Support Team and we can provide a digital brochure of the Gravel Roadster to share with a loved one on the holiday. We appreciate your support of the brand and hope you participate! As soon as we get any updates, we will share them with all of you. -The Ride1Up TeamThe Ride1Up Roaster V2 Gravel Edition e-bike drew a large amount of interest upon its release. Priced at just $1,245 in an industry that normally charges $3,000 or more for electric gravel bikes, the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition is the most affordable way to get into the gravel game on an e-bike.At the same time, it still manages to pack in a number of nice components, such as the included Gates carbon belt drive and internally-mounted battery.The bike’s strong response led to high sales, but now customers are waiting for those containers to finally reach port and unload the bikes.Ride1Up is far from the only e-bike company affected by the shipping crunch, but it is one of the most transparent so far, showing customers exactly where bikes are in the shipping process and why the typically shorter voyage is taking much longer than usual.",ebikes
2021/12/16,"Ride1Up has spent years earning a well-deserved spot at the front of the pack for commuter e-bikes. But now the San Diego-based electric bike company is branching out into a new class of rides with a more beach cruiser-esque model known as the Cafe Cruiser. The new e-bike is likely to help expand Ride1Up’s reach beyond its existing urban-oriented market, with the brand now expanding further into comfort and lifestyle-type electric bikes.Similar to nearly all of Ride1Up’s existing electric bikes, the Cafe Cruiser will be a fast and powerful e-bike. A 750W hub motor and top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) ensure that it will keep up with or surpass every other legal e-bike on the road in the US.But unlike the rest of the brand’s offerings, the Cafe Cruiser takes on a much more feel-good cruiser vibe.Available in either a step-through or step-over frame, the bike rolls on big ol’ three-inch balloon tires and mounts a sweptback cruiser-style set of handlebars. There’s even that top tank design that we’ve occasionally seen on moto-inspired cruisers. The geometry of the bike is more upright, with a laidback riding style that is designed more for enjoying a comfortable cruise than for getting to work in a rush. And to ensure that riders will be able to enjoy the cruise with a friend along for the ride, the rear rack has been designed to be extra rugged for supporting the weight of an additional passenger (as long as that passenger weighs 130 lb or less). The entire bike has a weight rating of 300 lb.The rack features Ride1Up’s Connect+ system, which allows for quick snap installation of multiple accessories such as a bench seat or kiddie seat. Word on the street is there may also be a basket option that can quickly connect into the rack system.A clear rear wheel skirt and a set of foldout footpegs give the rear passenger a safe and comfortable ride.The passenger kit with bench seat, footpegs, and a clear wheel skirt won’t be available until February though. The child’s seat seen above likely won’t be an accessory you can get directly from Ride1Up, but shows what types of uses are possible with the heavy-duty rear rack.In fact, with that much payload capacity on the rear, the bike almost doubles as a mid-tail cargo e-bike. Almost.Even with the cruiser DNA, Ride1Up still couldn’t totally deny its roots with some good old-fashioned commuter equipment to ensure the Cafe Cruiser still works well on the rough and tumble roads.Features such as fenders, front and rear integrated lighting, eight-speed Shimano drivetrain, Mozo hydraulic fork with 80mm of suspension travel, and Zoom hydraulic disc brakes make the bike a potent commuter as well.The frame-integrated 48V 15Ah battery offers 720 Wh of capacity. Ranges vary considerably based on a number of factors, but the cadence-based pedal assist can probably help riders eke out a good 30-40 miles (50-65 km) of range easily, though throttle riding may cut into those numbers a bit. The Ride1Up Cafe Cruiser is currently taking pre-orders with a promotional price of $1,595. That number almost seems like a typo to me, especially considering that nearly the same price at other companies often nets you much lower performance and lower-spec components.I really like the look of the bike, and I LOVE the price. That price tag of $1,595 seems like a steal.To get a powerful motor, big battery, good suspension, and quality brakes, you’d normally have to spend much more than this. Then add in the awesome passenger-carrying ability of the Cafe Cruiser, and that’s a serious deal.The step-over and step-through variants are also a great way to make the model more accessible. Most of Ride1Up’s other e-bikes also come with both frame styles as options, so I’m glad to see the same here.The beach cruiser e-bike market is underserved, in my opinion. There are options on the expensive end like Pedego and Electra, but those bikes are often priced well outside of many riders’ budgets, and the affordable ones tend to skimp on the good parts.So far the best option for bang-for-your-buck in electric cruiser bikes has probably been Newport Beach-based Electric Bike Company. The company makes beautiful electric bikes locally and also offers more customization options than I’ve ever seen in the e-bike industry, but that also comes with a higher price – especially when you get into the really awesome custom paint options.At $1,595 for the Cafe Cruiser, I just don’t know of any other cruiser e-bike that comes close to this level of components and with anything resembling the backing of a reputable company like Ride1Up.I can’t wait to get to test the Cafe Cruiser out… I just hope my wife is as jazzed about riding on the back!",ebikes
2021/12/16,"The RadRunner from Rad Power Bikes broke new ground upon its release two years ago. It became the first widely successful utility e-bike from a major manufacturer, spawning many imitators in the process. The e-bike has remained a staple of Rad’s lineup of electric bicycles ever since, and it is now getting an update in the form of the RadRunner 2.The RadRunner 2, which was just announced this morning, carries over much of what riders know and love from the original RadRunner.The step-through frame is largely the same, though the geometry has been altered to bring it closer to the popular RadRunner Plus. A more laidback head tube angle mimics a similar angle offered by the longer suspension fork on the RadRunner Plus.While the RadRunner 2 doesn’t have the same suspension offered by the fancier Plus version, it does draw inspiration from its ride comfort. To create a more plush ride, the RadRunner 2’s saddle has been upgraded with an extra 15 mm of cushioning. That’s a whole half-inch of butt-bouncing goodness, making the somewhat funny-looking flat saddle a bit nicer on the tush.The odd look to the saddle is no accident. It’s designed that way to fit nicely with the Passenger Kit accessory that turns the RadRunner 2 into a two-person e-bike. Or, as I found when I tested that package on the original RadRunner with my two young nephews, it can be a three-person e-bike as long as riders #2 and #3 are sufficiently pint-sized. And with the inclusion of a new accessory, Rad Passenger Bars, the RadRunner 2 will be even more comfortable for rear passengers.The long rear bench seat combined with the wheel skirt and footpegs makes for an optimum passenger platform, but it can still be used for loading cargo as well. The combined utility of cargo and passengers was one of the first things that drew me to the bike over two years ago, and I’m glad to see that it has only gotten better. In fact, I’m guessing those passenger bars would make a great place to tie bungee cords when you’re lashing down cargo – not that they are likely intended for that. But you know the drill: improvise, adapt, overcome.The RadRunner 2 platform still accepts other popular accessories from the RadRunner line, such as that giant Center Console accessory that provides enclosed storage, a phone holder, and a cup holder all in one package. It removes the step-through nature of the bike, but its utility likely makes it worth it for many riders.The other major features of the RadRunner 2 all stick to the usual suspects we saw with the original RadRunner. There’s the single-speed drivetrain, the LED display, and the Tektro mechanical disc brakes.All of these parts are chosen to offer a balance between good quality components and affordability. Riders looking for suspension or multiple gears can upgrade to the RadRunner Plus, but the RadRunner 2 is still likely sufficient for most riders.Performance also remains the same, with a top speed on throttle or pedal assist of 20 mph (32 km/h). A 672 Wh battery offers the same range of up to 45 miles (72 km) per charge.The three-inch tires are also back, offering wide enough tread for off-road excursions, but remaining narrow enough to preserve a nimble ride on the road.As for pricing, the RadRunner 2 goes on sale this morning for $1,499. That’s a solid increase compared to the $1,299 RadRunner, but likely falls in line with Rad’s recent announcement that prices would be increasing due to increasing pricing pressures in the e-bike industry.As anyone who saw my review over two years ago when the first RadRunner came out will know, I’m a huge fan of this platform. It’s nimble, it’s quick, it’s simple, and it’s bulletproof. My biggest complaint is probably that the dang name always autocorrects to “roadrunner” when I type it.While this is admittedly not a massive update to the RadRunner, that’s fine with me. In fact, I’d rather see it stay largely unaltered. The bike has long been an awesome addition to anyone’s garage, and the changes we’re seeing now simply make it a bit better without messing up a good thing. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.That’s largely the sentiment I heard from Rad’s team when I asked them about the design changes. They explained that, for the most part, the RadRunner has been a crowd favorite, but that they wanted to take into consideration some specific feedback they heard about the ride to improve it even further with these updates.The only thing that stings me here is the price. I still think the RadRunner 2 is a good buy at $1,499, but that previous pricing for the RadRunner 1 was pretty sweet. Like we’ve covered before though, everything from the exchange rate to the cost of raw materials and gouging ocean freight rates are forcing manufacturers to raise prices across the board.What do you think of the RadRunner 2 platform?

2021/12/15,"Super73 epitomizes the electric moped market in the US, offering several models of fast, powerful, and nostalgic bikes that combine moped-style features with electric bicycle technology. Now the Southern California company says it will debut multiple new models at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022) in early January.According to a marketing email sent out by Super73, “[t]he company plans to turn two-wheeled transportation on its head by unveiling a bold new concept, segment-busting new models, as well as new accessories and apparel lines.”The new accessories and apparel lines are to be expected, as Super73 heavily embraces the lifestyle aspect of its brand – likely more than any other e-bike company.The new models are more surprising, especially since Super73 has already released several updates such as the new Super73 ZX e-bike that we tested this fall.But the real kicker is the “bold new concept” that Super73 plans to release.The company doesn’t give any more details, but does release an interesting graphic that hints at a larger form factor than a typical electric bicycle.Outlined in a neon sign motif borrowed from Las Vegas styling – the city that will play host to Super73’s CES unveiling – is the unmistakable outline of a true-to-form motorcycle.While it’s no guarantee that Super73 will actually roll out an electric motorcycle at CES in a few weeks, this is the largest hint yet that the e-bike company is cooking up something larger.Of course this “bold new concept” is likely to be just that, a concept. At least, at first. But that’s also how many of the most interesting new bikes in the industry began.The move wouldn’t be unprecedented in the electric bicycle industry. Fellow California-based electric bicycle company SONDORS rolled out a concept of an electric motorcycle nearly a year ago. The 80 mph (130 km/h) Metacycle began taking orders and was expected to make deliveries by the end of this year, but has since been delayed to summer of 2022.Super73’s largest and most powerful electric bicycles already border on light electric motorcycle territory, but retain pedals and the ability to program the bikes to street-legal power and speed limits.Unlocked though, the brand’s highest power models are capable of power levels surpassing 2,000 watts and speeds of around 30 mph (50 km/h).Electrek recently borrowed a couple of the company’s higher-spec electric bikes on a trip across Germany, where we took advantage of the power and utility of the bikes to explore everything from the city roads to countryside trails.While it’s not yet clear exactly what Super73 has cooking in its R&D department, it certainly sounds like the company will be bringing several interesting new bikes for show and tell.

2021/12/14,"Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes has just sent an email out to its customers and followers announcing that prices will increase across its line of electric bicycles starting at the end of this year.Electric bicycle prices have followed a rollercoaster trajectory this year.Back in the spring of 2021, prices were generally rising across the board. We discussed how a number of pricing pressures were affecting the industry, from shipping prices to exchange rates and more.But by September, many companies had already begun lowering prices again after a slight drop in sea freight prices.It seemed like the price hikes witnessed across the industry were in the rear view mirror, but today’s announcement from the largest electric bicycle company in North America calls that into question.Rad sent out the following message this morning:At Rad, our mission is “to offer an unrivaled customer experience with radical electric bikes that are built for everything and priced for everyone.” Over the past 18 months we’ve taken creative steps to weather the global supply chain crisis. Nevertheless, these challenges have made it much more expensive to build and ship our electric bikes and accessories. In light of this, we’ve made the tough decision to raise prices across the Rad lineup beginning December 29th, 2021. These new prices will enable us to continue our commitment to only delivering high-quality and innovative products — plus, with flexible financing options, free shipping, and our direct to consumer business model, Rad Power Bikes will remain one of the most cost-effective ways to get around. Our current prices will be active until December 29th. If you have your eye on an item, we have in-stock ebikes, spare parts, and Rad accessories at the highest-levels we’ve seen in the past few years.We will finish the year with more than 700 passionate employees and are ready to support all of our existing customers and empower the hundreds of thousands of new riders we expect to join us in the new year. We appreciate your understanding around these price changes and are proud to be your partners. We look forward to continuing to Ride Rad together into 2022 and beyond.Rad Power Bikes is often looked at as an indicator for the entire industry. Not only have they raised more money than others by far and produce more electric bicycles than anyone else, but their products and pricing structure are routinely copied throughout the industry.The company’s size has helped it weather storms in the past that more severely impacted smaller players in the market. During the height of the ocean shipping crisis, Rad was even able to buy its own containers and shipping vessel to ensure a steady supply of e-bikes kept flowing when other companies were stuck with empty shelves.But now it appears even Rad is being forced to make adjustments due to continued pressures weighing on the electric bicycle manufacturing industry.The news comes after the company unveiled two new premium electric bicycles this year, the RadRover 6 Plus and the RadCity 5 Plus, both offering a wide range of new features never before seen at Rad. Both also used higher spec parts that made for higher-quality bikes yet pushed prices higher than we’ve seen from the company before – up to $1,999 for the off-road RadRover 6 Plus. That contrasted starkly with the $999 RadMission e-bike, which the company developed last summer to maintain a strong offering in the critical sub-$1,000 electric bike category.The company has not yet announced what the new pricing structure will be for its e-bikes once prices rise at the end of this month. That information is expected to become available on December 29.Suffice it to say that if you’ve been considering picking up one of Rad Power Bike’s e-bikes lately, now is the time to check out the company’s sales before prices increase. It’s never fun to see a price increase in the e-bike industry, especially since these are already expensive purchases. Many people buy electric bicycles to replace car commutes, and thus e-bikes often help owners save money in the long run. But upfront costs can still make e-bike purchases hard to swallow.Rad has grown so much in the past couple years, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling in size while drastically investing in increasing e-bike production rates. That doesn’t come cheap, but the company also raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in investments during that period.On the other hand, when costs increase, companies that need to maintain their bottom line can either increase prices or reduce quality to maintain pricing. Everyone knows that there are cheaper options out there than Rad, so it makes sense that the company would rather maintain the quality that it is known for, and I’m glad that’s what they’ve done. Otherwise it becomes a race to the bottom. Rad may not have the same level of quality as a high-end company like Specialized or Trek, but they come in at a fraction of the price of those e-bikes that often start at $3,500-$4,000. Compared to budget options on the other end of the spectrum, Rad has long been a Goldilocks solution with excellent quality for a modest price. Not too cheap but not too fancy either.And while some cynics have claimed that e-bike companies will begin raising prices ahead of a potential $900 electric bike tax credit that is currently working its way through the US Senate, I don’t think that’s what we’re seeing here.My biggest question is whether this is an isolated incident related to Rad’s explosive growth and investment in its own production and nationwide customer service, or whether other e-bike companies will follow suit with increased prices.What do you think? Let us know in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/12/10,"It was only a matter of time before two of the largest growing fields in the last few years, micromobility and cryptocurrency, combined their influences. Major micromobility retailer Voro Motors has just announced that it is now accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as a payment method.As the largest cryptocurrencies gain wider acceptance as everyday forms of payment, currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are starting to be accepted at an increasingly large number of retailers.Tesla even got into the Bitcoin game this past March when it began accepting the digital currency as a form of payment for its electric cars.However, the electric vehicle manufacturer backtracked less than two months later, removing Bitcoin as a payment option over concerns regarding the heavy fossil fuel use in mining of the cryptocurrency.That hasn’t stopped Voro Motors though, as the California-based electric mobility company adds crypto to its list of acceptable payment methods.Just don’t plan to get rich if the exchange rate jumps in your favor. The company explained that they will process any returns at the current exchange rate. So if Bitcoin doubles next week and you return a product for a refund, you’ll only get the current exchange rate back (i.e., the same USD value and half the number of Bitcoins).From medium and high-power electric scooters to some funky electric bike-like scooters, Voro Motors carries one of the widest selection of electric mobility products.I’ve personally tested several of Voro Motors’ rides, and one of my favorites is the 51 km/h (30 mph) Emove Cruiser electric scooter.The scooter comes with a massive 52V and 30Ah battery rated for 1,560 Wh of capacity. The company claimed that the scooter could travel 100 km (62 miles) on a charge, though I thought that was just marketing hype until I tested it myself. Riding at full speed, I managed around 104 km before the scooter’s battery finally drained.You can see my range test in the video below.Voro Motors may be the most recent micromobility company to begin accepting Bitcoin, but they are far from the first. Croatian electric bike company Greyp accepts several cryptocurrencies for its high-end electric bicycles, and Furosystems also accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. Is this a sign of the times?Will more companies begin selling e-scooters and e-bikes in cryptocurrency?Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/12/07,"Replacing cars as commuter vehicles is one of the best uses for electric bicycles, which help would-be riders turn into actual riders by adding the confidence boost of electric pedal assist. Now Addmotor is hoping to cash in on the market with its own electric city bike known as the E-53 City Pro.Addmotor is typically known for more out-there designs, like giant fat tire electric bikes or retro-styled moped e-bikes.But with the announcement of the new Addmotor City Pro, the company is planning a more traditional diamond frame e-bike for metro-style riding.The new model may look like a typical city e-bike, but it comes with a few features that we normally only see on higher-spec models.For example, the bike’s 48V and 20Ah battery is much larger than those found on typical value-oriented electric city bikes. The company claims that the 960 Wh can offer as much as 125 miles (201 km) of range on pedal assist, though that’s likely in the lowest power pedal assist mode. Higher power pedal assist or throttle-only operation are still likely to garner some serious range thanks to a battery that is much larger than average.The 500W motor is said to offer 900 peak watts of power, making for strong starts and proper hill-climbing performance.Hydraulic disc brakes are also included standard, improving the braking power and reducing the routine maintenance requirements of the bike.Other features include a front suspension fork with 80 mm of travel, a 55 lb (25 kg) payload capacity rear rack, fenders, front and rear LED lighting including turn signals and hazard lights, 26×2.3″ tires, 7-speed Shimano drivetrain and saddle with integrated grab handle.The Addmotor City Pro also comes in two frame styles (step-over or mid-step) and six color options, though not all colors are available for all frame styles.Retail pricing will be set at $2,099, but the bike will go on pre-order later this month with a promotional discount of around $500.Surpassing the $2K-mark puts Addmotor somewhat above “value” e-bike territory, but the extra-large battery and inclusion of slightly better components such as hydraulic brakes may sway riders who want a bit of an upgrade over more affordable, base-level city e-bikes. Addmotor also has several models that cross into the $3K+ territory, so this isn’t exactly new ground for the e-bike company. Addmotor has more typically focused on larger fat tire e-bikes though, and so the entry of an efficient city model certainly adds some nice breadth to the company’s lineup.Addmotor isn’t going to win any beauty pageant awards for the e-bike, which sticks with the old school frame-mounted battery. Many companies are moving to integrated batteries that look sleeker and cleaner, but it’s still hard to hide this much battery inside the frame tubes. You can see the new City Pro e-bikes in Addmotor’s video below, which is a bit more upbeat than I would have expected for a city bike promo.",ebikes
2021/12/04,"I’m an electric bicycle guy through and through. You’ve probably seen me riding and testing any number of dozens of electric bicycles in the last few months – hundreds in the last year or two. So I’ve seen just about everything the e-bike industry has to offer, or at least I thought I had. That was until this strange-looking contraption rolled across my screen in my latest hunt through the Chinese shopping giant Alibaba’s electric vehicle section. With five different shock absorbers, moped seats and wheels the size of teacup saucers, I knew this apparatus was destined to become my next Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week.First of all, we need a little context here. The thing to know about most electric bicycles designed for the Asian market is that they don’t look quite like what we’re used to in the West.Unlike our big-wheeled, big-motored electric bicycles, Asian e-bikes often feature smaller wheels, lower power and are designed for utility above all else.Sure, we have folding e-bikes in the West. But even they can’t compare to just how much utility gets designed into domestic market Asian e-bikes, which often entirely replace cars for many people and serve as the family minivan of sorts.Case in point is our new Alibaba e-bike here. It’s a fraction of the size of a typical e-bike, and yet is designed to carry twice the number of riders.Somehow this little e-bike is designed to support up to 200 kg (440 lb) – or if the graphics are to be believed, two baby elephants.Those 12″ wheels might not look like the most comfortable option for hauling around both you and your kid, but fear not! The designers already thought about that, and made sure to install the latest in e-bike comfort technology. They figured if one shock is good, why not go with five?!So between the front fork, rear shock (which somehow becomes a mid-shock now) and the dual rear coilovers, we’ve got quintuple suspension on this e-bike.Now the design of the suspension isn’t the most elegant, mind you. The dual rear coilover shocks, which seem to be the best quality parts of the design, only support the rear kid’s seat. I guess like a true doting parent, the kids always get the best stuff.Then the entire rear of the bike, seats and all, appear to be one massive swingarm supported by that mystery middle shock. I have no idea what kind of spring that plastic tube is housing – it could be crumpled up newspaper for all I know. But the design of the entire half of the bike pivoting like a swingarm worries me that if I hit the right bump at the wrong speed, all those springs might just catapult me into low earth orbit.Putting the less-than-elegant suspension design aside for a moment, there are a number of other impressive features about this little e-bike.Not only does it come with dual-wheel disc brakes, front and rear lights and a built-in folding mechanism, but it’s also got a pretty awesome battery system.The battery is hidden away inside the seat tube, which is usually the smallest tube on a normal bike but somehow became half of the frame in this thing. It appears to be housed inside of a pleather carry bag that is accessed by lifting the seat. That’s a new one for me, and I don’t see new things very often in the e-bike industry.The e-bike even comes with foot pegs for the rear passenger, which is more than I can say for some other rear-seat Asian-style e-bikes I’ve tested out previously.As awesome as the e-bike looks, the best part is likely the price. It starts at a mere $705 with free shipping! Granted that’s for the relatively small battery option with just a 48V 8Ah battery with a mere 384 Wh of capacity. But there are options for 11Ah, 15Ah, 20Ah and even a massive 30Ah battery. That’s 1.44 kWh of capacity!With just a 400W motor and a top speed of 30 km/h (18 mph), that 30Ah battery sounds like it should last weeks. It may not look like the electric bikes we’re used to seeing in the West, but this thing has the character and spunk of a plucky underdog in an 90’s made for TV movie. It’s poised to roll into the hearts and minds of riders all over the world – as long as you don’t go hitting any pot holes too fast. Slingshot: engaged! ",ebikes
2021/11/30,"Himiway has long offered just two models of e-bikes (or technically three if you count step-over vs. step-through), but times are changing and so is the company’s electric bike lineup. The three new models also swap in several new upgrades, such as better motors and more premium brakes.The Himiway Zebra is the company’s first new model, and rolls in on fat tires with a more trail bike setup than the existing Himiway Cruiser we’ve seen before.The new e-bike includes a large 48V and 20Ah battery with 960Wh of capacity. The battery is integrated into the frame, removing the eyesore of an exposed battery.Himiway claims a range of 60-80 miles (100-130 km), which sounds a bit high from where I’m sitting. Easy-going pedal assist riding using the cadence-based pedal assist sensor might get close to that, but the throttle will surely burn though that battery much quicker. Even if the range claim is a bit lofty, that’s still a much larger battery than we see on average e-bikes in this class.The bike sports an updated motor that improves upon the hub motor in previous Himiway e-bikes with better heat resistance and is said to offer better longevity. The 750W motor puts out 86 Nm of torque, and propels the bike to a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) out of the box. Past Himiway e-bikes have been modifiable to around 50% higher speeds, but it is not yet clear if the new models will follow suit.Other improvements over past Himiway e-bikes include hydraulic disc brakes, brighter lights, improved suspension fork, and a more comfortable saddle.The bike is available in either white or black and in a step-over or step-through frame. Priced at $1,999, it looks like Himiway might be trying to compete with some higher-end electric fat tire bikes, such as the RadRover 6 Plus that have recently entered the market.Himiway’s new cargo e-bike is known as the Big Dog, though it doesn’t take the oversized longtail format we often associate with large cargo e-bikes.Instead, it looks more like a utility style e-bike with multiple large rear rack options.The electronics sound similar to the Himiway Zebra above, meaning a new 750W hubmotor, 48V 20Ah 960Wh integrated battery, and 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed. The hydraulic disc brakes, integrated lighting, and 7-speed Shimano transmission also carry over from the Zebra.The rear rack looks to sport a nice-looking wooden platform, something that has become a signature of Himiway’s past e-bikes.The Big Dog is also rated for up to 400 lb. (186 kg) of capacity, which is much larger than most electric bikes and matches some of the heaviest duty haulers.Priced at $2,099, the Big Dog is several hundred dollars more than many utility e-bikes on the market, though does offer a few nicer upgrades compared to more budget-level options.Last but not least are two full-suspension fat tire e-bikes.The Himiway Cobra uses a similar 750W hub motor, while the Cobra Pro opts instead for a Bafang M620 mid-drive motor. That mid-drive just happens to be one of the most powerful options on the market, and has been known to offer crazy performance, destroy chains, or sometimes both.Both models use four-bar rear suspension and are available in either a black/gray snakeskin that looks carbon fiber-ish, or a forest camo pattern.They include similarly large 960Wh batteries with lofty range ratings of up to 80 miles (130 km).The Cobra and Cobra Pro are both rated for up to 28 mph (45 km/h). Himiway even includes a cute little speed statement, claiming “For the U.S market, the top speed of Himiway Cobra is around 28mph without pedaling, which is absolutely legal.” Ehh, kind of. In some places. But generally you need to be using pedal assist to hit 28 mph legally, at least in Class 3 states.The Himiway Cobra will set riders back $2,399, while the high-powered mid-drive Cobra Pro carries a much heftier price of $3,999.Himiway has been beset with claims of customer service-related problems, coming at a time when many companies are dealing with similar issues. Himiway now offers a two-year warranty on the frame, battery, and non-consumable components, which is perhaps the company’s way of assuaging those fears.",ebikes
2021/11/29,"There are hundreds of models of electric bikes to choose from in the North American market across a vast price range. That can make it confusing to find the right one for you. While fancier, higher-priced e-bikes offer more features and longer-lasting parts, many riders prefer to get started with a more budget-friendly option. After testing countless e-bikes on both the higher and lower-priced end of the market, we’ve compiled the best of the budget-friendly options this year.Fortunately for value-priced electric bike shoppers, the sub-$1,000 range still includes plenty of interesting e-bikes across all categories from fat tires to city e-bikes and trail-ready electric bicycles.Since fat tires have been incredibly popular this year due to their go anywhere, do anything riding style, we’ll start there with some great fat tire e-bike options on a budget.The Lectric XP 2.0 is usually the first e-bike I recommend to someone looking for a budget model that still offers good speed and power. The throttle makes it a great bike for those who just want a speedy little motorbike, and the pedal assist functions mean you can also use it for fitness or recreation when you want to get in some real pedaling action.With a 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed and a 500W motor that really puts out closer to 800W of peak power, it’s a super fun ride. The 2.0 version was updated this year with slightly less fat tires (3″ instead of the previous 4″). That makes the bike noticeably more nimble. The update also saw added front suspension, more comfortable handlebars, better rear rack, stronger frame, and other key improvements. Plus, since the bike folds in the middle and at the handlebars, you can even fit it more easily in a car trunk or back seat to take it on a trip.The bike is normally priced at $999, but is on holiday sale right now for $949, plus the deal includes a free comfort seat upgrade, suspension seat post, upgraded headlight, and free lock.Check out my full written review of this awesome e-bike, and see the testing video below.If you want larger diameter fat tire wheels, you might want to check out Ecotric’s fat tire e-bike.I had a blast riding this one on some fire roads outside of Los Angeles, where I put its hill climbing to the test. The 500W motor isn’t the strongest I’ve tested, but it’s hard to complain too much with a price of just $799, which is actually better than the price I paid when I snagged one for $850 before its current sale.The bike gets up to 20 mph (32 km/h), which is fast enough for most riders. I tested it on both street commuting and off-road trail riding scenarios, where it performed well in both roles.There aren’t any fancy components here; it’s all budget-level stuff. But that’s to be expected at this price. As long as you don’t try jumping it 10 feet in the air, it’s likely to serve you just fine for normal, everyday riding.Check out my review of the Ecotric here, or grab it while it’s still on sale on Amazon here.While fat tire e-bikes are fun for off-roading, city-friendly e-bikes are often more useful for utility roles like commuting.There are several good road-ready options available this year that can easily fit most budgets.The $999 RadMission is one of my favorite city e-bikes. Not only does it have good parts for the price, but it’s backed by the largest and most reputable e-bike company in North America, Rad Power Bikes.They’ve landed over $300 million in funding over the last year or so, and sell more e-bikes than anyone else by a hefty margin. So if you’ve ever worried about whether or not a company will be around to offer service and support in the future, Rad puts those worries to rest.The RadMission is a single-speed electric bike, but I’ve found it’s still good for moderate hills since the 500W motor helps power you up an incline even without a lower gear. I’ve even taken it on some serious off-roading adventures and the bike has performed admirably on just about everything, only being foiled by deep sand where its street tires weren’t sufficient.Despite my off-road shenanigans though, this is still very much an on-road bike. The 20 mph (32 km/h) speed makes it good for city riding, and the ability to add any number of Rad’s accessories enables riders to modify the bike to their own needs.You can see my full review of the RadMission here, or grab it while it’s still on sale from Rad.The Ride1Up Roadster V2 is perhaps the best deal for a belt drive electric bicycle on the market right now. Unlike chains, belts are quiet, longer lasting, and never rust or need oiling. They’re a slick way to make a bike lower maintenance and make it more pleasurable to ride. But they’re also usually expensive.The Ride1Up Roadster V2 offers a belt drive at a budget price. Most models of the Roadster V2 are $995, but they have the larger frame size on sale right now for $895, which is a steal of a deal.The bike is fairly minimalist with a small display and a smallish battery, but the lack of a throttle means that its pedal assist range is still around the same as the throttle range of all the other e-bikes on this list. I’d say 25-30 miles of range is manageable, and you can go even further with a lower power setting.If you’re looking for a lightweight, stealthy electric bicycle for a modest price, this is a great option.Check out my full review or head on over to Ride1Up’s sale page.The $799 HeyBike Cityscape is another one of those city-oriented offerings that can be great for someone on a tight budget.It may not come in many colors (I hope you like black), but it still packs in good performance with speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h).Throttle-lovers will be happy to see that pedaling is optional on the Cityscape, but you can still make good use of the pedal assist whenever you want a classic cycling experience.The bike even includes fenders, lights, and the rear rack in the price, which is a rarity when you get to these low prices.Check out the current sale on Amazon, or see my video of the Cityscape below.The Ariel Rider Rideal may look like the RadMission, but it’s got a few key differences.This metro-style e-bike adds a higher power 750W motor for better acceleration and hill climbing, and it also swaps in a 6-speed Shimano transmission instead of the single-speed setup.The battery is also larger, offering around 30-40% more range. The 20 mph (32 km/h) speed is pretty much on par with all other Class 2 e-bikes, but the low-cost and high utility make this e-bike an awesome option for commuting or leisure riding.I personally prefer the mid-step frame, especially when I have something large loaded on the optional rear rack. But there is also a high-step frame if you prefer the more traditional diamond frame shape.The bike is normally priced at $999 but is now on sale for just $899, which is a rockin’ deal. Check out my full written review here, or see the video review below.I’d heard so many good things over the past year about the Hyper electric mountain bike from Walmart that I bought one to test it out myself.The only problem is that I didn’t have such a great experience myself, so this one is a mixed bag for me. It is normally priced at $598 and occasionally gets priced reduced to $398 (like right now). And so I had high hopes for this one, especially after hearing “it’s great, for the price” from so many people. But when mine arrived, it had an issue with the pedal assist sensor, and then a few other mechanical things were worrisome, like a bent brake cable housing and a seat post clamp that didn’t tighten enough.Perhaps mine just got knocked around too much during shipping, or I was just unlucky. But since so many people seem to like this one, I’m including it with the caveat that mine arrived in less than ideal condition.For what it’s worth, Walmart took it back and refunded me with no questions asked. I’ve recently bought another to give it a second try and see if mine was a lemon. Once it arrives, I’ll be excited to get to testing it.The $749 SWFT FLEET electric cruiser bike is one of the few decent electric cruiser options that won’t dent your wallet too much.It was reviewed by Electrek‘s own Mikey G, who called it a no-frills e-bike that still gets you that classic cruiser action on a budget.With a nearly 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed and a single-speed drivetrain, this is the type of bike you’d want for leisurely rides along a winding beach path or picturesque boardwalk. Check the bike out in action in the video review below.When the budget for it exists, I often recommend that new riders spend a bit more to get a better quality, longer-lasting e-bike that they’re likely to enjoy even more. But with the high prices of e-bikes, I know that’s not always possible.So hopefully this list of tested and verified e-bikes helps guide you on your way to finding a more budget-friendly option to get you rolling on your local trails or streets soon.",ebikes
2021/11/28,"Southern California electric bicycle manufacturer Luna Cycle has just released its latest high-power, high-performance electric bicycle. But don’t get your hopes up for throwing a leg over a Luna X2 anytime soon; the popular e-bike sold out almost immediately upon its unveiling.The Luna X2 follows two years after the release of the groundbreaking Luna X1 enduro e-bike and adds several key improvements.The carbon fiber X2 houses a 20% larger battery, upgraded rear suspension linkage, a new frame design, and Luna’s V2 Ludicrous controller option for extreme power.The upgraded battery nows comes in at 48V and 17.5Ah, or around 820 Wh of capacity. The battery is removable but mounted inside of the downtube for a sleek, hidden look. From a quick glance, it’s not obvious that the bike includes electric assist at all.Despite the stealthy appearance, the X2 packs in some serious assistance. That mid-drive motor down by the pedals is a Bafang M600, which is one of the most powerful and torquiest electric bike mid-drive motors on the market.Luna has modified the motor even further though, opting for its own custom controller options known as the Ludicrous controller (hmm, sounds familiar). That higher power option unleashes a full 2,500 watts of power from the unassuming motor.The torque-sensing motor can be operated by pedal assist, where it is tuned for a responsive ride. Luna claims a range of around 30-40 miles (50-65 km) when operated with moderate pedaling. Speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) are possible on pedal assist, making this a Class 3 e-bike in the US (when operated with legal power limits programmed to a max of 750W).Or owners can opt to engage the throttle, enjoying motorbike-like performance without the need to pedal. Just don’t expect to get the same range when leaning heavily on the throttle.The X2 weighs in at around 58 lb (26 kg), which would be heavy for a pedal enduro bike but is actually rather lightweight for an e-bike with this much motor power and battery capacity. Those high-performance electric drive components aren’t light, nor is the top-shelf suspension.A RockShox Debonair Yari 160mm travel front fork and RockShox Deluxe Select+ shock with 210mm of travel in the rear allow the bike to tackle just about any type of trail or off-road excursion you could throw at it. Other high-end components include an SRAM Eagle 12-speed groupset, SRAM GUIDE four-piston hydraulic disc brakes, dropper seat post with internal cable routing, MAXXIS tires, and of course that carbon fiber frame.Yes there are higher end components out there, which I’m sure the commenters will point out, but this a great setup.Priced at $4,200 before the $400 Ludicrous controller update, the Luna X2 sold out almost immediately after debuting this weekend. And with parts like these, it’s no wonder why. The X2 competes in a category populated by bikes like the Specialized Turbo Levo, which costs around 50% more.Luna has long been known for bucking industry trends, offering more power than its competitors and hitting price points that most other e-bike companies have been unable to match. The X2 is now the most recent in a long line of high performance launches for the company.",ebikes
2021/11/26,"Juiced Bikes unveiled it latest electric bicycle model, the RipRacer, earlier this month. The new e-bike model uses a compact frame and smaller diameter 20″ fat tires to create a space-conscious layout that easily fits in cars and elevators. The RipRacer, which starts at $1,399, still offers high performance for anyone looking for a peppy ride.With power and speed both synonymous with the Souther California-based e-bike company, the RipRacer was all but guaranteed to pack a punch.And with two models available, Juiced assured that it did.A Class 2 version of the bike powers up to 20 mph (32 km/h), while a Class 3 version cranks the knob further with a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).The Class 2 bike also includes a large capacity 52V 10.4Ah battery rated for 540 Wh. Juiced Bikes says that battery should be enough for around 35 miles (56 km) of range. The higher power Class 3 version has a larger 52V 15.6Ah battery with 780 Wh of capacity. That one should get closer to 55 miles (88 km) per charge. Keep in mind though that faster riding and more throttle use will likely reduce the real world range.The battery also debuts Juiced’s new battery case, which comes with a carry handle and custom holder for an Apple AirTag to help locate the battery or bike should either become…. misplaced.The batteries will also be able to dock into Juiced’s new charging dock, which should come out next year. The docking feature will serve double duty as a powerbank, as it will add AC and DC power taps to allow the battery to provide off-grid power for running other devices.We got a closer look at how that will work from Juiced’s founder and CEO Tora Harris a few weeks ago.Anyway you slice it, despite the small size of the RipRacer, it definitely still rips. Even the lower power model still pulls a peak 1,040W with a 750W continuous motor.The higher power version seems like the more fun of the two though, supplying a peak power of 1,300W thanks to its higher power controller.The bikes also include features normally found on higher-priced models, such as hydraulic disc brakes and integrated lighting.The Class 2 RipRacer is launching at just $1,399 while the Class 3 version is priced at $1,599. Those prices are likely to rise after the promotional period, so this is a deal you won’t want to drag your feet on.Also, Juiced is taking $100 off of every other model in their lineup with the code BF100, so you’ll want to check out the rest of the sales on their site too.",ebikes
2021/11/24,"Just about everyone has a memory of riding a Schwinn at some point as a kid. But the fun doesn’t have to stop, especially with the company’s line of electric bikes. Now with the launch of three new models consisting of the Schwinn Marshall, Coston CE, and Coston DX, there are even more options available.All three of the new models come in either a S/M size or a L/XL size, shirking the one-size-fits-all ideology that is common in the value e-bike space.The 7-speed e-bikes are all also available in either a traditional step-over frame or a more accessible mid-step/low-step frame.The Schwinn Marshall is the brand’s new trail-oriented electric bike. The bike rides on 2.3″x27.5″ tires and is powered by a 250W rear hub motor. Not exactly a powerhouse, but it will get you moving along at up to 20 mph (32 km/h) on either throttle or pedal assist.The 288 Wh battery is integrated into the downtube of the bike. Schwinn says you can get 35 miles (56 km) of range, though that sounds like the pedal assist-only range. Throttle-riding will presumably eat into the range more quickly.Headlights and tail lights are included, as is a novel battery light in the downtube. That battery light likely won’t do much to light your way, but it will make you much more visible to cars around you at night.The Marshall is priced at $1,499 on Amazon or at Schwinnbikes.comWhile the Marshall’s wide tires and front suspension made it a great option for light trail use, the Coston CE does double duty on the trails or road.It retains the front suspension and step-over frame option, but the mid-step option is replaced by a lower frame that offers true step-through accessibility. It also adds in a suspension seat post for a bit more cushioning on the ride.The Coston CE benefits from included fenders, which are important features for city commuters that have to deal with puddles or rain.The e-bike still gets five levels of pedal assist as well as a thumb throttle, offering speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h). It also gets the same battery and range as the Marshall.The Schwinn Coston CE is priced at $1,699 on Amazon or at Schwinnbikes.comFor riders looking for even more of an upgrade designed for true commuting, the Coston DX is likely the answer. The Coston DX adds an included rear rack and even a unique storage saddle that flips up to hold small items like your wallet, keys, or phone. You also get the suspension seat post, but the front suspension fork is replaced by rigid fork designed for more pure commuter-style riding.Another nod to its commuter design is the larger 360Wh battery, claiming up to 45 miles (72 km) of range. And yes, those cool downtube lights on the battery are still there.A capacity of 360 Wh still doesn’t approach the industry average, but these e-bikes appear to be intended for a combination of recreational riding and modest city commuting – not long-distance touring.The Coston DX still offers the same top speed as the other bikes in the line, pegging the needle at 20 mph (32 km/h).For the highest-spec offering in the lineup, riders will have to fork over $1,999 or at Schwinnbikes.comWhat do you think of Schwinn’s new e-bike lineup? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section!But before you do, take a look at the last Schwinn e-bike I tested in my video review below.",ebikes
2021/11/23,"Serial 1 provided a Mosh CTY review bike to me so I could commute from my hotel in downtown Los Angeles a mile or so south to the Los Angeles Auto Show this week. But I used it to attend the USC Football game a few miles to the south, dinners/events in various parts of the city, and just generally get around instead of Uber or renting a car. So, how’d it perform? Note: Harley/Serial 1 is having a $1000 off Black Friday sale on all of its ebikesThe Mosh is a Class 1 electric bike powered by a specially-tuned Brose motor and 529Wh battery that is connected to the rear wheel with Gates belt drive. There are no gears on this bike or gear shifters, which make the bike look extremely clean. There’s also no throttle, meaning when the bike gets near 20mph your leg cadence is getting blurry. The CTY Mosh looks like a heavy throwback to the original Harley Serial 1 line with its huge wheels, battery/motor combo, and oversized everything. But at 48lbs, the aluminum frame keeps it light while maintaining the 280lb(128kg) rider weight limit.  Serial 1 says that the e-bike will give you between 35 and 115 miles of range, which means just about anything. For what it’s worth, I drove the whole week without needing to charge and had no issues, so that 35 mile low end seems very plausible. There’s no speedometer or odometer, so all my measurements are here estimates but I rode around 45 city miles for the week and had a solid one bar out of four left. Serial 1’s overwhelming goal here is simplicity. There’s no display or gears to think about. All the wiring is internally routed. The only controls are an LED-lit power gauge up and down arrows and light switch on the left handlebar. You’ll likely stay at max assist, but there are four levels starting with no assist, which is actually nice when cruising through crowded areas like near the LA Coliseum on game day below:I’m a huge fan of internal belt-driven Brose motors because they are quiet, vibration-free, and the power curve is subtle yet torquey. My daily e-bike driver is still a Brose-driven 2017 Raleigh Redux IE, which is so smooth I often forget that I’m using an e-bike (never mind that I’m cruising 20mph up a  hill). The Mosh CTY is somehow even better with an upgraded battery and a smooth, maintenance-free Gates belt drive. The lightweight, mid-mounted Brose S MAG motor features a brushless internal rotor and produces 90Nm/66 ft. lb. torque, perfect for beating cars off the line or getting up serious hills without a granny gear. From a start and at the low end, there is nothing this bike can’t do. The motor and battery are both located at the bottom of the bike, which gives this thing a much lower center of gravity than a typical e-bike, and that’s noticeable in maneuverability and high-speed turns. It handles like a much svelter commuter. Instead of watching me ride through city streets, have a look at this guy with more skills:You’ve got huge Schwalbe Super Moto-X 27.5 x 2.8-inch road wheels combined with 27.5 x 35mm alloy rims and Sapim stainless steel spokes. Those big boy wheels are the only suspension you’ll get since this is a rigid fork/hardtail configuration. SimpliCTY!Stopping power is provided by hydraulic two-piston disc brakes front and rear and 203mm x 1.8mm rotors. Everything here is a little over spec. 180mm brakes are the standard on this sized bike, and those wheels are significantly beefier than your typical commuter.Maybe most impressive is the lighting, which isn’t just a beacon but a Roxim high beam that actually illuminates the road in front of you. If that wasn’t enough, there is an illuminated Serial 1 signature headtube light that looks dope and lets everyone know you are on something special. On the rear, you have two illuminated red lights (better than one) though they don’t act as turn signals. They do brighten when decelerating, not just when braking, and will turn into hazard lighting when the bike is on its side. Pedals? Have a look at these metal beasts. No shoes, no service hippy:Charging the 529Wh battery is very straightforward. You can charge it through the downtube on the bike or directly to the battery if you take it out and into your home or office. Charge times are 0-100% in 4.75 hours, or 0-75% in 2.6 hours. There’s the typical red charging indicator on the charger, which turns green when it is done or no longer charging. The charger is pretty big but fits into a backpack if you want to bring it along for big rides. I do wish there was a more standard charging plug option so that you could hook up a solar charger or car charger to this without an inverter. USB-C PD?I’ll get the worst part out of the way first: This e-bike isn’t for me. The Class 1, 20mph speed limit is a non-starter for me – which is a shame because I love love LOVE just about everything else about this bike. It is super easy to jump on and off of, riding is a dream, components are top shelf, and what’s not to love about accelerating as fast as cars off the line? Braking is strong and controlled (though my fresh brakes did make a little too much noise) and bright lighting makes it super safe. The huge wheels take bumps like a champ and hills are easy peasy.Other nitpicks: The lights are great but I would like to see some more reflective and bright colors here – reflective wheel sidewalls for instance would go a long way. This thing is basically a matte black stealth bike that avoids detection which is great for sneaking around but also cars can’t see you. Also the brakes and the coasting clicks are quite loud. The price at $3800 is kinda steep but at the $1000 off Black Friday price is easily justifiable with this quality of build and components. And of course, right when the ride is about to get interesting, I’d start jonesing for more speed and more power. There’s no gear to move you beyond 20mph, and even if you can get the pedaling up that high, the motor stops assisting you.I’m fully aware that my suburban drives and need for 28mph speed aren’t every use case. For city dwellers or those content below 20mph, this is going to be an incredible bike option. This bike is so much fun, and I felt like a man among men until 20mph. In a perfect world, I would absolutely upgrade to the Class 3 Rush CTY Speed with an upgraded 706Wh battery and Enviolo AUTOMATiQ intelligent auto-shifting CVT hub. I can’t imagine what I’d have to complain about with that bike. ",ebikes
2021/11/22,"Ariel Rider has proven time and again that it knows exactly how to build fast, powerful electric mopeds that push e-bike performance to entirely new levels. And the Grizzly 52V dual motor e-bike is yet another great example of the brand’s dedication to high-performance bikes that combine light electric motorcycle specs with e-bike parts for a line-blurring ride.If you recall the high-performance Ariel Rider X -Class 52V e-bike that we reviewed earlier this year, then much of the Grizzly will seem familiar.It retains the high speeds and dual-suspension setup, but improves upon those parts while also adding a second motor, second battery, and a more relaxed ride position.The result is basically a small electric motorcycle. Yet because the Grizzly uses bicycle parts (including functional pedals) and can be limited to street-legal power and speed levels (and in fact ships locked in 20 mph mode), it qualifies as an electric bicycle for on-road use without a motorcycle license.Of course that means you can’t unlock the true potential until you’re off-road, but it’s worth the wait.Check out my video review of the Ariel Rider Grizzly below, then keep scrolling for my complete review of this powerhouse e-bike.The Ariel Rider Grizzly is a powerful e-bike, make no mistake. The dual 1,000W motors are rated for a peak output of 1,850W each for a total of 3,700W combined.The motors are not quiet, mind you. They use steel gears internally instead of the typical nylon gears. That helps them provide that power over many years without tearing themselves apart, but it also means you get a constant whirring sound from the motors. It doesn’t bother me, though, as it fits the ride. This bike is visually loud, so it might as well announce its presence as well.A selector switch on the handlebars lets you choose between front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. I generally leave it in all-wheel drive, but flicking it to rear-wheel drive is a good way to drop the power if you ride through a wet spot or know you’re coming up on a patch of sand. Or if you just don’t want to do dual-wheel burnouts after each stop sign.To hit the top speed of the mid 30’s of mph, you’ll need to unlock the bike from its factory settings. That also means it will no longer be street legal in areas that limit e-bikes to Class 1, 2, or 3 performance (i.e. most places). So keep that in mind if you want to go through the unlocking procedure.Even if you don’t unlock it to the “off-road only modes” and instead you stick to 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle or 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist, the extreme power of dual motors still has the added benefit of impressive hill climbing and quick acceleration.To supply those two hungry motors, you also get two giant batteries. Between the pair of them are 1,820 Wh of capacity. That’s enough for up to 75 miles (120 km) of range, which in technical terms is “more than enough.” If you’re riding off-road, or just going fast on the pavement, you won’t get nearly that much range. But just shy of 2 kWh on an e-bike is plenty for nearly everyone. And if you’re wondering where the $3,099 price comes from, the dual batteries and dual motors bear much of the responsibility.The bike also comes with two chargers so you can charge both batteries at the same time. I’ve seen dual battery e-bikes come with a single charger, which can be annoying to switch back and forth between batteries. Dual-chargers cost the company a bit more, but it’s the way to go for anyone who uses their e-bike often and wants to be back on the road quickly.Technically this is an electric bicycle and so technically it has bike parts. The dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, seven-speed Shimano shifter, and KMC chain are all typical bike parts, though I can tell you that you’re unlikely to get much real-world use out of the last two. The bike pedals just fine, but it’s so much fun on throttle-only operation that many people are just going to treat it like a motorcycle with eccentric footrests.Speaking of footrests, it even has pegs for a passenger. If you want to carry a friend with you, which the powerful motors absolutely make possible, you’ll want to upgrade to the two-person seat. Without it, there’s room left on the rear rack for a cargo box or rack.The only other bike-like parts left are likely the 4″ CST tires, which work great both on and off-road. After those, we’re back to quasi-motorcycle parts. The front fork is an inverted hydraulic specimen designed to fit those giant tires. The rear suspension consists of a pair of coilover shocks that are definitely more moped than bike. And both the front and rear suspension are adjustable to dial them in for your weight and ride style.Speaking of weight, this isn’t a lightweight e-bike. At 105 lb (47 kg), it’s one of the heaviest I’ve ever ridden. It weighs right up there with other moped-style e-bikes like the Juiced HyperScorpion.Don’t expect to load this into a truck by yourself without throwing out your back – it’s a team carry situation.But even though the weight limits its portability, it has the opposite effect on the road. The bike feels solid and planted, more like a vehicle than a bicycle. I ride a scooter-style moped as my daily driver and it gives me more of that feeling, like I’m on a motor vehicle and not a commuter e-bike.That’s really where the value in the Grizzly rests: as a solid, powerful e-bike that serves a nearly motorcycle role on the street and a dirtbike role on the trail.As an urban transport vehicle, the bike is powerful enough to climb hills, haul gear, keep up with traffic, and ride all day without fear of running out of battery.As a trail warrior, it fills the role of a fat tire adventure bike with the suspension and handling to turn an abandoned lot or empty rock quarry into the best playground ever. What I wouldn’t recommend doing is making enemies in the bike lane with a monster like the Grizzly here. Yes, it’s legally an electric bicycle (in the US). And yes, you can definitely ride it in the bike lane (I did). But that also requires some serious self-control. When you’re around other cyclists, you have to tame yourself and ride with the speed of traffic. When you’re out with the real traffic and mixing it up with cars, that’s when the full power and speed of the bike can really come alive, assuming you’re into that.Just like with masked superheroes, with great power comes great responsibility. Just because a minivan can do 90 mph with the pedal to the floor doesn’t mean it should be driven that way all the time. And just like a powerful e-bike can exceed the speed limit with the throttle pinned doesn’t mean it always should. Riding safely and respecting everyone around you (and your local laws) is always the way to go.Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some more riding to do!",ebikes
2021/11/21,"It’s been a while since I had a genuine belly laugh from a supposedly-comical brand marketing video. But Harley-Davidson’s “e-bike guru” did just that as it poked and prodded its way through cycling culture stereotypes on its way to landing a surprisingly relatable message about simply enjoying riding.Part of that success might be because it wasn’t really a Harley-Davidson production, but rather came to us via Serial 1, an H-D spinoff company that builds premium electric bicycles.If Harley is a hundred year old, slow-moving corporate machine, then Serial 1 is its spunky, nimble startup love child. No chrome, no throttles, just electric motor-assisted pedaling.Serial 1 teamed up with Allies & Co and Bash, a production and film team, to create the “eBike Guru”, a comical short that explores how a new e-bike owner might be tempted to fall into the trap of stereotypical cycling culture.The short follows Greg as he receives a new e-bike and quickly turns into a cycling snob, much to the ire of his exasperated wife Kathy.Once Kathy has enough of Greg’s antics, she calls the e-bike’s help line and is put through to a special line for the “eBike Guru” to solve Greg’s problem.I won’t give anything away. The video is only 8 minutes long and is worth a watch. Let’s be real – it’s Sunday and you’re not doing anything better.Serial 1 definitely came out of left field when it launched barely a year ago. Brand Manager for Serial Aaron Frank explained how the company’s status as outsiders in the industry meant that they had to look for clever ways to get their message out.“The eBike market is crowded and chaotic, and a content piece like this is one way to stand out. We wanted to have a little fun and to take advantage of our status as outsiders in the cycling industry to make some humorous content that could only come from Serial 1. At the same time, many of our mainstream customers are not cyclists and don’t understand that riding a bike isn’t all about suffering. eBikes are the best way to be active, have fun, and explore your world on two wheels.”  It’s not the first time Serial 1 has had a bit of fun in front of the camera.A few weeks ago the brand created a one-off e-bike that looked strikingly similar to the BMX bike from a certain hit Steven Spielberg classic. The beautiful e-bike creation was auctioned off for charity, but not before Serial 1 had the chance to film an epic video with it.(Again, we’re talking less than 90 seconds here. Worth it.)It may not be conventional, but it’s working. ",ebikes
2021/11/20,"Electric bicycles and electric motorcycles may be getting significantly more affordable in the US after tax credits for both advance closer towards becoming law.Both electric bicycles and electric motorcycles received generous tax credit proposals in the Build Back Better Act, which was passed by the US House of Representatives on Friday morning.While tax credits for electric cars and EV batteries have gained much of the headlines, electric bikes and motorcycles weren’t left out of the bill.Electric motorcycles already receive a 10% federal tax credit, but that figure was tripled to 30% in the new bill, according to the Washington Post.The credit was capped at a maximum of $7,500, and will apply to electric motorcycles that meet certain minimum requirements. To qualify, the electric motorcycles need to have at least 2.5 kWh of battery and travel at speeds of at least 45 mph (72 km/h).They must also be designed primarily for road usage, meaning electric dirt bikes likely won’t qualify.Most electric motorcycles exceed both of those figures, though mini electric motorcycles may fall under the minimum requirements.A new wave of lightweight electric motorcycles such as the SONDORS Metacycle and Kollter ES1, both priced at between $5,000-$6,000, would likely qualify and see their prices reduced by more than $1,500.Electric scooters such as the NIU NQi GT may just slip into the qualified vehicles list with maximum speeds listed at 45 mph (72 km/h).Both two and three-wheeled electric vehicles are covered under the bill, meaning vehicles such as the three-wheeled Arcimoto FUV (seen in my test riding review video below) may also qualify for up to $7,500 in tax credits.Electric bicycles received their first-ever nod from the federal government in the form of a 30% tax credit of their own. The tax credit is capped at a maximum of $900, and would only apply to electric bicycles priced under $4,000 (which includes a wide selection of quality e-bikes, but rules out some of the most expensive options).While several models of e-bikes can be found for under $1,000, most popular e-bikes cost several thousand dollars.The inclusion of electric bicycles in the federal electric vehicle tax credits comes after extensive support and lobbying from the public and groups like PeopleForBikes.As PeopleForBikes President and CEO Jenn Dice explained:“The House’s latest vote on the Build Back Better (BBB) Act embraces bicycles as part of a climate solution thanks to new financial incentives for bikes and e-bikes and grants for climate and equity focused infrastructure improvements. We urge the Senate to take up the BBB before the end of the year so we can get to work on lowering transportation emissions while keeping all people, no matter how they travel or where they live, moving.”Now the bill heads to the Senate, where it faces a tough battle and will require the support of all 50 Democrats if it hopes to pass. Without any Republican support for the bill, even a single defection from the Democrats could prevent its passage. [Update: This article previously stated a maximum e-bike tax credit of $1,500, though that appears to have been lowered to $900 before the passage of the bill.",ebikes
2021/11/19,"I love riding electric bikes in part because of how many different uses they offer. I enjoy riding the trails or cruising the beach as much as the next guy, but e-bikes offer so much more than just fitness or recreational riding. Any day I can replace a car trip with an e-bike is a good day, and electric cargo bikes like the Blix Packa Genie I’ve been riding offer some of the best utility out there for true-errand running and people-moving.Unless you’re planning on getting a four-wheeled electric bike-car, then a two-wheeled electric cargo bike probably offers the best cargo capacity. Plus there’s the added bonus that it remains easily street parkable, just like a normal bike (albeit slightly longer).Blix recently updated its Packa cargo e-bike, giving it more utility than ever. And now with the new dual battery option, it offers some of the best range out there.To see it in action doing double duty as a cargo-hauler and people-mover, check out my video review below. Then keep scrolling for pictures and my complete thoughts on the bike.One of the first things I noticed about the Packa was that it wasn’t only a cargo e-bike, it was actually a good-looking e-bike too.That’s not a given in the world of longtail cargo e-bikes, where proportions get stretched and aesthetics are often sacrificed.But Blix Bikes is known for their elegant and classy Dutch-styled e-bikes, and so the company managed to put those skills to use and maintain an actually good-looking cargo bike.But what good is appearance if it doesn’t work well. Fortunately, Blix is coming in hot with great performance to boot.The 750W motor is surprisingly strong. Blix says that despite the 750W nominal rating, it really pulls up to 1,350W of peak watts. That probably explains why it gives that kick-in-the-seat-of-the-pants feeling.Many cargo e-bikes feel sluggish due to the extra weight, but the Packa here has an almost hot-rod feel to it. When you twist that throttle, the torque kicks in immediately and it really flies off the line. Considering it is designed to carry heavy loads, that’s exactly what I want in a cargo bike. The 24″ wheels are a bit smaller than typical 26″ wheels and help increase the torque with a favorable gear ratio, which likely contributes to the extra boost off the line. They also keep the weight in the cargo baskets from sitting too high and feeling unstable. Many cargo bikes have gone to even smaller 22″ or even 20″ tires, leaving 24″ tires like these as some of the bigger tires left in this type of e-bike.This is a class 2 e-bike and that means it tops out at 20 mph (32 km/h). While I usually enjoy having more speed at my disposal, cargo bikes are one of those times where 20 mph feels plenty fast to me – especially when they are loaded down with weight or passengers.So between the quick accelerations and the 20 mph top speed, the performance feels great to me. But there’s more to the equation than just how much go-power the bike has. Stopping is just as important (or arguably more important, depending on who you ask). A pair of powerful hydraulic disc brakes bring the Packa to a stop quickly and confidently.I’ve ridden electric cargo bikes with poor brakes before, and it’s not a confident feeling to grab the levers only to feel your momentum slooowly bleeding off. The Blix Packa Genie’s brakes are exactly what I’m looking for – crisp, quick, and controlled.The real star of the show here is just how much range you get when you opt for two batteries. The bike comes with either a single or double 614 Wh battery. A single pack is good for 40 miles (64 km) while the double battery option with 1,228 Wh offers 80 miles (129 km) of range. Now that’s the pedal assist range, and going throttle-only will probably net you closer to 25 or 50 miles (40 or 80 km) on the single or dual battery models respectively. But with my mixed riding of pedal assist and throttle action, I fell somewhere in the middle of that range.The downside to two batteries is that they make the bike pricier, though surprisingly not by much. The second battery is only a $300 increase. I say “only” because, despite $300 being a lot of money, it’s actually much less than it would cost to buy a 614 Wh battery at retail. So they definitely don’t gouge you on the second battery option.Enough about the bike’s performance though, let’s talk shop. Cargo e-bikes are all about cargo options, and the Packa Genie has plenty.I swapped the front nameplate out for a front cargo basket, while on the rear I installed the kid carrier and padded seats. The front basket was great for smaller boxes and backpack-sized cargo. The rear kid carrier can be used for cargo (as long as it’s big enough to not fall through the leg area, and a cheap cargo net might be a good accessory to add when not doing kid-hauling), but it obviously excels at its true purpose – kid carrying. I lugged my nephews all over the place and we turned that bike into the local kiddo taxi. The rails around the back gave them something secure to hold onto, though I definitely should have gotten the running boards so that they had somewhere to put their feet. But fortunately kids are adaptable and they just put their feet on the frame. I told them not to put their feet in the spokes, as my sister would be very angry if I returned them without toes. Though on the bright side, at least it would take them longer to grow out of their shoes.If Blix wants to add a clear shield for kid feet though, I wouldn’t be opposed to its inclusion as a safety feature.One other thing that struck me as I got to know the bike was just all the little extra touches and fine details that Blix added.The steering stabilizer and giant double kickstand made parking a breeze.The paint was very nicely applied and definitely looks better than the typical rush-job paint applications we see in this price range.The adjustable stem allows riders to dial in the height and reach of the handlebars to fit various body sizes.Even the bell was creatively mounted on the hydraulic brake lever’s oil reservoir instead of taking up extra space on the handlebars.And speaking of those handlebars, check out the nicely wrapped wires and cables that make everything look classier and buttoned up. That’s not entirely unique to Blix – we see it every now and again – but its a rarity that really stands out.When you see so many different e-bikes all the time, it’s the attention to detail and little extras that start to really make a difference between the models.As I mentioned, electric cargo bikes seem like the best car replacement option to me since they can do so much.The Packa is still normal-sized enough that I can treat it like a typical bike. It’s not gigantic, though it is bigger than a traditional city e-bike. But that doesn’t stop me from using it as personal transportation to run to the coffee shop or perform a normal commute on.At the same time, it’s got all that added utility with front and rear cargo space. I can literally do more than a week’s worth of grocery shopping on it, though that might be less than a week depending on how big your family is.And it looks great, to boot!Priced at $1,999, it’s a bit more than a typical starter e-bike in the $1,300-$1,600 range, but it also offers more. It’s well built, attractive, powerful, and has plenty of range. A couple thousand bucks is a serious investment, but if it prevents you from having to buy a second family car, that could be some serious savings instead. My wife and I are a one-car family precisely because we use two-wheelers so much of the time. So while it might not work for everyone, I’m living proof that a high-utility e-bike really can replace a car in many cases.I’m pretty jazzed about the Packa Genie, but let’s hear what you think.

2021/11/18,"Electric bikes. They’re two-wheeled electric vehicles that outsell electric cars handily and are a much more affordable way for many commuters to begin replacing gas-driven miles with a cleaner alternative.So why aren’t they a bigger part of the discussion on sustainable transportation alternatives?For those that haven’t had the pleasure of learning about these fun electric two-wheelers, e-bikes are basically normal pedal bikes with the addition of a battery and an electric assist motor.Sometimes it’s a low-power motor designed to help cyclists climb a hill easier, reduce the effort required to get to work, or lengthen a fitness ride for longer outings. Other times, it’s a higher power motor complete with hand throttle like a motorbike that can actually replace the need to pedal altogether and function more like an electric moped.And then there are all sorts of specialty electric bicycles, like folding models for taking on the subway or cargo models for carrying groceries or kids.Basically, it’s a vastly diverse industry with something for everyone. The common thread is that they all share electric motors and they all can be used to replace car miles – especially gas-powered car miles.These aren’t some new-fangled idea or an obscure hobby for those in the know. Electric bicycles are selling like hotcakes – and they have been for years.Even in the US where the public has been slower to catch on to e-bikes, new electric bicycle companies have reached over a hundred thousand sales in just two years. The more established electric bicycle companies in the US are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in funding as investors awaken to the huge surge in e-bike adoption.In Europe, electric bicycles are even more common and are actually projected to outsell cars by the middle of this decade. Not just outsell electric cars. All cars.And Asia is already years ahead of Europe in terms of e-bike adoption, where it is common for families to forgo a car altogether in favor of an electric bike.But as effective as e-bikes are when it comes to transportation alternatives, they still seem to get looked over in favor of pricey electric cars – especially when it comes to public policy. That’s not to say electric cars aren’t an important part of the equation. Americans commute by car far more than any other vehicle. Replacing gas-powered cars with electric cars is thus an important part of reducing emissions that lead directly to climate change.But not everyone has tens of thousands of dollars for a new electric car. Even with tax credits, buying a new car isn’t always the most sustainable solution. Electric bicycles, on the other hand, can often be purchased new for well under $2,000, and many good options even exist for less than $1,000. Even the fancy ones from high-end manufacturers usually cost between $3,500-$6,000 (or as my commenters often like to put it, “the price of a used Nissan Leaf”).When it comes to legislation supporting investment in sustainable transportation, affordable e-bikes frequently get passed over in favor of electric cars and flashier projects.When they do get funding, they’re often looked at in terms of specialty alternatives. Even the New York Times relegated electric bikes to “niche items” recently. As the CEO of North America’s leading electric bicycle company Rad Power Bikes Mike Radenbaugh pointed out on Twitter, there’s nothing niche about the best-selling electric vehicles.He explained that his company’s electric bikes alone have replaced 338,000,000 miles. And consider that they only represent an estimated quarter of the US e-bike market.Far beyond a “niche” industry, ebikes are the fastest growing & most energy efficient EV. Rad riders alone replaced 338 million car miles. Incentivizing people to step out of their cars & try ebikes is critical to cutting emissions at scale, improving health & quality of life. https://t.co/wzHOCBYaATTimes may be changing though. This year sees the best chance yet that e-bike tax credit legislation will pass in Congress to give Americans a credit of up to $1,500 on a new e-bike purchase.And electric bicycle sales continue to skyrocket in the US, even without any financial incentives from the government.For the many commuters out there eyeing an electric vehicle to replace their gas-driven miles but struggling with the high cost of electric cars, the answer might be surprising. And smaller. And have just two wheels.While not everyone can replace a car entirely with an electric bicycle, many local trips don’t require a several thousand pound vehicle. Running errands or meeting friends at the local coffee shop might just be quicker, easier, and far more energy-efficient if performed on an electric bicycle. For those that can replace a car with an e-bike, or perhaps replace a second car to become a one car and one e-bike household, the financial benefits can be staggering. One San Francisco woman found that she saved $50,000 over seven years by swapping her car for an e-bike.So while electric cars are an important part of the equation, lighter personal electric vehicles like e-bikes, e-scooters, and even e-motorcycles are just as important. And maybe even more so.",ebikes
2021/11/16,"When Lectric eBikes first unveiled the Lectric XP folding fat tire electric bike back in the summer of 2019, they rolled out into a crowded market full of new startups. But something about the e-bike struck a chord with consumers and catapulted the company to near-instant success.Now in just over two years, Lectric eBikes’ two founders Levi Conlow and Robby Deziel are celebrating an unprecedented growth rate. Just announced today, this is the fastest that any US-based electric bicycle company has reached the 100,000 e-bike milestone. It comes at a time when the entire electric bicycle market is seeing record sales, but few companies have seen such quick growth immediately after launching.While other dominant players in the market like Rad Power Bikes may sell more e-bikes annually, the kind of rapid growth displayed by Lectric eBikes is unprecedented for an e-bike startup.A big part of the young brand’s success likely stems from its price point and design ethos. Instead of targeting the higher end of the market, they left that to the several thousand dollar e-bikes of companies like Trek, Giant, and Specialized. Instead, the Lectric XP rolled out as an $899 folding fat tire e-bike that was priced perfectly to become the first e-bike for tens of thousands of new riders.It was never positioned as the most technologically advanced or highly engineered e-bike, but the bike still offered excellent high-speed performance and a “good enough” design style that was intended to get butts on seats. No fancy features – just a solid (if also a bit heavy) fat tire bike designed to be simple to use and maintain.The foldable setup of the e-bike also helped draw in markets that hadn’t yet widely embraced electric bikes, gaining significant attention from communities around RVs, boating, and even light aviation.Starting in 2019 with just 10 prototype e-bikes sent out to media reviewers, Lectric eBikes began with word-of-mouth marketing that helped the brand’s message spread like wildfire. Three weeks later, the company had reached its first $1 million in sales.Now just two and a half years after starting in their garage, the company has sold over 100,000 e-bikes and expects to reach the next 100,000 even quicker.As CEO Levi Conlow explained:“It took exactly 30 months to get 100,000 e-bikes in circulation. We project it will take less than nine months to sell the next 100,000 e-bikes. What I’m most excited about is the one million mark to follow. That’s a bold forecast but I truly obsess over the snowball effect: every time we ship an e-bike, it goes to work for us. Our customers are the real catalyst for our growth: they buy one e-bike, fall in love with it, purchase another for their spouse, and then both riders tell their friends about their incredible new ride.”Parlaying the original bike’s success, Lectric eBikes followed up with a step-through version of the e-bike and then an entirely reworked edition of the e-bike called the Lectric XP 2.0.We recently reviewed that e-bike and experienced first hand all of the new upgrades (check out the review video below).From more nimble tires and wider handlebars to a more robust frame and even cargo-carrying options, the Lectric XP 2.0 expanded upon the bike’s performance and utility. It can reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) and now includes suspension and a comfort package to make those miles fly by even more comfortably and enjoyably.With the upgrades came a new higher price of $999 – a modest increase from the original low cost –but a Black Friday sale is currently going on all month. Riders can get the bike for just $949 with an included bundle of accessories such as a lock, upgraded saddle, and suspension seat post combo, and a higher-spec headlight. As the entire e-bike industry continues to demonstrate strong growth and the federal government even considers potential tax credits for electric bikes, these types of success stories may become more common in the coming years.Suffice it to say that electric bicycle adoption rates have clearly demonstrated that the public is embracing this fun and efficient form of alternative transportation.",ebikes
2021/11/15,"Ever since I began riding electric bikes from Ride1Up back in 2018, I’ve found that the company does two things very well. First, it makes classic-looking e-bikes that perform even better than they look. And secondly, it does so for a price that leaves me scratching my head wondering how they can sell it for that little. The Ride1Up 700 Series is a perfect example on both counts. Right out of the box, this urban-assault commuter e-bike has everything a rider needs for a potent city e-bike.Perhaps most importantly of all, it’s got the speed and power to hang with the cars on the road.While I don’t mind a Class 2 e-bike, I often feel like I hit a wall at 20 mph (32 km/h) when the motor assist cuts out. The Ride1Up 700 Series is a Class 3 e-bike and thus can send me right up to 28 mph (45 km/h), as long as I give it some honest pedal-assist above Class 2 speeds.While that rear hub motor may claim a continuous rating of just 500W, it is paired with a 22A controller and 48V battery to provide just over 1,000W of peak power draw. That results in powerful acceleration, whether you’re relying on the throttle or going halfsies with the pedal assist.Before I dive too deep into this review, be sure to check out my testing video below. There you’ll see me putting the Ride1Up 700 Series through some real-world commuting-style riding. Then read on for the rest of my thoughts!I always get a bit annoyed when I see e-bikes that are obviously designed for city riding but don’t include important city-specific accessories like lights, fenders, or racks. I know there’s an argument to be made that not everyone needs the last two (though the belief that all e-bikes should come with included lighting is a hill I’m prepared to die on). But fenders and racks are so useful that I believe they are basically required equipment for commuter e-bikes. Even if you live in a low rain area, the occasional puddle from irrigation or the errant hose can still leave you with unexpected tire spray. And even when I’m backpacking it instead of loading gear onto a rear rack, the fact that it is there often helps keep my bag from hanging down close the wheel.In the case of the Ride1Up 700 Series, this e-bike offers the trifecta. Bright lights, high-quality hardened alloy fenders, and a pannier-ready rear rack that is rated for a robust 50 lb (23 kg).In addition to those three key accessories that come as standard equipment, other commuter-friendly components include the Schwalbe SUPER MOTO X 27.5 x 2.4 tires (one of my favorite on-road tires), powerful dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, and a Shimano Acera derailleur on an eight-speed cassette.Are there better transmissions than the Acera? Yes. But is it good enough for 95% of us.And between those big Schwalbe tires and the 100mm of travel in the front fork (complete with hydraulic lockout), the ride is urban jungle-ready. Potholes and curbs sometimes simply have to be taken head-on, so big tires and bigger suspension are a godsend in those cases. There’s no rear suspension on the Ride1Up 700 Series, as that would be a big ask for a commuter bike (though not unheard of). But at least the Selle Royal gel saddle adds a bit more comfort in the rear.I’m pretty jazzed about the commuter loadout here, though there is, of course, room for improvement. The cadence sensor is fine, but I got spoiled by the nicer torque sensor on the Ride1Up LTM’D. If they had included a torque sensor on the 700 Series, that would have been sweet! Though considering the bike is priced at $1,695 and includes accessories like lights, fenders, and a rack as standard equipment, I can see how a torque sensor didn’t make it into the budget on this one.And what’s with that left side throttle? Call me old-fashioned, but I much prefer a right-side throttle. I know the trigger shifter means you can’t have a thumb throttle on the right side, but why not go with a half-twist throttle? Not only is it my favorite style, but it also happens to be the best style as well (according to me). So the bike is well-spec’d, sure. But what about the electronics?Ride1Up pretty much nailed it there too. The powerful motor and fast top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) combine to give confidence-inspiring performance. I have no qualms about taking the lane in a city scenario, since I know I have the power to back it up. But when the traffic gets tight, I can easily slide back into the bicycle lane and be a cyclist (traveling at reasonable speeds based on the scenario, of course).And the 48V 14Ah battery offers sufficient range, though I can’t say it’s the largest battery I’ve seen. With 674 Wh of capacity, the battery is rated for between 30-50 miles of range. The standard disclaimer of “you’ll only get the max range on the lowest pedal assist setting” certainly applies here, and you should know that getting throttle happy really eats into your range. But few commutes are going to be longer than 30 miles – and the ones that are rarely get performed by bicycle anyways. So the battery seems sufficient for the role.The fact that the battery is also integrated into the frame is another plus for the Ride1Up 700 Series. Not only does it look slick, but it also helps cut down on theft, being much harder to steal. It’s those little details that all seem to add up on this e-bike: The nicely designed and integrated components, the beautiful cable management to prevent a rat’s nest of wires on the bars, the color LCD screen, the gel saddle. The little extra pieces here and there go above and beyond what we typically see in this mid-level price range for e-bikes.At $1,695, you really get a lot for your money here. At this price, it’s a great deal for a fast, powerful road-ready bike with all of the necessary commuting equipment.The small complaints I had were few and far between. Ride1Up did an excellent job with the design and execution of the 700 Series, and it shows.",ebikes
2021/11/14,"Last week the San Diego-based electric bicycle company Juiced Bikes unveiled its newest e-bike, the RipRacer. The bike features a smaller frame and 20″ wheels, making it ideal for smaller riders and city dwellers that want an elevator-friendly, space-conscious ride.Juiced Bikes’ founder and CEO Tora Harris gave us a closer look at the new e-bike in a video released on the company’s YouTube channel.In the video, Tora showed off a 90% complete production prototype of the new RipRacer e-bike. The prototype has minor cosmetic differences from the production vehicle, which is expected to roll out early next year.In the first up close look at the bike, Tora showed off the ‘fun-sized’ design along with the inspiration behind it.As he explained:“First of all, you’re going to notice that the bike is on a BMX-style platform with 20-in tires. And they’re 4-in wide tires, so they’re super fat. It really works with this form factor bike, making the bike really fun to ride.”The bike is shown off fitting into small elevators without having to lift one end of the bike up.While the bike is certainly smaller than most fat tire e-bikes, that doesn’t mean it precludes adult riders. The company says the RipRacer should fit riders from 5’0″ to 6’3″ (152 to 190 cm).We also got a first look at Juiced’s new G2 battery pack. The second-generation 52V battery comes with a number of upgrades over the traditional battery back used across Juiced’s e-bikes.A carry handle was added on top of the battery, which will be useful for carrying the high-capacity batteries. The battery demonstrated in the video was Juiced’s 52V 15.6Ah battery configuration with 811 Wh of capacity, but the company also offers batteries up to nearly 1,000 Wh. Those dense battery packs can benefit from a carry handle to ease the process of lugging them around when they’re off the bike.The fuse cover on the back of the battery is now hidden, and the waterproofing of the entire battery has been upgraded to an IP65 rating. That means riders won’t have to worry about the battery if they get caught in a rainstorm on the way home.The battery also has a built-in apple AirTag compartment to help track the bike and/or the battery if it happens to become separated from its owner.The power button on the battery has been relocated to the bottom of the battery where it locks against the bike. Tora explained that this adds another layer of security, since you can’t turn the bike on without being able to remove the battery to reach the button.The video also gives us our first look at Juiced’s upcoming charging dock. The rather large device not only charges the batteries but also adds ports for power output when off the grid. This includes up to 500W of AC power from a pair of 110V outlets and DC power via USB for charging phones, tablets, and other electronics. We’ve explored battery-powered generators before for outdoor power use, but they often cost $1,000 or more. With a device like this, your large-capacity e-bike battery could serve dual duty as a backup battery or power source for camping and other outdoor activities.Next, Tora showed off the motor, which is a 750W rear geared hub motor. The bike in the video is the Class 3 version (up to 28 mph or 45 km/h), though a Class 2 version (20 mph or 32 km/h) is also available. In the Class 3 version, the controller is limited to 25A, meaning the 750W motor actually pulls closer to 1,300 watts of peak power.The new motor uses an updated wire connection, meaning it is easier to disconnect and service in the future.The bike also features better braking, as Tora continued:“With the high power and speed of this bike, we also include hydraulic disc brakes. It’s very important that we have very powerful brakes for safety. So you get a lot more power, a lot more control, and also less maintenance.”The bike is also designed to be comfortable to pedal, even with its single-speed transmission. The rear cog is a 12t, while the front chainring uses a 52t setup. That results in a higher gear ratio to prevent your feet from spinning like a food processor at higher speeds.Single-speed electric bikes have actually become increasingly common. Many riders leave their e-bikes in the highest gear all the time, as the inclusion of pedal-assist means less time is spent accelerating to higher speeds.Tora also showed off the accessory mounts and explained that the bike is designed to be an accessory platform. The top tube features four bottle bosses that function as hardpoints for mounting frame bags or carriers. The headtube of the frame has a mounting plate for a front rack or basket, and the rear dropouts sport a large M8 threaded receiver for a heavy-duty rear rack.While many e-bikes skip the built-in lighting in favor of charging for accessory lighting, the base RipRacer comes with bright lighting, including a 1,000-lumen headlight. The tail light has an always-on function as well as a brake light function.The seat is also custom designed and includes a grab handle to help maneuver the bike.The bike was also designed to be easy to service, as Tora explained.“Another thing that is very important is serviceability. So we made this bike very easy to get to the motor, very easy to get to the controller and the wiring harness. We don’t have any cables moving through the frame, which would make it hard to service.”While that may be true, there’s also some spin there as well. Several years ago, e-bikes began featuring internal wire and cable routing to create a sleeker, cleaner look without a rat’s nest of cables.  Once hydraulic brakes became more popular on e-bikes though, manufacturers quickly learned that if the brakes ever needed work, it was a headache to pull and then re-bleed the lines. The same goes for replacing electrical wires, which are harder to service when routed through the frame tubes.In Juiced’s case, the RipRacer features a wire channel on the underside of the downtube that includes a wire cover to retain a clean look that mimics internally-routed cables. The wires appear to be hidden in the frame tube, but are actually just concealed along the bottom of the tube. It’s the same approach that Rad Power Bikes implemented when it unveiled the new RadRover 6 Plus earlier this summer.The Juiced RipRacer will go on sale starting Nov 26th, starting at $1,399 for the Class 2 version. The higher power and higher speed Class 3 version will be priced at $1,599. Both of those are promotional prices, and the final prices of the bikes are expected to rise after the holiday season.Deliveries should begin in March, just in time to prepare for riding season in much of the US.",ebikes
2021/11/12,"Remember the good old days of your childhood, yanking your siblings around in a little red wagon or racing it down the hill like a rocket ship? I definitely do, and so when the original little red wagon company Radio Flyer announced that they were getting into electric bicycles earlier this summer, I was hot to trot for a test ride. Now that I’ve spent several days testing the Flyer M880 midtail cargo e-bike, here are my thoughts on this interesting new addition to the e-bike landscape.First off all, what’s a midtail cargo e-bike? Most cargo e-bikes we think of are known as longtails, meaning they have that stretched rear and long bench on back. That’s great for carrying a couple passengers or bulky cargo, but it also changes the ride characteristics. Midtails have dimensions much closer to a typical “normal” bicycle, but usually still have elongated rear racks for carrying more cargo than your standard city bike.In the case of the Flyer M880, the rack is actually part of the frame itself. Combined with the ability to install a front basket as well, it offers plenty of cargo storage on both ends.To see the e-bike in action (and to check out some fun little red wagon towing scenes), take a look at my review video below. Then keep reading for the complete written review!The Flyer M880 may be called a midtail cargo bike, but it rides much more like a typical e-bike. It’s not small, mind you. But it still doesn’t feel as large as it is. The 3″ balloon tires are a nice compromise between more nimble 2″ tires and more ridiculous 4″ fat tires. This size is quickly becoming a popular choice in the e-bike industry for its combination of comfort and convenience.There’s no front suspension on the bike, but the big tires help smooth out the terrain in front of you. And this is very much an on-road bike anyway, so I don’t think Radio Flyer is expecting anyone to hit the trails. A smooth, mulch-strewn nature trail may be in the cards, but nothing crazy. Instead, these tires are designed to roll smoothly over bricks, pavers, cobblestones and other urban obstacles. Don’t let the bike’s “normal feeling” ride fool you though, there’s definitely cargo potential. That huge rack is the first clue. The fact that it is integrated into the frame makes it extra sturdy – there’s no bolted connections or hinged joints like you find on universal racks. This one was specifically designed for this bike… because it is part of the bike.Integrated racks do have one glaring downside though: If they are ever damaged, they can’t be replaced. As long as you keep the wheels down and don’t go too nuts with the bike, that shouldn’t be an issue though.The frame is also nice and rugged. The bike says it’s rated for 300 lb., though it feels much more solid than most other 300 lb.-rated electric bikes I’ve tested. The welding looks great and lives up to Radio Flyer’s quality manufacturing reputation. The step-through design leaves no frame flex. and to be honest it doesn’t even look that step-through. That’s a big advantage for all the folks that don’t want to look like they are riding a step-through bike, but have begun to admit to themselves that step-throughs are actually more convenient and easier to ride. When you’ve got a rack full of cargo or a kid back there, the last thing you want to be doing is trying to swing a leg over that.The optional baskets are also really nice. Like, reaaaally nice. This is where you start to see the true Radio Flyer quality start to shine through. The company has been known for its aversion to corner cutting, even if that means its products cost a bit more. And the quality of these baskets is true to form. The front and rear baskets themselves are rugged though fairly standard, and it’s really the bags that are above and beyond. They’re thick fabric to withstand abuse, have solid metal snaps instead of cheap velcro and they include a zippered pocket so small things don’t shift around. Think about the open racks and baskets on other bikes: you’d never be able to toss your keys, phone, water bottle. or handful of change into those other typical bike baskets, but these bag inserts make it possible. And the Flyer logo is even printed in reflective ink, because why not? Just one more added bit of safety.The frame, tires, and utility features of the bike are where the Radio Flyer touch also shines through. The electronics are great, but that’s more of a case of the company spec-ing the right parts, not necessarily them designing their own batteries or motors.Don’t get me wrong, it’s a job well done. The 500W motor is plenty powerful and the 20 mph (32 km/h) speed definitely gets the job done for a family e-bike, even if sometimes I find myself wanting to go even faster on long straightaways. But these are fairly standard e-bike parts that you’ll find all over the place.I certainly do appreciate the integrated battery though. There are still plenty of brands rocking bolt-on batteries, and I’m glad to see that Radio Flyer went with an integrated battery upon their entry in the e-bike market. I’m also glad to see the large capacity 750 Wh battery. For any e-bike that is designed for hauling loads, a big battery is a prudent design choice. Even on throttle-only riding, which is notoriously battery draining, the 750 Wh battery will help riders stay out longer. And when using the five levels of pedal assist, ranges of up to 50 miles (80 km) are possible. There are also smart choices on the component side. The adjustable stem probably only costs them a few more bucks but helps riders dial in the handlebars to the perfect position. The big double kickstand helps keep the bike nice and sturdy while parked, and is especially useful with big loads or kids on back. And the steering stabilizer spring is also useful when parking so the bars and front wheel don’t swing around.If I could make one small upgrade to the bike, it’d probably be hydraulic brakes. The mechanical disk brakes are fine – no problem there. But with the high quality of the rest of the bike, the inclusion of nicer hydraulic brakes would have been the cherry on top. But perhaps the mechanicals help keep the price down. At $1,699, the Flyer M880 has a fairly mid-level price among value-oriented e-bikes. While you can find better deals out there, most bikes don’t have the combination of battery capacity, rugged design, comfortable ride, and brand legacy that you’ll find here. And the fact that Radio Flyer has been around for over a century gives me a pretty good feeling that they’ll be there if riders ever need service and support.If I sound like a Radio Flyer fanboy, it’s because I kind of am. I had Radio Flyer ridables growing up, including this Radio Flyer Row-Cart. After thirty-something years, it still works as a good as the day I got it. Now it brings joy to my niece who I recently handed it down to.  So suffice it to say, I’ve seen firsthand how much effort Radio Flyer puts into building products that last.For a first electric bicycle, Radio Flyer has knocked it out of the park on this one. It’s a great family e-bike that is built to last for years of fun riding.",ebikes
2021/11/11,"The KBO Ranger electric cargo bike has just launched as the company’s first utility e-bike.It takes on a rather Tern-esque design, opting for small diameter 20″ wheels but mounting them in a large-capacity cargo frame. The result is a small e-bike with big cargo and passenger potential.Smaller format e-bikes are becoming increasingly popular.Just yesterday, Juiced Bikes unveiled its first ‘fun-sized’ e-bike that employed 20″ fat tires in a smaller than typical frame.The day before that, Propella showed us their new Propella Mini, a minimalist 20″ wheel e-bike that weighs a mere 33 lb. (15 kg).And of course one of the best-selling electric cargo bikes of all, the RadWagon 4, famously launched its update with smaller diameter wheels for a more nimble and space-conscious ride.The KBO Ranger’s 20″ wheels don’t seem to limit its ability to haul big loads though, especially thanks to the rear rack’s 120 lb. (54 kg) weight rating. The entire bike is rated for 400 lb. (181 kg).The rear rack, which is included as standard equipment, also comes with a matching set of floorboards (not pictured) to turn the Ranger into a passenger-carrying electric bike.The front of the bike includes a basket mount for even more cargo space, though that basket is an optional accessory.The rigid front fork doesn’t offer any suspension, though that is fairly common in the cargo e-bike market. Instead, the 3-inch wide tires offer a bit of cushion for the ride.The rear hub motor is rated for 750W continuous and a peak power rating of 900W. The battery is a rather large pack at 48V 17.5Ah and 840 Wh of capacity. KBO says that should be good for a maximum range of 60 miles (96 km). We’d expect that to result in closer to 30-40 miles (50-64 km) on throttle-only riding, if experience is any indication.Mechanical disc brakes bring the bike to a stop, while a set of included fenders should keep riders dry and protected from road spray.Other components that should interest prospective riders include a sturdy center stand, front and rear lighting with included brake light function, LCD backlit display, saddle with built-in handle for maneuvering the bike while parked, wooden rack platform, 7-speed Shimano transmission, and 48V3A quick charger.The KBO Ranger is priced at $1,699 and is now available for pre-order in either gray or orange colorways, though the first units won’t ship until January.We’ve had some experience with KBO in the past, including recently reviewing the KBO Breeze commuter e-bike. We found it to be a simple yet nicely performing city bike that was both comfortable and responsive, though the pedal assist was slightly laggy – a common affliction in e-bikes with cadence-based pedal assist sensors. And at $1,499, it was quite affordable for an effective commuter e-bike.Check out our review video of KBO’s Breeze commuter e-bike below, and stay tuned for more news and reviews about the upcoming KBO Ranger as soon as it becomes available.",ebikes
2021/11/10,"San Diego-based electric bicycle company Juiced Bikes unveiled today a new e-bike model with a smaller format than the company’s other popular e-bikes. The Juiced RipRacer also sets a new low price for the brand.The RipRacer, which starts at just $1,399, is something of a little brother to the larger Juiced RipCurrent e-bike.While it retains fat tires that help the bike perform well on- and off-road, it shrinks those tires down to a 20-inch format.Combined with the smaller frame, the RipCurrent turns into a compact runabout that still packs in the power and range that Juiced’s riders have come to expect. It also adds new tech, such as the first-ever Apple AirTag-integrated battery that stands a chance of being located if it’s ever lost (or more likely stolen).The RipRacer will be offered in two options, a Class 2 and Class 3 version. Both are rated for riders up to 275 lb (120 kg).The Class 2 RipRacer will have a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) and a range of “35+ miles” (56 km) from a 52V and 10.4Ah battery.The Class 3 RipRacer will hit higher speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). It will also be able to travel farther thanks to a larger 52V 15.6Ah battery. Juiced claims it should have a range of 55 miles (88 km).Both of those ranges are based on pedal-assist operation, meaning the rider’s pedaling power is boosted by motor assistance. When ridden using only the throttle (i.e. no pedaling necessary), the range is reduced due to the increased power demand.The Class 2 version includes a 20A controller that will pull around 1,040 peak watts, while the Class 3 version’s 25A controller will be good for a slightly higher 1,300 peak watts.One other difference between the two models is the display, with the Class 2 version featuring a more simplified display than the full-featured Class 3 version’s display.Both versions of the Juiced RipRacer feature 750W continuous-rated geared hub motors and include some impressive tech such as hydraulic disc brakes and Apple AirTag-integrated batteries (though it appears to be a bring-your-own-AirTag situation with a specially designed compartment in the battery case). The batteries feature a redesigned case that includes a carry handle, improved water resistance and can be mated with a charging dock accessory that will debut late next year. The dock will also allow other electronics to be powered from the battery, functioning similar to a generator or portable backup battery. The batteries are backwards compatible with all of Juiced’s previous 52V e-bike models.While the bikes include some impressive new tech, the much-loved torque sensor found on most of Juiced’s electric bikes is swapped for a lower-spec cadence sensor, which means the pedal assist isn’t quite as responsive as true torque sensor-enabled e-bikes like Juiced’s Scorpion electric moped. Skipping a few of the higher-end parts like torque sensors and front suspension (note the BMX-style fork in its place) helped bring the bikes’ prices down. The Class 2 model will be priced at $1,399 while the Class 3 model will fetch a slightly higher price of $1,599. Both are considerably lower than most of Juiced’s other e-bikes. The Class 2 version is one of the lowest prices on the market for a 750W e-bike with hydraulic disc brakes.That puts the RipRacer in an interesting niche in the market. Other low-cost fat tire e-bikes like the $999 Lectric XP 2.0 may undercut it on price, but the RipRacer offers higher-quality components and over 50% more battery capacity, not to mention interesting additions like the charging dock and Apple AirTag integration.Other “fun-sized” fat tire e-bikes like the Pedego Element match the RipRacer on price but don’t come close to matching its power, speed, or components.The smaller format of the RipRacer should make it more appealing to riders on the shorter end of the spectrum. The company says it should fit riders from 5’0″ to 6’3″ (152 to 190 cm).As Juiced Bikes founder and CEO Tora Harris explained, the bike is largely designed to target a new generation of riders.With a younger generation becoming more and more interested in electric bikes, we saw the opportunity to launch a smaller model at an entry-level price point, an e-bike that appeals to a wider audience, but of course with the signature performance features the Juiced brand is so well known for. By offering a new frame style that’s a lot lighter and more nimble, and adding a range of colors, both new and experienced e-bike riders get a thrilling riding experience that’s also extremely functional and safe. And, like all of our e-bikes, It’s a great way to replace expensive and energy inefficient car miles.The 66 lb (30 kg) RipRacer will be available in four color options of Baja Blue, Noir, Hi-Viz Yellow, and Mystic Green. It will go on sale on Thursday, November 26, though it won’t begin shipping until March of next year.",ebikes
2021/11/09,"While many electric bikes continue getting heavier and heavier, Propella has constantly bucked that trend with its lightweight electric bicycles. But the Propella Mini e-bike takes the brand to a whole new level with its smallest and lightest model yet.The recently launched Propella Mini swaps out the wide-diameter 700c wheels of its big brothers for pint-size 20-inch wheels.Combined with the small, minimalist frame design and low-power electronics, that helps drop the bike’s weight to a mere 33 lb. (14.9 kg). At just 59″ long, it’s nearly a foot shorter than Propella’s other e-bikes (which are already quite minimalist to begin with).The smaller 20-inch wheels also help the bike generate more torque for better hill climbing.That’s an important benefit when you consider that Propella bikes aren’t exactly brimming with excess power. The 400W peak-rated Bafang motor is plenty for flat land riding, and can even handle hills of up to 10% grade. But the bike isn’t going to take the checkered flag any time soon.The Propella Mini still offers a top speed of 18 mph (30 km/h) and fits into a Class 1 designation, keeping it street legal just about anywhere in the US.It also gets rather impressive range for such a small battery. That little 3.5 lb. (1.6 kg) pack measures just 250 Wh in capacity yet scores the Propella Mini between 20-35 miles (32-56 km) of range. That’s largely thanks to the pedal assist operation of the bike. Without a throttle, the Propella Mini uses a cadence-based pedal assist sensor to provide power. When riders begin pedaling, the motor kicks in to offer assistance. When riders stop pedaling, the motor also stops and the rider simply coasts.It’s not exactly cutting-edge technology, but it works well and is an economical, efficient solution to score more range out of a small battery. And the added benefit of such a small battery is that it takes up very little space in your bag if you pop it off to bring it inside for charging (or to remove it as a target for thieves).Speaking of being an economical solution, the Propella Mini is priced at $999 but is currently on sale for just $899. There are some obvious sacrifices to get it there, such as the single-speed drivetrain and that small battery we discussed. But compared to other e-bikes in its price range, the Mini comes in at around half the weight, which could push it over the finish line for riders looking for a light and compact e-bike.The bike seems like a neat solution on the low-cost end, but we’ll know more once we have one in hand to perform a complete review soon.Until then, feel free to peruse our review of Propella’s full-size V4.0 e-bike, which uses most of the same components yet on a larger road bike-styled frame. You can even see it in action in my testing video below.",ebikes
2021/11/08,"I ride all types of electric bicycles, from the dainty to the powerful. And while I love any chance to throw my leg over a new electric steed, it’s usually the higher-power options that really tickle my fancy. And the Addmotor Wildtan M5600 is pretty much the living embodiment of the excessive, high-power electric fat tire bike movement, offering more fun and excitement than anyone really needs, but that we all truly want anyway.With an electric bike as wild and powerful as this one, you’re definitely going to want to see it in action. Check out my video review below, then keep reading below for my extended review.I have to start by making it clear that this is a big, powerful e-bike and it’s not for the faint of heart. Hidden away inside a protected frame box is a 1,000W-rated Bafang BBSHD mid-drive e-bike motor. It’s rated at 1,000W, but that’s a conservative figure. These motors have been known to draw over 1,500W when really opened up, and they put out up to 160 Nm of torque, which in technical terms is quite a lot.The bike is also physically large. It’s got a big frame, big tires, and a big attitude. It’s also got a massive 350 lb (159 kg) weight rating, so that should give you an idea of how overbuilt it is compared to most run-of-the-mill electric bicycles with a fraction of that weight rating.When you’re flying down the road or trail at 28 mph (45 km/h), you feel somewhere between a freight train and the world’s most nimble bulldozer. And the ability to switch back and forth between street or trail riding seamlessly is a big part of the Wildtan’s charm. It’s practically an overlanding e-bike as it doesn’t even really need a trail. You can just blaze your own, thanks to the powerful motor and the massive 4.5 inch wide fat tires.And with that powerful motor tied into a quality 9-speed shifter, you’ve got all the torque and gearing you need to tackle nontraditional terrain or climb steep hills. That 9-speed Shimano Alivio shifter is also a good starting point to talk about the higher-grade components on this bike. While most non-bike-shop electric bikes opt for lower-tier Shimano Altus or Tourney transmissions, the Wildtan is spec’d with a higher quality Alivio step. Add that to the higher quality hydraulic disc brakes, the nicer air suspension fork with adjustable pressure, preload and lockout, the nicer 5-inch color display, the thru-axle on the front wheel, and all the other higher-end parts, and you start to see how Addmotor actually specced the Wildtan for real use and abuse – not just the appearance of a rugged bike.The bike also isn’t neutered in the battery department, either. Again, Addmotor went above and beyond by supplying a larger battery than you’d generally find on a bike like this. At 48V and 17.5Ah, you’re looking at 840Wh of genuine Panasonic cells. That means it’s not just a high-capacity battery that will last longer on a charge, but it’s also a quality battery with cells that should last for many years.On an expensive e-bike like this, that’s exactly what I’d expect. Oh yeah, and here’s the kicker. The bike is quite expensive, to the tune of $3,099. That puts it in full-suspension e-bike price territory, even though we’re looking at a hardtail. How does Addmotor justify the price? Most likely between the higher-end components than most base-level e-bikes and that massively powerful mid-drive motor instead of a hub motor. That’s still a lot of money, though. I mean, it’s an awesome e-bike and I had a blast riding it, but you’ve got to really want a big, powerful e-bike to be ready to fork over that kind of money. Then again, you’re definitely getting a lot for your dollar here. Not only does the bike offer higher-end components than we typically see, but it’s a crowd pleaser through and through. Drivers were often rolling down their windows at red lights to ask me about the bike, and more than once I got a thumbs up from pedestrians as I rode by. At least, I think it was the thumb.So while the price stings a bit, I can vouch for how much fun the bike is and how well it is put together. It’s also just a comfortable bike to ride. The right-side, half-twist throttle is the right way to outfit an e-bike, and is far superior to bouncy thumb throttles or [shudders at the thought] left-side mounted throttles. The saddle feels good and the bike is nicely proportioned (though it’s biased toward taller riders simply due to the large size of the bike). And it’s all just a nice, comfortable, and easy-to-control ride.All told, this is a fun-loving, all-over-the-place electric bike for anyone who has the spare change and spare garage space to fit a big bike like this into their lives. It may not be for everyone, but for those who can swing it, it sure is a wild ride.",ebikes
2021/11/04,"Magicycle breaks onto the USA electric bike scene with a full power fat-tire cruiser that includes a comfortable stance and a wealth of extra goodies. The high powered 52v electric system can clim most any hill, and the full-house of commuter accessories can tackle most any situation. With a clean look and decent components, there’s a lot to love about the Magicycle Cruiser. Founded by Wade Wei, Magicycles has a more direct eye on manufacturing, since the company built it’s own factory in Wuxi China. Wade’s inspiration came as an act of filial piety. 11 years ago, the endeavor began as an answer to his father’s arthritis. Now, Magicycles produces over 300,000 units between their factories in China and Poland.At its core, the Magicycle Cruiser is a powerhouse electric bike. Some of the most prolific E-Bikes on the market utilize a 36v battery, and many others use a 48v system to energize the ride. Magicycle chose for a 52v system to add extra power and punch to the experience. Not to be slacking, the battery is also rated for 15ah, which ensures that large power won’t be gobbled up with just a few short trips. With a range of up to 60 miles on one charge, the Magicycle Cruiser is sure to deliver both power and endurance.Connecting to the electric system is intuitive and simple. The bike includes a full color LCD display, with easy readouts and easy to understand controls. Using the remote switch conveniently located on the left handlebar, the central display can change pedal assist on the fly, and access ride metrics such as trip set, average speed, max speed, and more. Also, the integrated head-light and taillight  run off the main battery pack, liberating the rider form the hassle of changing batteries.Mechanically, the whole cast of familiar components come together: Shimano 7 speed gearing, KCM rust resistant chain, alloy front suspension, 180mm mechanical disc brakes, comfort grips and a wide saddle for easy riding. The 18 inch frame size accommodates a wide variety of riders, and still offers a laid back ride with cruiser handlebars that make for a comfortable ride for anyone. The rear mounted kickstand can support the bike’s 75lb weight, even fully loaded with extra cargo.The Magicycle Cruiser includes all the necessary accessories to get the commuter started on the road instantly upon arrival. The integrated rear rack can house both standard and thin pannier rails, and the full coverage fenders keep the rider out on the road. Combined with the lights, these are standard issue for a commuter bike, but the addition of a bike lock, top tube bag, and motion alarm make for a compelling value proposition.Included with the bike was a combination coil lock for locking up the bike during errands or on the job. Coil locks can be cut with simple tools and a bit of determination, but Magicycle might have had this in mind. Also included is a motion alarm for the bicycle. The motion alarm activates with an included key fob, and with the press of a simple button, the bike is armed and will sound a wretched noise if the bike is rocked or bumped during an attempted theft. The combination of these two methods of theft deterrents offers peace of mind to the commuter on the go.Lastly, the Cruiser includes a top tube bag with a touch-screen accessible cell-phone window. Aside from the cell phone compartment on the lid, the bag itself is water resistant and can hold items roughly the size of two apples.While the Magicycles Cruiser is capable of off-road adventure and easy cruising, the commuting design and accessories are an easy way to justify an otherwise fun and exciting electric bike. The first 100 lucky customers can save $200 with the coupon code “ELECTREK”, offer ends October 31st.You can order the MAGICYCLE CRUISER All Terrain Fat Tire Electric Bike for a special $1599 launch price now.

2021/11/04,"The SWFT brand is relatively young in the electric mobility space, but it’s coming out swinging with a variety of options. Casting a wide net, SWFT sells direct and through Best Buy, both online and in 10 stores in the US. Today we’ll be reviewing an offering right in the middle with their electric cruiser, which is called the Fleet.Yup, $999. For this kind of price, it’s common to see an electric bike promise a steak and deliver chicken nuggets. In the case of the Fleet, we have a very clear use case with tailored components to save some serious cash. Obviously, the bike isn’t made for off-road, racing, or tight urban transport, but instead for easygoing cruising, and simple commuting in fair weather.The Fleet is a full-sized, comfortable electric bicycle with easy controls. In this price range, it’s common to see small folding e-bikes with telescoping handlebars, telescoping seat posts, and controls that require a bit of a learning curve. With the Fleet, it’s very easy for any rider to jump on and use it with proficiency. The frame proved a solid build and a classic look. While it’s a bit cramped for someone over 6 feet, the medium frame will fit any rider that can swing their leg up and over the frame.One relative strength of the Fleet is the electric system. The Fleet has both a pedal assist and throttle operation, which itself offers great versatility on the ride. The pedal assist is activated with the small display on the handlebars, which is small in itself and adjusts to three levels of assist. The limited pedal assist is supported by the throttle, which can give a boost of riding at the flick of the wrist. I did notice that the throttle wouldn’t begin at a dead stop. After nudging the bike a couple feet forward, the throttle would propel the bike as long as it was twisted.The 48v 10Ah battery is advertised for a rather precise max range of 37.2 miles. In my experience, I’ve ridden a bike very similar using only the throttle, and did 20 miles without using the pedals. With this kind of range, it’s quite possible to complete some simple commuting with the Fleet. I say “simple” commuting because the Fleet does not have complete mounting points for a rear rack, and other accessories would have to come third party. Still, with a backpack and nice weather, the Fleet could easily become a daily driver for almost any need around town.The biggest drawback for the Fleet should come as no surprise: rim brakes and a single-speed mechanical gear. This combination makes for a really good-looking bike, with a clean-looking set of wheels and a straight chain. On the business side, this combination of parts doesn’t do very well on steep hills. Since it’s an electric bike, a gentle slope can easily be overcome, but going up the local hill could pose a challenge. To be brief, if the bike doesn’t make it up the hill, then you need not worry about going down.The bike can be ordered from BestBuy.com to earn reward points, and is also available in 10 stores in the US. The ones I know of are: Austin, Los Angeles and San Francisco, Miami, Tampa and Orlando, New York City,  and Seattle. Big store representation is a major step toward legitimacy for any brand, and for e-bikes in general. This shows a lot of confidence in the product for both SWFT and for Best Buy.The price is hard to beat, and the drawbacks are clear. The Fleet is an affordable simple cruiser that looks good, feels good, and has enough power to flaunt both. For some reason, a lot of cruiser electric bikes carry a high price tag (I’ve seen many for over $3,000), but the Fleet really boils it down to the necessities and gives the cost savings back to the user. If you ride on steep hills often, then you may want to look for a bike with a range of gearing, maybe even a mid-drive to magnify that output.",ebikes
2021/11/03,"Electric bicycle companies are raising money left and right these days, with the latest big investment heading toward European electric bicycle company Ampler Bikes.The Estonian electric bicycle company’s elegant, high-end e-bikes are popular throughout Europe for their upscale design and high-quality EU production. Now that production should be getting a boost, thanks to a new funding round of €7.4 million (approximately US $8.6 million). That puts Ampler’s valuation at €47 million (approximately US $54.5 million).Just like the larger electric bicycle industry, Ampler has been growing at an impressive rate. The company recently doubled its workforce and showrooms, and will invest in constructing a carbon-neutral production factory by 2023.Germany is Ampler’s main market currently, but the company has plans to greatly expand its operations in the Netherlands and Switzerland.The locally built electric bicycles have proven to be a favorite of European urban commuters. As Ampler’s CEO and co-founder Ardo Kaurit explained:“All Ampler e-bikes are hand assembled in our own factory, as we believe that self-owned assembly will continue to be an important competitive advantage in order to offer the best urban commuting experience with user friendly, reliable and sustainably built light electric bikes.”We had the chance to review the Ampler Stellar electric bike last year, and found it to be an incredibly high-quality urban commuter bike. From the welding to the integrated battery and highly responsive torque sensor, the bike was several cuts above a typical imported commuter e-bike. To top it all off, the bike doesn’t even look electric – meaning most riders won’t know you have a boost (and thieves won’t know how valuable it is). You can check it out in my video review below.Ampler’s announcement comes at a time when massive capital is flowing into the electric bicycle market.Fellow European electric bicycle manufacturer VanMoof recently claimed to be the most funded electric bicycle company after landing a $128 million investment.US e-bike company Rad Power Bikes announced a $154 million investment round less than two months later. That brought Rad’s two-year funding total to nearly $330 million.With all of this cash being pumped into the electric bicycle industry and e-bikes still flying off the shelves of every major retailer, both consumers and investors are signaling high confidence in the continued growth of the industry.",ebikes
2021/11/02,"Gazelle has just launched its latest electric commuter bike, the Medio T9 City. The electric bike uses a mid-drive motor from one of the most popular suppliers in the industry, but without the typical high price.Powered by a Bosch Active Line motor, the Gazelle Medio T9 City electric bicycle powers the rear wheel through a 9-speed Shimano Alivio derailleur. Bosch-powered e-bikes typically aren’t cheap. In fact, they’re downright expensive. Prices vary, but $4K is a pretty typical number. Prices go up even higher with fancy components and fancier brand names on the tubes.But the Gazelle Medio T9 City is priced at an ultra-reasonable $2,299 in the US. That might not sound very “low-cost” to anyone unfamiliar with the e-bike industry. But to put that in perspective, many hub motor e-bikes approach that price level despite having simpler, lower cost drivetrains.Bosch’s Active Line motor isn’t at the top of the company’s drivetrain hierarchy, but its 40 Nm of torque is still plenty for most commuters just looking for a boost on their way to work.The motor helps the Medio T9 City hit a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) in the US, though international versions have lower speed limits to comply with local regulations.The 400 Wh Bosch battery is also a bit smaller than industry averages, but the pedal assist-only e-bike is still quite a bit more efficient than throttle-enabled e-bikes and thus manages to land a respectable range. Real-world ranges run the gamut and can differ based on the power level selected by the rider as well as other factors such as terrain, tires, and rider weight. But most 400 Wh Class 1 e-bikes can manage ranges of around 30-45 miles (48-72 km) with ease.The suspension fork should help make those miles go by more comfortably too, though it will add a bit to the bike’s 47 lb (21 kg) weight, sans battery. Gazelle didn’t mention the weight of the battery, but most 400 Wh packs tip the scale at around 5.5 lb (2.5 kg).The T9 Medio City comes in two frame sizes and both use a low-step design for increased accessibility. As general manager of Gazelle North America Ewoud van Leeuwen explained:“Gazelle is all about quality, offering riders the best possible experience. With the introduction of the Gazelle Medeo T9 City, we are thrilled to offer an excellent bike with premium components at an accessible price point. This opens up the possibility for more first time ebike riders to experience a well-made, dependable bike from a brand they can rely on, and a rich network of trained retailers that can provide service and support.”",ebikes
2021/11/01,"Lectric Ebikes first rolled onto the scene in 2019 when they dropped the affordably priced Lectric XP fat tire folding e-bike seemingly out of nowhere. At just $899, the fast and fun electric bicycle became the first e-bike of tens of thousands of new riders around the US. But like in most things in life, first attempts are seldom perfect. So with great anticipation, Lectric Ebikes launched their updated Lectric XP 2.0 earlier this year. The new version improved upon the few shortcomings of the original bike and added plenty of new features that many of us didn’t even know we wanted.To check out the Lectric XP 2.0 folding e-bike in action, watch my video review below!The Lectric XP has been one of my favorite bang-for-your-buck electric bicycles since its inception. And now the Lectric XP 2.0 has taken the best parts of that bike and made it even better.You still get a powerful motor with 500W of continuous power and 850W of peak oomph. You still get a fast top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), though the bike ships in Class 2 mode of 20 mph (32 km/h). A simple setting change using the handlebar-mounted control pad opens up the faster top speed and enables Class 3 performance.And you still get a folding frame that allows you to more easily take a fat tire bike on an adventure far away from home, whether that means loading it more easily into your car, truck, boat, plane, or RV.But on top of what stayed the same, you simply get so much more with the new Lectric XP 2.0.The most obvious initial upgrade is the suspension fork. I spoke in my original review about how I could accept the lack of suspension on the first edition of the bike since most low-cost e-bikes that include suspension usually opt for super-cheap spring forks that can fall apart after a year or two. When the Lectric Ebikes team first told me about the new Lectric XP 2.0, they told me that they decided to go with a higher-quality hydraulic oil suspension fork, partly due to my concerns. By investing a bit more, they added the comfort of suspension and the reliability of a higher-quality fork. Now, it’s only 50 mm of travel, so don’t think you’re going to be riding down the stairs like you’re on a cloud, but it’s still plenty for typical trail riding or just rough city streets. The new suspension fork absolutely makes a difference, improving the ride quality and making off-the-beaten-path adventures even more fun.Next, the Lectric XP 2.0 got wider bars, giving a more comfortable grip and finer tune control. At lower speeds and on smooth ground, the difference is somewhat small. But at higher speeds and on more technical terrain, every bit of extra control is greatly appreciated. Unlike narrower bars that can end up feeling more like a tiller, wider bars give you the comfort and confidence that comes with a higher degree of control.Another control upgrade includes the (slightly) narrower tires. Gone are the 4-inch fat tires. In their place are 3-inch balloon tires. They split the difference between mountain bike and fat bike tires, offering the comfort of more air volume but maintaining more nimbleness than giant fatties. They strike a nice balance and also help shed a little bit of weight, too. That’s also important because the bike has a few heavier upgrades.The frame is beefier, especially in the central folding mechanism. Beefier usually means more robust, and anything that makes a low-cost e-bike more robust is a good thing, meaning your ride should last longer and offer more years of enjoyable use. But it’s not just a stronger frame. It’s also a frame with more utility. A bigger and more robust rear rack was added, along with hardpoints for mounting a front rack or basket as well. There’s a whole cargo package that you can select to add serious storage to the front and rear of the bike, almost turning it into a true cargo e-bike. Almost.Speaking of accessories, I also got the comfort package. It consists of a suspension seat post and an absolutely giant sprung saddle. I should start by saying that the Lectric XP 2.0’s stock saddle is already awesome due to its size and comfort. But if you really want an even more comfortable upgrade, then you’ll love this giant saddle in the comfort package. It’s like flying first class, but on an e-bike. Just so much more room, so much comfier. Other interesting accessories included a nicer headlight and a folding lock that mounts on water bottle bosses hidden behind the seat tube of the frame. The stock light is already a nice upgrade, but you can get even brighter one from Lectric if you really do a lot of night commuting.There are just so many great upgrades here that I’m surprised the price didn’t increase more than it did. At just $999 (or $949 as part of the Black Friday deal!), the Lectric XP 2.0 will run you one whole Benjamin more than the original, but you just get so much more.And the single “downgrade” I could find on the bike, if you can call it that, is the 48V battery dropping from 10.4 Ah to 9.6 Ah. It’s slightly smaller, but from my testing it seems like the bike gets around the same range, so the higher efficiency of narrower tires seems to make up for it. With about 20 miles (32 km) of throttle-only riding and more on pedal assist, the range still seems fine for most riders.And sure, I could run through the list of things it doesn’t have. No hydraulic brakes, no torque sensor, no 8/9/10 speed transmission. Boo hoo. Seven speeds feels like plenty. And all of those other higher-end parts would be great, but that’s not the kind of bike this is. Plenty of other companies make e-bikes with fancier components like those, and if you want those parts, buy from one of those other companies. Lectric has always been about providing the lowest cost possible without dropping the quality of the e-bike too much. It’s all about bang for your buck, and I 100% respect that. The spandex crowd will never get it or accept it, but they aren’t the target market. This is one of those “get me started e-biking” bikes that offers you everything you need for a great starter e-bike that is fully adventure or commuter-capable.Other fancier e-bikes shave off the pounds or offer higher-spec components, but that comes at an obviously higher price. With Lectric charging under $1k for this kind of performance, I call that more than fair. It’s a great deal.And in fact, it’s becoming an even better deal this month, since Lectric Ebikes has just announced its Black Friday sale starting today. For the rest of the month, the price is discounted to $949 and will also include several free accessories, such as that awesome comfort package, the folding bike lock and the upgraded headlight. If it was already a good deal before, then now it’s even better!",ebikes
2021/10/29,"TurboAnt, makers of both electric bikes and electric scooters, aims to answer 3 rides in one with the Thunder T1 electric bike. Being a jack of all trades, the Thunder T1 can tackle the trails, blast to work, and even has a touch of comfort for a Sunday cruise.Based on a fat-tire frame and wheel set, the Thunder T1 has grip for off-road, with width and cushion for comfort. Riding off-road it feels great not being limited by the threat of loose terrain. The 26″ x 4″ fat tires can find traction even in sand, snow or gravel, 2 of which I got to try out personally.Of course, hauling hundreds of pounds of total weight in loose terrain can eat through a battery pretty fast, so TurboAnt equipped the Thunder with a removable 48v 14ah Samsung battery. This offers adventurers more time to slide in the sand, and still make it home. With a maximum range of 60 miles, the Thunder T1 is a challenge to find enough terrain to shred.The quality battery is paired with a powerful 750w rear hub motor, offering both durability and instant acceleration. With 80nm of torque, and up to 28mph top speed, the Thunder T1 has enough pep to climb, race, or simply get around town. To protect you (and TurboAnt) a safety feature of a throttle cut-off button is features within thumbs’ reach on the handlebars.Looking at the controls, it’s easy to see that TurboAnt made something easy to use. The display is clear, and simple, allowing the rider to focus on the ride ahead. For informed riders, the display offers the depth of travel distance, total distance, pedal-assist level, battery status, and more. The Shimano Tourney 7-speed gearing is familiar and comfortable, and could never be called intimidating. Stopping the Thunder T1 is a pair of Tektro Aires 180mm mechanical disc brakes.Riding off road, the RST hydraulic front shock can change the preload adjustment to offer more flex for spearing into tough terrain. Headed back to the paved road, the fork can change again to lock into added efficiency. While on the road, the commuter features are easy to notice. The wide and encompassing fenders keep the rider dry and clean, while the front and rear lights integrate into the main battery, making for an easy and simple high-vis rider. The TurboAnt also carries a myriad of other small features that really add-up. The front wheel has a quick disconnect, making it easier to transport this large bike inside of a regular car. The battery can be charged on or off the bike, and also has an embedded phone charger. The stem, seat, handlebars and pedal assist are all customizable, offering control and comfort for multiple riders with just a few changes.  The TurboAnt Thunder T1 comes 90% assembled, only requiring the complete front wheel to be installed, the complete handlebars to be aligned, and the pedals screwed on. After a bit of air and a safety check, you’ll be on the road in no time. With an unbeatable price of $1,699, the Thunder T1 is sure to make waves on the roads and trails near you.If you’re after the extra sleek look, check out the Nebula N1 from TurboAnt. It has the same specs as the Thunder T1, but in a slightly upgraded and more integrated package. You can check out the full TurboAnt collection here.

2021/10/29,"Harley-Davidson has just pulled the sheet off its most recent custom electric bicycle, the Serial 1 MOSH/BMX. It’s the latest addition to Serial 1’s 1-OFF limited edition series.The e-bikes in the 1-OFF series are more than just limited editions though; they are one-of-a-kinds. If you are looking for a retro BMX ebike, check out the Zooz. Serial 1, the electric bicycle startup spun off last year by Harley-Davidson, crafts each e-bike in the series and then auctions them off to benefit a charity. H-D gets to show off its cool e-bikes. Rich folks’ money goes to people who actually need it. Everyone wins.The last time around, Serial 1 unveiled a ’60s chopper style e-bike known as the MOSH/CHOPPER. It eventually sold at auction for $14,200, and now the company is hoping to repeat the magic with another eye-catching and nostalgia-inducing electric bike: the MOSH/BMX.Just like the MOSH/CHOPPER, the new MOSH/BMX was crafted by Warren Heir, Jr., and Kendall Lutchman at JR’s Fabrication and Welding in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This time though, the custom e-bike transports us back in time a mere 40 years to glory days of the 1980s.The MOSH/BMX is built on the same base as the stock Serial 1 MOSH/CTY. That means it sports the same Brose e-bike drive, Gates carbon belt drivetrain, Enviolo continuously variable transmission, TRP hydraulic disc brakes, and Serial 1 battery that was developed in-house using expertise gleaned from Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire electric motorcycle development.Unlike the standard Serial 1 MOSH/CTY, the BMX variety here gets a number of custom touches.The bars are swapped for 9″ high-rise BMX bars with internal cable routing, giving the e-bike an entirely different ride posture. A front milk crate basket is mounted on a custom stainless steel rack (and could very well make this the most expensive e-bike ever with a milk crate attached to it). The colorway has been replaced by a striking two-tone fade job.And to top it off, a number of authentic BMX touch points were added, such as the Viscount Dominator saddle, ODI Mushroom bar grips, and the bear trap pedals. Remember getting a shin-full of those suckers when you were a kid!?As Serial 1 brand manager Aaron Frank explained:For this second 1-OFF build we sought inspiration from iconic BMX bikes of the early ‘80s. One ride brings you right back to the suburbs of your youth, ripping skids, jumping curbs, and racing everywhere in a pack of your closest friends.Proceeds from the auction of the e-bike will benefit the just keep livin Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Camila and Matthew McConaughey that is “committed to empowering high-school students by providing them the tools to lead active lives and make healthy choices for a better future.”Sounds like a win-win to me.",ebikes
2021/10/28,"After being cut in half, a proposed US tax credit for new electric bicycle purchases has been bumped back up to a full 30%.The move comes as electric bicycles sales continue to grow, making the alternative form of transportation an increasingly popular option as a car replacement. That led several members of the US Congress to propose a tax credit earlier this year to help reduce the cost of e-bikes, which are several times more expensive than pedal bicycles.Congress has been chewing away at the proposed legislation, with the House of Representatives recently cutting the incentive from 30% to 15%.Now President Biden’s “Build Back Better” proposal has restored the proposed incentive back to its full 30%. It would be capped at a maximum incentive of $1,500, and would only apply to electric bicycles priced under $8,000 (which is the vast majority of all e-bikes).A phase-out schedule is included based on income level. The credit would begin phasing out for taxpayers earning over $75,000, though that figure increases to $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples who file jointly.There’s still a way to go before the e-bike tax credit could become law, but this is certainly promising news for those that have hoped to buy an e-bike as an alternative to car trips.The proposed tax credit has been designed to help Americans that may not otherwise be able to afford the cost of an electric bicycle.While several models of e-bikes can be found for under $1,000, most popular e-bikes cost several thousand dollars.Even though e-bikes are expensive compared to pedal bicycles, many riders have discovered that they ultimately saved a significant amount of money by switching from a car to an electric bicycle. In one case, a woman in San Fransisco saved around $50,000 over several years by entirely switching from a car to an electric bicycle.Most commuters who don’t live in a densely packed urban area will likely find it difficult to completely replace a car, but electric bicycles are still useful for many local trips that don’t require a full-size vehicle. And with electric cargo bikes that can carry several children or a week’s worth of groceries, more riders are discovering that a full-size vehicle might not be as necessary as they once thought.",ebikes
2021/10/28,"Rad Power Bikes isn’t just the largest electric bicycle company in North America, it’s also the most funded. Rad announced a massive new funding round today, adding another $154 million to its war chest as the company continues its mission of bringing affordably priced electric bicycles to the masses.Part of that huge funding round has already been earmarked to invest in North American and European production.The new funding round is Rad’s second this year, following on the heels of the previously record-breaking $150 million investment secured in February.Now Rad Power Bikes’ existing investors have decided to double down, effectively throwing more money at the leading electric bicycle company.The funding round announced today was led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with investments from funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Vulcan Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP, and The Rise Fund, TPG’s multi-sector global impact investing strategy.While Rad announced that the funding will go toward the usual suspects of product development and further fleshing out its services such as RadMobile at-home assembly/repair service, the most interesting new investment may be adding production outside of Asia.The company announced that as part of its efforts to diversify its manufacturing and supply chains, it will be investing in North American and European production.I pushed Rad Power Bikes founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh for more details on exactly what that means, but he explained that he wasn’t able to share full details yet on precisely what components could see production in North America or Europe, or exactly where that production would be handled.But it certainly fits with Rad’s strategy of finding creative solutions to solve the extreme supply chain difficulties being experienced throughout the electric bicycle industry.Not only has Rad Power Bikes already invested in redundant production in several countries across Asia, but the company has purchased its own supply of shipping containers and even its own shipping vessel to keep its e-bikes flowing into the United States. With over 350,000 riders so far, the Seattle-based e-bike company leads North America in sales and ridership. Strategic investments in sustaining and growing that edge have been an important part of keeping e-bikes available and maintaining affordable prices during unprecedented uncertainty in the e-bike industry.It’s all part of the Rad’s plan to demonstrate that it’s not just an e-bike company, but an entire transportation solution company, Mike explained to me over the phone. And extreme growth has been central to that plan. “We’ve grown to over 620 people now, and we even have 100 open roles we’re currently filling. We’ll more than double our size this year alone.”It’s not just manpower that has grown, but also the company’s physical footprint. Rad has led in direct-to-consumer sales via its website, but has steadily invested in growing its retail space too. Mike explained that between its RadMobile service and physical retail stores, Rad Power Bikes would be tripling its physical footprint by the end of 2022.All of that investment in growing its manpower and retail presence hasn’t slowed innovation at Rad, with the company launching three new models of e-bikes during the COVID-19 pandemic alone. The $999 RadMission electric bike became an instant success when it was launched last summer. Rad then followed up with two more premium e-bike launches this summer with the $1,999 RadRover 6 Plus and the $1,799 RadCity 5 Plus.And that pace of innovation looks set to continue. “We’re not going to slow down on product development,” Mike explained. “We’re working on a very substantial multi-year product road map. Don’t think we’re going to slow down product innovation – nothing could be further from the truth.” Dadgum! That’s some serious funding. Add that $154 million to the $150 million earlier this year and $25 million in 2020, and you’re looking at $325 million in funding in just 20 months. Rad is a privately held company, and so we don’t have a good look at their finances, but it’s not a giant leap to suppose we’re looking at an electric bicycle company worth over a billion dollars.That highlights two things. one, investors see the massive growth of e-bike sales and can tell that current modal shifts in transportation mean that such is growth is certainly sustainable, and two, Rad Power Bikes’ investors feels bullish enough in Rad to double down on their recent investments. That’s some serious industry confidence in e-bikes in general and in Rad specifically.I am fascinated to see how the company uses all of this newfound cash to bring us even more e-bikes and accessories as well as an even better customer experience. Rad’s founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh is just as much of an e-bike fanatic as we are here at Electrek, probably even more so. It was obvious that he was pained by not being able to give me any more specific details about what they’re working on in Rad’s development center. But from the little I’ve seen behind the curtain and the little more Radenbaugh was allowed by Rad’s hardworking and vigilant marketing team to let slip out, we’re going to see some exciting stuff coming out of Seattle.",ebikes
2021/10/26,"The Fiido X folding electric bike is the latest rendition of Fiido’s modern take on the classic folding bicycle. Not only are these electric bikes easier than ever to ride, thanks to their pedal assist feature, but now they come with fancy new tech for locking that innovative seat tube battery.The Fiido X was originally released as part of a crowdfunding campaign earlier this year. But for those that didn’t want to take a risk on an Indiegogo project, now is your chance to snag a full-production model. And to let you know if it’s worth it or not, I put my body on the line to test this newfangled e-bike with the fanciest, most complicated battery locking mechanism I’ve seen yet.The Fiido X is definitely one of the most innovative folding e-bikes out there. You’ve got to see this one in action. Take a closer look at the bike in my video review below.There are a pile of unique features here. The magnesium frame keeps the bike relatively lightweight (for an e-bike) at just 17 kg (37 lb).The folding mechanisms have been reworked with a sleek center folding system that hides away most of the hinge and streamlines the handle.And the battery is built into the seat to remove any bulky frame members or bolt-on batteries that would otherwise ruin the sleek lines of the modern-looking e-bike.The few other seat tube e-bikes out there, including the previous version of Fiido’s folding e-bike known as the Fiido D11, require an electrical cord to be plugged or unplugged each time you insert or remove the battery. That’s how you get that stored power from the seat tube battery into the bike.But with the Fiido X, they designed this innovative rail system that shoves electrical blades into the battery’s hidden rails, engaging the battery. Making it even cooler is that the rails are engaged simply by locking the seat tube in place with the quick release lever. That means when you insert the seat, the same action that locks the seat at your desired height also invisibly performs the electrical connection to the battery.With non-locking seat tube batteries, you have to bring the seat with you each time you park to prevent someone from stealing it. But the Fiido X incorporates a digital lock into the bike that keeps unauthorized hands off your expensive battery.The same locking combination is used to start the bike as well, meaning the bike can only be powered on by the owner (or a friend of the owner that is privy to the combination).The seat tube battery is without a doubt the standout feature in the Fiido X, and its 418 Wh of capacity is much larger than you might expect to be crammed into such a small space.Fiido claims that you can get 130 km (80 miles) of range from that battery, ha!Ok, fine – that might actually be possible if you leave it in pedal assist level 1. A lot of e-bike manufacturers are programming their lowest assist level to be super weak in order to barely sip the battery. That means you can get extreme ranges out of the bike. But most people are likely to use levels 2 or 3 that provide more power, especially since the bike doesn’t have a throttle. What the bike does offer, though, is a torque sensor, which works really nicely. As soon as I step on the pedal with any decent amount of pressure, I nearly instantly feel the motor assist start up. There isn’t the telltale delay found in cadence sensors. Torque sensors are the best way to engage pedal assist because they result in the most natural assistance. The bike powers up when your legs power up and the bike throttles back when your legs ease up on the pedaling. It just works the way you’d intuitively expect it to. Fiido definitely hit the nail on the head in that regard.The bike isn’t particularly fast, mind you. In the US it’s a class 1 e-bike, meaning you can get up to 20 mph or 15.5 km/h. That’s a decent commuter speed for the bike lane, but you won’t be keeping up with traffic in most cities. The European version of the bike is even slower at 15 mph or 25 km/h. That’s way too slow if you ask me, but then again, it’s the legal limit over there, so what can you do? Plus this tiny little 250 watt motor in the rear wheel isn’t exactly spec’d for high speed riding either, so you’re pretty much maxing out the bike when flying at top speed. If it makes you feel any better, the motor is rated at 350 watt peak power, so it is technically more powerful than the smallest 250W motors.Like any good folding e-bike, the Fiido X is simple to fold and fairly easy to carry due to the lower than typical weight of 17 kg (37 lb). The front folding mechanism appears to be from bike maker Dahon (which I deduced from the “Dahon” printed inside it). The rear mechanism might be Fiido’s own design, which would make sense as it looks very custom-made for the novel frame of the Fiido X. It’s easy to use and looks like it’s just part of the frame when you’re not operating it. In my opinion, it looks much nicer than the chunky handles found on most folders.Other commuter accoutrements round out the bike nicely, like the narrow CST tires, integrated lighting, hydraulic disc brakes and basic but acceptable display. Some fenders would be nice for rainy areas, but you can likely add your own fenders to the mounting points if you really need them. For the current price of $1,599 (or $1,579 with coupon code ELECTREK), it’s a neat e-bike. It was an even better deal at $1,099 during the Indiegogo campaign earlier this year, but that’s what you get for not risking it with a pre-order.While some might pan the lack of low-end power, the bike is obviously designed for those that are already pedal-centric. This isn’t a mini motorbike, it’s a traditional pedal assist e-bike. There are cheaper, faster e-bikes out there with more power, but that’s not what everyone’s looking for. Sometimes a clean, lightweight folding e-bike with modest power is a better match for a true commuter e-bike.Some suspension might be desirable for those with pampered behinds, though classic bike commuters will often trade suspension for longer lasting, lower-weight parts anyways. So for a lightweight and interesting-looking e-bike, the Fiido X lands on a number of levels. It’s got innovative technology, a solid pedal assist system, and plenty of battery for any reasonable commute. Not bad, Fiido!",ebikes
2021/10/25,"Watt Wagons is the Boston-based electric bicycle company behind some of the most highly specced electric bikes in the country. Now the company is unveiling its latest flagship commuter e-bike, the Watt Wagon Helios.While many US-based electric bicycle companies are largely importers of Asian-made e-bikes, Watt Wagons is one of the few US-based manufacturers in the industry.Instead of aiming for the lower end of the market, Watt Wagons competes with the high end European manufacturers like Riese & Müller.Case in point: Watt Wagons’ new Helios e-bike. It’s pricey, but it’s also loaded to the bars with high-end components.Starting with the frame, the Helios gets full 3K carbon fiber treatment. The full-suspension frame is produced in Watt Wagons’ local carbon fiber production factory. It comes in a mid-step as well as a low-step option to increase the accessibility for various sizes and types of riders.Built into that carbon frame is one of the highest-performance mid-drive motors available in the electric bike industry: The infamous Bafang Ultra motor.This high-power motor is capable of outputting over 1,500 W of power and 160 Nm of torque, though Watt Wagons has ensured that it is limited to legal levels for the various countries where its e-bikes are sold. In the US, the Helios is a Class 3 e-bike, meaning it can reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist. While the Bafang Ultra’s motor has proven legendary, its integrated controller hasn’t always won as much praise. To provide a much better power delivery experience, Watt Wagons has swapped in an Archon X1 controller. That allows the company to make precise modifications that improve the user experience for riders. It also opens the doors for more components, such as the Watt Wagons smart display to feed important data back to the rider in real time.The powerful motor drives the rear wheel via Watt Wagons’ own proprietary belt drive system that is rated up to 500 Nm of torque – a level that is largely unthinkable in the world of e-bikes. To put that in perspective, most Bosch mid-drive motors put out around 50-60 Nm, with the most powerful reaching 90 Nm. The Helios’ belt drive connects to a Kindernay IGH VII internally geared hub. That provides a 100% sealed transmission, meaning reduced noise and maintenance, plus a cleaner look without a derailleur or chunky cassette.  Powering that motor is a 1 kWh battery offering around 50% more capacity than most commuter e-bikes on the market. The battery is also constructed using 21700-format battery cells, a slightly larger and more modern cell format than the typical 18650s used in most e-bike battery packs.The massive motor and the high-capacity battery sure aren’t lightweight, but the 65 lb (30 kg) e-bike certainly would have been even heavier without that carbon fiber frame. Considering the rack and fenders are included in that weight, the bike is hefty but not outrageous for such a powerful full-suspension ride. We’ve seen plenty of full-suspension e-bikes with large motors and batteries that end up exceeding 100 lb (45 kg).The Helios is expected to begin shipping in spring 2022. The price? It hasn’t been publicly disclosed yet, but the company indicated that it “will be in line with premium products from Riese and Müller and Specialized built to similar specifications.” Specialized doesn’t really offer a good full-suspension commuter e-bike for direct comparison (the company’s nicest hardtail Turbo Como commuter e-bikes peak at around US $5,500). Riese and Müller, on the other hand, have comparably spec’d e-bikes that start at around US $9,000.When they say “car replacement,” they mean it!",ebikes
2021/10/21,"The Juiced Scorpion X recently replaced the original Scorpion moped-style electric bike and offers new upgrades to improve upon an already strong entry in the market. Chief among the upgrades is the inclusion of a more powerful motor and a larger battery.The Scorpion X inherits the RetroBlade motor co-developed by Juiced and Bafang. That motor is designed to put out close to 2,000 watts of peak power when installed in the even more extreme HyperScorpion e-bike.The Scorpion X is the little brother to the HyperScorpion, so it doesn’t get to enjoy the full 2,000 watts of power, but it still receives a nice (and quite noticeable) power boost over the original Scorpion from last year.Juiced will tell you that it puts out 750W of continuous power, but the peak power really breaks into the low four digits. Between the added power and other upgrades, the Scorpion X is sure to help Juiced maintain its spot near the top of the pack when it comes to moped-style electric bikes.To see the bike in action, check out my video review below. Then keep reading for even more perspective on the Scorpion X.The extra power is nice, don’t get me wrong. When I reviewed the original Scorpion last year my main takeaway was “It’s a great bike but it feels like the power doesn’t live up to its badass design.” Juiced must have taken that feedback to heart, but the company didn’t stop there. The Scorpion X gets a number of other upgrades too.Juiced has standardized around 52V batteries, but has recently increased its minimum pack size from 13 Ah to 15 Ah, boosting the capacity from 676 Wh to 780 Wh. That’s 15% more battery, or around 15% more range. The company claims a max range of 55 miles (88 km). That’s theoretically possible in the lowest pedal assist setting, but I find that real-world riding with a variety of throttle and pedal-assist action lands me somewhere around half of that range. I can easily break into 30+ mile territory if I add some pedaling, which is easy on the Scorpion X.Of all the electric mopeds out there, Juiced’s design is one of the better models for pedaling comfort. It still doesn’t feel like a typical bike, but it’s pretty darn good by moped standards. You don’t get the knees in your armpits feeling that some other mopeds give you, that’s for sure.You also get a torque sensor and cadence sensor that work together to provide the most realistic and natural feeling pedal-assist possible. That torque sensor is a big part of what makes the Scorpion X actually comfortable to pedal. And considering the bike weighs 100 lb (45 kg), it darn well better be comfortable to pedal in case you ever run dry on battery.The dual-suspension design and plush seat also add to the bike’s comfort, even when you’re ripping on the throttle. And let’s be honest, you’re going to use the throttle a lot. The rear suspension is actually usable and can even have the pre-load adjusted, unlike some cheaper dual coilover shocks. The front suspension keeps the bars from sending shockwaves right into your wrists, contributing to the smoothness of the ride. Those street tires help out too, striking a nice balance between slicks and off-road tires, having enough tread for rainy days.On the bars sit a pair of hydraulic disc brake levers and a new Microshift twist shifter (that is no longer upside down like the original Scorpion!). The hydraulic disc brakes are plenty grippy and give you the confidence you need to bring a heavy e-bike back down from speed. For an e-bike that can hit up to 28 mph (45 km/h) in its highest power mode, strong hydraulic disc brakes are a must. Other upgrades include a new 100 dB horn that gets some serious attention from cars and even a new style of packaging that provides some of the best e-bike protection I’ve ever seen. Juiced has always been serious about properly packing its bikes. Despite the uncomfortable amount of foam, I will say that you’re almost guaranteed to get your bike in good shape even after the delivery company kicks the box out of the back of the truck.One of the most common areas for e-bike damage in shipping is the rear rack, so many companies ship them in a separate box. To make it easier on you, Juiced ships the bike as assembled as possible. And with the new RelayRack on the Scorpion X, you can add all sorts of accessories right onto the rear rack. The passenger kit will likely be a favorite of many since it adds a rear seat and footpegs to allow riders to carry a passenger behind them. There’s a lot to love here. A nice big headlight, comfortable pedaling, motorcycle-level frame that is way more rugged than anyone should really need, dual suspension – it’s all designed to give you more of a true motorbike experience than a simple e-bike feeling. And at a price of $2,199, it’s certainly priced higher than a simple e-bike. But compared to other electric mopeds, the price falls right in line (or is even much better than some) and feels proportional to what you’re getting here. You can easily spend twice this much on moped-style e-bikes with full suspension, so the Scorpion X feels like it is more than fairly priced for its components and performance. Just be prepared for a few odd looks in the bike lane when they see your old-school motorcycle headlight coming. A quick spin of the pedals usually brings a smile though, or at least another funny confused look.And for anyone who likes the idea of the Scorpion X but wants to go all out with more power, more battery, and more everything, the HyperScorpion may be right up your alley.",ebikes
2021/10/20,"Super73 is known for collaborations that have seen its popular electric bikes take design cues from famous brands, sports teams, and other cultural icons. After showing off a beautiful concept bike last year designed under a collaboration with Roland Sands Design, the company has now decided to create a limited-edition production version of the eye-catching electric bike.The original concept was pitched as an off-road racing-style e-bike, and the specs definitely live up to that name.It was built on the base of Super73’s flagship RX-series e-bikes, which feature fully adjustable dual-suspension designs, high-power motors, and high-capacity batteries.The new e-bike, known as the RSD x SUPER73-RX Malibu, will retain the same adjustable RX inverted front air fork found on all RX models, but adds a Fox Racing Float 3 Evol rear shock unit to improve ride quality and handling.The stock 960 Wh battery has been relocated from the top tube to the down tube, making way for an extra long tracker bench seat in its place. The company says the new seat should give the rider extra range of motion while racing (or just cruising the streets). The lowered battery will likely also improve handling in the turns by lowering the bike’s center of gravity.The bike retains the stock RX’s 2,000W peak-rated hub motor, which offers speeds of over 28 mph (25 km/h) in unlocked mode. That mode is generally reserved for off-road riding. Riders can select from more limited modes to keep the bike street legal under various local regulations. Class 1 mode limits the bike to 20 mph (32 km/h) with 750W of continuous power and 1,200W of peak power, but disengages the throttle. Class 2 mode (which is the default mode when shipped in the US) adds the throttle back into the mix and Class 3 mode bumps the speed to 28 mph (45 km/h) on pedal assist.An upgraded Magura four-piston front brake caliper has been added, along with short brake levers to “increase precision” clamping down on that stock 203mm rotor.The RSD x SUPER73-RX Malibu also gets an upgraded mid-bar handlebar with bar pad and ODI Ruffian ATV grips, which were added to the bar ends using gold lock rings engraved with “SUPER73.”More gold accents can be found in gold pins on the Crank Brothers “Stamp 2” pedals as well as a gold KMC Z410 chain.Adding to the visuals, the bike is decked out in RSD graphics that give it an even more eye-popping appearance than stock Super73s (which are anything but mundane looking to begin with).Lastly, the e-bike gets upgraded 20×4”’ front and 5” rear GRZLY tires, just in case the stock tires weren’t massive enough already.As Super73 cofounder and CMO Michael Cannavo explained:“SUPER73 is proud to partner with Roland Sands Designs to take a fresh look at what two-wheel electric mobility should look like. With a focus on moto-style, ergonomics, and the attention to design that has made RSD so iconic in the motorcycle industry, the Malibu is a perfect fit for any rider’s lineup.” The RSD x SUPER73-RX Malibu is a limited-edition e-bike with only 1,000 units to be produced worldwide. As if the production wasn’t limiting enough, the price is likely to narrow down the potential market too: A cool $4,500.Orders won’t open until October 25, so you’ve got some time to find the cash.It’s expensive, but considering how quickly Super73 sells e-bikes, I don’t think they will have trouble moving a thousand RSD x SUPER73-RX Malibu editions. I know looks are subjective, but I think it’s awesome and I’d love to have one myself.Regular Electrek readers may remember that we recently spent a few weeks riding Super73 e-bikes around Germany while visiting a few industry shows. The bikes were fast, powerful, and comfortable, making for great urban assault vehicles.With all the upgrades and of course the new aesthetics from RSD, these limited-edition e-bikes are sure to be even more fun.

2021/10/19,"Sushil Reddy is no stranger to long-distance electric bicycles rides, having broken the Guinness World Record back in 2016 with a 7,424 km (4,613 mile) ride across India. Since then he’s set his sights on solar power, performing several more long-distance solar-powered electric bike rides. Now he’s halfway through a 10,460 km (6,500 mile) ride around the US on a custom-built solar-powered electric bike as part of the SunPedal Ride project.As the SunPedal Ride project explained:“The SunPedal Ride is an outreach project started by Sushil Reddy in 2016. The idea is to have conversations about clean energy and sustainable mobility via endurance journeys undertaken on zero tail-pipe emission vehicles. Each edition of The SunPedal Ride is a new challenge which is executed by a team and supported by a group of sponsors/partners to spread the message via public interactions. A medium of a zero tail-pipe emissions vehicle is used in each edition of The SunPedal Ride.”Past editions of the ride have included solar-powered tuktuk three-wheelers and other long-distance solar e-bike rides.This new ride around the US will be one of the project’s longest yet.Sushil is joined by sustainable energy activist Luis Fourzan on the epic ride. The pair started in North Carolina and have made a long arc along the northern US to their current location in Montana. Over the next five to six weeks, the pair will continue south along the West Coast before turning east and heading across the desert Southwest en route to their final destination of Texas. Sushil’s Yuba bicycle is a custom-converted electric bike that is powered by a pair of 50W SunPower solar panels for a total of 100W of photovoltaics. Assuming 70W of real-world power and eight hours of sunlight per day, that could recharge a typical 500 Wh e-bike battery each day. With extra leg power, the trip is likely to be a healthy combination of the sun’s solar energy and Sushil’s lunch energy. The batteries used on the bike are far from typical though, and instead are the innovative modular LiGo batteries developed by Vancouver-based Grin Technologies.Grin’s thru-axle motor was also used for the conversion, providing propulsion for the e-bike.You can see the e-bike in action in Sushil’s Twitter video below. He sure seems to be booking it!#thesunpedalride is in #northdakota @bistrib @NWSBismarck @JimmieKnight @gd_adkisson We would like share our journey experiences on the #solar #ebike via media in North Dakota. Jamestown, Steele, Bismarck, Richardton and Medora are our stops. https://t.co/8meRfUDP7k pic.twitter.com/RWRKLTlWn0Solar-powered electric bicycle rides have proven to be popular choices for raising awareness of sustainable energy for transportation.While solar-powered electric cars are making progress, the efficiencies required to supply enough energy to the more powerful vehicles often result in wacky designs. Solar-powered electric bicycles, on the other hand, can easily achieve much more of their energy purely from solar charging. With solar canopies or solar trailers that offer more space for panels, many solar e-bikes can actually obtain most or all of their energy from the sun.Solar panel innovations sure are taking their sweet time to bring us smaller, more efficient options. But as the technology improves, solar-powered light electric vehicles could prove useful tools for sustainable transportation alternatives – especially in areas where traditional grid-charging options are limited.What do you think of Sushil’s ride?

2021/10/16,"It’s been a big few weeks for electric bicycles in the military, with the latest tactical e-bike news coming from down under. Australian soldiers are now testing the use of high-powered electric bicycles for military roles, focusing on stealthy scouting missions.Scouts from the Light Horse Regiment with Queensland Mounted Infantry are now testing out high-powered e-bikes, though few would consider these to be ‘bicycles’.The e-bikes in question may have functional pedals, but they can reach speeds topping 80 km/h (50 mph) on throttle-only operation. Those high speeds are possible thanks to a powerful 6.2 kW motor. The e-bikes remain pedalable thanks to a 9-speed gearbox built around the bikes’ bottom bracket, where many e-bikes would traditionally house a mid-drive motor. The exact model of e-bike hasn’t been officially named by the Australian military, but it’s plain to see that these are B-52 model e-bikes from the Australian company Stealth Electric Bikes. The 51 kg (112 lb) e-bikes carry 2 kWh batteries and are rated for ranges up to 100 km (60 miles) on a single charge, albeit at slower speeds. At a speed of 50 km/h (31 mph), they produce just 65 dB of sound. That’s far below the audible signature of a gas-powered dirt bike. They can also be more easily lifted into a truck or other military vehicle and can even be pedaled back if the battery were to run low.As corporal Thomas Ovey of the Queensland Mounted Infantry explained:“The footprint is minimised due to less power, less noise, and you’re not kicking up much dust that could be seen by enemy forces. It’s much more effective than a standard motorbike. They’ll call us up, we’ll get the stealth bikes out, head down there and grab the information. It’s a lot quicker. We cover more ground much faster, and it saves time instead of waiting for troops to come to us when they’ve found something. It’s easier to punch out the e-bikes and return.”This is only the latest news of electric bicycles getting drafted into the military, reversing the typical military tech trend by taking civilian gear and repurposing it for tactical use.Earlier this month we learned of three countries who were using electric bicycles in their special operations and paratrooper units.In that case, it was the popular dual-branded Jeep and Quietkat electric bicycles, produced in China using the powerful Bafang Ultra M620 mid-drive motor known to put out over 1,500W of power and hit speeds nearing 60 km/h (36 mph).Such fat tire electric bicycles have been finding military use for years, where their all-terrain capabilities combined with their low weights and silent operation make them ideal for recon use.Norway’s armed forces began testing fat tire electric bicycles in border guard applications as early as 2018.For more high-power uses, electric motorcycles are also starting to become a favorite for stealthy yet powerful two-wheeled transport in the military.The New Zealand Defence Forces began testing UBCO’s electric utility bikes last summer, using the motorcycles for patrol roles.Police also often employ electric motorcycles in patrolling roles as more efficient alternatives to gas-powered motorcycles.We saw a rather comical case of an electric Zero police motorcycle pulling over a Tesla in what was dubbed by the officer as “the quietest police pursuit ever.”Many other police departments are now hopping on the electric motorcycle bandwagon too.",ebikes
2021/10/15,"The original sponsor of a bill introducing a 30% tax credit for electric bicycle purchases recently commented on the current state of the proposed legislation, calling it frustrating but expressing hope at the progress it indicated.Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) introduced the E-BIKE Act this past February along with congressman Earl Blumenauer (D-OR).The act was immediately sent to the House Ways and Means committee for review. It has since been co-sponsored by dozens of Democratic lawmakers, though no Republicans have signed onto the bill.While the legislation would have originally offered a 30% tax credit, recent amendments to the bill by the House Ways and Means committee cut the proposed tax credit in half to just 15%.Congressman Panetta explained to Bicycle Retailer that the move was frustrating, but represented progress in getting the legislation approved. He also expressed how it has helped raise the important issue of the benefit of e-bikes altogether.According to Panette:“As President Biden said the other day, legislating is frustrating. My attitude was, OK, let’s take what we can get and start the conversation. E-bikes are being talked about in Washington, D.C., just like EVs, just like E-buses. Before that bill, trust me, in Washington, D.C., especially with some of my members on both sides of the aisle, that wasn’t in their vernacular. And now e-bikes are.”The bill has now been passed to the House Budget Committee for continued review.In the updated bill, a 15% tax credit would be available for the purchase of an e-bike up to $5,000, meaning a maximum credit of $750. The new bill also puts income limits on the eligibility. According to the proposed legislation, the tax credit would begin phasing out “starting at $75,000 of modified adjusted gross income ($112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married filing jointly) at a rate of $200 per $1,000 of additional income. For a given taxable year, the taxpayer may use modified adjusted gross income for that year or the immediately preceding year, whichever is lower.”Panetta further explained how this was still in fact a victory as it moved the bill closer to adoption:“We all enjoy riding the conventional bike, but the e-bike adds that different little aspect, that little kick that when you see that hill, next thing you know you’re flying up it. It’s energizing. But what I realize is it’s not about recreation. We have to start getting people to think about it as transportation. And that’s how we’re looking at this e-bike incentive bill we have in Washington, D.C. That’s what we’re hoping for. Trust me, we’d love to have the 30%, but at this point, I thought it was necessary to take the win as it is in order to continue the conversation of getting more butts on bikes. I told my wife once I pass this legislation I’m going to treat myself to an e-bike. It will be self-gratifying to do that.”Electrek will continue to report on updates to the E-BIKE Act as it works its way through congress.",ebikes
2021/10/13,"Super73’s reputation precedes itself, with the company known as much for its SoCal lifestyle image as its hot-selling electric moped-style bikes. I’ve ridden my fair share of Super73 e-bikes and I enjoyed every one of them so far. And so when the company offered me the chance to test out their newest model, the Super73-ZX, I was there in a flash. The company invited me out to a press event at the Petersen automotive museum in Los Angeles to experience the new format for Super73’s popular entry-level Z-series.I’ve tested almost all of Super73’s models over the years, and recently returned from a two-week trip in Germany where I was able to check out some of the most aggressive models in the company’s lineup.But in addition to the crazy-powerful, full-suspension, and giant-battery versions they offer, they also have more mild models starting at much more reasonable prices.I tested the company’s most affordable model, the Super73-Z1, almost two years ago. While it was mostly great, my biggest gripe was that the hard seat that wasn’t as comfortable as the plush ones on Super73’s other rides.Much to my delight, the Super73-ZX greeted me with a brand-new seat design that was much more comfortable. It still keeps the same shape and design that I liked (mostly because it just looks so awesome), but it added in some much-needed quality foam. You can see the new seat and so much more in my test ride video below.But that wasn’t the only change. Just under the seat I found a larger battery that was actually removable. This was another big improvement over the Z1, since the battery could both go farther and actually come off the bike for easier charging. As someone who lives in an apartment and can’t just pull my bike into a garage to charge, removable batteries are a must. So I’m glad to see Super73 got with the program and brought the removable battery to their only model without one.The extra range from the 615 Wh battery means the fun riding can go on even longer. And since the bike is definitely a throttle-optimized bike, a big battery is even more important.There’s pedal assist as well as throttle control, but Super73 e-bikes have always been throttle-first affairs. After riding a pedal-assist-only Super73 in Germany (where EU laws don’t allow throttles), I was actually surprised at how pedal-friendly it turned out to be. When I returned to the US and they put a throttle back in my hand, I was certainly glad to have it. If you really enjoy pedaling, though, you’ll be happy to know that Super73 offers an optional 10-speed transmission. But for me, that throttle is too much fun and I don’t often find myself pedaling on these moped-style e-bikes.When it comes to suspension, that’s another optional upgrade. Super73 can add a suspension fork to the ZX for more cash, but to be honest, I don’t think you’ll need it. I tested the standard version without suspension, and I found the giant 4-inch fat tires to be all the shock absorption I need.My wife joined me for the test ride, and she found the bike to be plenty comfortable as is. She’ll never read this so I can come right out and say it: She’s a bit particular when it comes to bicycle comfort and is hard to please in the e-bike department. Unlike me, a happy idiot that’s just glad to be riding, she is much more discerning. So the fact that she found the bike so comfortable says a lot. As she described it, it was a combination of a comfortable ride and smooth power. She’s not normally a speed freak, but she was definitely having fun with the 1,300W of peak power in the Super73-ZX. Hitting speeds of up to 28 mph on a bike like this will bring a smile to anyone’s face.Technically the bike is listed as 750W nominal, which keeps it street legal in its first three models as either a Class 2 or Class 3 e-bike. It can reach speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle and 28 mph (45 km/h) when you add in pedaling. Or you can put it in mode 4 and just enjoy ripping on the throttle up to its 28 mph max speed, no pedaling required.It’s hard to really ding the Super73-ZX anywhere. It’s fast, it’s powerful, it’s comfortable, it’s fun. What’s not to like? And now that the ergonomics have gotten a big upgrade, it’s easier than ever to ride.At its current price of $1,995, I might have liked to have seen some hydraulic disc brakes, but the mechanical brakes still worked great. My wife’s small hands seemed fine on them. So while I generally like to see juice brakes at this price point, the Super73-ZX seems to get along just fine with the mechanical Tektro brakes.And at 62 lb (28.4 kg), it’s not even that heavy, either (at least by e-bike standards). The aluminum frame helps keep the weight down and the minimalist design means you aren’t lugging around a bunch of extra metal with you. It’s still not going to be as light as a cute little folding bike if you ever need to lug it onto a subway, but it’s not really that kind of bike, either.This is for anyone who wants an old school moped experience on an e-bike platform. A wind-in-your-hair, cruising the open road on your classic moped vibe without having to mix up some two-stroke gas or kick-start your bike. It’s old school meets new school, combining the classic charm that Super73 has nailed and the modern e-bike tech that brings all this power and range at affordable prices. In fact, I’d say it’s exactly the kind of urban electric ride that Harley-Davidson wishes it could deliver, but that today’s generation is flocking to Super73 for. And I can see why.",ebikes
2021/10/12,"VanMoof has just announced a new high-speed electric bicycle model known as the VanMoof V, which will reach speeds of up to 31 mph (50 km/h). The company is referring to it as a “hyperbike,” which makes sense considering it is faster than just about any other e-bike available in the US or Europe.VanMoof is largely known as an elegant, tech-forward electric bicycle brand. The Dutch company’s sleek, classy-looking e-bikes are heavy on the tech side but don’t attempt to win any awards on performance.That makes today’s announcement of a high-speed electric bicycle all the more suprising.VanMoof says we should still expect the company’s signature tech to be found in the new e-bike, including features like a Turbo Boost button, the Kick Lock that allows riders to lock their bikes without a key, automatic shifting, and theft deterrence via GPS tracking.But the real innovations on the performance side come in the hardware.To reach that high top speed of 31 mph (50 km/h), VanMoof has opted for two motors. With one motor in each wheel, VanMoof will use an intelligent controller to “enhance traction for safety and performance.”The bike also sports full-suspension, with what appears to be an inverted front fork and a single-pivot rear suspension setup.True to VanMoof design, the bike’s frame uses sleek straight tubes to create an elegant-looking bike, even if the VanMoof V hides away a lot more power under the hood than all of the VanMoof bikes that came before it.The company explained that the decision to develop such a high-speed electric bicycle was driven by the goal of replacing cars as the dominant form of transportation in cities. E-bikes offer a number of advantages over cars, such as free parking, the ability to avoid traffic via bike lanes, fresh air, and added exercise. But when cars aren’t held up in traffic, they can often travel faster than e-bikes – especially slower 15 mph (25 km/h) EU-compliant e-bikes.Faster e-bikes help solve one of the main downfalls of conventional bikes – that they sometimes can’t keep up with the speed of urban traffic.As VanMoof cofounder Ties Carlier explained:“The VanMoof V is our first hyperbike, an e-bike dedicated to higher speed and longer distance. I believe this new type of high-speed e-bike can fully replace scooters and cars in the city by 2025. We’re calling for policies designed around people, rethinking how public spaces can be used if not occupied by cars. I am getting very excited thinking about what a city could look like in the near future, and we are very proud to be part of the change by building the right tools for the transition.”The VanMoof V is currently still in the engineering stage, and the company expects it to begin deliveries by the end of next year.The price has already been set at US $3,598, and an invite-only pre-order period has just opened for riders to put down a $20 deposit to hold their spot in line. Invites are going out first to current VanMoof riders, and then others will be added to the waitlist on VanMoof’s website as time goes on.Color me interested!I’ve never hidden my love for fast e-bikes, and so this tickles me in all the right ways.That being said, there’s a lot of questions left unanswered. How much battery capacity? How much motor power? Will the VanMoof V be registerable as a moped? When will VanMoof be sending Micah Toll a sample to review? People are asking the important questions.I also find the 31 mph speed to be a bit of a head-scratcher. Sure, 50 km/h is a nice round number. But in most US states there is a limit of 28 mph for Class 3 e-bikes. And in Europe most speed pedelec e-bikes are limited to the same equivalent figure (45 km/h).But considering that VanMoof’s engineers have over a year to finish the e-bike, I imagine small details like those will be figured out. It’s not hard to implement 20 mph and 28 mph software speed limits to keep the bike street legal in various jurisdictions. All told, this sounds very intriguing, and I can’t wait to see more progress from VanMoof. The idea of using faster e-bikes to replace cars in cities is an argument I’ve been making for years and is beginning to be embraced by the major manufacturers. Small, fast-moving electric vehicles are simply more space and energy efficient (not to mention more fun!).In fact, I wrote a whole manifesto about how e-bikes can save not just our cities, but our entire world.At least someone was listening.",ebikes
2021/10/11,"The Swiss electric bicycle company FLYER has announced that it is entering the North American market with several of its popular e-bike models.While not as well known yet in the US, the company has been active in Europe for over 25 years.With over two and a half decades of e-bike building experience, FLYER was one of the first names in the game when e-bikes were still little-understood rarities.  The company’s model line spans e-bikes built for everything from the road to the mountains.For the North American market, FLYER will be bringing its Uproc6 off-road enduro e-bike, Upstreet1 urban electric bike for city riding, Upstreet2 folding e-bike, and the FLYER Tandem e-bike. As FLYER’s CTO Christian Müller explained:“We see a great potential for e-bikes and the FLYER brand in the USA and Canada. We are convinced that plenty of people here will be wowed by our sporty FLYER mountain e-bikes as well as our modern and versatile urban models. Not only is the mountain e-bike sport slowly but surely becoming increasingly attractive in the USA and Canada, more and more North Americans are also discovering the e-bike for everyday use and leisure time in cities.We recently had the chance to test out the FLYER Tandem e-bike at the Eurobike 2021 tradeshow in Friedrichshafen, Germany. There we took it on a test ride to get a feel for the bike.With two Bosch batteries and a pair of Gates Carbon Drive belts, the bike certainly felt like it was built to Swiss standards. Of course at €7,999 (approximately US $9,260), it was also priced like a Swiss bike.FLYER isn’t the only European brand making its way to the US recently.Several popular European e-bike makers have eyed the growing US market, and specifically the growing high-end segment of the market.Dutch-based VanMoof and Germany’s Riese & Müller have operated for years in the US, but other competitors such as Belgium-based Cowboy recently announced plans to enter the North American market.With so many low-cost electric bicycles on the market in the US, the European manufacturers are largely focused on the higher end of the market where margins are more attractive and competition is less.",ebikes
2021/10/07,"San Diego-based Ride1Up has now opened orders for its low-cost electric gravel bike, the Roadster V2 Gravel Edition.Electric gravel bikes share many similarities with road e-bikes, but have more rugged construction and dual on/off-road tires to better cope with the variety of riding terrain seen in gravel bikes. Most electric gravel bikes cost upwards of $3,000, with some priced significantly more expensive.The Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition bucks that trend with a low price of just $1,245. It also bucks a number of other trends in the gravel bike industry, such as by offering a Gates carbon belt drive instead of a chain.The rear motor means that the bike is a single-speed, which is yet another unique design decision among the many electric gravel bikes out there. Despite their typical disadvantages on hills, single-speed drivetrains have become popular on e-bikes due to the added motor assist that makes those grueling first few pedal turns more manageable. Even hills are easier with single-speed drivetrains thanks to that added motor power.Now the most affordable belt drive gravel e-bike on the market is finally available for order, though shipping won’t start for another two months. To grab it, you’ll have to visit the page for Ride1Up’s standard $1,045 Roadster V2, then select the option for the $1,245 Gravel Edition e-bike (indicated by the colored circles). The bike is also available in two frame sizes for both larger and smaller riders.The extra $200 over the road version of the bike comes from a few parts upgrades, including gravel tires, disc brakes and a Gates carbon belt drive.That Gates belt drive is likely the key upgrade here. The standard Roadster V2 also offers a belt drive, but it isn’t the same quality as the upgraded Gates belt drive, which are known to last for as much as 50,000 miles or more.Just in case you need a refresher, belt drives on e-bikes have a number of advantages.Chains have enjoyed well over 100 years being the main form of drive technology on bicycles. But belts are coming into their own on high-end e-bikes designed for the city, hybrid, comfort riding, utility and other non-mountain e-bikes from just about every premium manufacturer out there.It makes sense, since belts have so many assets over chains. They are smoother operating and quieter, leading to a more pleasant cycling experience (especially in nature!). They are maintenance free, meaning you never need to oil them or worry about a stuck link. They won’t get your pants leg or ankle all dirty and greasy. And they last longer too, with some Gates belts rated for 50,000 miles (80,000 km) or more.I previously reviewed the Roadster V2, and it is an awesome ride… as long as you enjoy pedaling. Unlike powerful throttle-enabled e-bikes, this is a lower-power pedal assist e-bike that is designed to give you a nice boost, but still requires some good old-fashioned honest sweat equity. The 350W continuous-rated motor (with 500 watts of peak power) still gives plenty of boost in its highest power mode, but offers a more gentle assist in the lower power levels. The 252 Wh battery is small enough to be completely hidden in the frame, yet still offers enough capacity for around 20-35 miles (32-56 km) of range depending on your power mode. But the real kicker is that the thing only weighs 32 lb. (14.5 kg)!Now that the bike has been reworked as a gravel e-bike, off-road adventures are now in the cards – though perhaps moderately rugged off-road adventures.",ebikes
2021/10/06,"Bicycles being used as military tools are nothing new, going back decades and serving across several wars. Electric bicycles with the special forces though, now that’s something relatively novel and a sign of the times.Electric bicycles are more popular than ever before, and their success has now made its way into the military.Bucking the traditional pipeline of military-to-civilian technology innovation, several militaries have begun adopting consumer-level electric bicycles for tactical use.At least three national militaries – including Denmark, the UAE, and one unnamed European NATO member – are now testing electric bicycles in their paratrooper and special forces units, according to iNews.Multiple countries have focused on a single model of e-bike that we’ve seen before.That model, unveiled in early 2020, was jointly branded by Quietkat and Jeep.The full-suspension fat tire e-bike features nearly 5-inch fat tires and packs in a Bafang Ultra motor, known to supply over 1,500 watts of power in peak output.That motor also puts out 160 Nm of chain-ripping torque.It’s the kind of motor you’d probably want for a bike carrying 190 lb. of commando and another 70 lb. of gear up a mountain. While the bikes are largely stock, they feature some special upgrades intended for their more mission-critical use. Those include weapon holders and portable fold-out solar panels that can help recharge the bikes in the field.This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about e-bikes getting drafted into the military. Starting several years ago we began to see fat tire electric bicycles being employed by various armed forces for patrol uses, where they can quietly access areas without alerting others to their presence the way gas-powered motorcycles would.For more high-power uses, electric motorcycles are also starting to become a favorite for stealthy yet powerful two-wheeled transport in the military.The New Zealand Defence Forces began testing UBCO’s electric utility bikes last summer, using the motorcycles for patrol roles.Police also often employ electric motorcycles as more efficient alternatives to gas-powered motorcycles.We saw a rather comical case of an electric Zero police motorcycle pulling over a Tesla in what was dubbed by the officer as “the quietest police pursuit ever.”Many other police departments are now hopping on the electric motorcycle bandwagon too.",ebikes
2021/10/05,"Electric bicycle sales had been growing at an impressive rate in the US even before the COVID-19 pandemic began. But ever since the pandemic started, sales of e-bikes have skyrocketed. Now the latest numbers show that e-bikes sales aren’t cooling off anytime soon.The latest figures were compiled by NPD and indicate a growth rate for electric bicycles of 240% in the 12 months leading up to July 2021.Interestingly, though, general cycling equipment only grew at a rate of 15%, showing that electric bicycles are leading the overall growth in the cycling industry.And making this all the more impressive is that these figures show growth on top of the tremendous increase in sales we saw at the beginning of the pandemic nearly two years ago.While some worried we might have been looking at an e-bike bubble of new riders rushing out to buy e-bikes after the first lockdowns lifted in early 2020, we’ve seen sustained and unprecedented growth in the e-bike industry.While the pandemic reversed several years of slumping non-electric bike sales and finally sent the category back into the growth column, e-bikes saw their existing growth double, triple, and even quadruple in many cases.The increased ease of electric bicycles has convinced many drivers and public transportation riders to finally switch to two-wheels by removing the biggest hurdle: the large perceived effort of cycling.While studies have shown that e-bikes can still offer nearly as much exercise as pedal bikes (and sometimes even more, believe it or not), the added benefit of pedal assist means that riders don’t show up to work drenched in sweat like typical pedal cyclists. Throttle-enabled e-bikes available in North America have taken that advantage one step further, offering the ability to travel by bike at speeds up to 20 mph (32 km/h) with minimal or even no pedaling at all. And since throttle-enabled e-bikes also feature pedal assist, riders can always rely more on pedal power to add in as much exercise as they want. Those advantages get added on top of the huge commuting time savings offered by e-bikes in urban areas, where bike lanes offer speedy shortcuts past gridlocked traffic.Despite the pandemic sending e-bike sales into overdrive, pricing has stayed relatively consumer-friendly.When e-bikes initially began selling like hot cakes in early 2020, nearly every e-bike supplier was left with empty shelves and warehouses.Instead of price gouging, companies largely kept e-bike prices steady in the US. Many brands saw extended lead times, but there were almost zero cases of price gouging.As the pandemic wore on, though, increased pressures on pricing including shipping container shortages, skyrocketing sea freight prices, increased cost of raw materials, and a worsening US/RMB exchange rate led to many retailers slowly walking up their prices.As some of the largest influencers of pricing showed signs of stabilizing, many retailers have already begun to lower their e-bike prices back down to pre-pandemic levels.Such pricing moves come at a time when many brands are introducing new models to the market.Rad Power Bikes unveiled an interesting new sub-$1,000 e-bike early in the pandemic that targeted the urban commuter market. That quickly became a key demographic that grew sharply when commuters began searching for a socially distant alternative to crowded public transportation.Many other companies such as VanMoof, GoCycle, and Cowboy have also targeted this key commuter demographic with more premium models designed to safely and quickly move commuters around cities while offering more sophisticated electronics and features.At the same time, many more recreational-oriented e-bikes have been introduced over the last few months, such as the fat tire Aventon Aventure e-bike and the new Rad Power Bikes RadRover 6 Plus, as well as new moped-style e-bikes like the updated Super73-ZX.With a number of interesting new e-bikes hitting the market and a public that has shown no slowdown in demand for electric biking, continued growth of the segment is all but certain in the near future.Have you considered hopping on an electric bike soon for recreation or as an alternative to car trips? Or have you already seen the light? Let us know in the comment section below!",ebikes
2021/10/03,"When it comes to belt drives in the e-bike industry, Gates is the undisputed leader. And those quality drives usually come at a high cost, but now we’re seeing the lowest-priced Gates carbon belt drive-equipped e-bike yet: the new Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition.Just in case you need a refresher, belt drives on e-bikes have a number of advantages.Chains have enjoyed well over 100 years as the main form of drive technology on bicycles.

Many are well over that figure.But the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel Edition just may be the most affordable e-bike yet to feature a Gates belt drive, coming in at just $1,245.The Gravel Edition is an upgrade to the base level Roadster V2, a $1,045 e-bike that also features a belt drive, though not made by Gates.The Gravel Edition of the bike was just announced this weekend and won’t go on sale until next week, where it will come with an estimated shipping timeline of December 2021.The bike is so affordable because it is built around the budget-oriented Roadster V2, which is a pedaling-optimized low-power electric bike. I previously reviewed the Roadster V2 and it is an awesome ride… as long as you enjoy pedaling (see my review video below). Unlike powerful throttle-enabled e-bikes, this is a lower power pedal assist e-bike that is designed to give you a nice boost, but still requires some good old fashioned honest sweat equity. The 350W continuous-rated motor (with 500 watts of peak power) still gives plenty of boost in its highest power mode, but offers a more gentle assist in the lower power levels. The 252 Wh battery is small enough to be completely hidden in the frame, yet still offers enough capacity for around 20-35 miles (32-56 km) of range depending on your power mode. But the real kicker is that the thing only weighs 32 lb (14.5 kg)!(Note that the $995 price mentioned in the video above was the original promotional price upon release – it’s now up to $1,045, which is still way underpriced in my opinion).The Roadster V2 has those skinny road tires that you’ll find on most fitness or hipster-style commuter bikes, and so it isn’t really meant for off-road riding.But since gravel e-bikes make up such a booming category, Ride1Up has reworked the Roadster V2 into the Gravel Edition, paving the way (or graveling it?) for off-road fun.The rim brakes are replaced by mechanical disc brakes to give better stopping power, the tires are upgraded to true gravel tires and the bike sports a new “updated contemporary geometry”.But the biggest update is the replacement of the off-brand belt drive with a true Gates Carbon Drive system. That gives you the dependability of a Gates belt at a price that’s never been seen before.So how did Ride1Up do it? Basically, by offering less bike than most other Gates-equipped e-bikes. Gates drives usually go on top dollar e-bikes. I’m talking $5,000 Terns and $7,000 Riese & Müllers.But Ride1Up bucked that trend and brought the top shelf drive to a mid-shelf e-bike, saving money with less battery, a smaller motor and a minimalist display. Keep in mind that the Roadster V2 is also a single-speed e-bike with a rear hub motor, and thus you aren’t paying for a fancy internally geared hub and mid-drive motor that is normally paired with a belt drive system. This might sound like a strange choice at first – a single speed e-bike for gravel – but I’ve actually been doing exactly that with my own single-speed e-bike, the RadMission. This is another low-cost single-speed e-bike (this one is just $999) and I’ve been using it as my main trail bike. Keep in mind that I’m talking fairly smooth gravel roads and nature trails – not technical downhill single track. But the added assist of an electric motor means that I don’t need those lower gears, and the single ratio has been fine for me.So while the single-speed design may be a turnoff for some riders, I haven’t found it to hamper my style. I’m looking forward to testing out this new edition of the Roadster V2 as soon as I can beg, borrow or steal one to get my hands on the new e-bike.Until then, let’s hear your thoughts on the new Roadster V2 Gravel Edition in the comment section below.",ebikes
2021/10/01,"Electric cargo bikes are one of the most fascinating e-bike categories to me because of just how much creativity exists in the industry and how much utility the e-bikes offer. The EUNORAU G20 e-bike embraces the prototypical longtail cargo e-bike style yet adds new upgrades to the 2021 model, including a second battery for even longer range.While there are plenty of affordable longtail cargo e-bikes out there, most use hub motors to help bring that price down.Hub motors are great options for electric bikes to reduce the cost with simple, tried-and-true motors. But for those that are prepared to pay a bit of a premium, mid-drive motors offers some unique upgrades over hub motors.The problem is that mid-drive motors typically drive the price of e-bikes much higher – but not in the EUNORAU G20. This cargo e-bike manages to slip in a mid-drive motor while stiff offering hub motor prices.Make sure you take a look at my test ride video of the EUNORAU G20 below, then keep scrolling for my complete review.The big difference between the EUNORAU G20 mid-drive cargo e-bike and most other mid-drive cargo e-bikes is the price. At between $2,099 to $2,539, the G20 is around half the cost of most mid-drive cargo e-bikes and more in line with the pricing of hub motor cargo e-bikes.The EUNORAU G20 is able to offer a mid-drive motor at lower prices than most because they turned to an Asian motor OEM known as DAPU. It isn’t as well known as the usual suspects like Bosch or Brose, but I’ve found the motor to work quite well in my own testing. And the fact that it doesn’t come with a German price tag is a major advantage. Don’t get me wrong, I love a nice Tern e-bike with a powerful Bosch motor. But I don’t have $5,000 or more burning a hole in my pocket right now, so sign me up for a DAPU motor, please!Another cool advantage of going with an Asian mid-drive motor is that you get a throttle, since they aren’t limited to pedal-assist-only operation like the European motor manufacturers.There’s something almost trippy about throttle-enabled mid-drives because you can look down while using throttle to see your chainring spin while your feet are staying still, but the sheer fun of it helps you get used to it pretty quickly.I’m a huge proponent of throttles on cargo electric bikes. I accept that many people don’t want a throttle because they treat their e-bike as a combination fitness/transport solution. That’s great. More power to you. But why not have the option? Even when I’m pedaling the G20, having that throttle to get rolling for the first few pedal turns is a big benefit.The throttle is also super helpful for those times that you forget to downshift before coming to a stop. Getting rolling in high gear is a doozy on any bike, especially a loaded-down cargo e-bike. So I think the option of choosing throttle or pedal assist is a big win here.While the G20 has great “go,” its “stop” could use some work. The brake levers and calipers themselves are fine for mechanical brakes, but the brake pads feel like two pieces of wood clamping down on the steel disc rotors. EUNORAU could have spent a few extra bucks to put better pads in the brake calipers, that’s for sure. At least it’s an easy swap, and brake pads are a consumable part, meaning you’ll be changing them anyway. But I’d recommend changing them sooner rather than later and putting in some better pads than the stock ones they provide.When it comes to cargo e-bikes, a double kickstand is a must, and the G20 delivers there with a Y kickstand. The Y shape is much sturdier and helps keep the bike steady with a heavy load when parked. The only problem with the G20’s kickstand is that the pivot is mounted so freaking low, leaving the bulk of it hanging pretty close to the ground. I smacked it several times when hopping curbs, to the point where it loosened up and I had to retighten it after the first week or so of riding. I started getting better about looking for ramps, but let’s be honest – sometimes city riding requires getting creative. You don’t always have a nice smooth transition between surfaces and the occasional curb must be hopped. If I have to ding the G20 on its low-mounted kickstand, then the bike earns those points right back with the display. The G20 uses an easy to read LED display with a dark background and bright numerical segments that you can read in just about any setting. You never have to worry about looking down to check your speed or battery and being unable to read the screen due to the glaring sun.Speaking of that battery, you won’t have to check it too often if you go with the updated dual battery option because the two packs just last so dang long. A second benefit of the dual battery model is that using the throttle doesn’t ding you as much in the range department. Throttle riding still drains battery quicker than pedal-assist, but the second battery means you don’t feel the consequences so quickly. The single 550 Wh battery version of the bike (we reviewed the previous edition of that model in the past) is likely to get you around 20-25 miles (32-40 km) on throttle only. You might get perhaps twice that much if you’re good about using medium-level pedal assist. But with two batteries, you can more than double both ranges (since that second battery is actually higher capacity at 672 Wh).The bike is decently fast at 25 mph (40 km/h), which feels like plenty when you’re carrying cargo or kids in the back. The G20 works equally well for both, but I recommend adding some deck pads if you want to bring kids back there. The wooden platform looks great but isn’t exactly kind on the rear end. Carrying heavy cargo or boxes piled tall can put the weight up a bit high, but the 24-inch tires at least lower the weight somewhat compared to cargo e-bikes with 26-inch wheels. Other electric cargo bikes like the RadWagon recently made the shift from 26-inch wheels to smaller diameter alternatives, and it really makes a big difference when you’ve got a bunch of cargo back there.For the most part I’ve been quite happy with the EUNORAU G20. It’s a fully functional cargo e-bike that even packs in some neat features like the folding handlebar stem that would allow you to more easily slide it in the back of a van or SUV. The bike even provides the benefits and most of the performance of a typical mid-drive long tail cargo e-bike but at around half the price – just a mere $2,099. If you go with the dual battery model, you’ll have to fork over a bit more at $2,539 – but that’s still a song compared to a nearly $6,000 dual-battery Tern GSD.But then again, the quality certainly doesn’t compare to bikes that are twice the price. Not only are the components lower quality, such as the mechanical disc brakes or the off-brand motor. Plus there are obvious shortcomings with the assembly, such as one of the bolts on the wooden running board being not tightened down all the way and stripped out. It’s apparent that the worker on the assembly line couldn’t get the bolt flush, stripped it out trying to drive it deeper, then shrugged and moved on to the next bolt. It doesn’t affect the functionality at all and is just an aesthetic issue, but it’s an example of the difference in fit and finish you’ll find between the budget-level and more expensive e-bikes.All told, I’d say the G20 is a great option for someone that wants a mid-drive cargo e-bike but doesn’t want to pay the high prices that such bikes normally carry. The mid-drive is a huge advantage with hills and for anyone who really wants to pedal the bike, but the price is still much closer to hub motor e-bikes. It strikes a great balance for the budget-minded shopper, and it definitely gets a recommendation from me, even if it isn’t as nice as the bikes it imitates. ",ebikes
2021/09/30,"Hot-rodding, hacking, or e-bike tampering – call it whatever you’d like. But Europe’s major electric bicycle companies are doing everything they can to prevent riders from finagling more speed from their e-bikes.Most e-bike companies in Europe have been against the practice of e-bike hacking for as long as they’ve sold e-bikes. But now the industry is getting more organized about it.Under the Confederation of European Bicycle Industry (CONEBI), 15 national bicycle industry associations in Europe and 68 companies have signed onto an industry-wide commitment to prevent owners from hacking their e-bikes for more speed and power.The signatories include major e-bike motor manufacturers such as Bafang, Bosch, Brose, and Shimano.Other large manufacturers of electric bicycles that also signed onto the letter include Giant, GoCycle, Haibike, Gazelle, Riese & Müller, Specialized, Tern, and Trek.As explained in the letter:The members of CONEBI speak out against any kind of manipulation of e-bikes and e-bike drive systems, e.g. to increase the performance or the maximum supported speed. Riding manipulated e-bikes on public roads may not only lead to technical problems but also result in serious legal consequences. Tampering kits and other types of manipulation can damage the drive system as well as the bike itself. Riders risk losing their guarantee and invalidating their warranty claims. If an accident occurs with a tampered e-bike, it may result in high liability costs as well as criminal prosecution.As part of the commitment to preventing e-bike hacking, the signatories to the letter committed to taking a number of steps.The group committed to re-evaluating current anti-tampering standards to determine if they were still “fit for the purpose” as well as to continuously work on “improving e-bike drive systems to make tampering more difficult.”The issue of e-bike hacking in Europe receives greater attention due to the much lower speed and power limits for electric bicycles compared to other areas of the world.In Europe, most e-bikes are limited to power levels of 250W and speeds of up to 25 km/h (15.5 mph).Most untrained riders and even many children can generate 250W of muscle power when pedaling, and the slow speed limit of e-bikes in Europe means that many e-bike riders are routinely passed by pedal cyclists on fitness/road bikes. In practice, most European motor manufacturers actually exceed the 250W power limit because it is difficult to measure and enforce. Top-end motors from companies like Bosch can actually produce well over 250W of power in their peak output settings. Speed is much easier to measure and enforce on the side of the road, and thus almost all European electric bicycles are limited to sluggish 25 km/h (15.5 mph) speeds.Speed pedelec classes for 45 km/h (28 mph) e-bikes exist in some areas in Europe, but they often require the faster e-bikes to be registered, carry a license plate, and disallow them from using bicycle lanes. Such restrictions remove many of the advantages of e-bikes and have led to a tiny fraction of e-bikes in Europe exceeding the 25 km/h (15.5 mph) limits.This has resulted in many riders seeking out and discovering ways to increase the speed of their e-bikes. We’ve even covered products that make this is a simple and easy task.Many companies have already begun cracking down on the practice, and Bosch even introduced an update that would lock the bike’s motor if the rider tried to repeatedly hack it for more speed. Some countries, such as France, have made hacking e-bikes an offense that could be punishable by jail time.While many riders are simply looking for more speed to get where they’re going faster, safety concerns regarding faster e-bikes have led to this pushback from the industry. Pedestrians have been hit and killed by hacked e-bikes that were traveling faster than manufacturers intended.In addition to the tragedy of such events, manufacturers fear that such instances could eventually lead to increased regulation of electric bicycles or classification as motorcycles instead of bicycles.Steps such as this self-commitment letter are an indication that the industry is now becoming even more serious about self-regulating to prevent such measures in the future.As someone who often rides e-bikes in the US and gets to enjoy the 20 mph and 28 mph (32 km/h and 45 km/h) speed limits of Class 2 and Class 3 e-bikes, I feel the pain of European e-bike hackers, but I also certainly understand the safety ramifications of faster vehicles.The issue is that this isn’t a matter of e-bikes, it’s a matter of fast bikes. Period. A common argument against e-bikes is that they weigh more and thus a potential crash is more dangerous.A typical battery and motor add around 5-6 kg to a bike. So I don’t buy the argument that we need to keep e-bikes slower because they weigh more, especially when the weight difference is somewhere around 5-8% of the entire rider/bike system. That 5 kg can be the same as a pedal bike rider who can’t exercise self-control in the candy store. If anyone really believed in the merit of that argument, they’d advocate for selling a scale with e-bikes and force heftier riders to use a slower speed limit. The variation in human weights is simply much larger than the variation in bicycle/e-bicycle weights.What I do think is that there should be bicycle speed limits in mixed-use areas, regardless of the type of bike. Pedestrians and cyclists shouldn’t really be forced to share paths anyways, but since many cities are forced to retrofit their non-car transportation systems, mixed-use paths are an inevitable result for the time being. Thus, bikes should simply have speed limits in high traffic areas of cities to protect pedestrians. Post reasonable speed limits for bikes and ticket anyone who exceeds them. An e-bike might be perfectly safe traveling on the side of the road at 25 mph, but it would make sense to force the rider to slow down to half that speed in an area where pedestrians and cyclists are forced to share the same paths. In my opinion, location-based bicycle speed limits make much more sense than e-bike power limits. We don’t force car manufacturers to limit horsepower to 70 hp. We tell car drivers not to travel faster than 70 mph. Or 35 mph. Or whatever the safe speed is for a specific area. And that’s exactly the point – safety is relative. Creating a single power or speed limit that is built into the e-bike makes no sense if the argument is safety. Why not take a real step towards safety and actually put smart restrictions in place that make a larger impact on the safety of riders and pedestrians.As an added bonus, tickets for hooligan riders that exceed the safe speed limits in high-traffic areas can be issues and the money put towards building safer cycling infrastructure. Now that’s a plan. ",ebikes
2021/09/29,"Earlier this summer, BMW unveiled an interesting electric cargo bike known as the Dynamic Cargo Concept. It used a three-wheeler platform and novel tilting mechanism to make a more stable e-cargo trike.BMW said at the time that it had no plans to produce the design, but instead was seeking a partner to commercialize the concept. Fast forward several months and it appears BMW has found that partner in German bicycle company Cube.Cube announced this month that they have licensed the design from BMW and the bike company is now showing off its version of the tilting electric cargo trike.BMW’s original design featured a larger front wheel and two smaller rear wheels placed on either side of a modular rear cargo area. Typical bicycle-style pedals engaged the electric motor to provide powered assistance.The cargo area was designed to accommodate different cargo attachments for carrying various items, from packages to children.While most delta trikes (tricycles with the two wheels at the rear instead of the front) suffer from instability in turns, BMW designed the Dynamic Cargo to lean into turns. The frame pivots just forward of the rear wheels and cargo section, meaning the rider and front-wheel can lean into turns like a conventional bicycle.Cube took that idea and ran with it, turning BMW’s renderings into a real life e-bike… errr, e-trike.The titling design is key to the e-trike’s innovation and offers huge stability gains for the rider. There’s a limit to just how fast a typical rigid delta tricycle can take a turn, or how sharply it can turn even at lower speeds. That’s a fact that is known to anyone who has ever taken a turn too fast on a typical tricycle and felt like they were going to be thrown off the side – or worse, felt that inside wheel lifting up.BMW and Cube think that the Dynamic Cargo concept e-trike solves that issue for good, explaining:“Innovative design allows the front of the Concept Dynamic Cargo to lean naturally through corners while the rear, cargo-carrying part remains upright. The result is a natural ride feel, easy handling, super stability and a smooth ride for whatever you’re carrying.”The rear of the trike is also designed to accomodate a number of various utility-oriented tasks. Grocery shopping is often one of the key considerations for cargo bikes, offering an alternative to a car trunk for trips to the local market. But kid carriers and other cargo requirements are equally important to many riders, and Cube shows off how the rear cargo bed can be converted for a variety of different cargo tasks.Junior sitting in back may not get the benefit of the leaning mechanism, since the cargo remains firmly untiling, but at least the lower center of gravity of the rear cargo means it can corner at higher speeds than the upright-seated meat pilot upfront.When can you get your hands on one of Cube’s tiling e-trikes? The answer is unclear.Cube is still referring to the e-trike as a concept and hasn’t announced when it may see production. But the wording on Cube’s site says, “This is a concept bike whose serial production is not yet complete,” which sounds like they’re heading in that direction.There’s also no word on pricing yet, but don’t expect it to be in the budget column. Neither BMW nor Cube are known for low-cost vehicles, so we don’t expect this new ride to be any different.",ebikes
2021/09/28,"Italian design firm ARES is showing off its ARES Super Leggera electric bicycle, which it claims is the lightest electric bicycle in the world.The 9 kg (19.8 lb) electric road bike was produced in a partnership between the design firm ARES and High Performance Systems (HPS), an advanced engineering company that develops mobility technology.The heart of the Super Leggera e-bike is a 200-watt motor that is designed to provide a modest electrical assist to riders.An average human can generate 200 watts of power when pedaling a bicycle, so this certainly isn’t a high-powered solution. Instead, the “Watt Assist” system developed by HPS is intended to provide a slight boost to riders, helping take the edge off of hills by compensating with the assist level of a typical human rider.While HPS provided the technical know-how, ARES was responsible for the ultralight carbon fiber frame and components. The result is an ultralight electric road bike, as the company explained:“ARES and HPS have worked together for two years carrying out countless tests in the laboratory and covering many thousands of kilometers on the road, using the experience of former professional cyclists to fine-tune the dynamic qualities of this racing style e-bike. ARES managing the design of the frame and the finishes; HPS providing its expertise on the mechanical and engineering side. The result is a high-tech carbon fiber bike that doesn’t currently exist on the market: the ARES Super Leggera by HPS is a top-of-the-range e-bike weighing just 9kg, a world first.”ARES claims that the Super Leggera is the lightest electric bike yet, though the design firm may be a few grams off – and it also depends on how you count those grams.Technically we’ve seen lighter e-bikes, such as the 6.872 kg (15.15 lb) Freicycle electric bike. While that one is probably the lightest e-bike in the world right now, it was a custom DIY build, so it doesn’t really count when discussing production e-bikes.The HPS Domestique is probably the current lightest production electric bicycle at just 8.5 kg (18.7 lb) and thus edges out the ARES Super Leggera by around 500 grams. But then that weight also depends on whether you count some other key components in the total such as pedals (often a ‘bring your own’ affair in competitive cycling).ARES has certainly edged out the lightest models in other cycles niches though.Hummingbird has the lightest folding e-bike at 10.3 kg (22.7 lb), while Trek claims to have the lightest full-suspension electric mountain bike at 15.75 kg (34.72 lb).ARES is currently planning a limited first run of 24 Super Leggera e-bikes, putting the bicycles just on the production side of the grey area between boutique and custom. Such lightweight design and limited production comes at a cost though – in this case, the cost is €18,950. Yikes!That’s a big ask from a company that still hasn’t released a number of other key specs about the bike, such as battery capacity or major components.But when it comes to the claim of the world’s lightest electric bike, suffice it to say that ARES is definitely right there near the top of the list, even if there are technically a few lighter e-bikes riding around these days.via: ARES",ebikes
2021/09/27,"Cowboy has been a popular electric bicycle brand in Europe for several years now, and it’s finally making its US debut.We’ve been following the Belgian e-bike maker Cowboy since 2018, watching with interest as the company updated its sleek-looking electric bicycles year after year. Each new model has been defined by a modern, stylish design that often looks more expensive than it is.More recent updates to the line, such as the company’s latest C4 e-bike with higher torque motors and belt drives introduced this past summer, have pushed the prices higher into the $3,000-ish range.But now Cowboy is entering the US market and is doing so with a price tag that undercuts most of the other European electric bikes available in the states.Cowboy is bringing a single model to the US, its latest C4, but is offering it in both the step-over and step-through variants.And to make a splash upon its US debut, Cowboy is offering the C4 e-bike at a promotional price of just $1,990. [Update: The promotional pricing ended in early. December and the bike is back up to its $2,990 regular price].The US version of the bike reaches a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), maxing out the Class 1 speed limit. It doesn’t include a throttle, but instead offers torque sensor-based pedal assist. Hydraulic disc brakes quickly bring it back down to zero.The single-speed C4 uses a Gates carbon belt to transfer the rider’s pedal force to the rear wheel where the hub motor is housed. The 250W motor produces 45 Nm of torque to assist the rider.That motor is powered by a removable 360 Wh battery offering up to 43.5 miles (70 km) of range. It’s not a particularly powerful e-bike, but the smaller motor and battery help keep the weight down to just 41 lb (18.6 kg). And considering that weight includes a number of real-world commuter accessories like fenders, that’s a pretty decent weight.The bike also has several other interesting features. A wireless charger is housed in the bike’s handlebar riser. Once a user’s phone is docked on the handlebars via a magnetic holder, it can be charged wirelessly with up to 15W of power.Other smart features include remote unlocking when the Cowboy app senses you’re in close proximity to the bike, crash detection that can recognize a fall, and even connectivity features that help you connect with other Cowboy riders to compare riding stats.While the sleek design of the bike as well as its carbon belt drive are likely to garner interest in the US, the single-speed drivetrain may put off some riders in hillier areas. The added motor torque helps offset the lack of a low gear to drop into, and we’ve discussed previously how single-speed e-bikes are becoming much more popular, but some riders still enjoy having that shifter at hand.With a reasonable price tag for a high-tech European e-bike, Cowboy is poised to make a successful landing in the US, where it has very few other high-design European makers to compete with.What do you think of Cowboy’s C4 e-bike and its fancy new US price? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below.",ebikes
2021/09/24,"Harley-Davidson’s electric bicycle brand Serial 1 launched a limited edition e-bike known as the MOSH/TRIBUTE that has seen surprisingly fast sales despite its high sticker price.The bike features an eye-catching design that mimics the original design concept debuted by the brand back in late 2020.When Harley-Davidson announced that it was spinning off its electric bicycle program as a new electric bike startup known as Serial 1, the company made a splash by unveiling a stunning concept electric bicycle. Complete with white tires, glossy frame and leather accents, the vintage-inspired concept was designed with cues borrowed from Harley-Davidson’s first ever motorcycle produced over 100 years ago.Serial 1 ultimately followed up with production versions of electric bicycles that lost some of the fancy embellishments in favor of increased utility and realistic pricing.But last week the brand demonstrated that it never lost sight of its original concept. Serial 1 announced that a limited edition run of MOSH/TRIBUTE electric bicycles would be produced that more closely mimicked the original concept bike.Priced at $5,995, the MOSH/TRIBUTE bikes cost over $2,000 more than the standard Serial 1 MOSH/CTY bikes that they are based on.But that hasn’t hampered sales, as evidenced by the quick sellout of the bike. In less than a week, Serial 1 has sold out of all of the large size models that will be produced and the company indicated that the remaining medium size models are also nearly sold out. With only two frame sizes available, that means the limited edition Harley-Davidson electric bike is nearly gone for good.Serial 1 has indicated that there will be other limited edition e-bikes in its future as part of the new S1 series of custom and limited run e-bikes. But the MOSH/TRIBUTE may likely become one of the more collectible models due to its status as the first limited edition bike in the series.Sporting a Gates carbon belt drive, Brose S Mag motor and TRP hydraulic disc brakes, the MOSH/TRIBUTE includes the same major components as Serial 1’s other electric bikes. It also has the same specs, including its 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed and 529 Wh battery custom-developed by Harley-Davidson using technology gleaned from the H-D LiveWire electric motorcycle program.But in the aesthetic department, the MOSH/TRIBUTE is all its own. Key elements like the leather saddle and grips, brass accents, glossy paint, white tires and brown drive belt all contributed to the stunning aesthetics of the original vintage prototype.Based on the success of the MOSH/TRIBUTE model, we can likely expect to see more interesting designs coming in Harley-Davidson’s S1 series of limited edition e-bikes in the future.",ebikes
2021/09/22,"The RadCity 5 Plus e-bike from Rad Power Bikes has just been launched with a pile of new upgrades, making it the most extensive update to the RadCity electric commuter e-bike yet. The team at Rad kindly gave me the opportunity to get an early test ride on the new RadCity 5 Plus, and today I’m taking you along with me to see what makes this new e-bike tick.The new RadCity 5 Plus is the latest e-bike in Rad’s lineup to get the “Plus” treatment. That’s where Rad takes an existing e-bike and upgrades the quality and utility of the bike by adding new features and higher spec components.Earlier this summer we saw Rad Power Bikes do something similar with its most popular e-bike, the fat tire RadRover. When the new RadRover 6 Plus landed, we witnessed a slew of awesome new upgrades like hydraulic disc brakes, a new motor, upgraded display, sleeker semi-integrated battery, new lighting, and other improvements.Now Rad is following a similar path with the commuter-ready RadCity e-bike line. Both the RadCity step-over and RadCity step-through are getting a number of similar upgrades to create the RadCity 5 Plus edition.You can see my first ride experience on the new e-bike below, or you can keep reading for the complete run down. Or both!There are a pile of new updates to the RadCity that turn it into the RadCity Plus.The first and most obvious is a new battery. Just like the RadRover 6 Plus, the RadCity is getting Rad’s newly designed battery pack that slides down into the frame. Not only does that create a sleeker package by hiding away the battery, but it also frees up a lot more space in the triangle of the step-over frame. On the Step-through version, it allows the frame to be even more accessible with extra room to swing a leg through.The battery is still 672 Wh, which is on the larger size of the e-bike battery spectrum. It offers reasonable range of around 25-50 miles depending on if you’re ripping on the throttle or taking it easy with pedal assist. I’ve ridden plenty of Rad Power Bikes e-bikes and range has never been issue.The second major update that will likely catch the eye is the new motor. The last RadCity was the final holdout in the Rad lineup for direct drive motors. Those were big, dinner plate-size motors that took up a lot of space in the rear wheel. Now Rad has moved to a smaller, lighter but torquier geared hubmotor in the rear. The downside is that you lose the regenerative braking option (even though that gave back only marginal battery charge). The upside is… just about everything else. The new motor is lighter, smaller, better at hill climbing, and doesn’t look like such an eyesore in the rear wheel.I took the bike up some steep Seattle hills and the new motor worked great on both throttle-only and pedal assist riding. Rad claims a 40% increase in hill climbing speed and I believe them. The RadCity 5 Plus flew me up some super steep hills with an ease that surprised me.The last major eye-catching update is the pair of new LED displays. This is likely to be a divisive feature, but I’m a fan. The former simplistic LCD display has now been split into two LED displays. The main display is still in the center of the bars and offers up important data like speed, distance, power, etc.Then on the left bar end there’s a combined remote and display that provides less frequently used info like pedal assist level, battery charge, and headlight status. That’s all important data, but not something you’re constantly looking at. Most people check their battery level once in a while, and pedal assist level is kind of a set-it-and-forget-it thing. I also like that the functions being actuated by the buttons are located next to the buttons. For example, on the old screen you would click the button on the left bar end to change the pedal assist level, then have to look back to the display in the center of the bars to see if the level changed and what level you were in now. With the new system, that info is right next to the buttons, making it quicker and easier to use – no more hunting around with your eyes.Some people won’t like that there are more things taking up handlebar real estate, and I certainly get that. When you want to add your own lights, phone holders, and other aftermarket accessories, space on the bars is at a premium. But I do think the new displays are a well thought out and executed feature.All the electronics are nice and all, but what about the bike parts?In addition to the newly designed frame, the RadCity 5 Plus also gets some upgraded components. Chief among those upgrades are new hydraulic disc brakes.Even though mechanical disc brakes are absolutely fine for a 20 mph (32 km/h) e-bike, hydraulic disc brakes are simply a nicer upgrade. They require less maintenance since you don’t have to adjust cable lengths as they stretch. They require less force to get the same stopping power, meaning you can more easily one-finger brake to maintain better control of the handlebars. The levers are adjustable so riders with either small or large hands can dial them into a comfortable distance from the bars. And the brakes aren’t susceptible to cable rust or housing wear, which can cause bicycles to have non-responsive braking as the bike ages.Rad Power Bikes also includes higher-quality ceramic brake pads in the calipers, giving an even stronger bite and longer-lasting brakes. With brake pad replacement essentially the only maintenance item left with hydraulic brakes, longer maintenance intervals offered by ceramic pads push these brakes even closer to nearly zero-maintenance territory.The rear of the bike has also been reworked to create a bolt-on rack instead of a frame-integrated rack. That means you have more options for accessories and you also aren’t stuck with an unmodify-able rear end. If you ever banged up your frame-integrated rack on the old model, you were out of luck. With this setup, it can easily be replaced and thus increases the lifespan of the bike itself.New tires are also present on the RadCity 5 Plus. The puncture-resistant tires were re-engineered for the bike and supposedly offer an 11% increase in range. One change I’m not so sure how I feel about is the new suspension fork. The reduced travel makes the bike a bit lower and lighter, but it doesn’t have quite the same absorption range anymore. Of course this is a city bike, not a trail bike, and so the 60 mm travel RTS spring fork is probably adequate for the type of riding most people do.The previous RadCity had a bit more “mountain bike in a city” feel with that 80 mm travel fork, and so dropping down to a mere 60 mm is probably a good compromise, even if it means we don’t have quite the same amount of suspension as we used to have.Everything else about the bike is either pretty much the same or slightly better.The touch points like the saddle and handlebar grips are as good as ever. The frame is sleeker without the bulky battery and controller boxes hanging off. The adjustable stem makes it easy to find the most comfortable fit. The lower seat height opens the door to an ever wider range of riders, with Rad boasting of an extra 5″ of height range to the high-step model and an extra 2″ of height range for the step-through model. It’s all quite nicely engineered to improve upon what was already a great commuter electric bike.Priced at $1,799, it’s on the higher end of Rad’s lineup. But then again, we’re talking about a “Plus” series e-bike, and all of Rad’s more premium Plus models are going to come priced at a premium. With a wide range of e-bikes from $999 starter e-bikes to these new Plus models with higher-end components, Rad Power Bikes is swinging at and connecting with a huge swath of the market.For a massive company with in-person service covering most of the country, they’re making it pretty darn easy for as many riders as possible to make the Rad decision.",ebikes
2021/09/21,"Specialized has been in the electric bicycle game since 2009, making them one of the earlier entrants among mainstream bicycle companies. With all those years building premium e-bikes, they’ve had plenty of time to refine their technology. Now the company is showing off the latest generation of Full Power Turbo electric bikes with updated models of the Turbo Vado and Turbo Como bikes, plus a new model known as the Turbo Tero. We’ve seen Specialized give plenty of attention to its SL or “Super Light” e-bikes over the last two years.The company rolled out extra lightweight versions of the the Turbo Vado SL road/transport e-bike, the Turbo Creo SL fitness road bike, the Turbo Como SL city e-bike (a bike that we tested and loved), and the lightweight electric mountain bike known as the Turbo Levo SL.Those electric bikes saw Specialized hit new records for low weight and extreme portability, but at the cost of battery capacity and power.Now Specialized is returning to its roots with updates to several of its Full Power Turbo e-bikes that make no sacrifice in the watts or torque departments.As Specialized’s head of Turbo Business Dominik Geyer explained:“With the launch of our new Full Power Turbo lineup, we are excited to bring next-level performance to riders in their everyday lives. Our brand is committed to the development and implementation of innovative, new technologies that will better serve riders in all riding scenarios. We believe that bikes have the power to change lives and are focused on delivering the best possible riding experience to empower more everyday rides.”All of the new Full Power Turbo e-bikes in Specialized’s lineup include the company’s new MasterMind controller. In addition to serving as the brain of the e-bike, it also offers new features such as the Turbo System Lock designed to deter thieves. If the bike is stolen, owners can use their Mission Control phone app to remotely lock the bike’s motor and activate a motion alarm. Once the motor is locked, the bike is unusable until the original owner deactivates the lock.MasterMind also integrates a Garmin rear-facing radar on some models that can alert riders of approaching cars as far as 140 meters (460 feet away). The system uses visual, audible, and haptic feedback to alert the rider and can provide relative distance and speed data for approaching cars.The Specialized Turbo Vado is the combined road/fitness/urban transportation e-bike in the Specialized lineup. It’s not quite as Sunday Lycra as the Turbo Creo SL, and instead takes the road e-bike closer an everyday use e-bike.A more comfortable position puts the rider slightly more upright and provides a more nimble seating position. The inclusion of a front suspension fork also helps take the shock out of the road as riders navigate urban jungles.Speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) are possible thanks to three levels of motor assist from the Specialized 2.2 motor.The Turbo Como, on the other hand, heads much further into the comfort city bike direction, bordering on almost a step-through cruiser setup.The bike features an ultra-low step-through frame for easy mounts and dismounts. In fact, Specialized assures us that it’s the “lowest step-through design available on the market.”The Como also includes three levels of pedal assist and a top assisted speed of 45 km/h (28 mph), making it a Class 3 e-bike in the US.The Specialized Turbo Tera is a trail-focused electric bike that is designed for exploration. Specialized describes it as having the “heart of a mountain bike” as well as “added capabilities for utility trips.” The upright seating position and utility accessories like full-length fenders and rear rack give the bike more utility than just for trail-riding shenanigans. Just like the Turbo Vado and Como, the Tera’s rear rack can support up to 27 kg (60 lb.) of cargo, and the three bikes are rated to support a child seat as well as for pulling a through-axle trailer.A lower top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) on the Turbo Tera classifies the bike as a Class 1 e-bike in the US and allows it to access more trails and riding paths than Class 3 e-bikes.The speeds are expected to be limited in Europe, where stricter e-bike regulations allow for a maximum of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) before the motor must cut out.All three bikes feature Specialized’s 2.2 motor putting out 90 Nm of torque. It is listed as a “250W nominal” motor, though all companies that want to sell e-bikes in Europe have to label their motors as 250 W to comply with local e-bike regulations. In practice, the motors put out much higher peak power, and torque figures are the better measurement for direct comparison between e-bikes and e-bike motors as torque is not regulated and thus can be accurately labeled and marketed.Specialized claims that the bikes can put out up to quadruple the power of a human rider in their highest assist setting, and that the power is delivered “intuitively and naturally” thanks to that MasterMind controller.Large capacity batteries of 710 Wh should also provide considerable ranges for the e-bikes. Actual range varies widely based on terrain and power level, but achieving over 75 miles (120 km) per charge  with a battery of this size on an efficient pedal-assist e-bike is certainly within reason.The three new e-bikes each come in three models (3.0, 4.0, and 5.0) with different component load-outs and with variants offering either an internally geared rear hub or a derailleur drivetrain.Pricing starts at US $3,250 for all three models with derailleurs, while the internally geared hub adds an extra $500 to the price. Prices increase up to $5,500 for the higher-spec models.",ebikes
2021/09/20,"The range is one of the first questions I get asked about my electric bikes, right after “How fast does that thing go?” But range has always been one of the most mysterious and difficult to pin down specs in the e-bike industry. After increasing its minimum battery size, San Diego-based Juiced Bikes is showing just how far its electric bicycles can go on a single charge with real-world testing data.Until recently, Juiced Bikes’ smallest battery was still fairly large at 52V and 13Ah.The company recently replaced that battery size with a larger 15Ah alternative, boosting the 676 Wh battery to 780 Wh and increasing the range by about 15%. That’s well above average in the electric bicycle industry, though still smaller than the company’s largest 52V and 19.2Ah battery with 998 Wh of capacity.Juiced has claimed various max ranges of 50-70 miles (80-112 km) per charge with that new 15 Ah battery, depending on the bike it is mounted on, the type of riding, and the terrain covered on the ride.Now, the company is giving us more clarity than ever on those figures with a detailed real-world range test. The test was performed on Juiced’s new $1,999 CrossCurrent X Step-Through, a commuter-style e-bike revealed last month.While many official range tests are performed with small and light riders (150-170 lb or 68-77 kg is fairly standard), Juiced used a 6’2″ and 210 lb (1.88m and 95 kg) rider for its test. Those measurements are above average for American males and should assuage any concerns of deliberately reducing rider weight to obtain a rosier range verification.The test, performed on a new Juiced CrossCurrent X Step-Through e-bike, showed a max range on the bike of around 35 miles (56 km) in Race Mode and double that in Eco Mode.Juiced also used a ride tracker to obtain GPS-verified distance and mapping of the test rides.To perform the test, the battery was fully charged, and then the e-bike was ridden over a period of several days without charging the battery. This simulated a typical commuter application, where riders may start the week with a charged battery and deplete it over the course of several days.We’ve seen (and performed) endurance tests of batteries involving a single long ride for many hours until the battery is drained, though this marathon type of riding is less representative of real-world usage than the multi-day test method used in this experiment.The test was also performed almost entirely on pedal assist modes, where the rider’s pedaling power is augmented by motor power. The e-bike used in the test has a throttle that allows it to be ridden without pedaling, but this significantly reduces the range and thus many companies are wary of sharing throttle-only ranges. In Juiced’s range test, the first three of the five pedal assist power levels were used, consisting of Eco Mode, Level 1, and Level 2.The first day of the test saw a roughly 16 mile (25.7 km) commuter-style ride on city streets, with the rider averaging around 12.5 mph (20 km/h). The rider mostly used pedal-assist Level 1 and Level 2, and briefly used the throttle to get “up to speed” with cars when accelerating from a stop.The second day saw a longer ride of around 20 miles (32 km) on more rural roads. The ride averaged around 13.3 mph (21.4 km/h).The third day saw a return to city roads with a ride of 12 miles (20 km) and averaging approximately 12 mph (20 km/h).The fourth day’s journey took the rider to a local farmers market, where he made use of the CrossCurrent X Step-Through’s included rear rack. The 13 mile (21 km) trip was performed with an average speed of just under 11 mph (18 km/h).The fifth day finally saw the battery drained after around 7.5 miles (12 km) of riding at an average speed of 8.75 mph (14 km/h), reaching the point where the bike no longer provided power.Throughout the five days of riding, the bike reportedly achieved 69 miles (111) km on a single charge. The rider covered a combination of flat and moderately hilly terrain and had a typical load of around 215-225 lb (97-102 kg), including gear and cargo.This kind of fairly granular, real-world data is rare in the e-bike world, and it is helpful to scrutinize what these results mean.The total average efficiency of this ride was 11.3 Wh/mi, or 6.9 Wh/km. This is a fairly reasonable energy expenditure rate for rather slow pedal-assist riding. When making back of the napkin calculations for e-bike ranges, I typically use the figure 15 Wh/mi for pedal assist and 25 Wh/mi for throttle, and this e-bike was slightly more efficient than my general assumptions — likely due to it riding slower.These results demonstrate a few things to me:When comparing e-bikes, we often like to look at max speed and max range specs, but it is important to remember that you can only have one of those at a time. To Juiced’s credit, they don’t hide the fact that high speeds reduce range, and the company claims that this same e-bike should get around half of the range in Race Mode as it achieves in Eco Mode.Very few e-bike companies come out and provide real-world range testing data, and I know of only one that does it for every pedal-assist mode and throttle mode on its e-bikes: Aventon. That company provides a chart for every e-bike model they sell with range and speed data for each pedal-assist mode and for throttle-only riding, and I’ve always respected that.It is this kind of real-world riding data that will actually help riders compare different electric bikes and better estimate their own expected ranges.Image credits: Juiced Bikes",ebikes
2021/09/18,"Serial 1, the electric bicycle company that was spun-off from Harley-Davidson’s original electric bicycle program, has revealed that it will sell a limited number of S1 MOSH/TRIBUTE e-bikes.The S1 MOSH/TRIBUTE electric bike more closely matches the original vintage prototype electric bicycle first unveiled by Serial 1 late last year.When we first covered the story, millions of readers tuned into Electrek to see the Harley-Davidson electric bicycle that broke the internet.That bike used a similar frame to the actual series production electric bicycles from Serial 1, but had a number of unique touches inspired by Harley-Davidson’s first motorcycle from over 100 years ago.Key elements like the leather saddle and grips, brass accents, glossy paint, white tires and brown drive belt all contributed to the stunning aesthetics of the original vintage prototype.Below you can see what the bike looked like upon its unveiling.The stunning concept marked a huge launch for Serial 1, who followed up with several e-bike models based on the same frame.The serial production electric bicycles shared a similar frame and electronics, but lacked the elegant accents originally seen in the tribute bike.Now those are back in the limited edition Serial 1 S1 MOSH/TRIBUTE, which debuted today at the Electrify Expo in California.As Serial 1’s Brand Director Aaron Frank explained:“When Serial 1 launched in October 2020, the first e-bike shown to the public was a stunning prototype drawn from the vintage motorcycle that inspired the creation of the Serial 1 e-bike brand. We are thrilled now to offer a limited-edition that so faithfully captures the iconic look and feel of that first prototype, and to use this moment as a springboard to launch our S1 Series that will see even more exclusive and highly-desirable Serial 1 eBike models in the future.”The company will produce only 650 individual units of S1 MOSH/TRIBUTE electric bicycles, split evenly among the US and European markets. Deliveries are expected to commence in Q4 of this year.The bike is based on the MOSH/CTY model and shares most of the same components, including the Brose mid-drive motor, Gates carbon belt drive, TRP hydraulic disc brakes with internally routed hoses to match the internal electrical wires, and the bike’s signature integrated lighting. The front shield and rear dropouts both house built-in frame-integrated lighting, plus there’s an extra bright headlight mounted on the handlebars that was designed in-house by Serial 1’s engineers.While it doesn’t look exactly like the original prototype, the S1 MOSH/TRIBUTE certainly pays homage to that distinctive design, as you can see in the photos below.Serial 1 plans to roll out more special editions of its electric bicycles under the S1 line, following in the footsteps of its previous one-off custom electric bicycles.While we don’t yet have any word on what other types of tribute or custom electric bicycles Serial 1 is working on, we’ll be sure to update when we learn more.Until then, let’s hear what you think of Serial 1’s MOSH/TRIBUTE e-bike in the comment section below!",ebikes
2021/09/17,"In case you missed it, a gaggle of Electrek‘s staff just spent several weeks in Germany attending the Eurobike and IAA Mobility trade shows to check out the latest in two-, three-, and four-wheeled electric transportation. While we were there, the fast-paced electric bicycle company Super73 was kind enough to loan us a pair of badass e-bikes that turned into our main wheels for the rest of the trip. We took those things across Germany, toured the cities and the countryside, road the hell out of them, left them outside during intense rainstorms, may or may not have crashed one or both of them at various points during the trip, and basically did the best we could to push those bikes to their limits. They took everything we could throw at them and asked for more.If you aren’t familiar with Super73, you’re going to want to get a load of this.Super73 basically originated the moped-style and electric minibike craze that has been growing in popularity in the US for the last five years or so. The Irvine, California-based company took minibike styling from the 1970s and ’80s, combined it with extra fat tires, then mashed it all into an electric bike format to create fast, fun, and eye-catching e-bikes.I lost count of how many people walked up to us to ask about the crazy-looking bikes we were riding, but it was several dozens. And the smiles and neck-craning we saw as we would ride by surely broke into the triple digits. These may look like little motorcycles, but they’re actually fully legal electric bicycles. The “gas tank” is really a lithium-ion battery, and the motor is housed in the hub of the rear wheel. The frame looks like a classic wishbone-style motorcycle frame, and the long bench seats paired with big ol’ headlights help complete the motorcycle illusion.Our adventure began in Friedrichshafen, Germany where Electrek covered the return of Eurobike 2021. Situated on the banks of beautiful Lake Constance, bordering the shores of Austria and Switzerland, Friedrichshafen played out its swan song as the last year that Eurobike would be hosted in the sleepy town before moving to Frankfurt next year.Super73 had a booth at the show decked out just like you’d expect of the lifestyle brand, complete with over-the-top customized electric bikes, retro riding gear, gigantic wall art and flashy slow motion riding scenes playing across giant screens.While Super73 operates in Europe and sells its bikes in Germany, they don’t yet have the same recognizability or dominant position that the company already holds in the US. The styling is unlike anything else around, and it’s a real California meets Cologne kind of situation when these Americana e-bikes roll down the streets of Germany.Where’s a local Casey Neistatberg when you need one?In the US, Super73’s e-bikes are fast and powerful. They can hit speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h) and rip with motors pushing 2,000 watts of peak power.In Germany, strict electric bike laws mean the bikes are limited to lower power and speed levels. But not even the Germans could take the fun out of the non-stop parade that is Super73’s exhilarating style. And that was on show in full force at Eurobike, where many companies tried to imitate the Super73 image, but none truly succeeded.Since we were looking at a two-week stint in Bavaria across two trade shows and a few hundred kilometers, Super73 kindly offered to lend us some e-bikes from Eurobike that we could continue around Germany with. The only problem was getting them out of the show. The entire complex was well secured and specifically designed not to let people steal bikes from the show floor. But with the permission of the company, that’s exactly what we were trying to do. The bikes were all tagged with exhibitor labels, a system that does double duty to let the guards know the bikes are meant to be test ridden and also to help spot bikes that aren’t supposed to be removed from the premises. With our bright pink test ride-approved wrist bands in place from the previous day, we blended in with the other riders as we surreptitiously rolled out into the cordoned off test ride space on a pair of flashy new Super73s. Initially looking like any other attendees in the test ride area, we broke cover as we peeled off past the red and white caution tape and Jersey barriers in a section between show workers. Barricades had been set up to prevent car and bike traffic from passing through the area, but they were designed for normal bikes – not these bikes. We had to ride up and along a 45º grass embankment to get around a barricade and then hop another high concrete curb while pedaling frantically and praying the giant tires would just figure it out as we went. I couldn’t help channeling my inner Steve McQueen in The Great Escape, famously outrunning the Germans on a stolen motorbike. It was a bit touch and go, but if any e-bike could handle a spontaneous off-road escape like this it would be one as totally overbuilt as a Super73.If anyone saw us then there might have been shouts from the guards as we whizzed out of the fairgrounds, but I honestly couldn’t have told you due to the comically loud tire roar of the giant 4″ custom rubber. We just kept our eyes forwards and pedaled like hell. As we yanked off the telltale exhibitor tags on the bikes and reached the open road, the realization dawned on us that we were home free. Our rapid-pace pedaling eased into a leisurely cruise along the gravel trails that took us back towards town, smiles on our faces from the successful heist.From that point on we were able to relax and enjoy the pleasant ride through the countryside, farms on one side of the road and meadows on the other. Friedrichshafen isn’t a big town and the bike lanes sometimes just turn into gravel trails on the side of the road. Earlier in the week we took a few Bird-style rental scooters from Tier and the gravel trails were a real doozy. But the Super73 bikes took to gravel, cobblestones and just about anything else as if it was as smooth as a basketball court. Those fat tires roll over just about anything in their path. And the suspension on the bikes absorb anything the tires don’t.In Germany you can’t have throttles on e-bikes and so Super73 outfits the bikes with 10-speed transmissions using high quality Shimano parts. The bikes certainly feel a bit strange to pedal at first, especially if you’re used to a road or mountain bike. But the seats are nicely tapered and allow you to adjust back and forth until you find the most comfortable pedaling position. I was sore after the first day, but quickly forgot that it was even “odd” after that. In total I eventually pedaled that thing for several hundred kilometers and it felt just fine as a conventionally more pedalable bike. That being said, we were on the S2 and RX models. A couple years ago I reviewed a Super73-Z1 model and that one was much less comfortable to pedal. So if you’re really into pedaling, the S-line and R-line seem to be the best bet.From Friedrichshafen we needed to find a way to Munich for the IAA Mobility show, but it was going to be a bit of a long ride. Even with the 48V and 20Ah batteries packing nearly 1,000Wh of capacity, we were still looking at a 130 mile (210 km) journey, and so we decided to do it by train instead.I double-backpacked the trip but Seth had a Timbuk2 Co-Pilot Luggage Roller Suitcase, and ended up tying it to the Super73 using his Eurobike show badge lanyard (Reduce, reuse, recycle!). He towed that bag for miles and neither the bag nor the bike complained. If you ever need some luggage that can survive being dragged behind an electric moped, that’s apparently the one. In fact, ebike trailer luggage might be a nascent product category.Getting the bikes on and off the trains in Germany turned into a bit of an ordeal. My S2 weighed 73 lb (33 kg) but Seth’s full-suspension RX was a hefty 80 lb (36 kg). Two of the trains had bike cars that were normal walk-ons, but one had the train car up four steps. Try throwing an 80 lb e-bike up the stairs, followed by a couple bags and then running back down to help a mom get a stroller on behind you – that’s an experience.Speaking of experiences, I had another interesting one at the Lindau-Insel train station where a train worker didn’t want to let me load the Super73 onboard because she thought it was a gas-powered motorbike. I had to explain in mostly pantomimes that this was an electric bicycle, though the fact that English and German share the world “electric” fairly closely was apparently helpful.Finally we got to Munich where the train station wasn’t walking distance from our AirBNB, but it was definitely biking distance. Wheeling around the city at dusk in what looked like silent motorcycles while slinging rolling luggage behind us must have seemed ridiculous to the locals, because we were definitely getting stares. The streets turned out to be covered in trolly tracks, and anyone who has ridden a typical bike over tracks knows how easily those can swallow a wheel and end your day. But the Super73 tires again proved to be the best bet in both the city and the country as they rolled over the gaps in the trolly rails without even noticing.Munich turned out to be a perfect use case for the bikes. Unlike sleepy lakeside German villages, Munich was an urban gauntlet of trains, cars, motorcycles, police paddy-wagons and every other form of street-hogging transportation you could think of. The bright red bike lanes were our saving grace to escape the urban traffic and breeze through the city. No one could arrive faster than us – the local cars got stuck in traffic and the local bikes were nothing compared to our bikes. The IAA Mobility show was a good 10-12 km (6-7 miles) from downtown Munich and the commute each day had us on a combination of farm roads, bike lanes, nature trails and city streets. There was a little bit of everything and again the Super73s handled it all. We could skip the traffic and then sling gravel all in the same ride, on the same bike, with the same load-out. The big lights kept us visible in the city and the suspension kept us rolling comfortably on the trails. The uncluttered bars provided ample space for accessories like phone holders to help navigate the urban jungle, and the giant batteries gave us the ability to charge once every few days even while venturing out for long rides on the scenic route.The bikes may look ridiculously overbuilt, but that came in handy for the diverse riding and utility jobs we asked of them.As the trip wound to an end, I was sad to say goodbye to my Super73 I had grown so fond to. That bike had taken me everywhere, had saved me countless taxi fares. It helped me explore nature trails I never wound have found and took me on detours throughout parts of cities I never would have discovered. The bikes served as conversation starters with nice strangers that were all too eager to learn what the hell I was riding. Train rides turned from boring time fillers to friendly encounters when other passengers came to check out the bikes. The bikes even held up to our litany of abuse, from overnight thunderstorms to going wheels up when not looking where we were going.I don’t own a Super73 myself, but now I really wish I did after having such a fun experience on the bikes over the past two weeks. And at least in the US, Super73’s e-bikes get to be unlocked to achieve their full potential as faster, more powerful runabouts. But even when limited to 25 km/h (15.5 mph), I was impressed with how versatile and useful the bikes proved to be. And of course the eye-catching and conversation-starting California style was the cherry on top.After two weeks in the saddle, I definitely count myself as a member of the vast Super73 fan base. Now I’m just waiting for the next group ride!",ebikes
2021/09/16,"Phoenix-based Lectric eBikes has made a name for itself in its two short years of existence thanks to the company’s smash hit Lectric XP e-bike. Now the garage startup turned massive e-bike brand is getting a boost of old-school cred with the hire of industry insider Jeff Frehner as its new COO.Frehner has joined Lectric eBikes after stints as a former executive at Saris Cycling Group and Dorel Sports (owner of brands like Cannondale, Pacific Cycle, and Schwinn).In addition to extensive industry experience leading successful cycling brands, Frehner holds a Juris Doctor degree and previously served as general council for major bicycle parts supplier QBP.Lectric eBikes CEO and cofounder Levi Conlow described how Frehner’s addition to the team would benefit the fast-growing e-bike company:“We’re fortunate to have Jeff join our team at a critical moment in our company’s lifecycle, nearing 100,000 bicycles in circulation in less than two years. Jeff’s deep industry connections and experience in building successful teams will help Lectric continue to deliver the most accessible electric bikes on the market. He shares our vision, which is to get as many people riding bikes as possible. Beyond his executional strengths, his veteran leadership and knowledge of the industry will be invaluable to a young and growing business.”Lectric eBikes began with the typical garage startup origin story back in the summer of 2019. We followed along as Conlow and his childhood friend Robby Deziel pooled their resources to start the nascent e-bike brand.When their original prototype didn’t quite land the warm welcome they had hoped for, they borrowed the funds to try again with a new type of e-bike. That’s when the $899 folding fat-tire Lectric XP e-bike was born. With Class 3 speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) and a price that broke new ground for affordability, the Lectric XP was an instant success.We reviewed one of the early versions of the bike and came away majorly impressed. While it wasn’t the fanciest or highest quality e-bike out there, it offered good specs at a great price.Now the company has sold over 100,000 e-bikes and counting as they’ve rushed to increase production. The company has already seen a 500% increase in manufacturing since last summer, at a time when the entire e-bike industry is riding the wave of increased e-bike adoption rates fueled by the pandemic.The company recently unveiled a new version of the e-bike that improved upon many of the original’s shortcomings, such as adding suspension and making a more nimble design.The price was increased to $999 with the launch of the 2.0 version, but the e-bike is still seen as one of the best bang-for-your-buck models in the industry, especially in its folding fat tire e-bike category.Now the company is focusing on increasing its hiring as it sets its sights on the true big dogs of the North American e-bike industry. Hires like Frehner show that Lectric eBikes is going after respected industry execs to bulk up its garage startup ethos. As the e-bike industry continues to develop, we could see even more mixing of these power players on the horizon.",ebikes
2021/09/15,"A 30% tax credit for electric bicycle purchases in the US has been slowly working its way through the gauntlet of Congress. The latest update to the proposed legislation shows much anticipated progress but also reduces the potential size of the incentive.The tax credit for e-bikes first appeared as part of the E-BIKE Act proposed earlier this year.The bill was first introduced in the US House of Representatives in February and proposed creating a 30% tax credit to incentivize the purchase of new electric bicycles in the US.The goal is to make it easier for Americans to afford electric bicycles and thus hopefully replace many car-driven miles with more efficient electric bicycle transportation.In July, a companion bill was introduced in the US Senate, a necessary step to see the legislation passed in both halls of Congress before it could eventually become law.The House bill was sent to the House Ways and Means committee shortly after its introduction, and we’re now getting our first look at how the committee has reworked some of the language.The largest update includes a reduced incentive of 15%, or just half of the total originally proposed.A phase-out schedule has also been proposed based on income level. The credit would begin phasing out for taxpayers earning over $75,000, though that figure increases to $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples who file jointly.The text also includes the same problematic “under 750 watts” wording when defining which electric bicycles would qualify for the incentive. Most US states allow e-bikes to have a maximum motor power of 750 watts, and thus 750W e-bikes are common from many manufacturers. Ideally the bill will be updated to read “not more than 750 watts” to include all e-bikes currently legal in most of the US.The committee also included a provision that would require the e-bikes to come with a manufacturer assigned vehicle identification number (VIN). The VIN would then be used to claim the tax credit.The under $8,000 MSRP limit necessary to qualify for the credit has remained from the original bill.These changes are not binding, but likely indicate a new direction for the bill. There is still a long way to go before the legislation could be passed in the US House and Senate, after which it would then need to be signed into law by President Joe Biden.Below is the exact wording of the House Ways and Means committee’s updated proposal:Beginning in 2022, taxpayers may claim a credit of up to $1,500 for electric bicycles placed intoservice by the taxpayer for use within the United States. A taxpayer may claim the credit for oneelectric bicycle per taxable year (two for joint filers). The credit phases out starting at $75,000 ofmodified adjusted gross income ($112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for marriedfiling jointly) at a rate of $200 per $1,000 of additional income. For a given taxable year, thetaxpayer may use modified adjusted gross income for that year or the immediately precedingyear, whichever is lower.Qualified electric bicycles is defined as a bicycle which is equipped with fully operable pedals, asaddle or seat for the rider, an electric motor of less than 750 watts which is designed to provideassistance in propelling the bicycle, and does not provide assistance if the bicycle is moving inexcess of 20 miles per hour or only provides assistance when the rider is pedaling and does notprovide assistance if the bicycle is moving in excess of 28 miles per hour.In order to be eligible for the credit, the aggregate amount paid for the acquisition of such bicyclemust not exceed $8,000.In order for an electric bicycle to be eligible for the credit, the manufacturer must assign eachbicycle a unique vehicle identification number and report such information to the Treasury in amanner prescribed by the Secretary. Taxpayers must then provide the proper vehicleidentification number assigned to the electric bicycle by the manufacturer in order to claim thecredit.The Secretary shall make payments to mirror code territories for the amount of revenue lost withrespect to this provision. The Secretary shall make payments to non-mirror code territories forthe amount of revenue lost with respect to operating a similar credit for electric bicycles.",ebikes
2021/09/14,"We’ve watched many electric bicycle models in North America push further into the heavier, more aggressive categories of fat tire e-bikes and electric moped-style rides. But the KBO Breeze takes a different approach, bucking the trend toward bigger and bolder e-bikes. This comfortable and leisurely contender is light on riders’ backs and even lighter on their wallets.I can’t claim that there’s anything revolutionary about the KBO Breeze. It’s not an e-bike that flips the script, but it’s also not intending to rewrite anything. Instead, the KBO Breeze is all about fulfilling a basic need: a simple and effective e-bike for getting around the city and carrying your gear/shopping/kiddo with you.The bike comes equipped with enough motor and battery capacity to provide good power and higher than average range, while also offering a number of included accessories that make the Breeze a more utility-oriented package.And its design actually looks pretty good as far as e-bikes go, something that is far from a given in this industry. It’s even available in both a step-over frame and a step-through frame option, offering more access to a wider range of riders.You can follow along on my test ride of the e-bike in my video review below. Then keep reading for the full tech specs and my complete written review.As electric bicycles become more feature rich, their prices have crept upwards as well. Add that to a number of pricing pressures on the industry and we’ve seen an unfortunate increase in e-bike pricing over the last year.But KBO’s price of $1,499 falls in the sweet spot of being affordable enough for most to consider, yet pricey enough that they didn’t cut corners with a bunch of cheap parts.For example, the 48V 16Ah battery is larger than you’ll find from most of the leaders in the industry. That’s 768 Wh of capacity, or enough for around 35 miles (56 km) of range on throttle only (though the 22 mph (35 km/h) top speed helps that range figure by not letting you ride too fast on throttle operation). If you can keep yourself in pedal assist and put in some honest effort while the motor assists you, a higher range of up to 55 miles (88 km) is possible.But there’s more than just capacity to consider with an e-bike battery. Let’s all take a moment and appreciate how nice that integrated battery looks. Obviously that’s not all KBO’s handiwork, as batteries are generally OEM products. But KBO chose the right pack here with one that disappears nicely into the downtube and looks great.The motor is plenty powerful for a daily commuter, offering 750 watts of peak power to reach that top speed of around 22-23 mph (35-37 km/h). With that much power, you’re actually getting some serious assist in the higher pedal assist levels. The saddle is pretty decent too, and I really enjoyed using the pedal assist even though I’ve never hidden my love of throttle e-bikes. The cadence-based pedal assist has that telltale lag of around a second or so when you engage the pedals, but its something I can easily live with.The Shimano 7-speed shifter is basic hardware but it works just fine. If I was paying more then I’d want to see slightly better parts that would last longer between tune-ups, but this is a $1,499 e-bike and you can’t really climb the Shimano hierarchy at this price. The same goes for the Tektro Aires disc brakes on 180 mm rotors. They aren’t fancy mechanical disc brakes, but they get the job done. And at least we were bestowed with 180 mm rotors instead of 160 mm base-level rotors. And to be honest, we’re in a similar situation with the suspension fork. It’s just fine, but nothing fancy. I’ve seen cheaper and I’ve seen better – this one is solidly middle of the road, which makes it fine for basic commuter use.The throttle is a half-twist model, which I’m seeing less frequently. I find half-twist throttles to be the most comfortable type of throttle, since you can twist the inner half of the grip and then use your entire hand to grip both halves and hold the throttle engaged– no wrist strain necessary on long rides. Thumb throttles can be tiring on longer riders, and full twist throttles require some level of wrist muscle engagement to maintain the twist. Half twist throttles are the goldilocks option and I love seeing them.The fact that the bike goes slightly faster than 20 mph on throttle-only makes me wonder if that’s a legal issue that could prevent its classification as a Class 2 e-bike in the US. But since we’re talking about a lousy 2 mph, I’ll consider that close enough.The step-through frame is also a nice offering. There’s a step-over frame option too, but I usually prefer step-throughs when possible. If you’re loading up the rear rack then it is much easier to step through the frame than swing a leg over high-mounted cargo. And the step-through still has a 300 lb (136 kg) load rating, so even heavier riders can still enjoy the bike without worry. I know some people still have this outdated idea that step-through frames = girls’ bikes. But that’s ridiculous. Some of the most badass e-bike designs on the market today use step-through frames. It’s simply more comfortable. And if your manhood is tied to where your top tube is located, what does that say about you?As someone who rides e-bikes as a way to actually get around and not just for recreation, the commuter-oriented features are definitely appreciated. The included metal fenders and the sturdy rear rack are critical for commuters. You never know when you’re going to hit a puddle or get caught in a freak rain storm, and so fenders are key pieces of kit for commuters. A rear rack not only gives more cargo space, but I like the way it can double as a backpack rest when I have a particularly full backpack.The lights are another “nothing fancy but nothing too cheap either” part of the bike. They work fine for alerting others to your existence, but someone who commutes often in the dark might want to add a larger headlight to illuminate the way home from work.With 750W of power and slightly higher than 20 mph speeds, the KBO Breeze has the power and speed to make me feel safe on the road. While I love 28 mph e-bikes, the KBO Breeze still has decently fast commuter speeds that I can live with. The combination of long range and a nicely designed e-bike that can fulfill a true commuter role sits nicely with me. The bike is an attractive option in the commuter electric bicycle space and is fairly priced for what you get.It doesn’t provide any world-changing innovation, but it gets the job done nicely.",ebikes
2021/09/13,"After skipping a year due to the pandemic, Eurobike 2021 returned to Friedrichshafen, Germany, nearly two years to the day after the previous rendition of one of the world’s largest and most important bicycle trade shows. The show was immeasurably different (much like the world itself over the last 18 months), but it still hosted some of the most interesting new updates to bicycle tech we’ve seen in years.And as e-bikes have exploded in popularity since the pandemic, so too has the proportion of e-bike companies to pedal bikes at the show. While 2019 saw closer to an even mix between electric and acoustic bikes, Eurobike 2021 was absolutely the year of the e-bike as electrically-powered two-wheelers dominated the show.Interestingly, one of the biggest changes other than the increased dominance of electric bicycles was the growing number of cargo e-bikes.Perhaps buoyed by a larger number of commuters seeking to replace more car trips than ever with alternative transportation, the sheer volume and diversity of cargo bicycles was immediately apparent throughout the show.Other notable standouts included new electric bicycle drive systems, increasingly bizarre forms of electric bicycles and a host of accessories designed to make e-bikes even more useful for various daily uses.You can see all of these and more in our Eurobike 2021 compilation video, where you’ll follow the Electrek team around the show floor and test grounds as we check out all of the coolest e-bike tech.Below is a selection of notable companies and products that were on hand at the 2021 Eurobike show.We’ve also got a poll going to see what your favorite item from the show is. Make sure to come back up here to the top of the article to vote once you’ve finished the article!One of the first new advancements I sought out at the show was a fascinating new electric drive system for e-bikes that completely removes a mechanical connection to the drive wheel.Instead of using a chain or belt – the two most common drive systems for bicycles – the Free Drive unit generates electricity from the rider’s pedaling action via an electric generator mounted at the bottom bracket of the bike. It then feeds that power to the motor to propel the bike. If any extra energy is generated above what the motor requires, it is stored in the e-bike’s battery.I covered the system in detail last week, and it’s definitely worth a closer look.I also had the chance to take a spin on an electric cargo bike outfitted with the Free Drive system, and I’ll have a complete first ride write-up along with a video of the experience coming to Electrek soon.Greyp took advantage of the Eurobike 2021 show to unveil a series of new ultra-premium carbon-fiber electric mountain bikes as part of the G6 full-suspension line.I tested out the original G6 e-bikes when they were first unveiled. Even two years ago, they were high-tech, and now they’ve only gotten better.The new models include the G6.4, G6.5 and G6.6 full suspension electric mountain bikes.The bikes include large 700Wh batteries, mid-drive motors with 90Nm of torque for powerful hill climbing, embedded tech include built-in eSim cards and 1080p front/rear cameras capable of live-streaming rides, high-end components like Fox Float suspension and of course Greyp’s signature carbon-fiber frames.We’ll have a deep dive into these new e-bikes coming up soon, so consider this a teaser for some of the most tech-savvy premium electric mountain bikes on the market.Barcelona-based Rayvolt had on display the latest update to their beautiful electric bike line. From the Catalonian leatherwork to the steampunk brass accents, these e-bikes are second to none when it comes to class.Rayvolt isn’t just about building attractive bikes, though. They design all of their tech in-house, from modified motors to custom software. That allows them to add interesting features that you won’t find elsewhere.For example, one of the innovations found in all Rayvolt bikes is variable regenerative braking based on reverse pedaling speed. Instead of pulling the brake levers when you want to stop, you can just pedal backwards. A slight backwards turn of the pedals gives light regenerative braking, but a quicker spin activates stronger regenerative braking in proportion with the reverse pedaling speed. It’s the equivalent of one-pedal driving in an electric car, except with bike pedals and almost no need for hand brake levers.That same technology also allows for another cool feature called RegenFit. You can put your e-bike on a roller or trainer and pedal it like an exercise bike, with the motor providing regenerative braking resistance to charge the battery. CEO Mat Rauzier explained that in a half-hour fitness session, he can add around 23% charge to his battery. The system was developed by Rayvolt’s CTO, Jaime Pla. When I last saw Jaime over two years ago, he was a bigger guy. Now seeing him for the first time after the pandemic began, he’s 17 kg (37 lb) slimmer. As it turns out, it’s largely from developing the RegenFit system. He had to use the feature in order to test and debug it over several months, which led to him shedding those extra pounds along the way! He admits that a healthier diet played a role, but daily fitness riding on an electric bicycle charging a battery was a big part of this weight loss success.Bicycle maker Tern showed off their line of bicycles, including two of my favorites, the GSD and HSD electric cargo bikes. Both offer serious cargo-hauling capacity but in a smaller package that resembles the size of a typical bike.The two cargo bikes can also be parked standing up on their tail, making them great for apartment dwellers with limited space.Tern also showed off the company’s latest accessory line, including a neat rear rack accessory that allows riders to transport their kids inside of a waterproof canopy. That way, moms and dads can take their kids to school on the bike, rain or shine, without the little ones getting wet (or sunburned!).Bosch took to Eurobike to show off its Smart System, which is the latest update to its extensive line of electric bicycle drive systems.Unlike in previous years, where we’ve seen incremental updates to motors, the Smart System offers a new software approach that allows Bosch to implement several new features. Part of the system is Bosch’s new Flow App. The app is designed to digitize the e-bike ownership experience. Instead of needing to bring the bike into an authorized Bosch dealer for minor updates, riders can now perform over-the-air (OTA) updates themselves via the app. That will allow riders to take advantage of new Bosch features as they are continuously developed and deployed.The app is also useful for customizing riding modes, recording riding activities automatically, and integrating with fitness apps. The automatic riding activity recording is particularly convenient as it uses the bike’s sensors to begin the activity recording automatically, meaning riders won’t need to pull out their phones and manually click “record” to track each ride.Bosch also plans to integrate Bike-to-X communication as part of the internet-of-things (IoT) framework, which would allow for interesting features to be added. By connecting with other cars and trucks, the e-bikes could give early warning signals that help to better protect riders.Along with the new software, Bosch also rolled out a larger 750 Wh PowerTube battery that hides away inside a bike’s downtube, plus a new Kiox 300 display with updated remote.We also had the chance to see the Bosch Smart System installed on several of BULLS’ new electric bicycles. BULLS came prepared with a giant booth complete with dozens of models of e-bikes. Few companies can match the sheer breadth of models, and it’s quite impressive to see so many different types of e-bikes all under one roof.This is the first time I’ve ever seen this bicycle, and it’s an absolute beauty. The Coleen electric bike does a stunning job of incorporating old-school design features like rotary switches into a retro-modern-looking electric bicycle.The exposed chrome accents and the sleek full-carbon frame play well together, especially combined with the leather saddle and bar grips.The 250W and 25 km/h (15.5 mph) EU version doesn’t seem to do the beautiful bike justice, but they also have a 750W and 45 km/h (28 mph) model, which seems much more up to speed for a bike that looks this good.The French-designed and built electric bicycle is hand-made, with over 50 hours of labor going into the manufacturing of each bike.There wasn’t a price listed on the bike, but I’m guessing it’s one of those “If you have to ask…” situations.Super73 had an awesome booth decked out exactly how you’d expect, with retro-themed motorbike awesomeness.On display were their three main models, the Z, S and R lines.The company recently launched a new Super73-ZX e-bike to update the most affordable e-bike in the lineup. And shortly before that, the R and RX lines were released with better suspension, higher-spec components and more power than most people would ever need. Or perhaps the perfect amount of power, depending on who you ask.Super73 let us borrow a couple of their e-bikes to zip around Germany on. We’ve since taken them to Munich for the IAA Mobility show, where they became our main rides around the city. The bikes turn heads everywhere we go and are instant conversation starters. They also happen to be our favorite way around the city (and usually the fastest way around the city too). We’ll have more on that experience coming up soon!I’ve covered the Manta5 hydrofoil electric water bike before, but that was several years ago, and I’ve never seen it in person.Now, the team at Manta5 has returned to Eurobike with an updated model, and I immediately fell in love with it.Seriously, just watch the first three seconds of the video below.That’s what I want to be doing right now. Sign. Me. Up.It’s basically an electric bike built on top of a hydrofoil, and the pedals (plus the motor) power a propeller instead of a rear wheel. You ride up on the foil, which helps you use less battery, just like a hydrofoil electric boat.The whole thing looks incredible, and I’m already talking to the company about getting a test ride soon to bring you guys a video review. It’s a tough job, but someone has to do it.There was a fascinating section with all sorts of bike-related startups, each with an interesting idea to show off. Some were more prototype-y, while others were already in production. Below are the neatest ideas we saw.The Hopper Mobility bike car was one of those larger-than-life entries that grabs your eye from across the exhibit hall.The German-made electric tricycle is shaped like a car but uses an electric bicycle drive-system to provide a more efficient alternative to conventional cars or even electric cars. It’s also a lot more nimble than cars, thanks to a rear-wheel steering mechanism that gives it a tiny turning radius of just 2 meters (6.5 feet).It can legally travel in bike lanes, though I’m not sure you’ll make a lot of friends that way. An included solar panel in the roof offers 5 km of range for every hour of sunlight. That means riders likely won’t even have to plug it in to charge most of the year, assuming they park outside.Speaking of solar power, the Sunbike team showed off solar panel wheels that could be used to charge an electric bicycle in motion. The DC-DC system uses an MPPT setup for the highest efficiency charging system.The design was still quite early stage, but the idea could be promising. Plus, it gives you some awesome bling in your spokes!The Sunbike team claims a max power of 120W, counting 30W on each side of the wheel. Considering you’re not likely to see the same amount of sun on both sides of the bike at the same time, I’m not sure the 120W is really doable. But they also quote a max daily charge of around 500 Wh on a sunny day or 250 Wh on a cloudy day. Those figures sound a bit more realistic.This one technically isn’t an e-bike product specifically but could apply to any bicycle. The Rain Rider cover is an easily installed and removed canopy and shield that can protect bike riders from the rain.It pops on and off in just a few seconds and can also quickly fold in half to take up less space in your garage or at work. If you have a minute and want it to take up even less space when not in use, you can disassemble it down into something the size of an umbrella.There are plenty of rain canopy concepts out there, but the execution of this one just seems really slick in how easily it mounts and dismounts from the bike.There are electric snowmobiles out there already, but this is something a bit different. It has tracks like a snowmobile, but the Arosno E-Trace is more of a snow bike. It’s not for blasting around like a snowbound motorcycle, but rather for a more leisurely ride like a bicycle.It uses an electric bicycle drive system tied to an Enviolo bike transmission to regulate the “gears” to create what I’d call more of a snow transporter. It’s not particularly fast, but it does look like a fun way to get around. And if you actually had a cabin in the Arctic circle somewhere, it might even be a realistic way to get down to the local trading post or last remaining Blockbuster video rental. The Gleam tilting cargo electric trike has two major things going for it: It features a modular cargo system for swapping in various boxes and flatbeds, and it actually tilts at the rear so you can ride it harder into turns without flipping over like a typical trike would.They’ve got a slick system to quickly remove and swap various cargo accessories on the back, making this an interesting option for commercial customers.The electric trikes are made in Europe, which should already clue you in to their high prices. Starting at around €7,000, these aren’t cheap options. But they’re also quite sophisticated electric trikes, so you’re getting a lot for your money.We’ve only begun covering OKAI recently, but we’ve actually seen plenty of their vehicles in disguise. That’s because until recently, the company mostly supplied other micromobility companies like Bird and Lime with products such as e-bikes and e-scooters.Now, the company is branching out into its own lines of electric rideables while still continuing to supply the major shared electric mobility companies.That means we’re likely to see several new OKAI-branded products, some of which may share similarities with common electric scooters and bikes already cruising around the world’s major cities.The order of advancements in motorized transportation has always been cars first, then motorcycles, and eventually bicycles. The trend can be traced across components like tires, batteries, lights and more — basically just about any other shared component. Now we can add anti-lock brakes to the list.Blubrake makes anti-lock brakes specifically designed for bicycles. While they can be mounted on traditional pedal bicycles, electric bicycles are prime candidates due to their onboard power to run the electronics and the lack of a weight penalty for the added mass of the hydraulic actuator. We had the chance to check out Blubrake’s braking system that is neatly hidden away in the top tube of an electric bicycle and interfaces directly with the hydraulic braking system on pretty much any e-bike. It doesn’t even require its own proprietary brakes. Instead, it can be installed inline with brakes like those from Shimano, Tektro and Magura, to name a few.While it might sound like overkill to some, the few times people have locked up a front tire and lead to a crash on an e-bike (I can, unfortunately, count myself in that group) are a few too many. Anti-lock brakes could save some skin the next time someone grabs a little too much brake.Call me a nerd, but I think this is really cool (and I proudly wear the ‘e-bike nerd’ designation). The eChecker diagnostic tool suite is a line of electric bicycle testing equipment that can basically simulate a rider and run all sorts of performance tests on any e-bike.Throttle-enabled e-bikes can easily be tested on nearly any dynamometer. That’s simple. But the eChecker can run the same tests on pedal-assist e-bikes, which is a much harder feat. It does it by using a robot to activate the pedals and simulate a rider. That simulation means the tool can be used to compare various electric bicycles in a uniform fashion. My first thought was, “Great! Finally, a tool that can perform accurate range tests to compare different e-bikes against each other and determine real-world range ratings!” As it turns out, that is possible but not a common use. That would require some testing agency to invest the approximately €40,000 for the machines and run the tests. Instead, most of eChecker’s customers are e-bike manufacturers that want to verify their own e-bikes and run tests on competitors’ e-bikes to benchmark their performance.Oh well, maybe someone will step up and buy one of these to start publishing real range data for each e-bike. I’d do it myself if I could afford it.This one is going to be divisive, but let’s check it out anyway.Nicolai has built what is, for all intents and purposes, an electric motorcycle with pedals. There’s a footpeg version for realists, but the pedal-version was on display at the show and looks as ridiculous as it sounds.If you forget the pedals and focus on the electronics, you’ll find a 15 kW continuous and 35 kW peak motor. That’s fairly comparable to a Zero FXE electric motorcycle, to put that in perspective.It’s so powerful that they used two Gates carbon belt drives in parallel. That also seems a bit silly, especially since Gates makes motorcycles belts. They have Gates motorcycle belts installed on the Harley-Davidson LiveWire and Zero SR/F electric motorcycles, each of which puts out around 80 kW of peak power. So I’m not sure why Nicolai went with a pair of belts, but at least it adds to the overall ridiculousness of the bike!This was a fun one that we actually got to test out. The Flyer electric tandem bike offers a pair of batteries, a pair of belt drives and a pair of seats. My publisher Seth took the driver’s seat, and I performed the role of back seat driver slash dead weight. The ride went surprisingly well, though, like all tandem bikes, it can be weird riding back seat and having no control over anything other than propulsion. It could be a great couple activity — depending on the couple. If you’ve got the kind of relationship that can survive two people hurtling through traffic while only one gets to makes all the decisions, then I can definitely recommend the Flyer tandem as a well-made and sufficiently powerful e-bike with plenty of battery for a long and surely argument-free ride. Electric mobility sharing company was on the scene at Eurobike as well. While they’re best known for their shared electric scooters, it was actually the company’s new consumer-focused electric bicycle that was on prime display.The company showed off the new e-bike in both frame styles (step-over and step-through), where we got our first chance to see it in person.There’s no dancing around the fact that the bike obviously looks like it was heavily inspired by popular Dutch bicycle company VanMoof. And Bird’s reps didn’t shy away from it either, suggesting that the design has differences but conceding that VanMoof’s signature bicycle frame design is not patented.But hey, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And it’s not like Bird is the first to copy VanMoof’s frames, either.Ducati’s e-bikes were also on display, but not in a Ducati booth. Instead, they were shown off at the THOK booth.To anyone in the know, that makes good sense. THOK is the actual producer of Ducati’s e-bikes, as the pair have operated a partnership for several years now.This isn’t just a sticker bike, though, and Ducati’s electric mountain bikes actually have several unique features compared to other THOK MIG-R electric bikes.But the similarities are also glaring, including those underslung batteries that are a favorite of THOK.Alright, so technically, this one isn’t an e-bike. And it’s not even a bicycle. But this bike packaging is pretty darn cool.Nearly every e-bike I’ve ever unboxed and re-boxed for reviews (and I’m talking literally hundreds of them over several years) has had some level of foam packaging. I don’t have to tell you how bad unrecyclable and non-biodegradable foams are for the planet.And that’s exactly why THIMM’s foam-free bike packaging is so cool to me. They’ve designed these boxes to use only cardboard, which can be produced from recycled material and also recycled itself.This is the way I hope all e-bikes get packaged in the future.So that’s it, folks! Those are the coolest e-bikes, accessories and other assorted bicycle-industry innovations we found at Eurobike 2021.Let’s hear what you enjoyed the most. Either let us know in the comments section below or vote in the poll at the top of this article. Or both!",ebikes
2021/09/09,"The GOTRAX Endura electric bicycle is the answer to the question, “What e-bike would you recommend if I wanted to spend as little money as possible but not get a pile of junk?”It is far from the best e-bike I’ve tested, but it still scores major points for combining good-enough parts with a super-low price tag of $649. I’ve tested e-bikes that cut too many corners before, and this is not one of them. It makes some sacrifices that we’ll discuss, but it still lands a solid win in the end.As much fun as premium e-bikes are, their high price tags can unfortunately limit such fancy e-bikes to riders who are fortunate enough to be able to afford those luxuries.Budget-priced e-bikes help bring similar joy, convenience, and utility to the common man. And GOTRAX knows a thing or two about making budget-oriented electric two-wheelers.For several years now I’ve been using GOTRAX electric scooters, both testing them for work and personally using them for my own around-the-town needs. GOTRAX has made a name for itself in the electric scooter industry as a bare-bones, gets-the-job-done electric scooter that can do most of what the fancier scooters can – yet for a fraction of the price.Now it’s time to see if they can do the same thing for electric bikes. To see the GOTRAX Endura in action and hear my thoughts on the e-bike, check out my video review below. Or just keep reading while I break it down for you in the rest of my review.Scooters are convenient little two-wheeled electric vehicles, but there’s just not that much to them. E-bikes, on the other hand, have a lot more going on. There are two independent drive trains, more touch points, larger wheels to deal with, more cable runs, suspension, etc. So it’s not as simple as scaling up GOTRAX’s scooter experience.Even so, I’d say they did a pretty good job here. The Endura is a comfortable bike to ride, and you wouldn’t guess it’s just $649. In other words, it doesn’t ride like a cheap bike.I will say that I’m more impressed with the quality of the electrical side of the bike than the mechanical side of things, and we’ll touch on the reasons why. But let’s start with the electronics.Right off the bat, I can tell you that the performance isn’t exciting thanks to the low power 250W motor and 36V electrical system, but it still works quite well. It won’t get your adrenaline pumping, but it will give you an enjoyable, leisurely ride.The pedal assist system provides a nice, relaxed boost and the throttle lets me be lazy if I want the bike to do most of the work. The Endura only has a 270 Wh battery, which is rather small by today’s standards, so I tended to ride more with pedal assist to eek out as much range as possible from the battery. But with a top speed of 15.5 mph (25 km/h), even riding at top speed on throttle-only doesn’t ding the battery too hard. And let’s be honest: with such a low power motor, we’re not talking about a lot of electrical muscle here.So even though this isn’t a high-performance e-bike, it has fine performance considering the price. And it even goes above and beyond in some circumstances, such as the nicely integrated battery. If you spent the same money on a random Amazon e-bike, you’d likely find tacky-looking bolt-on batteries or sometimes even batteries mounted in a bag on the handlebars. But the GOTRAX Endura has a slick-looking integrated battery that locks into the frame and can be removed for charging. Or, well, I should say MUST be removed for charging. That’s the one annoying thing about the battery – you can’t access its charge port without removing it from the bike. That little quirk is a bit annoying, but all in all the electrical side of things is quite nice. The battery is small but nicely integrated. The motor is also small but works just fine for flat land cruising – even if it can’t handle huge hills on its own. There’s also pedal assist and throttle to choose from, which is a big advantage over pedal assist-only e-bikes. The display isn’t fancy but works just fine as an LED dot display, and you even get a headlight that runs off the main pack. There’s no tail light, but I’m not about to complain too hard there, considering I’ve seen e-bikes at three times this price without a tail light either.So the electronics are actually pretty good. But back on the bike component side of things, it’s a bit hit or miss. I’m glad to see they invested in the electronics, but there’s certainly room to go a bit higher on the bike parts. For example, the front fork leaves a lot to be desired. Sure, it’s nice to have suspension, but at what cost? It just doesn’t feel sturdy like a good suspension fork. I might have preferred a rigid fork that I at least know should last for years. And I don’t know anything about this tire brand other than it’s some random Chinese tire manufacturer. I didn’t expect Maxxis here, but I also thought I might at least get a pair of entry-level Kendas.The shifter and derailleur are also on the bottom end of Shimano’s hierarchy. Not bad, but not great either. Of course for an e-bike like this that is basically a pleasure cruiser, they’re certainly sufficient.The graphics aren’t particularly interesting and feel a bit stuck in the early 2000s, but at least the bike otherwise feels solid. The “super sport” decals are laughable considering the low power of the bike, but I prefer to think of them as being used ironically.So while we can definitely see the areas where GOTRAX cut a few corners to bring the cost down, they surprised me with a few key details at the same time. There’s the saddle that is actually quite comfy, and the inclusion of fenders as standard equipment. Even the rear rack comes standard – saving you some serious bucks compared to e-bike companies that charge extra for lights, fenders, and racks.Ultimately I’d still recommend this e-bike to anyone looking for a good, ultra-cheap e-bike. If you can spend a few hundred dollars more, then you can get some serious quality upgrades from other brands. But I get it, not everyone can afford to spend a few hundred dollars more. And compared to other e-bikes at the $649 level, GOTRAX Endura delivers a nicer package that rides better and feels more comfortable to use.I didn’t expect to like such a low-cost bike this much, but I can totally see a place for it. I just think it’s important to judge it within its class. I can’t compare it to a $2,000 e-bike, but I can confirm that it blows away other e-bikes in its price class.",ebikes
2021/09/08,"Beginning early this year, electric bicycle prices crept up nearly across the board. Now we are starting to see reductions in prices from major US brands. Could this be the light at the end of the tunnel?Indicators are starting to point in that direction.In a surprise move, we’re now seeing prices drop on a handful of electric bicycles from popular electric bicycle brands.After having raised prices on many models earlier this year, Rad Power Bikes is now lowering them again on several models. The company’s most affordable model, the RadMission, had crept up to $1,099 but has since dropped back down to $999. Another of the brand’s popular models, the RadMini folding fat tire e-bike, had hovered at $1,499. But now the company has made the RadMini’s sale price of $1,299 permanent.Juiced Bikes has also seen impressive price drops. When the company recently unveiled its new step-through version of the $2,499 CrossCurrent X commuter bike last month, the price was revealed as just $1,999 (albeit the new version had a slightly smaller battery).And after raising the price of its popular Roadster V2 belt-drive e-bike from $995 to $1,095, Ride1Up has since modestly dropped the price to $1,045.The sudden increase in electric bicycle prices earlier this year was driven by several factors, but chief among them were skyrocketing shipping prices and a weakening dollar.Shipping container prices have risen over fivefold in the last year or so. A typical 40HQ shipping container that can fit around 250 e-bikes has increased from approximately $4,500 to $20,000 on the popular East Asia to US West Coast route.That price increased steadily over the last year, leaving many to worry that the end was nowhere in sight.However, the last month has shown one of the first brief price decreases followed by a tenuous plateauing of shipping prices, as seen in the chart below. They’re still sky-high compared to a year ago, but the continuous increase in prices appears to have slowed or even temporarily halted.That likely signals good news to e-bike companies who may be able to plan around more predictable shipping prices, at least in the short term.At the same time, we’re seeing a similar story with the weakening dollar.Compared to the Chinese yuan, the US dollar has been dropping in value fairly steadily over the past year. However we’re beginning to see a plateau there as well, as you can see in the chart below.After hitting a low point early in the summer, the US dollar has rebounded slightly against the Chinese yuan and appears to have somewhat stabilized compared to its period of precipitous drops.While the price of the dollar is still down considerably compared to the Chinese yuan, a stabilization in that trend will also signify good news to US e-bike companies that do the bulk of their manufacturing in China or who rely heavily on batteries and motors from Chinese manufacturers. World markets are still volatile, and that complicates both the long-term planning by electric bicycle manufacturers and the forecasting of prices by analysts.But the signaling of several major manufacturers dropping prices on their e-bikes at a time when many of these companies are still supply-constrained is a good sign for consumers.If current trends continue, we may just be looking at the first rays of light at the end of the tunnel.",ebikes
2021/09/03,"Electric bicycles are subject to various speed limits around the world, but the 25 km/h (15.5 mph) speed limit in places like the EU and Australia is particularly frustrating to riders who are in search of just a bit more “oomph” in their bikes. But a new device is making it easy to increase the top speed of electric bicycles without making any major modifications to the electric bike’s drive system.Many electric bicycles use a magnetic speed sensor on the rear wheel to measure the traveling speed of the electric bike.When the e-bike reaches a pre-programmed top speed – as low as 25 km/h or 15.5 mph in many countries – the motor power cuts out and riders can only reach higher speeds under their own leg power or with the help of gravity.The Speedi device tricks the speed sensor on the rear wheel into spinning more slowly, effectively raising the e-bike’s electronic speed limit by around 50%. It uses a small gear with a 1:1.5 ratio to slow down the speed sensor. That would effectively turn a 15.5 mph e-bike into a more thrilling 23 mph ride.I’ll let the Speedi folks describe the use case in their own words:Sick of hitting your e-bikes speed limit when you’re friken given ‘er the beans?! Want to smoke ya mates?Designed, tested and manufactured in New Zealand, our Speedi uses a mechanical planetary gear system to increase your standard e-bike speed by 1.5.A nice feature with this method of “hacking” the bike’s top speed is that it doesn’t interfere with other measurements being registered by the drive system, such as torque, power, temperature, etc.It also doesn’t require the user to open or modify the motor or drive system.Manufacturers will probably frown at the device’s use, or could even consider it a warranty-voiding action. So users should probably check with their manufacturer first if they want to play it safe.And of course you’ll want to check with your local regulations to determine if the device is considered illegal on public roads. If so, off-road e-biking may be your only chance to employ a device like this. The Speedi team at NLS Components has already developed units that are compatible with bikes from Trek, Specialized,  Giant, and Santa Cruz. They also offer custom units that can potentially be made compatible with other brands, as required.The devices are priced at NZD $160, or around US $114.Traveling at 50% higher speeds though – that’s priceless.I know this is going to be a bit controversial, but I certainly understand the desire to ride faster than the EU speed limit. Hitting the 15.5 mph wall is frustrating, especially when non-electric bikes can easily be pedaled faster.The thing I worry more about is if someone is able to put this on a Class 3 e-bike or a speed pedelec in the EU, effectively turning a 28 mph or 45 km/h e-bike into a lightweight motorcycle. I’m not sure if many such e-bikes actually have the power to add 50% more speed on top of the 28 mph limit, but the 15.5 mph versions certainly have room to run up to 23 mph.The extra wear and tear on the drivetrain and components is likely reason enough for a manufacturer to claim the warranty is voided, which sounds fair to me. They factor in all their warranty planning based on their e-bikes being used as designed. So if you’re going to modify your e-bike to go faster, I think that should be on you.",ebikes
2021/09/01,"Dutch electric bicycle company VanMoof has announced one of the largest funding rounds ever in the electric bicycle company. The $128 million funding round could be a sign of more to come as e-bike sales are hotter than ever and investors continuously eye a piece of that action.The $128 million funding round was the Netherlands-based electric bicycle company’s Series C round. The company revealed that the investment was made in exchange for a minority share, which would value VanMoof at over a quarter billion dollars.Combined with a previous funding round, VanMoof claims that the total of $182 million raised in two years makes them the “most-funded e-bike company in the world.”They apparently barely edged out Rad Power Bikes for that title, as North America’s largest e-bike company hauled in its own massive $150 million funding round earlier this year and another $25 million round in 2020.Compared to the value-oriented electric bikes that Rad Power Bikes produces, VanMoof has focused on a much sleeker, tech-infused product.We got a chance to test out the company’s latest e-bikes and experience that tech firsthand.As VanMoof explained, the new funding round will go toward helping the company further invest in developing the technology that has become a hallmark of its bikes:“The funding will be used to expand production and reinvent the way in which hardware and software components are made and make high-quality, high-tech e-bikes more accessible to consumers.”VanMoof has been on a tear as the e-bike industry has seen skyrocketing sales over the last 18 months. VanMoof’s sales more than tripled in 2020, and the company capitalized on its success by growing its retail footprint from 8 to 50 locations around the world. The United States has been one of the fastest-growing markets for VanMoof, and the company plans to open a new Los Angeles store this fall.While VanMoof’s electric bicycles used to carry premium prices well north of $3,000, the company’s continued investment in production has helped lower prices to around the $2,300 mark. While still a far cry above the more budget-oriented electric bikes we’ve often seen, VanMoof also offers a number of interesting and unique features not found elsewhere.A 4-speed automatic electronic transmission helps riders stay in the correct gear for various inclines without needing constant manual adjustment.An entirely enclosed chain keeps riders’ pants and ankles free from oil and grease, and adds to the recognizable, sleek design of VanMoof’s e-bikes.The bike features movement alarms, GPS tracking and remote locking as theft deterrence, as well as an innovative rear wheel lock that can be easily engaged with the toes when dismounting the bike. A simple kick at the rear axle locks the wheel, making a would-be thief’s quick getaway much harder.VanMoof also holds the unfortunate honor of being one of the most-copied brands in the e-bike industry. The iconic frame design has found its way onto other electric bicycles from B2C companies and even a new e-bike built by one of the largest scooter-sharing companies in the world as it made a new foray into electric bicycles.VanMoof is also the originator of the “Television box” trick in the e-bike shipping industry. They were the first to print a picture of a large screen TV on their bike boxes as a way to get shipping companies to treat the bikes better en route, resulting in fewer damaged bikes. Now that’s a standard practice adopted by many leading electric bicycle manufacturers on their own e-bike boxes.VanMoof has been setting industry trends for years – now imagine what they can do with an extra $128 million in their pockets.",ebikes
2021/08/31,"German company Schaeffler has just revealed an innovative new drive system for electric bicycles that eschews traditional bike chains and belts for an entirely electrical-driven system. The new system is known as the Schaeffler Free Drive and marks the entry of one of the most divergent electric bicycle drivetrains we’ve seen in years.The Free Drive, which was co-developed with electric bicycle drivetrain specialists Heinzmann, is based upon a generator installed at the bike’s bottom bracket. The rider’s pedaling action powers the generator and converts the energy from mechanical to electrical energy.That removes the need for any form of mechanical power delivery to the rear wheel, such as chains, belts, or driveshafts.Instead, the electricity is sent to the motor in the rear wheel, where it is converted back into mechanical energy to power the bike forwards. This “bike-by-wire” system is all controlled with CAN communications between the motor, battery, generator, and control electronics.The generator is able to vary the resistance in the pedals based on how much pedaling effort is required or selected. If the rider pedals hard enough to create excess energy (more than is required to power the motor at the current speed), that energy is dumped into the e-bike’s battery to be used later.The rear motor is also capable of regenerative braking, which offers one more way to charge the battery while driving.The motor isn’t particularly powerful at just 250W, though that’s the EU limit for electric bicycle motors in Germany. This drive is designed for pedal assist riding, not high power throttle e-bike riding, and thus can make do with a smaller motor than we see on many electric bicycles in North America.While this might sound like an overly complicated system for conventional electric bicycles that needlessly reinvents the wheel (pun shamelessly intended), its benefits for non-conventional e-bikes can’t be discounted.Drive systems for cargo e-bikes, especially those with three or even four wheels, can become complicated and expensive when powered by traditional mechanical means. But a bike-by-wire system would allow cargo e-bike designers more creativity in laying out the bike. No longer would they be constrained to design around a long, flapping chain or multi-stage gear reductions with jackshafts and derailleurs. Instead, they can design based on the needs of the vehicle and simply route the electrical system around the frame as necessary.Plus, the new drive system would allow riders to finally answer “Yes!” to one of the most common (and misinformed) questions from passersby seeing an e-bike for the first time: “Does it charge when you pedal it?”One key downside to the setup is a reduced pedaling efficiency. Chains are still the most efficient way to power a bicycle and belt drives offer only a slight efficiency loss.A Schaeffler representative explained to Electrek that the Free Drive is approximately 5% less efficient than chain drives.As he explained, that means the rider would either need a 5% larger battery to get the same distance, or experience a 5% shorter range compared to the same bike with chain drive.But efficiency wasn’t the team’s main goal, and they consider the slight efficiency drop to be worth the tradeoff, which is the increased design freedom that should open the door to countless opportunities for interesting electric bicycle construction.Schaeffer will be showing off the Free Drive at the Eurobike 2021 show in Friedrichshafen, Germany. It will be located at the booth of their sales partner, Heinzmann. We’ll be sure to check it out for you, but until then we want to hear what you think of the Free Drive. Let us know in the comments section below!Image credits: Schaeffler",ebikes
2021/08/31,"Bosch has just announced one of the biggest updates in years to its electric bicycle drive unit lines, including some smart new tech and a new larger battery.The new updates are included in Bosch’s MY2022 announcement being made today.On the hardware side, Bosch is unveiling a new PowerTube 750 Wh battery that should take riders farther than ever before.Bosch’s largest battery had previously been its 625 Wh packs, which still fell somewhat behind the common 672 Wh (48V 14Ah) packs seen on many other e-bikes in the industry.Bosch’s new 4.4 kg (9.7 lb) battery now adds 20% more capacity and range to Bosch’s best in-frame offering so far.The company is also unveiling a new Kiox 300 display. It provides all the rider’s pertinent info and can be relocated to new positions around the bars as desired.The buttonless Kiox 300 display pairs with a new remote operated by the rider’s left thumb. It allows riders to change parameters on the bike, such as the pedal assist’s power level. Color changing LEDs give users a quick visual reference to confirm which power level has been selected.Moving from hardware to software, Bosch is now making its electric bikes much smarter with a host of new features.Bosch’s Flow app is designed to digitize the e-bike ownership experience. Instead of needing to bring the bike into an authorized Bosch dealer for minor updates, riders can now perform over-the-air (OTA) updates themselves via the app. That will allow riders to take advantage of new Bosch features as they are continuously developed and deployed.It’s all part of Bosch’s goal of pushing e-bikes into a more digitally customizable form, as Bosch eBike Systems CEO Claus Fleischer explained:“In the future, the eBike will automatically adjust to the rider’s personal needs. It adapts to our riding style, suggests routes that we enjoy and guides us safely from point A to B. It gets to know our preferences and interests and offers a perfectly tailored eBike experience.”The app is also useful for customizing riding modes, recording riding activities automatically, and integrating with fitness apps. The automatic riding activity recording is particularly interesting as it uses the bike’s sensors to begin the activity recording automatically, meaning riders won’t need to pull out their phones and manually click “record” to track each ride.Bosch also has its sights set on integrating Bike-to-X communication as part of the internet-of-things (IoT) framework, which would allow for interesting features to be added. By connecting with other cars and trucks, the e-bikes could give early warning signals that help to better protect riders.According to Fleischer:“While the Car-to-X communication is slowly advancing, the Bike-to-X communication will certainly remain a pipe dream for many years to come. But we see great potential here to make eBiking even safer.”Other safety advances include a “digital guardian angel” are planned to be incorporated into Bosch’s e-bike systems to call for help in the event of an emergency. GPS-based anti-theft solutions and remote locking of an e-bike that has been stolen were all floated as possibilities that will be enabled by the new technology.As Fleischer continued:“We are convinced that the fully connected, smart eBike will redefine the mobility of tomorrow, both for short trips in everyday life and for extended rides in leisure time. The smart system equips the eBike with more intelligence, comfort, and safety for the mobility of the 21st century. This is how we are turning our vision of the eBike mobility of the future into a reality, step by step.”Some of this could be game-changing for e-bikes, such as the digital guardian angel and ability for e-bikes to alert cars of their presence.Other things feel like features where Bosch is playing catchup, such as over-the-air updates. Cheap e-bikes have been capable of this for years, and it smacks of Apple selling iPhones for years before giving us common features like copy/paste. If you’re going to have a smart e-bike, then including over-the-air updates is pretty much a prerequisite these days.But there’s no denying that Bosch is laying the groundwork for what could become an incredible connected e-biking system. The real test will be to see what kind of additional features they can roll out to users to truly bring e-bikes into the 2020s.Oh yeah, and it’s also great to see battery capacity continue walking upwards. Another 20% range is a nice boost. It’s more than most people need for city riding, but off-road riding eats battery capacity for breakfast. So I’ll take any extra 20% I can get, please and thank you.",ebikes
2021/08/29,"Electric bicycle sales have been increasing around the world for years, with the US seeing particularly drastic year-over-year growth. But never before have we witnessed the kind of colossal growth spawned by the COVID-19 pandemic. And according to industry leaders, there’s no sign of it slowing down.When the pandemic first hit hard in the US around 18 months ago, most in the industry assumed it would be rough waters ahead.The truth turned out to be the exact opposite, at least in terms of sales. The numbers absolutely soared as electric bicycles flew off the shelves across the country and around the world.Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. New problems emerged in the industry due to the rapid growth. But the high sales figures have continued, and there is no expectation of returning to lower pre-pandemic sales levels.As electric bicycle company Pedego’s CEO Don DiCostanzo explained to Yahoo Finance:“Let’s face it — everything electric is just hot, whether it be cars, now planes, trains. Electric bikes are probably the fastest-growing segment of any of these categories because they’re affordable for everybody.”With so many models of electric bicycles available across the board, many of which fall in the key sub-$1,000 category, Americans have been scooping up e-bikes in droves.Pedego even rolled out its lowest-priced electric bike to date in the middle of the pandemic (see my review video below). That helped the company reach a new demographic of riders and compete more directly with industry leaders like Rad Power Bikes, which currently dominates the $1,000-$2,000 category.Many popular electric bikes still cost north of two grand, with some priced considerably higher.A new bill introduced in the US House of Representatives and a companion bill in the US Senate are currently seeking to help Americans lower those prices with an e-bike tax credit similar to the electric vehicle tax credit.The plan would create a 30% rebate towards the purchase of a new electric bicycle in the US. There are still a few limitations, such as capping the rebate at $1,500 and the qualifying price of the e-bike at $8,000. But if the legislation passes, it could open the door to a second larger wave of electric bicycle sales in the US.That couldn’t come sooner for many commuters, who are now weighing their options for socially distant commuting between private cars that are expensive and time-consuming for commutes or crowded public transportation.Electric bicycles have proven to be an excellent alternative for many of these commuters by providing a cheaper, faster and healthier alternative form of transportation.And if the last 18 months are any indication, many more commuters are likely to discover those benefits soon as the modal shift we are seeing continues to change urban and suburban transportation before our eyes.",ebikes
2021/08/27,"I’ve tested a few different Cyrusher electric fat tire bikes over the years, and they all have the same basic qualities: The fit and finish might not match the pros, but the bikes offer a fun helping of ridiculous excessiveness. The Cyrusher XF900 full-suspension fat tire e-bike might just be the most excessive yet, in all the best ways.The Cyrusher XF900 launched late last year and is even larger in person than I had expected from the photos. It doesn’t just look massive – it is massive.It’s overbuilt so that you can take it just about anywhere and throw it at just about any terrain. Between the fat tires and full-suspension, the Cyrusher is basically begging you to finally leave the asphalt behind and do some real exploring.While I tested it with a fair amount of commuting-style riding, a lot of my adventures didn’t just head for the trails – they left the trails behind completely.Take a look at how the bike fared in my video review below, then keep reading for my complete review!The Cyrusher XF900 comes pretty much fully loaded.The rear hub motor is nominally 750W, but they’ve overloaded it to pull 1.5 kW of peak power. On a lighter e-bike that’d be crazy high, though on the heavy XF900 it’s just quite high. It’s not going to throw you off the saddle, but you’ll want to make sure you’re holding on tight when you blip the throttle or engage the pedal assist.A cool feature that I don’t see very often is that the throttle’s power level is actually tied to the pedal assist level selector. With five levels of pedal assist, if you start in level 1 and mash the throttle to 100%, you’ll experience a gentle takeoff. In pedal assist level 5, the throttle gives you that jolt of power that many riders are looking for. Any number in between provides an increasingly more enthusiastic throttle response.With a powerful e-bike like this, being able to tone down the throttle is a nice feature. It’s useful when you want to do low-speed maneuvering as well as when letting a friend try the bike when you aren’t so sure how familiar they are with powerful e-bikes. I can leave it in level 1 or 2 until I see that they aren’t going to whiskey throttle their way into a brick wall.On the battery side of things, the company doesn’t mess around with puny 48V 10Ah batteries and they don’t even waste time with a 14Ah pack. They go straight to the 48V 17Ah pack to give the best range. That’s the kind of big battery you need when you’ve got a powerful motor and controller. They still advertise the silly range of 100 km (62 miles), but that would only be possible on pedal assist level 1 and with a tailwind. Expect a throttle-only range of a third of that, and a pedal assist level 3-ish range of maybe just over half the max stated range. This is a heavy bike with lots of rolling resistance, so it’s not going to be terribly efficient.As I mentioned in the opening, this e-bike is really designed for exploring the unexplored. The giant fat tires and suspension make it easy to hit obstacles you’d never consider on a hardtail e-bike with 2″ tires.Both the front and rear suspension are middle shelf; they aren’t top notch parts like we find on e-bikes that cost nearly twice this much. But they’re good enough for recreational riding, which is exactly what I was looking for.When the riding got seriously rutted out or technical, I definitely had to come out of the saddle. The suspension just isn’t plush enough for the really rough stuff. But by and large I could stay planted and have a great ride through dirt, gravel, high grass, and some light sand. The powerful motor and the tires’ ability to pretty much float over anything means you aren’t limited to trails. I did plenty of riding through tall grass fields where I had no idea what I was riding over, but apparently it didn’t matter. I couldn’t see the ground but I could still roll right over everything. The only thing getting in my way was the pair of derailleurs to snag grass and weeds. This is one of very few e-bikes to sport multiple front chainrings. The 21-speed setup is interesting, but it feels unnecessary. The advantage of all of those gears is mostly on the low end, where you can drop into lower gears for more torque during hill climbing. But with a powerful motor like this, you don’t really need to drop so low since you’ll be climbing at faster speeds anyways.The increased granularity also makes it easy to find the perfect cadence. But again, that just feels unnecessary on such a powerful e-bike. Maybe the purists will enjoy the increased gears, but I pretty much left the bike in a single gear the whole time: the highest one.That’s because the Cyrusher XF900 is just so damn fast. It tops out at 28-ish mph (45 km/h), and it gets there on throttle-only riding or with pedal assist. Technically it’s not a class 3 e-bike if it can surpass 20 mph on throttle, but no one stopped me to ask and I didn’t volunteer that info to anyone.At those speeds, the bike is an equally capable road warrior and trail tackler. I don’t often hit top speed on the trail, but the open road gives me the room I need to run fast. Back on the trails, if I hit the mid-20s of mph, I consider that pretty darn fast. Nothing is perfect, and I have a few gripes about the Cyrusher XF900.The fenders are as cheap as they come, though I get that fat tire fenders for a full-suspension e-bike are a hard nut to crack. The good news is the rear doesn’t flop too much because the rear rack holds it in place. The front gets a bit floppy, but what can you do? That’s cheap plastic for you.Next, the front headlight is fine but the rear tail light frustrates me. It isn’t a typical e-bike light that runs off the main battery. Instead, its a saddle light that has its own battery. That means two main downsides: the battery will need somewhat frequent replacing if you ride at night often, and it will be blocked if you put stuff on the rear rack. I also found myself sometimes clicking the button when I moved the bike by lifting under the saddle. If I didn’t notice that I accidentally clicked on the light, it could run for hours during the day and drain the battery by the time I need it at night.A torque sensor also would have been nice. The cadence-based pedal assist sensor is fine, but when you’re playing in the big leagues you start to want to see those nicer parts that make the riding experience just a bit more comfortable and responsive. At this price, a torque sensor would have been a nice touch.Lastly, I’d say the price is a tough sell. At $2,799, this is one expensive e-bike. You certainly get a lot: high power, larger-than-average battery, fast speeds, full-suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, included rack and fenders, etc. But it doesn’t come cheap. It’s actually evenly priced against several other full-suspension fat tire e-bikes in its class, but you have to really want all of these features to write a check that big.From my time on the bike though, I can definitely say that this is one hell of a ride. Being able to explore everything from the concrete jungle to an actual jungle, and doing it for more than just a few miles, is an experience that I hope everyone can have at some point.",ebikes
2021/08/25,"Tenways has just launched a new belt drive e-bike known as the CGO600. We got a chance to test one out pre-launch to determine whether the nascent brand’s urban electric bicycle was worth a look.Spoiler alert: It’s worth much more than a look.Right off the bat, you should know that Tenways is launching its CGO 600 electric bike via a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.That’s not a bad thing – plenty of major companies from Segway to NIU have done the same thing for their new product launches.When it comes to crowdfunding campaigns for new e-bikes or other rideables, our general rule is that we won’t cover them unless the company has a proven track record of making deliveries, or we can test the product in advance if it’s a brand new company.In this case Tenways gave us the chance to score some in-depth testing over several weeks so we could really get a good sense of the quality and performance of the bike. You can check out my video review of the e-bike below, but don’t forget to keep reading for even more details and opinions from my testing.The Tenways electric bike is absolutely an urban-optimized e-bike, there’s no doubt about that.It’s got classic bike messenger styling and hides away almost all traces of electric assist. The rear motor is the only real giveaway, and even that could be mistaken for an internally geared hub from a cursory glance. It is positively tiny, dwarfed by the rotor for the hydraulic disc brakes.Of course the motor isn’t really an internally geared hub – and thus there aren’t any gears at all on this e-bike. But the trade-off for not being able to shift is that you’re gifted this awesome Gates carbon drive system. It replaces a conventional bicycle chain and makes for a smoother, quieter, and maintenance-free ride. These last for tens of thousands of miles – way longer than chains – and never need oiling or adjusting. That low-maintenance drive system is combined nicely with the hydraulic disc brakes that remove nearly all brake maintenance other than once-in-a-while brake pad changes. For an everyday urban commuter, having less to worry about is highly appreciated. I just want to grab my bike and go, knowing that it’s in good shape, and I’m not going to suddenly find a clicking derailleur or brakes that need the cable adjusted partway through my ride to work.The rest of the bicycle-only side of things are also quite agreeable to me: The grips feel fine even if they’re basic, the bike is comfortable to ride (despite it adopting more of that tucked ride position than I normally opt for), and the lightweight 33 lb (15 kg) design makes it a breeze to pick up and carry up a flight of stairs.But the electrical side of the bike is where I really want to dig in, because Tenways did a great job there. First of all, the bike sports a true torque sensor, meaning that pedal assist comes on fast and smooth. That’s important when you don’t have a throttle to help get rolling – especially on a single speed electric bike. You really want that pedal assist to engage quickly, but not abruptly, so that you start rolling with assist. On flat ground it’s more of a luxury, but for starting at the bottom of a hill, I consider that a necessity.The torque sensor is easily one of the areas where the Tenways e-bike has an advantage over similar belt-driven competition like the Ride1Up Roadster V2. The Tenways is priced a decent bit higher at $1,799 compared to the Roadster V2’s $1,045 price, but it also gets that nicer torque sensor and hydraulic disc brakes.The 250W motor isn’t overly powerful, but this isn’t a motorbike – it’s a pedal assist electric bicycle. I see the Tenways e-bike as appealing to someone who would already be comfortable on a single-speed or messenger-style bike, but wants a bit of boost for getting over the bridge or traveling at higher speeds without breaking a sweat.You do get three power levels to choose from, so you can crank it up to max power if you need it. But even on the medium power level, I felt like I had a reasonable amount of assist to keep me from working too hard. On the lowest assist level, I was definitely still getting a workout and I wouldn’t call it a sweat-free ride.Tenways claims a hilariously lofty range of 80 miles (130 km) per charge, which of course they’ll say is possible under “ideal conditions” in the lowest assist level. With a 252 Wh battery, even the efficient pedal assist is going to make it hard to achieve that range in the real world. Max assist level will likely net you 20-30 miles if you’re cruising at 20 mph in the US, and 50 miles is probably achievable in the lowest assist level since you’re doing the lion’s share of the work. The European version of the bike will be more efficient in max assist level because the speed is limited to 25 km/h or 15.5 mph. That small battery is a tradeoff – you get a slick looking e-bike but at the expense of not having a huge battery pack. Plus there’s the fact that you can’t easily remove the battery for charging, which is another good reason that the bike’s low weight of 33 lb becomes important in case you need to carry the bike somewhere to charge.So there are certainly trade-offs here. And if you can’t see yourself on a thin tire, low-power electric bike, then this likely isn’t your jam. But for urban riders that just need a minimalist yet quality e-bike that won’t stretch a paycheck too far, Tenways surprised me with how much they brought to the table here. It’s a good-looking e-bike that performs well and could easily pay for itself compared to a year of bus rides (or a month of parking fees, in some places!).The biggest downside here isn’t the bike – it’s the sales method. Many people will still be afraid to trust a crowdfunding sales method, despite it becoming one of the most common strategies for launching new personal electric vehicles like e-bikes and e-scooters. While I can vouch for the quality of the bike, it still takes a small leap of faith to plunk down a pre-order. Tenways claims they’ll be shipping as soon as September and already has photos on the campaign page showing its production running, so at least riders won’t have to wait too long to get on their new bikes.What do you think of the Tenways CGO 600 e-bike?

2021/08/24,"Electric bicycle manufacturer Himiway has been riding high on its main two electric bicycle models for quite some time. Now the company says it is ready to mix it up with a slew of new e-bikes.Himiway’s bread and butter has so far been its fat tire Cruiser e-bike and Escape moped e-bike.Both are fast Class 3 e-bikes that can be unlocked for impressive speed and power levels rarely seen in the industry.But with only two main e-bike styles in the lineup, Himiway is apparently planning to launch four new models with a bang during an upcoming livestream in October (date: TBD).As Himiway’s marketing manager explained:“We look forward to delighting both returning and new customers with our latest e-bike models. Watch our free livestream announcement from anywhere in the world this October as we showcase the Softail Supreme, Multifunctional, and Premium All-Terrain E-bikes. We will be announcing four new bikes across these three categories as an extension of our mission to revolutionize the electric bike experience for riders of all ages and fitness levels.”Himiway is referring to its new softail e-bike as its “most innovative e-bike yet.”The company hasn’t released too many details other than to confirm that it will feature full-suspension with high-quality suspension components. Himiway has also teased the price, indicating that it will fall somewhere in the $2,100 to $3,000 range.This wouldn’t technically be Himiway’s first full-suspension e-bike, as the company’s electric moped also sports rear suspension. But that bike uses a simpler dual-coilover shock setup, while the softail e-bike Himiway is teasing is likely to be more similar to a traditional electric mountain bike.It’s not quite clear what Himiway means by a multifunctional e-bike, but it will likely fall somewhere in the hybrid category.As the company explained: “The Multifunctional E-Bike, as the name implies, will offer riders a range of uses from grocery shopping to pickups and deliveries, all the way to weekend trips with the family. E-bikes are well-known for their versatility and many people have replaced cars with an e-bike as their main mode of transportation. This makes e-bikes, such as Himiway’s, very affordable when considering the total cost of ownership. The Multifunctional E-bike will raise the bar for what it means to offer maximum utility at an affordable price.”That might even mean that we could see a longtail cargo e-bike or a shorter utility bike. Given Himiway’s penchant for borrowing design inspiration, a RadRunner-inspired e-bike might not be out of the question.And considering the teaser price of “$1X99,” we expect it will likely compete in the same category as popular cargo/utility e-bikes designed for value-oriented shoppers.Again, Himiway is light on the details here for the company’s supposed “Premium All-terrain E-bike.” All we really know is that the company claims it will be “a blend of mountain and urban cruiser.”We also know it will also be a sub-$2K e-bike just like the “multifunctional” line, so we’ll see what rolls out in October.An update to the current Himiway Cruiser is a decent possibility, meaning fat tires for all-terrain riding combined with urban features like racks and lights.Considering the company claims four new models are coming (and my PR contact mentioned an actual five models), some of these three styles are likely to have variants such as step-through frames.Himiway is taking a bit of a novel path here, dropping details about specific models and rough price ranges, yet preventing us from looking behind the curtain yet. They’re also using some odd nomenclature, but I’ll chalk that up to a PR language barrier. The company boasts a warehouse in California and an address in a business park in Vancouver, Canada. But let’s get real. That appears to be a small rented office, leaving Himiway as a primarily Chinese brand operating a direct-to-consumer model in the US. I would have loved to see images of these new e-bike models, but Himiway isn’t ready to let us peek yet. The styles sound like a welcome addition to the lineup though, as they’ll help round out the otherwise lack of variety currently offered by the company.As it is, Himiway already suffers from accusations that its two models are largely inspired by (if given the benefit of the doubt) or knock-offs (if not) of two other major players: Rad Power Bikes’ RadRover e-bikes and Juiced Bike’s Scorpion electric moped. Both models have since received updates, and so it’s not surprising that Himiway is also looking to update its line.Come October we should have a much better idea of what Himiway is cooking up.",ebikes
2021/08/21,"Two of my passions are electric bicycle projects and DIY solar powered projects. In fact I’ve written the book on both topics. So to see these two fields combined in one quirky-yet-awesome product totally made my week. I just hope you’re as excited as I am to dive into this strange electric bike/car contraption that boasts a heap of features from seating for two to a giant solar panel array offering nearly unlimited range!It’s just one of many strange, awesome and fun-looking electric vehicles I’ve discovered while window shopping on the world’s most eclectic digital thrift store: Alibaba. And now it has the honor of officially becoming this week’s Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week! We’ve seen solar powered electric bicycles before, but they’re usually designed with some serious pedaling requirements. The low power of even large-sized panels means that riders generally still have to provide some significant leg assist.But this giant electric bicycle – errr, tricycle – has a huge canopy housing five 120 W solar panels for a total of 600W of power. It solved the panel size problem by wearing them as a hat instead of dragging them along behind the bike.Keep in mind that you’re probably only going to get a maximum of 400W or 450W of real power in ideal conditions, but that’s still plenty considering the motor size.They only outfitted the bike with a small 250W rear motor, so even spotty sun should give you as much power as you’re draining from the battery. That means you’ve got essentially unlimited range as long as the sun is out.And even when the sun goes down, this solar-powered e-bike has you covered with a generous 60V and 20Ah battery packing 1,200 Wh of capacity. The batteries seem to be mounted on the two rear rails, so we’re likely looking at a pair of 60V10Ah packs in parallel.If you assume a constant 250W draw, that’s nearly five hours of riding after the sun goes down. Plan your sleep pattern and bathroom breaks correctly and you could practically ride cross-country for weeks without ever having to plug in to charge. And the pair of pedals on the driver’s side means you could theoretically go it on your own if you ever ran out of juice after a particularly long cloudy period. Or you could carry an electric generator with you to recharge on the fly! Or you could just slap on a second 60V20Ah e-bike battery for cheap. The possibilities are as endless as the sun! (As in about 5 billions years more of them.)The solar panel canopy also gives plenty of shade and even provides a mount for headlights hoisted up high for good visibility.Slung below the canopy are not one but two recumbent style chairs that will surely prove much more comfortable than bicycle saddles on that cross country trip. How long you’ll be able to stand being shoulder to shoulder with your riding partner while cruising at a frustratingly slow top speed of 30 km/h (18 mph) remains to be seen.It’s unclear how steering works as the rear wheel appears to be fixed and the front wheels lack an axle or articulating steering. Perhaps those details combined with the lack of any brake calipers connected to that handbrake lever might be a clue that this is an unfinished rendering. Either that or you steer it like a canoe and apply the brakes just like Fred Flintstone.Yabadabadoo!One of my favorite parts of this solar powered electric bike is the price – just a quaint $1,550! Many of my favorite non-solar powered e-bikes cost more than that, and they only fit one rider!The only downside is that the Alibaba vendor has a minimum order quantity of 100 units.Just for kicks and giggles, I started down that road and got a quote of around $36,000 for shipping to the US. So at $191,000 for a hundred units, I may just need to start my own solar racing league and let the sponsors pay the bill. You know, if this thing actually exists.",ebikes
2021/08/19,"When you think of electric mobility company Bird, the mind conjures up black and gray electric scooters zipping along city streets. But with today’s announcement of the new Bird Bike, the company is now adding black and gray electric bicycles to the mix. But haven’t I seen that design somewhere?Bird’s aptly named Bird Bike features an elegantly designed diamond frame (or a still pretty decent-looking step-through frame in the accessible model).Anyone who has been around the e-bike block a time or two, though, will instantly recognize the design as particularly VanMoofian. Dutch bike company VanMoof is no stranger to seeing its designs ‘inspire’ other companies, everywhere from the style of the frame to the innovative packaging. And at least in this case, Bird has done a very nice job of integrating that design into a new consumer-facing e-bike. It certainly looks a lot sleeker than the company’s bulbous bikeshare e-bikes.Bird’s Chief Vehicle Officer Scott Rushforth deftly skirted around the issue, saying:“The demand for consumer e-bikes has never been greater, and neither has the need for innovative vehicles that get riders excited about cycling. That was our north star when developing the Bird Bike. It has a sleek, aluminum alloy A and V-frame design that gives it a look that’s both familiar and cutting-edge.”Heh, “familiar.”The Bird Bike sports a rear hub motor from Bafang, a leading electric bicycle motor manufacturer that we had the chance to visit in China and tour their factory.US riders get a 500W motor, while European riders will find a 250W motor instead. Whether or not that’s a simple sticker swap or an actual motor variation remains unclear. US riders will also get the benefit of a thumb throttle in addition to pedal assist, while Europeans will have to be content with just pedal assist.An LCD screen mounted on the handlebar stem contains all the pertinent riding information, such as speed, distance and battery level, yet keeps the handlebars free of clutter and saves space for adding riders’ own accessories.That’s actually a pretty decent display, which I know not from having personally tested the Bird Bike yet, but rather because the same display was used on another e-bike model I tested recently.Powering the bike is a removable 36V and 12.8Ah battery with 460 Wh of capacity. Bird claims that’s enough for 50 miles (80 km) of range on the most relaxed pedal assist setting. Stick to throttle only, and you’ll see range drop to 20 miles (32 km), according to the sales page.The Bird Bike also has a few interesting features that you won’t find on many other models.Replacing a typical chain drive is a Gates carbon belt drive. That setup is prized as a silent, zero-maintenance solution that feels smooth and lasts nearly forever. Various lifespans are thrown around frequently, but most fall into the 20,000-50,000 mile range. The bike’s IP65 water-resistant rating is also a plus for anyone who lives in the real world and occasionally finds themselves caught out in a rainstorm. We’re starting to see more water-resistant electric bicycles, but it’s never a given. So props to Bird for embracing their street-tough roots from scooter sharing and adopting several low-maintenance, long-life solutions.The Bird Bike will be available later this fall in the US, followed by a European release later this year. The bike will carry an MSRP of $2,299, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack for electric bicycle pricing.I gave Bird a bit of a hard time for lifting the major design elements, but at least they did a good job with it. I really like the way the LED lights are integrated into the front and rear of the top tube. Though again, that’s straight-up VanMoof design.The battery is also nicely integrated while still being removable, so there’s another win for me in the design column.The Gates carbon drive is awesome, even if it adds significantly to the price. But at $2,299, I would have at least hoped for hydraulic disc brakes or a bigger battery – or both.There are a lot of great e-bikes out there at or below this price point. The Bird Bike looks great, and it seems to have decent specs, but it is competing with faster, more powerful and longer range e-bikes that outmuscle it while undercutting it on price.That being said, if the bike rides as good as it looks, then it just might be worth it. I’ll try to get my hands on one ASAP to let you know if that’s the case.",ebikes
2021/08/18,"You may be familiar with Ariel Rider from the Seattle-based company’s popular high-power and high-speed electric bicycles. But they also recently unveiled a decidedly mid-power e-bike that is overflowing with value. The new Ariel Rider Rideal borrows from many of the e-bike industry’s favorite parts and features, then delivers in an affordably priced electric commuter bike.Unlike the high-power electric mopeds that Ariel Rider is commonly known for, the Rideal is a much more low-key electric bicycle.It’s designed as a commuter e-bike and thus sports a motor that is powerful enough for strong starts and hill climbs, but doesn’t cut into the bike’s efficiency too heavily.Built with an emphasis on urban rideability, the Ariel Rider Rideal packs in the features most-demanded by commuters.And at just $999, it does it for a song.To see the bike in its true environment, check out my testing video below. Then keep reading for my full review.The layout of the Ariel Rider Rideal is your basic city e-bike. That means it doesn’t have fancy suspension. It doesn’t have big, plush tires. And it doesn’t have any built-in high tech features like cameras or connectivity.But by saving more than a few bucks with a shortened feature list, the Ariel Rider team was able to invest in making everything remaining just a bit nicer. The Velo seat is actually quite comfortable without getting in the way of pedaling, and I love that grab handle underneath for moving the bike around the garage. The faux leather handgrips are classy and feel good in the hands. And even the paint has a slight metal flake look to it, giving it a subtle shimmer that gives a higher-quality sense without going over the top with a cheesy glitter finish.The 750W motor is more powerful than you find in similar metro e-bikes, the 624 Wh battery is larger and thus offers more range, and the bike even includes a 6-speed transmission – a feature that is becoming increasingly less common in budget-oriented e-bikes.The head and tail lights aren’t going to compete with fancy European-built lights on higher-dollar electric bikes, but they work better than the lack of lights we’re also seeing more of in this space.In fact, while we’re making comparisons to other e-bikes, let’s go ahead and compare the bike to its most similar competitor: the single-speed RadMission.We’ve seen plenty of companies try to take on Rad Power Bikes, the leader (by far) in North American e-bike sales. Some companies have made blatant rip-offs and clones of Rad’s bikes, inevitably with much lower quality.In this case, the Rideal feels more like an “inspired-by” than a clone. In fact, it even has a number of advantages. While the frame style and display scream RadMission, the bike’s performance specs actually shine a bit brighter. The Rideal has a larger battery, more powerful motor, and offers a multi-speed transmission that can help on varied terrain/hills. That doesn’t mean it can ever match the added value of a company like Rad, such as the excellent reputation for nationwide support and Rad Mobile service that can send an e-bike technician directly to your garage for repairs. But comparing bike to bike, this doesn’t feel like one of those cheap clone situations. And since Rad has never competed on performance, this seems more like a high-performance e-bike company applying their penchant for bigger motors and batteries to a niche that Rad exploited first.The long and short of it is that not everyone needs an over-the-top fat tire electric bike or a long tail cargo e-bike. Some people simply want a basic, light(ish) weight electric bike for zipping down to campus or the local coffee shop.The ability to add some utility, such as swapping in a front rack like I ultimately added, means you can even get a bit of light-duty cargo carrying in as well.I wish some of the Ariel Rider Rideal’s accessories came standard, such as the fender set that costs an extra $59. But when the bike is only priced at $999, I understand that they’ve got to try to pad the profits with a few accessories.But for a general purpose, simple e-bike that is designed for no-frills riding, the Rideal definitely scores high marks. Everything about it feels like a definite step up from the cheaper Amazon e-bikes. The low-dollar Amazon e-bikes typically have plastic pedals and light mounts, soft or rickety-feeling brakes, unforgiving saddles, and other cost-cutting measures. But the Rideal feels like you’re sitting on something closer to a $1,500 e-bike than a $750 e-bike.It doesn’t just feel good though, it also has the performance to match. Even though it’s got a simple LED display to check the pedal assist (PAS) level, the cadence-based sensor works great and offers anything from a light assist on the low end during a workout ride to a powerful assist on the high end that basically means your feet are just throttles connected to your shins.The main complaint I have about e-bikes with LED displays is that there’s no odometer. I can live without knowing my current speed (and I guess not knowing my mileage won’t kill me either, if I’m being realistic) but I really like being able to see the odometer tick up over time. It’s both a fun feature to enjoy the sense of accomplishment when you pass big milestones, and also a good reminder for mileage-based maintenance like checking spoke tension every few hundred miles.But again, at this price I won’t gripe too hard about the lack of a real LCD display. I knew this was going to be a simple e-bike, and that’s exactly what I was looking for. It works great, has plenty of power, more than enough range, and even comes in two frame styles (high-step or mid-step) to allow a bit of customization for shorter and taller riders.While it could always be fancier, I’m pretty darn happy with the Rideal. I honestly think it’s worth more than $999 based on the performance and quality feel of the ride, but don’t tell Ariel Rider I said that!",ebikes
2021/08/16,"When it comes to e-bikes, full-suspension electric mountain bikes are where the fun’s at. They give you the confidence and the comfort to do things you wouldn’t attempt on most other e-bikes. But that comes at a high cost – as in a high price. Budget eMTBs may not pack the same punch or performance as the top-dollar versions, but bikes like the Paselec GS9 give us normies the chance to have some real fun on a full-suspension electric mountain bike without having to sell a kidney.I won’t bury the lede here, since the price tag is what really sets this e-bike apart.The Paselec GS9 is priced at $1,399 on the company’s website when you use the coupon code ELECTREKGS9COUPON for $300 off, or $1,420 on Amazon.If you’re one of those “an e-bike should never cost more than $500” grumblers, that price will still seem sky high. But if you understand the market (and realize that the good full-suspension e-bikes cost 2-4x that price or more), then you’ll realize that’s a steal of a price.After having tested the GS9, I can absolutely say that it doesn’t stack up to the pricier versions. But it sure does get the job done for mere mortals like us that just want a decent, full-suspension electric mountain bike for playing around on the trails and getting in some fitness riding in the backcountry.Check out my video review to see what makes this e-bike tick, then keep reading for my complete thoughts.The Paselec GS9 may not be the best full-suspension electric mountain bike out there, but it’s pretty darned good for the price.The designers included key parts I’d look for in a light-duty electric mountain bike, such as the 180 mm hydraulic disc brakes, the 8-speed Shimano drivetrain, and some workable suspension.The suspension isn’t top-notch, but it definitely allowed me to ride much more comfortably off-road than I can with my non-suspension e-bikes.The gel saddle also adds to the suspension to give a very comfortable ride.Would I take this off any crazy jumps? Probably not. Would I take it off light jumps? Definitely, for as long as I could!Other parts offer similar compromises. There’s an included headlight but it’s nothing to write home about. It will let cars see you on the road but won’t entirely illuminate a pitch-black trail at night. And while the saddle has a rear tail light, it runs off swappable batteries, meaning you’ll eventually have to make the swap. I absolutely can’t stand it when e-bike companies do that – just give me lights that use the main battery pack! I’m already carrying a big battery, let me use it!That’s probably the biggest offense on the bike, and the rest is mostly uphill. Good brakes, decent suspension, comfy saddle and bars, a Shimano 8-speed that works just fine, etc. All good, all works, nothing over the top.My only other real gripe is that they went with a thumb throttle, despite having a trigger shifter. That’s a lot of levers in the thumb area, and I would have preferred to see either a twist throttle or twist shifter. Too many levers makes me feel like I’m operating an excavator.Even though I would have preferred a twist throttle to not interfere with the shifter, having any throttle is a welcome feature. I love having the option of both pedal assist and throttle when I need it. The 500W motor is decently powerful on throttle-only, though it doesn’t compare to the 1,000W and higher electric mountain bikes I’ve tested.Even so, on both throttle and pedal assist I can get moving quickly. Reaching 25 mph (40 km/h) doesn’t feel shady, thanks to the mid-level construction of the bike. Again, this isn’t a pro bike, but it doesn’t feel like it’s going to shake loose on you, either. It’s decidedly middle of the road in that regard.I’m probably guilty of riding with throttle-only more than I should, but only because it’s just so much fun. The battery isn’t huge at 48V and 13Ah, so I try not to overdo the throttle. The pedal assist is cadence-based, and so it’s reasonably responsive without being as spot on as a real torque sensor. Using the pedal assist definitely helps eke out more range, though. I don’t think I ever saw close to the advertised 50-mile (80 km) range of the bike, but I also didn’t do a lot of pedal assist level 1 riding, either.While we’re discussing battery, let’s talk about the quirkiness. On the one hand, I love these integrated batteries. The Paselec GS9 doesn’t even look like an e-bike at first glance, thanks to the hidden battery. When you’re riding trails with snobs that give e-bikers a hard time, that’s a nice little bonus. The downside to fully integrated batteries is that they can’t be removed for charging in order to lighten the bike when loading onto a car rack, or any of the many other reasons you’d want to pull the battery out. But the Paselec GS9 splits the difference with a battery that’s integrated yet still removable. It has a lock at the bottom of the downtube right in front of the bottom bracket. Turning the key allows the battery to drop right out, though the pack is so long that you need to either lift the bike up or lay it on its side to get the battery all the way out. You can see exactly what I mean in the video above.Being able to remove the battery also means you could carry a spare or even replace it in a few years when the cells start to age and you don’t get as much range – another big benefit of removable batteries.Here’s the thing: The Paselec GS9 isn’t some big-name e-bike. It doesn’t come from a flashy company and it doesn’t have big brand awareness. So I went into this review not expecting much.And while I can tell it doesn’t have the quality level of those fancier full-suspension electric mountain bikes, it still surprised me with how well it handled what I threw at it.To me, this is a great full-suspension electric mountain bike for recreational riders. If you’re a downhill enthusiast or regularly take the most technical trails at your local bike park, the GS9 probably isn’t the e-bike for you. You’ll want something more professional.But if you’re just a weekend warrior that enjoys getting out in the dirt and mountains for some fun riding, the GS9 is more than happy to deliver that experience. It uses good but not great parts that help save on cost while still providing a more capable off-road ride than a typical hard tail mountain bike. It’s basically the definition of “value,” giving you just enough of what you need and at a reasonable price.That’s exactly what I’m looking for in a proper budget-level, full-suspension electric mountain bike: something that gives me more capabilities without overly compromising on safety or quality.

2021/08/13,"The trusty delivery van may be the most common form of last mile delivery in cities around the world, but its position atop the throne is now being challenged by an unlikely competitor: the humble electric cargo bicycle.Cargo e-bikes are similar to most electric bicycles in that they feature an assist motor and battery to help the rider travel faster and farther. But unlike most electric bicycles, cargo e-bikes have longer, more robust frames designed to carry significantly larger loads and sometimes even additional passengers.A new study has found that in urban areas, electric cargo bicycles make deliveries 60% faster than delivery vans.While delivery vans may be capable of carrying more packages, they are much less efficient at actually making deliveries. The study found that electric cargo bikes were capable of making 10 deliveries per hour on average in urban areas, while delivery vans recorded just 6 deliveries in the same period.The major factor was the increased average speed of delivery e-bikes. They were able to utilize bicycle lanes and thus avoid getting bogged down in traffic. Larger delivery vans don’t have the same luxury, ultimately spending much more time waiting in traffic.The study also found that cargo electric bicycles didn’t just get deliveries done faster, they also performed the job much more cleanly. Compared to diesel vans, the cargo e-bikes cut emissions by 90%. Even compared to electric vans, cargo e-bikes had 30% fewer emissions.While electric delivery vans are slowly becoming more commonplace, they still can’t compete with cargo e-bikes on efficiency or emissions. They’re a huge improvement over fossil fuel-powered vans, but they use more energy to make deliveries and they get bogged down in traffic just the same.The speed and efficiency advantages of electric cargo bikes have been exploited by a number of industries. E-bike maker Tern recently teamed up with Dutch-X to combine the latter’s NYC delivery service with the former’s heavy duty electric cargo bikes.Third party logistics companies such as UPS, FedEx and DHL have employed cargo e-bikes to increase the speed and efficiency of package deliveries in urban areas. Hospitals have used cargo e-bikes as mini-ambulances to more quickly deliver EMTs and their life-saving first aid to emergency sites. And cargo e-bikes are even being used by entrepreneurs to operate food trucks and ice-cream vans on smaller, cheaper and more sustainable platforms.I file this one in the ‘duh’ category.Cargo e-bikes simply make so much sense. I’ve always had a thing for e-bikes that can carry more than one person, and cargo e-bikes combine that shared fun factor with extreme utility for carrying cargo/groceries/supplies/deliveries/etc.They have the ability to replace so many types of vehicles. Think you need a minivan to move apartments? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.Think you need a truck to make a lumber run to your local home improvement store? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.Think you need an SUV to haul all the kids to school? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.Think you need a van to pick up a new bike? Mikey’s done it on a cargo e-bike.There’s just so much utility to be had with a cargo electric bike. What’s not to like?!",ebikes
2021/08/13,"While most bike manufacturers like to claim their electric bikes are suitable for almost anything, it’s clear that the Furo X has a pretty distinct market in mind: City dwellers living in apartments.That’s apparent from the carbon fiber construction, aimed at minimizing the weight of the bike for those who have to lug it upstairs, and the folding design so that it doesn’t take up much space when stored at home.Electric bikes are heavy. That’s unavoidable when you take all the components from a traditional bike, then add an electric motor and a beefy battery. The last one I tested, the gorgeous VanMoof S3, weighed 41.9 pounds. I once had to carry it up three flights of stairs and very much hope never to do it again.Furo Systems describes the Furo X as ‘incredibly lightweight.’ At 33 pounds, I’m not sure that’s quite the term I would use personally, but yes – by the standards of electric bikes, lifting this one won’t result in chiropractor bills.Bikes also take up a lot of space in a city apartment, and while the fold isn’t the best (see below), it does allow it to sit in a hallway or corner of a room without taking over the place.So with the key benefits outlined, let’s see how it fares in real-life use.Folding bikes don’t typically look stylish. My daily ride is a Brompton, and as huge a fan as I am of them, even I would admit that they look like clown bikes when you’re riding them.Aesthetics are very personal, so whether you consider the Furo X stylish is a judgment you’ll have to make for yourself, but I think it’s fair to say that the design makes it look modern and hi-tech.The one exception, for me, is the battery. I have a strong preference for this to be integrated within the frame – though there are pros and cons to the Furo approach, as we’ll see – and there’s just something about this one that looks like a crude after-thought.One small point: The gear indicator is fitted effectively backward on the bars, which means there is no way to read it while riding! This photo is taken from the front of the bike, not the riding position:The Furo X has some impressive specifications. There’s that carbon fiber frame, of course, but the components are equally pleasing.You get a 9-speed Shimano Sora indexed derailleur system and Shimano hydraulic disk brakes. This is a decent bike before you even get to the electrics.The motor is a Bafang 250W rear hub motor coupled to the same Samsung Lithium-ion batteries used in the Tesla S.Furo claims 28 miles from the standard 314Wh battery and 37 miles with the 378Wh Max model.  To me, this again underlines the ‘city riding’ target market for this bike. Neither is a range suitable for a day ride, but even 28 miles is perfectly good enough for typical cycle commuting. Buy a second charger to keep at the office, and it would work even for long-distance cycle commuters.At the time of writing, the price includes a ‘limited offer’ of free mudguards, rear luggage carrier, kickstand and ‘complete lighting kit’ (which I’ll moan about later).The Furo X is an absolute joy to ride. Not many folding bikes deliver a rock-solid ride, but this one does. One thing that helps enormously is the adjustability of the bike. Like any folding bike, you can adjust the saddle height – and using an oval-shaped seat-post means that it can’t rotate, which is a very nice design touch. But the handlebar height is also adjustable, which I really appreciated. It means you can have a sporty position when you want to ride fast and a relaxed sit-up-and-beg position when you just want to meander along enjoying the sights.There’s no suspension, but the combination of carbon frame and fat, low-pressure tires means that it’s comfortable to ride even over some of the many bumpy London streets.The saddle is a gel one. I’m a Brooks fan (the B17 specifically), and a saddle is usually the first thing I change when I buy a bike, but the stock saddle isn’t terrible. For the sorts of short rides for which the bike is designed, you could probably live with it.The brakes are awesome! They’re incredibly effective and very controllable once you get used to their power. I think I can stop faster on this than any bike I have ever ridden.As a relatively short wheelbase bike with small wheels, the bike is quick-steering, but I’m used to that with my Brompton, and it’s something to which you quickly adjust. Once you have, then you appreciate the maneuverability in city traffic.Without power assist, the Furo X is rather sluggish, but it is rideable. If you run out of power, then it wouldn’t leave you stranded – I would happily cycle a few miles home without the motor.There’s a rear luggage carrier, and the addition of a cargo net and a couple of small bungies let me easily carry a backpack.In short, I loved riding this bike.There’s a small control panel on the handlebars, with a power button plus + and – buttons. The main use for these is to adjust the power assistance level, but there are also various arcane button combinations to change settings – like from km to miles. The display shows your speed, power assistance level, battery level (graphic only, no percentage or estimated range) and an adjustable function display offering odometer, trip meter, timer, watts, max speed or average speed. It does, however, lack the most useful display, which would be a clock.There are five power levels. Level 1 essentially turns it into a conventional lightweight bike. It provides enough assistance to overcome the weight of the electrics but still feels like a very natural ride.Level 5 is totally effortless up to about 16-17mph. With this level of assistance, I treated the bike as a 2-speed, setting off in 5th gear and quickly changing up to 9th. Even the steepest hill I could find in central London – Tower Hill – was no problem at all simply by dropping to 4th gear. Pull away from a standstill in 4th gear in assist level 5, and you can literally pull a wheelie!The maximum speed is tailored to the local law, so 20mph in the US. The assistance level does fall off noticeably once you hit about 17mph, but a 20mph cruise is certainly achievable with rather modest cycling effort.The most natural way of matching the motor output to pedaling effort is a torque sensor, which is what high-end electric bikes use. The cheapest way is a speed sensor. The Furo X sits between the two, using a cadence sensor. This means the motor application is very perceptible but enables you to cruise along at 17-18mph with basically zero effort, simply rotating the pedals with as little effort as you would to cycle at 3mph in first gear.There is a little lag, both when the motor cuts in and out. The lag when you start pedaling is barely perceptible. The delay in cutting out when you stop pedaling feels a little disconcerting, especially if you’ve gone straight from pedaling to braking – like when traffic signals change. For about half a second, you’re trying to stop the bike while the motor is trying to propel the bike. But that’s just psychological: It’s fast enough that any difference in stopping distance will be measured in inches.The biggest issue I had with the motor was random cut-outs.Well, I say random, but that isn’t quite the case. It happens (unpredictably) when you go over a bump. It happened to me several times in the few days I was testing the bike.The first time it happened, I hit a small bump in the road – nothing dramatic, just the kind of surface imperfection you find everywhere on London streets – and the display switched off, and the motor died. This same thing happened two or three more times over the course of a week or so.A variation I experienced once was that the display remained on, but the motor stopped working.Most times, power-cycling the bike fixed it: Switching it off and on again. But when it happened without the display cutting out, power-cycling didn’t help. I then decided since it was caused by a bump, maybe it could be fixed by one. I bounced the bike on the rear wheel, and yep, that worked.This is obviously annoying, but it could potentially be dangerous. When accelerating away from traffic signals, for example, you can be in front of traffic and accelerating nicely, but a motor cutout could see you cease accelerating or even decelerating unexpectedly.Now, this might be a fault with this particular bike – it is a press loaner, so perhaps not always treated with the same loving care people give their own bikes. But I have a suspicion about what is happening. I think, because the battery is removable, it can be jolted and break the contact momentarily, so the bike thinks you’ve switched it off. If I’m right, then this is a drawback to the removable battery.I did some Googling after encountering this problem and found that it’s not just me, and not just this particular bike.I would imagine it wouldn’t be too difficult a fix for Furo Systems. It might be that better shock-absorbance would resolve it, which might be as simple as a piece of rubber. Alternatively, it might mean adjusting the connector so that a slight movement doesn’t disconnect power. But it is a fix that needs to be made.Update: Furo Systems suggested a small modification to the power connectors, and also advised that the company has now redesigned them to prevent any recurrence of the issue.The bike is light by electric bike standards. I mean, I wouldn’t want to carry it very far, but for multi-modal transport, where you perhaps take a train for part of the journey and cycle at either end, there’s not generally much carrying involved. I think I’ve taken my Brompton on every form of public transit – trains, planes, buses, ferries, you name it. I generally wheel it to the door, fold it and then just carry it to my seat, and you could, in principle, do the same with this – so the weight isn’t an issue.The actual fold and unfold works well and includes folding pedals on both sides, but the final folded result is far from ideal.Although Furo has copied the overall mechanics of the Brompton fold, the bike doesn’t clip together in any way. You have to use a (supplied) velcro strip to hold it together, which is inelegant and doesn’t provide confidence that it will remain folded. More than this, the width and shape of the folded bike are just incredibly awkward to carry. I couldn’t find any comfortable way to do it. And while the Brompton fits neatly between back-to-back train seats or into an overhead locker on long-haul aircraft, the X is far bigger when folded and gets in the way much more on public transit.There is a mode where you can wheel it on one wheel semi-folded, but that’s no good for stairs or escalators and makes the bike too big for crowded platforms on public transit.So right away, I would say if multi-modal transport is your vision for this bike, then this is probably not the ideal solution, unless the two forms of transport are car and bike, and you have enough trunk space.However, if all you want is to fold the bike at either end of your journey, no problem. I mean, it’s not as compact as a Brompton, as you can see below, but most people are going to find somewhere to put it, even in a small city center apartment.Charging is very easy with the supplied brick: Just open the rubber flap and plug it in.If you can’t easily store the bike close to a plug socket, then using a key lets you easily remove the battery and charge it wherever is convenient. As I mentioned in the opening, the removable battery isn’t pretty, but it is convenient. However, it’s also top of my suspect list for the motor cut-outs.The lights are the worst feature of the bike, by far!First, the front light is only kind of vaguely adequate, while the rear light is just a joke. It is literally a single LED! You could use the hazard lights, which I’ll get to in a moment, but it’s still not even close to bright enough for road use.Worse, the front light doesn’t draw power from the main battery! It’s a standalone light, which is ridiculous on an electric bike.But the worst thing is that silly rear light is positioned in front of the rack, not at the back of it, so as soon as you put a bag on the rack, it is completely hidden.The bike is fitted with indicators, controlled by a remote on the handlebars. Like all bike indicators, these are not just a pointless gimmick but actively dangerous. The left and right indicators are so close it’s basically impossible for a driver to see whether you are indicating left or right, despite the attempt at an arrow. This is dangerous because an inexperienced cyclist may not know this, so may use them instead of arm signals.The only semi-useful thing about them is you can press both buttons simultaneously to make both lights flash, which means the rear light goes from about 2% of the light needed to about 10%.Finally, there’s a USB port to charge your phone. This would be handy if it were on the handlebars, but it’s not – it’s back in the battery unit, so effectively inaccessible.The Furo X costs $2299.That’s a reasonably serious chunk of change, but it’s actually relatively cheap in the folding electric bike segment. The electric Brompton, for example, starts at $3,800. The Hummingbird is $5,200. The Vektron S10 costs $4,000.When you consider the competition, the ride quality, and the components you’re getting, I think the Furo X is a really good value. If you’re looking for a folding electric bike you’re never going to have to carry, then I think this is a serious contender.However, if you need a bike that lets you hop and off trains or metro services, I honestly wouldn’t consider it. It’s really not comfortable to carry any distance at all. This is a bike for unfolding, riding to your destination, folding and storing. Alternatively, pulling out of the trunk of your car and riding the remaining distance.Either way, the motor cutout issue is something of a concern, so I would also wait for the company to announce a fix for that; otherwise, you might just need that two-year warranty. Now that the connector has been redesigned, this concern should no longer apply.I’ve enjoyed riding it tremendously and will be sad to see it go.The Furo X is available from the company’s website for @2,299, with free shipping.",ebikes
2021/08/13,"Ruff Cycles has just released a new electric bicycle known as the Biggie that sports a mini-bike design paired with a mid-drive motor setup. That’s a rarely seen combo on this popular style of electric bike.But the German-based Ruff Cycles may have wanted to pluck a motor out of its own backyard, opting for a German Bosch e-bike drive system.The Ruff Cycles Biggie comes with two motor options: a Bosch Active Line or Bosch Performance CX Line motor.Both are listed at 250W, which keeps them legal in the EU. Both also definitely put out more than 250W of power.Because European motor manufacturers are hamstrung by low-power e-bike regulations limiting them to 250W, they all claim a nominal 250W rating while publishing actual torque ratings. The torque ratings are not regulated, and thus allow manufacturers to more accurately convey the true “oomph” of their motors. For example, the smaller Bosch Active Line motor puts out a decent 40 Nm of torque, while the powerhouse Bosch Performance CX Line motor more than doubles that torque at 85 Nm.Both are limited to a somewhat disappointing 25 km/h (15.5 mph) top speed – again due to EU electric bike regulations.Customers can choose between two Bosch battery packs, a 300Wh or 500Wh pack. Both are rather small for a bike of this style, but the low top speed and lack of a hand throttle make the packs more or less sufficient since the motors can’t draw as much power as American electric mini-bikes like those made by Super73, Juiced Bikes, Ariel Rider, and others known for high-power electric bikes.The powder-coated steel frame on the Ruff Cycles Biggie won’t do the bike’s weight any favors, and in fact the company has refrained from publishing the weight of the bike. So far it is listed as “TBA.”But don’t expect this e-bike to be a lightweight. Moped and mini-bike electric bicycles are notoriously heavy, with their weight normally offset by the inclusion of a throttle. Without a throttle on the Ruff Cycles Biggie, riders will be relying on that Bosch mid-drive motor fully for pedal assist to get rolling.The Biggie won’t be available until next year, when it will come with an expected price of €3,399 (approximately US $3,990). That’s a pretty penny, but the bike also sports a number of high-end parts to attempt to justify that high-end price.Riders get an Enviolo continuously variable transmission paired with that Bosch mid-driver motor, Magura hydraulic disc brakes, high-end Tyron tires, and European manufacturing. The company doesn’t just assemble e-bikes locally on Chinese frames; they actually build the bikes from the ground up starting from the bare frame tubes. So despite the high price, there’s some real value here.This is absolutely one of those e-bikes I’d have to try before I buy. For other styles of e-bikes, such as city or mountain e-bikes, you have a pretty good idea of what you’re going into. But mini-bikes are notoriously bad for pedaling. They’re rare in Europe for that very reason – they generally ride best on throttle operation since you can’t adjust the seat to get a good pedal arc. One thing this e-bike has going for it in the pedaling department over most other mini-bike-styled electric bikes is that it offers 24-inch and 26-inch wheels. Most other models use 20-inch wheels that have you sitting lower. The larger wheels on the Biggie may put the rider in a more comfortable pedaling position, though they’ll also lift the center of gravity way up there – especially with the high-mounted battery.And while I don’t disagree that there are some nice components on this bike and that the European manufacturing is worth it, that’s still a high sticker price. I’ll probably stick with an e-bike that goes more than twice as fast for less than half the price, but that’s just me.",ebikes
2021/08/11,"EUNORAU, the makers of electric bikes both large and larger, is blazing a new trail for both its customers and its company. The Spectre S is its new flagship electric bike, built to rocket up rough terrain and bomb down with equal grace. As the company’s first foray into a new segment of the industry, there are improvements to be had, but this solid freshman entry should catch the eye of the varsity team.There are a wealth of off-road capable electric bikes on the market today and an even larger amount of electric bikes that check off the dual suspension box. Some of them can get by, others are made for looks, and some of them stand out from the crowd. The Spectre S stands out to me, with a high-quality frame, wildly powerful motor, and dual battery option.The single greatest hurdle of riding downhill is going up in the first place. While the more hard-boiled riders will scamper up the mountain under their own leg power, some take a car shuttle or ski lift to the top. Surprisingly, this isn’t considered “cheating,” and with that precedent set, an ever-growing number of riders are entering the sport with an electric bike to help them up the mountain.The Spectre S is the latter.Riding the Spectre up the hill was quite comical. The bike itself weighs in at 83.61 pounds. Combined with myself, water, and camera gear, we tip the scales at around 300 pounds. The burning heat of the summer sun was blasting over 100 degrees, and the scant cover of short desert trees only gave partial respite. Despite this and the rocky terrain of the ATV trail, the Spectre S climbed like a hungry moose.The core of the Spectre’s power is the Bafang M620 motor, which itself is the flagship of Bafang’s lineup. The M620 motor holds a royal flush of specs: mid-drive, 1000w, torque sensor, 160nm torque, and both throttle and pedal assist. In layman’s terms, the motor has great balance, power, utility, feels intuitive, and is used in high-powered cargo bikes, mountain bikes, and high-speed bikes alike.The torque-sensing pedal assist from the motor is a standout feature for climbing use. With a press of the feet, the electric system would deliver power perfectly tailored to the pressure of the pedals. The predictability and immediacy of the torque sensor delivered the perfect amount of power in most any condition. The match of intuition and technology make this an excellent motor for rough and varied conditions, something that a cadence-based motor simply cannot do.Combined with the powerhouse motor is a Sram NX 11 speed derailleur and an 11 to 42 tooth cassette. The Sram NX is at about the top of the enthusiast ladder when it comes to performance; any higher, and it would be in a professional grade. The comparable Shimano Deore groupset is a bit more reliable, as in my case, I had to reset the pulley arm spring during a ride. Nevertheless, the system interfaced perfectly with the motor, largely due to the shift detection that was combined with the motor.That moose of a motor was indeed hungry, as the dual battery system was being eaten alive. Equipped with dual batteries, the Spectre I rode carried 2x 48v 14ah batteries, making for 1.3kwh of energy. After about three miles of rough terrain (4.8km), the display read 80% capacity. Continuously climbing in the harshest of conditions, I might have seen as low as 12 miles of range (19.3km). Using this estimate, the Spectre S chugged along, consuming roughly five times the battery of an average eBike used on the road. Realistically, we’re not concerned about efficiency in these conditions. However, I feel it my duty to report that the stated range on the EUNORAU website (80 miles/128km) should be understood to be a road traveling maximum.Turning around and bombing downhill was an absolute blast! In the video, I spoke about the forward angle of the front tire, which enabled a more controlled and predictable descent. The Spectre S delivered a real hoot of a downhill, with enough thrills and chills to excite nearly anyone. A large part of the chills came from the inadequate brake pads and brakes. It’s quite normal for bikes to be equipped from the factory with a set of brake pads that are a “starter” set. Similar to cheap stock tires on a car, after wearing in the brakes, these pads are often replaced with a much more robust set. However, combined with the inadequate brakes, it made for a white-knuckle experience on the trail.The Spectre S uses a dual-piston hydraulic disc brake with a 180mm disc. While these kinds of brakes are perfectly adequate for a hardtail mountain bike, light-duty cargo bike, or even a city commuter, they don’t cut the mustard in the demanding applications that the Spectre S is otherwise adept at. If EUNORAU had decided to use a larger disc to dissipate that build-up, opted for cooling fins, or even a quad piston caliper, I think the bloated weight of this bike could descend even higher climbs. In my experience, the brakes were about tapped out from the heat of descending about 1,500 feet over three miles.One last point of interest is the legality of the Spectre S. Since it’s rocking a 1000w mid-drive motor, 35mph tops speed, and a throttle to boot, it’s easily outside the eBike classifications established in many states and municipalities. The bike isn’t totally illegal. I took the Spectre up and down an ATV trail, where dirt-bikes, side-by-sides, and even Jeeps are legal to drive. I really don’t have much else to say other than to be cautious and be legal. Further eBike restrictions can be put in place, and our industry isn’t large enough to fight it.Overall, I think the Spectre is a great bike for off-road adventures up some incredible hills and down some moderate ones. The price of the bike puts it into a niche category, a rider who wants to have phenomenal power to go up a hill but would want to upgrade the brakes to go down a hill of difficult incline. For a single battery price of $3,799, the Spectre S is considerably cheaper than many downhill-oriented bikes but is considerably more than other entry dual-suspension bikes that are realistically not made for any downhill at all.",ebikes
2021/08/10,"San Diego-based Juiced Bikes is announcing today the launch of a new electric bicycle version, the Cross Current X Step-Through.The original Cross Current X with a step-over frame has been Juiced’s premier electric commuter and urban riding e-bike for years.Now the company is releasing a new step-through version of the bike and significantly lowering the price. While the original Cross Current X is priced at $2,499, the Cross Current X Step-Through is now being launched with an introductory price of just $1,999.Much like the original Cross Current X, the new step-through version will feature a powerful 750W Bafang hub motor with 80 Nm of torque. That motor offers a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), pushing the CrossCurrent X Step-Through firmly into Class 3 e-bike territory in the US. Technically speaking, the bike arrives as a Class 2 e-bike that is limited to 20 mph (32 km/h). But users can edit the bike’s settings via the display to unlock Class 3 riding, should they desire. The bike even includes Race mode for non-public roads, where the speed is listed as “unlimited.” Gulp.The bike will also come with a slew of high-end components, including both torque and cadence-based sensors for smoother pedal assist response, hydraulic disc brakes for stronger stopping power that requires less maintenance, a 9-speed Shimano cassette for more gear options, included front and rear LED lights as well as included rack/fender package.Schwalbe Marathon Plus tires are also included to offer higher efficiency and smoother riding. I’m a big fan of that model of tire, having personally outfitted my e-bike with that rubber on a long distance 500 mile (800 km) e-bike ride a few years ago.Juiced Bikes is known for its higher-than-typical performance compared to its competitors, and the new bike is no exception. Despite rocking a 750W rear hub motor, Juiced outfitted the bike with a 25A controller that provides a peak-rated 1,300W of electric power.That higher power level is most noticeable in two areas: acceleration and hill-climbing. The new model is likely to score high marks in both categories.The two main differences between the new step-through model and the existing Cross Current X are the frame design and battery capacity. The new model’s step-through frame will be more accessible to a wider range of riders thanks to that lower frame. It makes getting on and off the bike easier – especially when that rear rack is loaded high – since you don’t have to swing a leg up to near shoulder height like an Olympic gymnast. Instead you can simply step through the frame and hop right on the bike.The second major difference is the battery, which is rated for 52 V and 15 Ah, marking a total capacity of 780 Wh. That’s a bit smaller than the massive 1,000 Wh battery found on the CrossCurrent X, but is still rated for over 60 miles (100 km) of range when you use pedal assist.Most riders will likely find that battery sufficient for typical urban and recreational riding. For anyone that wants to go even further though (or wants more throttle-only range), Juiced Bikes makes it easy to upgrade since the company standardized around a single battery shape. Multiple capacities of batteries in the same case design can be swapped in to customize the bike’s electric range.The CrossCurrent X Step-Through is available in four colors: Arctic White, Beach Blue, Yellow, and Black. Why the last two options don’t get their own fun paint names remains unclear.Juiced Bikes has been getting in on the step-through action lately, revealing a similar step-through version of the company’s popular RipCurrent fat tires e-bikes earlier this summer.That launch was unfortunately spoiled (by us, oops!) when a leaked image of the new e-bikes on their way to a photoshoot appeared.The company managed to keep the lid on this new launch though after likely learning their lesson. I’m guessing the bikes were better covered on their way to the most recent photoshoot!Anyone who wants to check out the new models can find them on Juiced’s website. And before you go, why don’t you let us know what you think of the new bikes in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/08/09,"Harley-Davidson’s electric bicycle brand known as Serial 1 has several eye-catching e-bike designs that already draw on a bit of retro flair. But now the company has doubled down on the nostalgia with a custom chopper-style electric bike that resembles a classic Schwinn Stingray bicycle.And it’s not the last custom e-bike design that Harley has planned for the future.The new design is part of a series known as “1-OFF,” in which Serial 1 will produce one-of-a-kind electric bicycles to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.These e-bikes are built on the same basic structure as the retail e-bikes offered by Serial 1, but come with significant modifications to the bikes’ aesthetics and accessories.For example, the first bike in the new 1-OFF line is known as the MOSH/CHOPPER, and it has some seriously ’60s chopper bicycle vibes.The beautiful, custom-modified electric bike was designed by Serial 1, though the modifications were performed by professional chopper builders Warren Heir Jr. and Kendall Lutchman at JR’s Fabrication and Welding in Milwaukee. The MOSH/CHOPPER features a dazzling blue “Street Freak” paint job with silver microflakes reminiscent of the ’60s, as well as a hand pin-striping and hand lettering. There’s a period correct long-and-low banana seat supported by a custom-made stainless steel sissy bar as well as ape hanger-style high-rise handlebars.Serial 1’s brand director Aaron Frank described the idea behind the custom e-bike series:“Customization is such an important part of the motorcycle ownership experience. For decades, people have been modifying their motorcycles to reflect their unique style and taste. The 1-OFF Series applies this same spirit of individualization and personalization to e-bikes, showing people just how much fun it is to create an e-bike that suits their own unique personality.”Under the hood (so to speak), the MOSH/CHOPPER retains much of the MOSH/CTY bike’s bones and features. The Brose mid-drive motor, Harley-Davidson in-house battery design, TRP hydraulic disc brakes and Gates carbon belt drive are all present.Harley’s own light package is still there, including the bright headlight and frame-integrated tail lights.But with all of the fun modifications, Serial 1 is expecting it to sell at auction for a pretty penny higher. That’s the plan anyways, though at time of publishing the high bid is only $6,100 with a little more than a day left. For comparison, the MOSH/CTY is currently available for $3,799. It definitely can’t compete on style with the MOSH/CHOPPER though. Check out the custom bike wheelie-ing through Milwaukee in the short video below.Serial 1 is planning to release several of these custom one-of-a-kind e-bikes per year, and I’ll certainly be interested to see what else they come up with. If the MOSH/CHOPPER is any indication, they’ll be pretty rad.But at the same time, I have to wonder about this move. I was the first journalist to ever see or test the Serial 1 electric bikes back before they were publicly released, and Serial 1 spent much of the time emphasizing to me how much they wanted to be seen as an e-bike brand, not a motorcycle company offshoot. While they certainly appreciated their heritage and the advantages that came with such a close relationship with their Harley-Davidson parents, they constantly compared themselves to e-bikes from other premium companies you’d see in any high-end bicycle shop.So to go a very different direction and embrace a much more motorcycle mentality of custom bike builds would seem to me as a fairly large pivot.Either way, I can’t deny how cool this bike looks. I’m definitely more of a “bikes belong on the road, not in a museum” guy, but I might have to make an exception for this one.If you want to see what Harley-Davidson’s actual e-bikes look like, you can see my world’s first test ride video below.",ebikes
2021/08/08,"While building and riding electric bikes take up most of my time, woodworking has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. And perhaps that’s why I was so excited when woodworker Evie Bee reached out to share her impressive-looking wooden electric bicycle that combines these two fascinating yet divergent fields.Evie’s passion for woodworking expands beyond just the crafting process to encompass the lifecycle of the wood.As she explains:“My interest in this area grew as I volunteered as a ranger with the National Trust at Osterley Park and while working with a tree house builder in India who was so knowledgeable about trees, ecology, and silviculture. This experience made me feel much more connected to the woods and I found I enjoyed being out in them much more than I did being in a workshop!”Evie has also long had an interest in classic cafe racer and scrambler motorcycles. Her passion for those vintage designs helped guide her as she combined design aspects of days past with modern electric bicycle components, all the while using a medium rarely found in the DIY e-bike scene. As a woodworker with a passion for sustainable design and combining modern manufacturing methods with traditional construction techniques, I felt this project would be a perfect and challenging opportunity to bring all these interests together and push my making skills to the limit. One of the other motivating factors for me choosing to make this bike was the desire to fulfill my dream of owning and riding my own e-bike. An experience I had cruising along a beautiful coast road on a rented bike was enough to convince me I needed to make one for myself. The bike became known as the Electraply, thanks to its incorporation of multiple styles of sustainably sourced plywood laminated together.Poplar makes up the bulk of the center of the frame, with more visually appealing Birch plywood added to the outside of the frame.Many sheets had to be cut using a CNC router to achieve Evie’s design.Stainless steel was used in a few areas for extra strength, such as the dropouts (where the rear wheel connects to the frame).For electronics, Evie used a 36V and 12.5Ah battery with 450 Wh of capacity, pairing it with a Smart Pie electric bike motor that houses an internal controller. That helped reduce the number of external parts mounted to the bike and simplify the wiring.The design and construction of the Electraply bike forced Evie to rely on many of her non-wood skills as well. She built the frame for the seat using brass piping and sewed her own faux leather seat cover using hand stitching.To share the design with others and teach people how to build their own Electraply wooden e-bike, Evie has written two free e-books that are available on her site.The first covers the design process for creating the bike, while the second details the construction process of turning the design into a real-life functioning e-bike.For anyone who wants a wooden electric bicycle but doesn’t have the time or handiness to build one themselves, Evie is planning to run a crowdfunding campaign in the future to commercialize the design.Check out the Electraply e-bike in action in the video below.All images rights belong to Evie Bee Designs",ebikes
2021/08/05,"Harley-Davidson’s Serial 1 e-bike brand is taking a Eurotrip as the electric two-wheelers ride across the continent.The expansion follows Serial 1’s debut late last year, when we got a chance to take the first ride on the premium electric bicycles.Now the electric bikes are showing up in Harley-Davidson dealerships across Europe this summer.Countries welcoming the motorcycle manufacturer’s e-bike brand include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.The European rollout is thanks to a new partnership with Harley-Davidson Europe. While Serial 1 technically became its own entity as an electric bicycle startup after being spun off as an internal Harley-Davidson project, H-D remains the electric bicycle company’s majority owner.European prices of course won’t be cheap, with the models starting at €3,499 ($4,140).But then again Harley doesn’t make just any ordinary electric bicycle. The three models include top-of-the-line parts such as automatic shifting. They also include features that we haven’t seen on any other electric bicycles, such as a glove box(?!) on an e-bike.On the low end of the range, the Serial 1 MOSH/CTY is the brand’s urban playbike. The 20 mph (32 km/h) MOSH platform is robustly constructed while offering just a single speed to simplify the drivetrain and keep costs down. While it’s designed to tackle a commute, the company also put their test rider to work jumping it around a skate park and taking it down stairs to prove its ruggedness.Europeans won’t get to enjoy its full speed though, as it will be limited to 15.5 mph (25 km/h) across the continent to conform to local regulations.For a bit of a fancier option, Serial 1 offers the RUSH/CTY and the RUSH/CTY SPEED. The automatic electronic shifting from this models’ Enviolo continuously variable transmission means riders get the proper gear at the proper time, all without having to touch a shifter.While all of the models use Brose’s latest S Mag mid-drive motor paired with a high-end Gates carbon belt drive, the RUSH/CTY Speed model ups the ante with a faster 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed. That makes it a class 3 e-bike in the US. It would be a speed-pedelec in much of Europe, though it isn’t clear if the higher speed model will actually make it to European shores. All of the models also use H-D’s proprietary battery packs that glean from the R&D that went into Harley’s LiveWire electric motorcycle development. The battery packs are mounted lower in the frame than on nearly any other e-bike and help to reduce the bike’s center of gravity. The MOSH gets a 529 Wh battery while the higher spec RUSH gets a 706 Wh battery. Serial 1 says the batteries offer up to 104 mi (168 km) and 115 mi (185 km) of range, respectively. Those numbers seem a bit lofty from my riding, but even two-thirds of that range in real-world conditions is plenty for most riders.What do you think of Serial 1’s e-bikes getting the Euro treatment? Let us know in the comments section below. And check out my own test ride of these premium e-bikes in the following video.",ebikes
2021/07/26,"Remember that proposed 30% tax credit for electric bicycles in the US? It’s now one step closer to becoming law, thanks to recent progress in the US Senate.Late last week, a new bill was introduced to the Senate known as the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act.The bill, S.2420, is a companion bill to H.R.1019 that was introduced into the House of Representatives earlier this year.The Senate bill was introduced by senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Brian Schatz (D-HI).It proposes a 30% tax credit for new electric bicycle purchases in the US, up to a maximum credit of $1,500.The goal of the bill is to help promote electric bicycles as an alternative form of transportation to personal cars. Not only would this help reduce harmful emissions, but it would also reduce traffic for everyone in crowded cities.The bill would make this possible by amending the Internal Revenue Code to create the new tax credit.To be successful, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must pass their versions of the bill, then any differences between the two must be addressed before heading to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.To qualify, electric bicycles would have to be priced under $8,000, which includes the vast majority of e-bikes sold in the US.Most common electric bicycles used for commuting fall into the $1,000-$3,000 range, while higher end e-bikes from more upscale companies usually cost closer to the $4,000-$6,500 range.Electric bicycles in Classes 1, 2, and 3 would be eligible, meaning e-bikes up to 28 mph (45 km/h) could qualify. However, e-bikes with motors carrying continuous power ratings of above 750W or that reach speeds higher than 28 mph (45 km/h) under motor power would not qualify.The tax credit would also be fully refundable, helping lower-income riders take advantage as well.The Senate bill was introduced late last week and is expected to gain a number of co-sponsors in the coming weeks.The House of Representatives currently has nearly two dozen co-sponsors, all Democrats. Since its introduction in February, no Republicans have signed on to co-sponsor the legislation.If you would like to show support for this bill, simply visit the US Congress website here and click “Contact Your Member” to find your Senator’s contact info.",ebikes
2021/07/24,"Nat King Cole may have wooed Daisy with a tandem ride in On a Bicycle Built for Two, but I wonder if he would have won her over quite as easily if he had propositioned her with this funny little three-seater electric bike. It may be odd-looking, but I love the weird combination of utility and style that makes this thing so awesome. That’s why it’s perfect for this week’s edition of the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week series!There’s so much to break down here, folks.This isn’t just any electric bicycle. This is an e-bike for the whole family.It may look like a three-seater to the untrained eye, but that simply reveals your lack of creativity. With Dad working the bars and Mom on back, Junior can sit comfortably in the jump seat up front.Then add Junior’s younger sibling sitting on Dad’s lap and the family’s chihuahua in the bird cage underneath, and I count five souls on this pleasure cruiser!But this two-wheeled minivan isn’t just a full family vehicle, it’s also packed with a surprising number of features.First of all, we’ve got real foot rests for all three seating positions. Spring-loaded pegs pop out for the main rider, the rear seat gets foot platforms on either side of the rear wheel, and the front jump seat occupant gets the entire step-through deck area to rest those little piggies.Next, you might not have noticed, but this is actually a full-suspension e-bike. Not only did they outfit this high-performance hot rod with a front suspension fork, but there’s even a rear swingarm with dual coilover shocks. Hello comfort city, here we come!And in case you’re ready to head to the comments section and whine at me about how this is a scooter, not a bike, take a closer gander, my pedantic friend. Those funny little pedals on 2-inch cranks might only offer a top speed of 3-4 mph under pedal power but they at least qualify this as a functional electric bicycle!In actuality you’ll never really pedal something like this, though it might make a nice backup if you ever ran out of battery.For storage, they include a cute bag up front, and there’s even that bird cage area under the seats. And I know what you’re thinking: Be real, Micah, that’s surely not actually a bird cage. No one would put an animal in there. It’s probably just a cargo box.No! Just look at the features list below! It’s actually a pet storage basket!The list of features keeps going, too! We’ve got lights! We’ve got fenders! We’ve got disc brakes! We’ve got a folding stem. We’ve got a motor lock! We’ve got a horn and turn signals! There’s even a built-in onboard charger on this little wonder bike. Why don’t $3,000 e-bikes in the West have half of these features? I bought a high-dollar e-bike last year, and there’s literally no pet storage on the entire thing – I kid you not!Plus you even get a number of colors to choose from, which is also more than I can say for most e-bikes in the west. There’s white, black, red, and pink. I’d love a bright blue or yellow, but for $745 I can’t complain.Oh yeah, and there’s the kicker – this thing is dirt cheap. $745 gets you the small battery version (384 Wh), though the 48V system still means there’s decent power. They claim a 400W power rating, but I’d guess it’s a bit higher. Most of these little bikes have 12A controllers, meaning this bike likely has closer to 600W of power.For a bit more cash you can upgrade to a bigger battery of 528, 720, or 960 Wh. That’s not bad. And these are lithium-ion batteries, mind you. Not some gutter trash lead acid battery. What are we, animals?!And the cherry on top is that the seller offers free shipping!I don’t know what kind of quality construction this family bike offers, but they claim a load rating of 250 kg (550 lb), or the equivalent of three pygmy circus elephants if I’m reading their infographic correctly:This isn’t just a family vehicle, though.Once the kids are in bed, this becomes a date-night motorcycle for you and your sweetie.Just look at those star-crossed lovers down there!Alright, alright. So here’s the part of each Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week where I tell you not to be silly and not to buy this week’s vehicle – that this is all for laughs.But here’s the thing, folks. I actually bought one.While researching it for this week’s article, I just thought it was too funny and too weird and too cheap to pass up. So I shelled out $844 for the upgraded 48V 15Ah and 720Wh battery option, and now I have a candy apple red one (presumably) headed my way (sometime) by October 15.I still say that you shouldn’t risk your money, but at least this one is through AliExpress, which offers buyer protection by holding the payment in escrow until you confirm that you received the goods and they fit the description.I’ve bought literally hundreds of things on AliExpress before, though not usually items that are this large. A couple of smaller things I bought weren’t up to snuff, and the platform gave me my money back, so I’m not too terribly worried about risking it this time, though this is definitely still a risk.If I were you, I’d sit pretty and just wait to see if mine shows up. As something of a professional e-bike rider, this is a hazard that comes with the job.While we wait to see if I just flushed $800 down the toilet, consider checking out some of my other fun Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week finds, such as a $2,500 electric house on wheels, a $1,850 one-wheeled electric motorcycle, or a $2,000 stretch limousine electric trike.",ebikes
2021/07/23,"I ride e-bikes a lot. Some days it’s a lightweight road e-bike. Other days it’s a longtail cargo e-bike. And some days it’s a ridiculously overpowered full-suspension fat tire e-bike. And as you may have guessed, I’ve been having a lot of days like those lately while reviewing the EUNORAU Defender S e-bike.I’ve almost run out of descriptors here: “1,500W all-wheel-drive full-suspension fat tire electric bike.”That’s a lot of adjectives. But then again, it’s a lot of bike.Some might even say it’s too much bike. But those people don’t realize how much fun an e-bike like this can be – when used responsibly.Check out my video below to see the EUNORAU Defender S in action, then read on for my thoughts on this epic monstrosity of an electric adventure bike.The first thing you’ll notice about this e-bike is the power and torque. From the moment you blip the throttle, it just rockets forward. I get front wheel burnouts even when I don’t mean to, though I’m a fairly lightweight rider.In fact, as much fun as the crazy power is, I’d say it almost comes on too strong. Some dual motor e-bikes have a switch to allow single motor operation or to drop the power into Eco Mode. The EUNORAU Defender S has neither of these, so it’s all power all the time. In practice, the extreme power is only an issue on dead starts when it lurches you forward. Once you’re moving, the power is still palpable, but at least it’s more controllable.I should also note that this is on throttle operation. If you use pedal assist, then the takeoff is much more gentle. It’s feels like they programmed in power ramping for the pedal assist but just left the sliders set at 100 for throttle control. You get used to it, but boy are those first few starts a doozy.I should also briefly address responsible riding here. Heavy, powerful e-bikes like these require more consideration than light and nimble electric mountain bikes. If you’re riding mixed-use trails that allow e-bikes, don’t go flying around blind curves and into a group of hikers. I did almost all of my riding on wide-open double track and basically treated the bike like a two-wheeled Jeep for overland-style adventure riding. There’s a time and a place for everything, so ride responsibly. End rant.Where were we? Oh right, the power. That high power is great for two things: speed and hill climbing. The specs on the website list the top speed as 35 mph. I never saw north of 28 mph, but perhaps there’s some secret unlock code that they never shared with me. Even so, at 28 mph the tire roar is enough to give you a seriously exciting ride. I’m not sure I’d even want to take this thing up to 35 mph, though at least it’s got some decent dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes on large rotors to bring it back down to realistic speeds.The combination of fat tires and full suspension mean that you’re riding on the bicycle equivalent of a memory foam mattress, especially when you drop the tire pressure. The ride is pretty darn cushy. Neither of the shocks are super high-end, but they both work well and give you that confidence to roll over a 3-inch branch on the ground at full speed or hop that curb on a whim.The only downside to such giant tires is that they aren’t quite as graceful as you’d hope. This is a tank of an e-bike, and it definitely doesn’t turn on a dime. It’s decently responsive, but “nimble” is not a word I’d use to describe it.The bike comes in both 17-inch and 19-inch frame sizes designed to fit riders on the shorter and taller end of the range spectrum.There are also multiple battery options available, with a single 48V 17Ah battery mounted in the downtube or a second identical capacity battery piggybacking on top.I tested the single battery version, and while the bike had plenty of power, it didn’t last for long. This is one of those e-bikes that is here for a good time, not a long time. Doubling the battery would not only give you more ride time, but it would also prevent voltage sag, which results in lower voltage due to the high discharge current required by two 750W motors operating from a single battery.At full charge the bike worked well, but when I got down to 30% battery, the meter would suddenly drop to 0% when I mashed the throttle, though I could still keep riding. That’s telltale voltage sag, which is an indication that the motors are pulling more power than the single battery wants to give.At $2,799, this bike is a tough sell for the single battery version. Sure, it’s tons of fun to ride, but that’s an expensive ticket to punch. The dual battery version at $3,299 is an even taller order, though there’s a dual battery version with a second 14Ah battery for $100 less.I get that the suspension adds to the price, but this still seems fairly lofty. Even so, I can’t deny how much fun the e-bike is to ride. So if you’ve got the cash, EUNORAU has got the bike. And it’s a ton of fun, even if it’s an expensive ride to get there.",ebikes
2021/07/21,"REI, the nation’s premier outdoor equipment retailer, enters the e-bike space with its CTY e2.2. For reasons unclear, REI decided to enter the electric bike space with a city bike rather than something made for off-road. If their goal was to nail down a commuter bike and test out their mettle, I believe they’ve succeeded. The CTY e2.2 is a commuter, no surprises there. As far as first entries go, I think REI has played it safe and made a very competent bike with very few drawbacks. I suppose REI sees enough demand for a down-to-business commuter to offer it literally surrounded by adventure equipment.The bike is lightweight, easy to use, has a fair amount of punch to the motor, and rides very intuitive and comfortable. The CTY is a great choice for commuters, fitness, exploring your town, and just enjoying the urban outdoors. Despite all the commuter accessories that are standard, the bike has a very clean look. The internal cable routing and the subdued branding give the bike a unique and professional appearance.The CTY uses the Shimano e6100. This motor is a classic performer, an excellent blend of mostly city riding, with enough kick to jump up a decent paved hill. The pedal assist is very intuitive and smooth. I really like it a lot. The bike doesn’t feature a throttle, but for the name brand mid-drive with the name brand smoothness, I don’t miss the throttle one bit. The system has some interesting quirks to it. After the bike is turned on, the lights are either always on or always off. You have to change go into the settings menu to change that feature. The pedal assist has three modes instead of the usual five. You still get a good splay of options, but it doesn’t offer fine-tuning of the electric assist. Also, the main on/off switch is on the battery, instead of up top on the handlebars.  I really like the small display and the small button controls. I enjoy having a simplified cockpit. But on the other end of that, if you are meticulous about counting mileage and time on the bike, you’ll need some reading glasses for that tiny screen.The electric system integrates very well with the mechanical system, but I would really hope so, since the bike is all Shimano, from front to back. Shimano alivio derailer, Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, Shimano 11-38 tooth cassette, and of course, Shimano crank arms, chainring, and chain. These are all great parts for the use of this bike, and I really enjoyed them. Other, non-shimano parts do exist, such as the front shock and the reflective tires, and they are great parts as it stands. There are a few quality-of-life features, like the double-sided kick-stand for easy cargo, the ergonomic trim on the grips, adjustable stem with a pretty high angle, and full metal fenders.According to their site, the CTY e2.2 is offered online, shipped to you or, better yet, having a local REI complete the full professional assembly. This can be a big part of the value, not just for assembly, but also for regular maintenance and much more. You can try out accessories, make sure it fits before buying, and much more. You can get some insights for local trails and rides, access to the repair center, and in-store updates to the electric system. REI offers the bike in different frame sizes, but just one color that I know of — Twilight Blue. Both my wife and I heard a few compliments on the color, so I really shouldn’t count it as a negative.Let’s cover some things I didn’t like; The bike isn’t especially lightweight. The frame is a bit beefy to accommodate all the electric parts; the metal rack adds a bit too. The battery on this bike isn’t a terribly high capacity — we’re talking a 504wh pack. The good news is that the range on this bike should be really good. I’d safely commit to a 40-mile ride on any day. If the rear rack weren’t welded on, I’d be tempted to take it off and use the bike off-road. But alas, I’d be left to dream of what could have been.The Co-Op cycle runs for just shy of $2,400, but as an REI co-op member, you get 10% of that back at the end of the year, making this bike $2,159 after that. For that kind of money, you could find a cheaper bike that promises you the world, but it’s hard to find something that can deliver such a natural biking experience, especially with local support. Really, for around $2,200, The CTY is a good catch for the name-brand electric system, high-tier mechanical components, pro-assembly, store support, and sleek design. With this solid first entry, I’m excited to see what co-op cycles come up with for their off-road bikes. I have no confirmation REI is doing this, but my intuition has already convinced me.",ebikes
2021/07/20,"The newly released RadRover 6 Plus marks the biggest update Rad Power Bikes has ever launched and showcases brand-new components like upgraded hydraulic disc brakes, new dual-screen displays, and a totally redesigned semi-integrated battery.The last few years have seen several new models released by Rad, and 2021 is shaping up to be similarly bike-packed.When the RadRunner 6 Plus was unveiled last year, it wasn’t clear if the “Plus” moniker would follow on future models, but the new RadRover 6 Plus has solidified Rad’s intentions to provide both entry-level and higher-spec e-bikes that all combine the company’s reputation for value-oriented bikes and industry-leading service.Across my many conversations with Rad Power Bikes founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh, the phrase Mike has continuously used to describe Rad’s model is “democratizing electric bikes.” That means bringing good quality e-bikes with a reliable support system to the masses at a price that most people can afford.When it comes to quality, the new RadRover 6 Plus definitely raises the bar. Check it out in my video review below to see me cruising Seattle in style on the new e-bike. Then keep reading for all of my thoughts on this major update to the Rad line!There’s so much to talk about here, I don’t even know where to start.Let’s begin with the new batteries. It’s a brand-new design developed by Rad and it’s a big improvement. The batteries are semi-integrated so they sit down in the frame tube instead of resting on top. That buys you more space in your frame and simply looks sleeker. The old plastic case has been replaced by extruded aluminum, and the battery also sheds its old key lock, which is now housed in the frame instead of coming along with the battery.The capacity is the same at 672 Wh, but the whole thing is just a much nicer solution. It’s a bit longer, which makes it narrower and thus easier to hold in your hand. There are built-in rails on the sides that make it even easier to grip. And it even has this satisfying “pop” up when you turn the key to unlock it, like it’s just asking to be grabbed.Next we’ve got a new motor that is torquier and thus offers better hill climbing. Terms like “better hill climbing” are a bit relative though, so Rad hit us with some hard numbers and says that the new motor helps the RadRover 6 Plus maintain a 25% higher speed during hill climbing. I didn’t just take the company’s word for it though – I took the bike and its new motor to some steep hills and put it to the test. See it in action in my video above.Moving on, we’ve got new hydraulic disc brakes that use ceramic pads for the best stopping power. The levers are adjustable so big and small hands can both fit nicely, and the hydraulic brakes allow more comfortable one-finger braking. That’s a convenient factor for everyday riding, but especially for off-road riding when you want to keep more fingers on the bars while modulating the brakes.They’re also a lower maintenance component, which is one less headache to worry about down the road. No more pulling out a 5mm hex wrench and adjusting brake cables!There’s also a new display screen – or rather two display screens. This one struck me as odd at first, as it seemed like it would just busy up the bars. But as soon as I started riding the new RadRover 6 Plus, I totally got it. You see, the main display right in front of you has the info you’ll want at a quick glance, things like your speed, power, distance, etc. This screen is centered on the bars, so it’s easy to look down and see the info that you’ll check often. Then on the left side of the bars is the remote that controls the lights and pedal assist setting, and it also has a large format screen that displays your pedal assist level and battery, plus a light icon to let you know when your lights are on. These are items you only look at occasionally, so they don’t need to take up space on the main screen. Also, the buttons that control this info are located right next to the readout, meaning you don’t need to look to the left to find the buttons for pedal assist settings, then look back to the center to see what pedal assist level you selected. It’s all right there in one location. The buttons are also much bigger, which is great for when you’re bouncing around off-road and need a big target, or for when you’re wearing gloves in the winter. Older riders will especially appreciate the larger buttons and larger readout.The frame has been re-engineered, too. While it was always a good fit for larger riders (the RadRover is a big bike, make no mistake!), now the frame also fits shorter riders better as the saddle can now go even lower. The new frame has improved ergonomics and a lower center of gravity, partly helped by that new semi-integrated battery. The step-through model also has an even lower step-through since it isn’t clogged up by the battery mounted on the frame anymore.The lighting has also been updated. The front gets a halo headlight and the rear light has been shifted onto the fender, meaning it can no longer be obscured when you’re carrying cargo or a rear rack.Having tested the bike personally, I can say that the RadRover 6 Plus is the best RadRover to date, by far. In fact it’s one of the best fat tire e-bikes I’ve tested, even among more expensive offerings.One small thing irks me, but it also offers a cool feature at the same time, leaving me with mixed emotions. The built-in USB charger from the previous RadRover is gone. Now there’s an upgraded USB charger that provides more power and is relocatable from the front to the rear of the bike (in case you want to power a device in your bag on the rear rack or in a rear bag). The only problem is it’s now an added accessory, not included equipment. On the plus side, you can daisy chain up to two in the front and two in the rear to power four devices from your bike. On the other hand, you’d have to buy four USB accessories. All told though, I think Rad made great choices when it came to this new era for the RadRover 6 Plus.Rad spent money where they needed to and saved money where it made sense. For example, unseen upgrades like ceramic brake pads instead of stock pads give riders safer, more responsive braking. That’s money well spent, even if it isn’t immediately obvious when looking at the bike. On the other hand, the 60mm spring fork is an economical and effective solution to offer good suspension but without the added cost of air forks that we find on many higher-priced electric bikes.That’s something I asked Mike about specifically, since I find it particularly interesting now that Rad is aiming at both the budget-minded rider with low-cost $1,099 e-bikes and higher-end customers with this new $1,999 RadRover 6 Plus. “To me, it’s all about whether or not something adds real value to the customer. If it doesn’t, I don’t want it on the bike,” Mike explained. He described how adding higher-performance parts like an air fork would be silly on a heavy electric bike where the weight savings aren’t worth the added cost. But investing in higher-quality brakes, a battery that is easier to use and an interface that provides a better rider experience all speak to the company’s goal about making sure every component adds value.At $1,999, Rad Power Bikes is definitely entering a different league with the RadRover 6 Plus. But from what I could tell from my day of riding the new model, they’re doing it right. The bike features a number of key updates and new features that push it into more premium territory. By maintaining a healthy breadth of models on both the entry-level end of the spectrum and now the more premium end, Rad Power Bikes is offering a little something for everyone all under one roof. I just hope we get to see even more models get the “Plus” treatment in the future.",ebikes
2021/07/14,"Ride1Up’s electric bikes have always been known for offering great value with higher-than-typical quality components for surprisingly modest prices. Now, the company has opened pre-orders for the Ride1Up Prodigy, which is the company’s highest-spec model to date.The Ride1Up Prodigy pushes the brand to a new level with the introduction of not just the company’s first mid-drive e-bike but a highly-respected Brose mid-drive.Many companies that have gotten their start in the value category of e-bikes have expanded into higher-spec e-bikes by beginning with Chinese mid-drives like those from Bafang. But Ride1Up went straight to a high-end German manufacturer for its drive system.Using Brose’s TF Sprinter motor and 9-speed Shimano drivetrain, the Ride1Up Prodigy powers up to Class 3 speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h). A 500 Wh battery provides 30-50 miles (48-80 km) of range depending on riding style and terrain.The team has actually been working on the new model for quite some time now and expected it to be available earlier this year. It was officially unveiled in January, but long parts delays from many of their suppliers pushed back delivery times and meant Ride1Up couldn’t begin taking pre-orders without clear delivery dates.Now, pre-orders have finally opened, with prices starting at $2,295.The Ride1Up Prodigy sports impressive specs for its price, including not just that Brose motor with built-in torque sensor but also dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, a 9-speed Shimano Alivio transmission, and included rear rack and fender set.Buchel LED lights in the front and rear and Schwalbe G-One tires keep riders safe and stuck to the road, at least on the pavement-oriented XR and ST frames that offer a step-over and step-through geometry, respectively. Both include a hydroformed aluminum fork to match the frame.There’s also an MTB version that upgrades to a suspension fork and Maxxis Forekaster tires but loses the fenders and rear rack. You likely won’t miss those commuter-spec components when you’re screaming down the trails anyways, though.It’s interesting to see Ride1Up offer both commuter-level and trail-ready versions of the bike that are able to share similar frames and components. Minor tweaks make the models more appropriate for the different riding profiles.The only bummer for the Prodigy V2 pre-order is just how long it will take to arrive. Shipping is listed as January, meaning riders will, unfortunately, miss this riding season in much of North America. But with the huge backlog in parts availability facing the e-bike industry, such waits are becoming the norm.And if anyone thinks the Prodigy is a bit rich for their blood, Ride1Up has several other lower-cost models that also offer a huge bang for your buck. The $1,895 Ride1Up LMT’D retains high-quality parts like the hydraulic disc brakes, but the $1,045 Ride1Up Roadster V2 is a crazy-good deal for a single-speed belt drive e-bike.I reviewed both of those e-bikes (here for the LMT’D and here for the Roadster V2) and would definitely recommend them.

2021/07/13,"Santa Cruz-based Blix has just announced several new updates across its range of electric bicycles designed for a variety of riders and applications.The updates are designed to help the bikes offer better performance with improved power and range specs, as well as several comfort improvements.The news tops off a year of 300% growth for the company at a time when the e-bike industry as a whole has seen a massive boost in sales.Now, the company hopes to parlay that growth into further success with its entire lineup of updated 20 mph (32 km/h) Class 2 models.The Blix Packa electric cargo bike was first launched back in 2019 and is now getting its first major overhaul.The long-tail cargo e-bike features an extended rear bench/cargo rack for hauling either cargo or passengers.Blix says that the new Packa Genie model will come with a stronger 750W motor with improved peak power output and more torque for tackling hill climbs or starts with a heavy cargo load.Bringing heavy loads to a stop is perhaps even more important than getting them rolling, and the new model will now come with more powerful hydraulic disc brakes.The range has been increased as well, with a dual battery version of the Packa Genie carrying an 80 mile (130 km) range rating from 1,228 Wh of batteries. That’s, of course, the pedal-assist range. Don’t expect to go 80 miles when using just the throttle.Other added touches include a lighter weight frame, better stability, an added trailer mount, and dual water bottle holders. The Blix Packa Genie is priced at $1,699 for the single battery model and $1,999 for the dual battery model. The company seems to have set its crosshairs on higher-priced e-cargo bikes, boasting that “starting at $1,699, the Packa Genie is one of the most competitive electric cargo bikes on the market, and the only electric cargo bike with matching performance features under $2,000.”Blix’s electric cruiser bikes also get new updates with the $1,599 Sol Eclipse.Just like the Package Genie, the Sol Eclipse inherits a stronger 750W motor for better hill climbing. It also gets larger 2.4-inch tires for added comfort.The updated cruiser bike benefits from an additional front LED and comes in new colors of Seafoam, Sorbet, Slate Gray, and Sky Blue.On the folding e-bike front, the new $1,699 Blix Vika+ Flex also gets those wider 2.4″ tires in addition to a new frame design to improve folding. It comes in Steel Blue, Burgundy, Racing Green, and Nü Cream.We reviewed a previous version of the Vika. Check it out to also see a video of the elegant folding e-bike in action.Rounding out the pack, the $1,699 Aveny Skyline offers Dutch bike styling and wider 2.25-inch tires. We reviewed a previous version of the Aveny and found it to be a real head-turner, thanks to its classy, sleek design.The step-through bike comes in the same colors as the Vika+ Flex of Steel Blue, Burgundy, Racing Green, and Nü Cream.All four of Blix’s new models are now available and ship directly to customers.",ebikes
2021/07/08,"After teasing the world with a first look at its sleek new electric folding e-bike last month, Fiido is now revealing the complete tech specs and component loadout for the bike. And the video they released along with it may just be the most epic launch video ever – for a folding bike.Folding electric bikes aren’t known for their glitz or glamour, but Fiido’s new model does break the mold with a sleek design unlike anything we’ve seen before.Well, almost unlike anything. It still builds upon the design of Fiido’s previous D11 folding e-bike that raised over $1M in its pre-sale campaign last year. But now the Fiido X ups the ante with several upgrades and style changes.You can check out the bike in action in the launch video below, then read on for the full specs and pricing info.First of all, we’ve just learned that there will actually be two versions of the bike, a Fiido X and Fiido X Lite.Both use seatpost-integrated batteries, with a larger 418 Wh battery in the Fiido X and a half-sized 209 Wh battery in the Fiido X Lite.The bike is a pedal-assist e-bike with a torque sensor and thus offers impressive range thanks to that efficient drive method. The Fiido X is listed with a 130 km (80 mile) range while the Fiido X Lite carries a 60 km (37 mile) range rating.Both of those figures are probably a bit optimistic (a trend in nearly all e-bike spec sheets), but the pedal-assist drive method is capable of squeezing out more range than most people would expect from an e-bike.The torque sensor-based pedal assist carries the bike up to a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph), which is the max speed for electric bicycles in most markets. It is unclear yet if there will be a Class 1 or Class 2 version of the e-bike for the US that could take advantage of higher 20 mph (32 km/h) speed limits in North America.Both models will feature 7-speed Shimano transmissions, magnesium frames with hidden folding mechanisms, key code locks for the batteries, 20″ CST tires, built-in LED lighting, and rear geared motors.The higher-spec model will include hydraulic disc brakes while the lower-spec model relies on mechanical disc brakes.The Fiido X carries a $1,999 MSRP but will be on sale for as low as $1,099 during the pre-sale period starting July 13. The Fiido X Lite will be on sale for as low as $899 during the pre-sale.These are some of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet for torque sensor-based e-bikes.For those not wanting to wait for the latest model or hoping to get an e-bike sooner, last year’s D11 model is currently on sale for just $999.",ebikes
2021/07/07,"Electric bicycles have come a long way in the last decade from rarely-seen oddities to skyrocketing sales.  It’s hard to argue against the obvious transportation advantages of e-bikes; they simply help people arrive at their destinations quicker and without as much sweat.But that same reduction in pedal pain also leads to a nagging criticism that e-bike riders sometimes find hard to shake: the misconception that electric bicycles don’t offer a good workout.That may have some base in truth for North American e-bikes operated only in throttle mode (sorry Europeans, no fun for you!). But when it comes to e-bikes used in pedal assist modes that require users to provide their own muscle power before any motor assist kicks in, the proof is in the pudding. And the pedaling.There has been plenty of anecdotal evidence of the benefits of e-bike exercise, such as riders loosing over 100 lb (45 kg) thanks to their e-bikes.But hard data that extrapolates across a wider range of riders usually tells a more complete story.San Diego-based electric bicycle company Juiced Bikes recently set out to set the record straight about pedal-assist e-bikes and their fitness benefits.The Juiced team took the company’s most recent model, the RipCurrent S ST, and used a fitness monitor to test how many calories a rider burned during a bike trip.The bike sports fat tires that would normally be arduous to pedal without any assist, but become perfectly manageable on an e-bike with several levels of pedal assist.The testing included a 45 minute ride on hilly terrain performed entirely in Level 2 pedal assist. With five total levels of pedal assist, Level 2 keeps riders on the higher effort end of the spectrum. Level 1 is usually reserved for fit riders seeking a serious workout, while Level 5 makes it easy to zip along quickly with minimal effort.The end results were 498 calories burned for a rate of 664 calories per hour. According to a handy chart I found, that rate is roughly equivalent to activities like playing basketball, a firefighter hauling hoses, or a rousing game of ultimate frisbee.As Juiced explained: “At the end of the ride a total of 498 calories were burned with an average heart rate of 106 beats per minute. These statistics are pretty encouraging for those looking to add some physical activity to their routines.”These results should come as a surprise to just about no one. We’ve seen plenty of examples of real world testing indicating that electric bicycles operated using pedal assist can provide a caloric burn rate equivalent to several common types of exercises.Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes ran an interesting real world test with riders of various sizes using different styles of e-bikes on different levels of pedal assist. The results were intriguing because they gave insight to a wider range of riders and riding scenarios.An academic study on e-bikes performed earlier this year by Miami University concluded that while riders engage in higher intensity exercise when using a non-electric bike, the amount of exertion on electric bikes still provides the moderate intensity exercise level that is recommended to avoid or reduce the risk of serious health conditions.And while this might sound counterintuitive, some studies have actually found that electric bicycle riders get more exercise than pedal bike riders in the long term. This is usually because such studies have found that e-bike riders spend much longer periods riding and do so more frequently than pedal bike riders. Despite pedal bike riders burning more calories per ride, electric bike riders burn more calories total and get more exercise due to spending more time engaging in the sport.I’ve certainly found that to be the case on my own rides. And even when I enjoy riding my higher power e-bikes, I can still get in a great workout. A 1,500W electric bicycle might sound like a dirt bike, but it certainly gets my heart racing (literally).The fitness and weight loss argument is just one of many advantages of electric bikes. The list of e-bike benefits is long, but getting healthy while having fun is definitely a chart topper.",ebikes
2021/07/06,"Bianchi’s line of popular electric bikes is coming to America as the company pushes to bring its latest models to the North American market.Bianchi USA’s CEO Pat Hus recently unveiled a series of new models at the Marconi Automotive Museum in Tustin, California. The event came as part of a coordinated effort to increase the Italian company’s North American market share after first offering its products in the EU.The models unveiled at the event spanned electric mountain bikes, touring e-bikes, and city e-bikes.Bianchi has stuck with Bosch as the supplier of its motor and battery systems — a move adopted by many of the leading European electric bicycle manufacturers.But unlike many of the other manufacturers, Bianchi is hoping that it can stand alone by showing off its unique innovations.As Hus explained to Bicycle Retailer:“Bianchi did not get into the e-ike space with a me-too product, it’s innovative, it’s different, it’s got a look to it, it’s got a story to it, I am so happy with what we did. There is a new vision going on here today, and you will start to get a sense of it today, with new leadership in Italy and the USA. Introducing Bianchi LIF-e, inspiration and innovation to deliver a new electric mobility and lifestyle collection.”Bianchi’s FX Type electric mountain bikes feature cast aluminum frames and 29-inch wheels. Their Bosch mid-drive motors reach 20 mph (32 km/h) of speed, meaning these models are designated as class 1 e-bikes that are the most widely permitted e-bikes on US trails.Interestingly, the FX Type frames incorporate LED lighting built directly into the frame — a move we’re only starting to see on a few off-road e-bikes. Such integrated lighting is much more common on city bike frames.Bianchi’s T Type touring electric bikes have a bit more pep in their step with 28 mph (45 km/h) top speeds. Those higher speeds are made capable by Bosch’s Class 3-rated electric motors that take advantage of the highest speeds allowable under US e-bike laws. Touring e-bikes are often ridden both on and off-road. Higher speeds when operated on-road help the bikes excel in commuter roles while still offering utility for trail riding.An included suspension seat post, as well as an integrated rack and pannier mounting, make the bikes even more well-suited to utility-type roles.Lastly, Bianchi’s C Type offers similar specs to the T type yet includes a more step-through frame that is easier to mount and dismount. When that rear rack is loaded up high, the step-through frame can make it much easier to hop on and off of an unwieldy e-bike.The C Type also offers a more comfortable and upright riding position thanks to its swept-back handlebars. That helps city riders gain a better perspective of the road and any potential hazards around them.As you might imagine, Bianchi’s e-Omnia line of e-bikes won’t be cheap. The C, T, and FX Type models are expected to retail for $5,700, $6,000, and $7,500, respectively, in the US. Availability should start sometime in July or August 2021, so excited new riders in North America won’t have to wait long.The company also said to expect new models in 2022, including in new disciplines such as electric gravel bikes.",ebikes
2021/07/02,"The RadRunner Plus from Rad Power Bikes is perhaps one of my favorite all-time, do-anything electric bicycles – and that’s coming from someone with hundreds of electric bike reviews under his belt. I may have ridden some e-bikes that go faster or carry more passengers or fulfill any number of specific niches. But if I had to choose one single e-bike that could handle as many different daily tasks and types of riding as possible, I think it would be the RadRunner Plus.One of my favorite aspects of electric bicycles is that they have helped usher in a new age of revolutionary design. With the assistance of an efficient electric motor, e-bikes don’t suffer from the same design constraints as pedal bikes. That has opened to door to interesting designs that specialize in all aspects of transportation and recreation. And the RadRunner Plus is one of the best examples of that design freedom we’ve seen yet in the industry. To watch this awesome e-bike in action, check out my video review below. Then keep reading for all of the details on this fun little e-bike that can do just about anything.The RadRunner Plus e-bike builds upon the classic RadRunner design that first debuted in 2019, yet adds a number of upgraded features for even more utility than ever before.When Rad Power Bikes first rolled out the original RadRunner e-bike, I was in love. The awesome little moped-style utility bike took the cargo and passenger features of the RadWagon e-bike and combined them with the smaller format of Rad’s folding e-bikes. There were only a few small areas where I saw room for improvement in the original RadRunner design, and apparently Rad Power Bikes had the exact same train of thought as I did, because they hit the nail on the head with each of the upgrades on the RadRunner Plus.So in addition to everything you get with a base model RadRunner, you also get an upgraded LCD display, larger headlight, front suspension, fenders, 7-speed Shimano drivetrain and the rear passenger kit including the padded seat, foot pegs, and wheel cover (that clear plastic shield to protect passengers from touching the rear wheel).Each of these is a huge upgrade that makes the RadRunner Plus such a potent e-bike for nearly every use case. To put it simply: If there’s something that needs doing, the RadRunner can probably do it.First of all, consider that just about anyone can fit on this bike. It’s got a nice low frame and is easy to mount with its step-through design, meaning short riders and anyone with mobility concerns in their legs/hips will feel comfortable on it. But with an adjustable seat, it does what almost no other moped-style e-bike can do by adjusting to fit the rider. Taller riders can either lift the seat or scooch back onto the long bench portion of the seat. It’s pretty cool how short riders and tall riders can feel comfortable on the same bike, and that most people will be able to flatfoot it at stops.Next, let’s talk practicality. The bike is a 20 mph (32 km/h) Class 2 e-bike with a throttle, so you can either zip around with the throttle to make quick work of a commute, or you can use the five different levels of pedal assist to get in a good workout. And with the upgraded 7-speed Shimano transmission, even steep hills are manageable on the RadRunner Plus. That 750 watt motor offers plenty of torque, plus the smaller diameter 20″ wheels help the torque equation even further, so between the powerful assist and your own added sweat equity, you’d be hard-pressed to find a hill you couldn’t climb on this e-bike.And with that 672 Wh battery, you’ve got more range than most cities would require. Even if you want to take it easy and hammer on the throttle, 25 miles (40 km) of range is easily doable. But once you start adding your own pedal power to the motor assist, you can easily tack on another 50-100% more range from the battery.But it’s not just a practical bike with plenty of speed, power and range – the real magic here is the utility. Or should I say, extreme utility. You can do just about anything with this e-bike.With the passenger kit on back, I’ve carried my nephews along with me for a three-up trifecta of e-bike fun! Up front there are accessory mounts to add any number of racks, baskets, and other accessories. And you can even add the Center Console accessory to the middle of the frame, which gives you a giant covered storage area that even has a molded phone holder and cup holder on the top. My brother-in-law uses that accessory on his RadRunner, and he is constantly filling it up with his family’s stuff when they all go on e-bike rides together. Sports balls for the kids and plenty of water bottles make their way into that thing practically every Sunday afternoon.With all of the features and different customization options, the RadRunner Plus is a true do-anything e-bike.  The passenger kit makes it easy to cruise around with your partner on back or drop your kid(s) off at school.  The large volume tires and front suspension fork mean you can easily ride off-road and hit the trails. The small size means you can fit it in an apartment without the bulk of a big bike like a RadWagon or RadRover. The 7-speed drivetrain means you can dial in your gear ratio for the perfect fitness ride or hill climb. The upgraded lightning keeps you visible at night, even from afar. The extremely wide range of accessories means you can turn the e-bike into any type of dedicated e-bike you want. The list goes on and on.It’s really quite impressive just how much you can do with a single e-bike here. And while you can obviously tell how jazzed I am about the RadRunner Plus, it has one thing in common with all other bikes: It isn’t perfect. I can always find a downside or two to even the coolest of e-bikes, and the RadRunner Plus is no different in that regard.When I go looking for anything to complain about, the two things that jump out at me are the weight and the  uncommon tire size. The 74 lb (33 kg) bike is heavy, but that’s more or less to be expected. Any bike with a powerful motor and big battery will be heavy. Then add a novel frame with integrated rack, added passenger accessories, suspension, etc. The weight is going to increase. There’s nothing you can really do about that. If you want high utility, you’re going to get higher weight.The other issue is the tire size. On the one hand, it’s a super comfortable size because it’s got the advantages of a fatter tire without the extreme bulk or weight of fat tires. At 3.3 inches wide, it’s a bit more nimble than a typical fat tire. But it also means you can’t just pick up a spare tire at any bike shop. Rad has you set with all the spare tires and tubes you could need (and Rad probably won’t say this but I imagine you can fit a 4″ tube in a 3.3″ tire without much of an issue if you were in a bind). But not everyone wants to be locked into one company for their consumable parts – I totally get that (even if tires are a once a year replacement). So for some people, that’s going to be a disadvantage.I really had to search long and hard to find anything to complain about here. The RadRunner Plus is simply the ultimate e-bike to combine the fun and recreational feeling of a weekend e-bike cruise with the utility and practicality of a true car-replacing e-bike. For a price of $1,799, you’re getting a heck of a lot of e-bike, not to mention the nationwide support coverage of Rad Power Bikes.It’s rare to find this kind of innovation in an e-bike, a true ground-up redesign of an e-bike frame to create a totally new type of ride. But Rad Power Bikes absolutely nailed it, and I’m sure it was worth all of that investment to build something truly new and unique. Okay, that’s enough writing about it. All I want to do now is go back outside and ride some more!",ebikes
2021/06/30,"Fiido has released a number of folding electric bikes, each time making incremental improvements based on user feedback. Now, the company’s latest model, the Fiido X, has been unveiled with several interesting and never-before-seen features.On its surface, the Fiido X looks a lot like the Fiido D11 electric bike that launched just a year ago.We tested that bike during its initial launch and gave it our approval, though we noted a few areas where it could be improved.Now, the Fiido X seems to have drawn upon the feedback of many testers like us to create a new generation of the company’s flagship folding e-bike.As Fiido’s founder and CEO Keven Wang explained:“Our fans have provided us with several suggestions for improvements such as smoothing the welding joints, simplifying the wiring of the bike, adding anti-theft features for the battery, and upgrading the pedal assist to include a torque sensor to provide better riding experience.” Each of those components are now featured on the newly unveiled Fiido X.The features that defined the original Fiido D11 are still present, such as that fairly minimalist frame and the seat post-integrated battery pack.But the components have been improved, with the magnesium-alloy frame now getting an interesting new locking mechanism and the battery getting its own upgrade.The frame’s folding mechanism is almost completely hidden — a stark departure from the often clunky latches found on many other electric bikes in this price class.A keypad for a lock is now mounted behind the battery, improving the security for the bike – though also likely complicating the removal process. For riders that live in a high-crime area, that might be a reasonable tradeoff.And perhaps critically for riders who live in hilly areas, a torque sensor has been added to improve the pedal assist performance of the bike. Torque sensors give a more immediate motor response and also provide more natural pedal assistance, especially during startup and while climbing hills.Fiido also released a new smart app that allows riders to integrate the bike and its features with their smartphones.We don’t have exact tech specs yet, though the company says those should be available soon before the pre-order period begins. But we expect the bike to fit Class 2 limits in the US, including a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). European models will likely carry a lower 15.5 mph (25 km/h) limit and lack a throttle due to stricter EU regulations.The Fiido X will come with a listed MSRP of $1,999 when it opens for pre-orders next month, which feels a bit steep for the specs. But during the pre-order period, the bike will be on sale for just $999. That price puts it well below many of the other lightweight folding e-bikes on the market.The pre-sale will be conducted on Indiegogo, which carries with it no shortage of baggage. While a few high-profile micromobility crowdfunding project failures have left a bad taste in the mouth of potential backers, Fiido has successfully delivered thousands and thousands of e-bikes across nearly a dozen different models.Like most crowdfunding projects, it would not be surprising to see the company overrun its timeline. But companies with positive track records like these generally always deliver…. eventually.While we wait for the pre-order period to open, you can check out the previous version of this bike in action below in my Fiido D11 review video.",ebikes
2021/06/29,"Electric cars may be a popular and growing form of sustainable transportation, but they certainly aren’t the most widespread. As it turns out, two-wheeled EVs in the form of electric bicycles have seen much higher adoptions rates — and for good reason.E-bikes function similarly to pedal bicycles, yet benefit from an electric assist motor that helps riders travel faster and farther without as much exertion. They can make bike trips shorter, flatten steep hills, and even offer the option of transporting a second passenger on an e-bike.While they can’t match the speeds or ranges of electric cars, they offer a whole host of other advantages, such as lower cost, quicker urban commutes, and free parking. And thus, it comes as no surprise that electric bicycle sales are soaring ever higher to the point where e-bikes are continuing to massively outsell electric cars around the world.Even in the US, which is a market for e-bikes that has long lagged behind Europe and Asia, there were over 600,000 e-bikes sold in 2020. That means Americans bought e-bikes at a rate of more than one every minute throughout 2020. E-bikes even outsold electric cars by more than two to one in the US.Electric bicycles are, of course, more affordable than electric cars, though the latter enjoys a number of state and federal tax incentives in the US to lower their effective costs. Electric bikes don’t receive any federal tax credit, though that could change if legislation currently pending in Congress gets passed.Electric cars also receive a majority of the attention when it comes to infrastructure investments, federal incentives, and green energy grants. Electric bike companies are generally left to figure it out on their own, with little or no outside assistance.And yet, e-bike sales in the US have grown wildly over the last few years. The COVID-19 pandemic played a role in the increased adoption rate, but it came at a time when electric bike sales in the US were already headed skyward.Across the pond, European countries are seeing similar trends.The United Kingdom Bicycle Association recently reported that 160,000 electric bikes were sold in the UK in 2020. The group noted that with 108,000 electric car sales in the UK during the same period, e-bikes handily outsold larger four-wheeled EVs.Europe’s electric bike sales are even growing at such a high rate that they are expected to surpass the sales of all cars — not just electric cars — later this decade.And for many city residents, that day couldn’t come sooner. In addition to providing a more affordable and more efficient form of alternative transportation for riders, e-bikes actually help improve cities for everyone. While e-bike riders can directly benefit from lower transportation costs, quicker commute times, and free parking, more e-bikes on the streets means fewer cars. And fewer cars means less traffic.E-bikes are widely seen as one of the best ways to reduce urban traffic, especially in cities without effective public transit systems. Even in cities with solid public transit, e-bikes are often more convenient alternatives as they allow riders to commute on their own schedules and without route constraints.While electric bicycles certainly can’t replace all car trips, the growing number of e-bike styles and the emphasis on e-bike utility mean that a growing number of families are trading a second car for an electric bicycle.via: Treehugger",ebikes
2021/06/28,"There’s a new Dutch e-bike company on the scenes, and they’re bringing classic European flair with them. Amsterdam-based Veloretti has just unveiled its first two electric bike models, and they’re both head-turners.The new Veloretti Ace and Ivy models that were just unveiled today combine classic Dutch bike styling with the latest e-bike technology.The Ivy is the more traditional step-through affair that comes to mind when imagining Dutch bikes, while the Ace is a more traditional urban commuter-oriented e-bike with a high-step diamond frame.Both bikes sport a Bafang mid-drive motor enabled with a torque sensor and bare the largest power sticker the company is allowed to apply under European regulations: 250 watts. Those same EU regulations mean the e-bikes are throttleless and top out at 25 km/h (15.5 mph).While Veloretti did what they could to max out the admittedly low performance specs as much as possible, the real beauty lies in the design and the component selection.The Ivy model is particularly stunning with its white tires and leather touchpoints. The company didn’t even opt for whitewalls – those are full white rubber tires. We’ll ignore the fact that the tread will never be as white as the day it comes out of the box and instead we’ll focus on the loadout.Hydraulic disc brakes provide ample stopping power on both the Ivy and Ace models. A small screen offers turn-by-turn navigation and connectivity via GPS, and 4G enables advanced features like crash detection, anti-theft tracking, and over-the-air (OTA) updates.The bikes’ LED lights are beautifully integrated into the frames, as are the 510 Wh batteries that offer a claimed 60-120 km of range (37-74 mi).The battery feeds a mid-drive motor setup, which means that the pedal and electric drivetrains are intertwined, unlike that of a hub motor e-bike. Connecting the motor and rear wheel is a Gates carbon belt drive – one of the leading players in the belt-drive industry for electric bicycles.At the other end of that belt drive sits an Enviolo hub. Not only is it a CVT that offers step-less shifting, but it’s the company’s automatic version. Other bikes with the same automatic shifting hubs and Gates belt drive systems have been priced closer to $4,500. But Veloretti is coming in hot with more than fair pricing: a mere €2,399 or US $2,860.Not that you could buy one in US dollars, that is. For now the bikes are only available in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Deliveries are expected to commence this July.via: Verge",ebikes
2021/06/27,"Hero Cycles has just delivered its first batch of Indian-produced electric bicycles to Germany.Now, the company expects the figures to grow.Hero Cycles is a massive bicycle manufacturer owned by Hero Motors, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.The Indian manufacturer’s electric bicycle division has now set its sights on Europe and the continent’s burgeoning electric bicycle market.Currently dominated by many domestic electric bicycle companies, the European e-bike market represents one of the largest outside of China.Hero hopes to become a new leader in the European market, competing with both domestic manufacturers and low-cost imported electric bicycles from China.The plan may be ambitious, but Hero brings a number of advantages. Indian-made electric bicycles aren’t subject to the heavy tariffs levied against many Chinese electric bicycle companies. Hero also brings to the table its own massive manufacturing resources and expertise.By 2025, Hero plans to add €300M in organic growth from its European operations and another €200M in inorganic growth, likely through the use of mergers and acquisitions.The move comes at a time when India is increasingly establishing itself as a major global competitor in the development and production of light electric vehicles and their associated systems.A number of interesting startups have arisen in India to produce high-tech electric scooters for the domestic market.Light electric motorcycle companies have also used strategic partnerships to produce hugely popular electric two-wheelers. Revolt’s RV400 electric motorcycle sold out in just two hours after opening a new round of pre-orders last week.Hero Motors even scored a key partnership agreement with Taiwanese battery-swapping electric scooter leader Gogoro to bring the latter’s battery swapping technology and scooters to India.Now, some Indian manufacturers are already looking at exporting their vehicles beyond the Indian market. Ola Electric is currently constructing a factory designed to produce 2 million electric scooters per year with an eventual capacity of 10 million scooters per year. A large portion of those scooters are already slated for export to Europe and other Asian countries.As China continues to experience supply chain and shipping disruptions, India’s major play as a competitor in the global light electric vehicle market could result in key changes to the industry over the next several years.",ebikes
2021/06/25,"One of my favorite things about Fiido’s electric bikes is that the company has always done things a bit differently. And the Fiido L3 continues that tradition, while bringing along some key upgrades and improvements as well.Those of you who remember my Fiido L2 review might recall how much I gushed over the little electric bike.What it lacked in physical size, it made up for in spunk. And utility. And power, surprisingly.So when Fiido designed and released the new L3, they kept most of what worked well, then upgraded the rest. That means the big battery got bigger, the long range got longer, and the moderate weight got moderately lower.Check out the new Fiido L3 in my video review to see what this little e-bike with lots of heart can do. Then keep reading for the full details!So here’s the thing: The Fiido is a small-format e-bike.But don’t laugh, it’s got serious potential.First of all, it can likely fit you. It’s got a massive weight rating of 150 kg (330 lb) and the folding nature means it has adjustable handlebars and a very adjustable seat.You might not get into prime pedaling form, but this isn’t really an e-bike that is meant for pedaling anyway. Sure, you can pedal it. It has pedal assist and there’s a single-speed drivetrain. But once you get above 15 km/h (nearly 10 mph), you have to start pedaling fairly fast.That’s true of just about any small-wheeled bike. The physics simply mean that you can’t get a high gear ratio without a front chainring the size of a dinner plate. So Fiido did the best they could there, and it’s decently pedalable – but that’s not the point. Because with a throttle and plenty of power, this e-bike is for blasting around like a moped.I know they say it’s only a 350W motor, but the 48V system is almost certainly over-volting that motor and providing more power than you’re expecting. Plus the small wheels help add to the torque. While I tested this bike in Florida where it’s flatter than a fritter, I rode the Fiido L2 in the Hollywood Hills and that small bike positively ate up those hills. So don’t think that just because it’s listed at 350W that this thing can’t climb. There’s some magic going on in there somewhere (and that magic is almost certainly that it’s putting out far more than the labeled 350 watts).So the Fiido L3 has power and torque, but it hits a virtual wall right at 15.5 mph, which is the bike’s programmed cut-off speed of 25 km/h. You blast up to it and then suddenly the power disappears. It’s a bummer, but what can you do? These Asian e-bikes often come with 25 km/h speed limits because those are the regulations in most of the world. I’d love to see them make a US version that hits 20 mph (32 km/h) to take full advantage of US e-bike laws, but we may be waiting a while for that one. But the real belle of the ball here isn’t the motor or the power, it’s the battery. This thing has a hilariously large battery measuring in at 48V and 23Ah. That’s 1,104 Wh of capacity, or nearly twice the average capacity of an electric bike. The Fiido L3 somehow looks like half an average bike but packs in twice the battery. It’s basically a giant battery on wheels.And the kicker is that Fiido didn’t even use the biggest battery cells they could have. They used 2.9Ah cells, and if they had used the largest 3.5Ah 18650 cells (did I mention I’m a battery nerd?) then they could have maxed this puppy out at a whopping 1,328 Wh. Maybe they held that back for the L4!Either way, the 1.1 kWh battery is huge. Fiido says they tested a 75 kg (165 lb) rider and found that 200 km (121 miles) of range was achievable. Elsewhere on the site they claim a max range of 250 km (155 miles). Maybe that’s with a kindergarten child riding it, I’m not sure. Either way, the point is that you’ll basically never run out of charge on a ride. In fact, you could probably charge the battery once a week and still never get close to running out of charge.This is a city e-bike after all. You likely aren’t going to be exploring the countryside on a Fiido L3. And so this is way more range than most people need, but it’s still awesome that it exists. Moving on, the rest of the bike is all acceptable, nothing fancy. The rear bench on the L2 has been replaced by a rack on the L3. That’s either an upgrade or a downgrade depending on what you did with it. If you carry a child back there, it’s a bummer. If you carry cargo, the rack is a better option. And you can always add a seat on top of the rack.The brakes are punchy, though mine had a slightly untrue rotor in the front giving me a small pulsing in the brakes. Not terrible, but not great either.The lights are good, the folding mechanism is good (and super convenient for tossing the bike in a car trunk), the folding pedals are good, the fenders are good. It’s all a pretty good bike with a pretty great electrical system. Oh, and a nice comfy spring seat that is wide enough to feel more like a reasonable chair than a bike saddle.For a price of $999, the bike feels like a deal to me. A lot of people will compare it to something like the $999 Lectric XP 2.0 e-bike and say you get more bike for the money that way. But while bikes like those go faster, they have less than half of the battery, so there are of course trade-offs. To me, the Fiido L3 is the ultimate tiny folding e-bike that still fits larger riders (even if they look a bit funny). It’s got the power, the weight capacity, and the range to make it a great urban e-bike.Just steer clear of those potholes!",ebikes
2021/06/23,"If you thought Bird was just an electric scooter-sharing company, then think again. Today the company unveiled a new electric bike, the Bird Bike, designed to add a whole new level of micromobility to its shared vehicle platform.Much like Bird’s electric scooter fleet, the new Bird Bike is a smart connected device that is loaded with sensors to communicate back to Bird’s headquarters.The bike features self-automating onboard diagnostics, geo-speed technology to limit the scooter’s speed according to local regulations, and multi-mode geolocation to ensure compliant operations in cities and towns of all sizes.The 75 lb (34 kg) e-bike features a step-through design for easy mounting and is slightly heavier than most consumer-level e-bikes, but it also comes with a much more ruggedized design to survive on the harsh streets.The bike includes low-maintenance drum brakes, a rigid front basket, and mag wheels that remove the maintenance hassle of spokes.Bird is now hoping to capitalize on its success with shared electric scooters by introducing a new mode of micromobility under the Bird brand.The move also comes when e-bikes are seeing soaring popularity.As Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden explained:“Shared e-scooters catapulted shared micromobility to the center stage of eco-friendly transportation in cities by providing more than 150 million zero-emission trips globally. We are launching our shared Bird Bike and Smart Bikeshare platform to meet fast-growing demand from cities and riders for more sustainable transportation options while expanding our serviceable addressable market by five billion trips per year.”Interestingly though, Bird isn’t only going it alone. The company is offering to partner with existing local and municipal-owned bike sharing programs. Something similar happened in Italy where Bird partnered with local company Zig Zag to incorporate the company’s vehicles into Bird’s App.As VanderZanden continued:“Cities and riders are best served by efficient, collaborative and non-monopolized transportation networks. Our vision of smart, responsible bike sharing is to provide the best shared bikes and operations when cities need them, and having the foresight to offer the best support and multimodal integrations when they don’t. Cities, people and the planet win when there is greater access to eco-friendly transportation.”For those hoping to experience the new Bird Bike soon, you may be in luck.Bird is bringing its latest electric two-wheeler to select cities in North America, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland, and France later this year.",ebikes
2021/06/22,"The Torque 1 electric bike from Florida-based RideScoozy is a commuter style e-bike that combines two features rarely seen together: a torque sensor and an affordable price tag.As we’ve discussed in the past, torque sensors are a more elegant way to engage the pedal assist on electric bicycles. Instead of just starting up power when the bike sees that the pedals are moving, which is how simplistic cadence sensors work, a torque sensor allows the bike to calculate the necessary power based on how hard the rider is pedaling.It’s a more comfortable and more effective way to apply pedal assist on an e-bike, but it’s usually found on much more expensive models.The Torque 1 is targeted at more entry-level riders with a price tag of just $1,199, making it a steal for a torque-sensing e-bike.Watch the e-bike in action with my video review below!So obviously the main feature here is the torque sensor and we’ll get to that, don’t worry. But first I want to take a step back and look at the Torque 1 in its entirety.At the bike’s core, it’s a single-speed commuter e-bike. The 20 mph (32 km/h) speed makes it a Class 1 e-bike that is perfect for city riders. The narrow tires, diamond frame, and fairly narrow bars give the bike a classic city bike feel.Where it parts ways with anything classically city e-bike is in the battery. The 378 Wh pack is actually decently large for a non-throttle bike, offering 25-50 miles (40-80 km) of range, depending on your ride style and pedal assist level. What really makes it stand out though is that it doesn’t stand out – at least not as an e-bike. The battery is totally hidden in the downtube and thus you almost can’t tell that the Torque 1 is an electric bike.The downtube is admittedly a little chunkier than a typical pedal bike, but it doesn’t make the battery obvious. And the hidden battery comes with a few advantages, including more streamlined design, lower chance of battery theft, and no keys to eventually misplace.On the other hand, the downside is that you can’t easily remove the battery for charging inside when you lock your bike outside. The battery can be removed for servicing or replacing in the future, but it takes a few tools and isn’t an everyday operation.The rest of the drivetrain is made up of a 350w rear motor and a single-speed pedal setup. The pedals are even full metal, which is a nice inclusion that we often don’t see at this price point. You even get a kickstand with the bike – which isn’t a given anymore on some low-cost commuter e-bikes.The brakes are simple mechanical disc brakes, but they are more than sufficient for a 20 mph (32 km/h) e-bike. And the whole ride weighs just 38 lb (17.2 kg). With a wide open triangle thanks to that hidden battery, the Torque 1 is easily thrown over the shoulder to walk up a flight stairs.As far as convenience goes, it’s hard to beat a simple but effective e-bike like this.The ride experience is great thanks to that included torque sensor – or at least as great as it can be on a non-suspension city e-bike. You’ve got to be a bit used to these rigid frames and narrow tires to enjoy this style of ride, but it works great for what it is: a lightweight metro e-bike.And the responsiveness of a torque sensor makes the pedal assist experience feel even better than the competition. A single-speed e-bike can sometimes feel sluggish off the line, but a torque sensor helps the bike apply more immediate power when the rider starts pedaling. I was also surprised that just three levels of pedal assist intensity turned out to be enough for me. I normally prefer more gradation, but the three levels actually feel nicely programmed. Level 1 is more of a fitness level with light assist, Level 2 gives you moderate assist that still requires decent pedal effort, and Level 3 makes your job quite easy.If you live in a super hilly city then this still might not be the bike for you. Downshifting for hill climbing is a no-go here, of course.But for anyone who lives in a relatively flat or only slightly hilly area, the Torque 1 e-bike excels in the commuter role – until the sun goes down or the skies open up. You’ll want to invest in a good pair of lights and some decent fenders if you live anywhere with rain or nights.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I really think all commuter-style e-bikes should come with basic LED lights that run off the main pack since this is essentially a safety feature. Serious commuters will likely want to add more powerful lights anyways, but a basic LED lighting system seems like a prerequisite to safe road riding. So outside the lack of accessories and somewhat minimalist standard equipment, you get great bang for your buck here. A smooth pedaling e-bike with enough range for any city commute and a lightweight design is a great edition to the e-bike marketplace, and the Torque 1 fills that role beautifully. At just $1,199, this feels like a bargain for a simple yet well-designed electric bike.",ebikes
2021/06/18,"Super73 rolled out a pile of new electric bike models last year with several new high-end models. Now the company is focusing on the other end of its lineup with a big new update to the brand’s popular entry-level model. The result: the brand-new Super73-ZX electric bike.The Super73-ZX updates the original Super73-Z1 with several key features.The frame is now both larger and lighter, accommodating taller riders while increasing the bike’s efficiency.The frame also sports a longer seat, which should give more seating options for the rider or make it more comfortable to carry a friend on back.Anyone who rode the original Super73-Z1 likely knows that the model’s fun mini-bike styling also meant that it wasn’t the most comfortable e-bike for actual pedaling. Now the company says this new frame design should make a big improvement there.The battery has also been updated to a larger 615 Wh model that is now removable from the bike. That provides the Super73-ZX with more range and a more convenient way to charge. Super73 claims a range of between 25-50 miles (40-80 km) depending on ride style and pedal assist level.The bike is also faster and comes with four ride modes. There’s Class 1 and 2, which each top out at 20 mph (32 km/h), then there’s a selectable Class 3 mode for pedal assist up to 28 mph (45 km/h) as well as an unlimited mode, listed as “up to 28+ mph.” I can only assume that means everything above and below 28. Sweet.Riders can use the new Super73 smartphone app to select between ride modes, and the same app also performs over-the-air (OTA) updates.There are a number of accessories available as add-on options, including a DC-DC converter for powering electronics, optional head and tail lights, turn signals, horn, fenders, and optional suspension upgrades.Those wanting to grab their own Super73-ZX should be ready with $1,995 – a decent bump from the original’s price. The specs have improved on the bike, but a good chunk of that increase is probably related to pricing pressures in the e-bike industry that have seen most of the big brands raising prices on nearly all of their models.We’re planning to get some testing in on this new model, so stay tuned for that.Until then, let’s hear what you think of the new Super73-ZX in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/06/17,"As much as I love electric bicycles, I have to admit that we rarely see anything revolutionary anymore. The last few years of e-bike advancements have largely been incremental. Important, but nothing groundbreaking. However, one look at the Igogomi e-bike had my inner child buzzing with excitement – finally something new!As you can probably tell, the Igogomi doesn’t look like most other electric bicycles, or even pedal bicycles for that matter.Not only are the wheels single supported. Not only do the brake levers bend the opposite way.Not only does it use a driveshaft in lieu of a chain or belt.But it’s just totally different. And different sounds like fun to me!Take a gander at my brief video review below before you continue reading for my full thoughts.The Igogomi folding e-bike does one thing and it does it well: It stands out.It’s not the fastest or the most powerful e-bike out there. But it’s got an awesome design that’s attributed partly to its innovative drivetrain and partly to the designers just saying “screw it” and building it however they wanted.Single-supported wheels aren’t new; the GoCycle bikes we’ve reviewed also have them. But the Igogomi manages to somehow wrap theirs in fenders that provide both utility and a stylish look.Next, check out those brake levers. They take a couple minutes to get used to since they have their fulcrum on the opposite end of the lever compared to typical bicycle brakes, but they’re pretty sweet looking. They also double as hand guards, not that you’d be ripping around on trails where that would be an issue.The brakes are just simple mechanical disc brakes, so it’s not like these are anything fancy on the inside. But on the outside, they look pretty darn cool!They also maintain a neat, minimalist style on the handlebars. There’s no protruding screen to ruin the lines, as the display is mounted flush with the top of the bars on the stem. Even the bell is barely noticeable. It’s all nicely integrated to give a purposeful look – not like a bunch of parts from a catalog got bolted together at the assembly plant.There’s also this cool light bar that runs across the front of the handlebars and makes for a great daytime running light. There’s also a headlight for added visibility, but two lights are better than one, right?Then lastly we have the belle of the ball: the shaft drive rear. A narrow driveshaft is hidden away in the sealed rear chainstay (do you call it a chainstay if there isn’t a chain anymore?) and directly connects the rear hub to the pedals. No gears, no transmission, just a direct drive.There’s a serious downside to that – this is a single-speed e-bike. But the upside is you get this cool, entirely enclosed drivetrain. It’s a no muss, no fuss solution. There will be people that claim that driveshafts are less efficient. And they’re probably right, by a few percentage points. But this is a bicycle. And an electric one at that. We aren’t splitting hairs here.I tested this e-bike in Florida, which isn’t known for its hills. The highest elevation is usually the closest lifeguard stand. If you live in a hilly area then this might not be the best bike for you. But in a relatively flat city, this e-bike works great as a single speed. The motor only tops out at 15 mph (25 km/h) and so it’s not like your legs will be spinning like an egg beater anyways. But if you do happen to encounter some hills, there are five levels of pedal assist and the most powerful level does offer some good boost. Just don’t try and climb a mountain with this e-bike, it won’t handle it. The bike also has some interesting tech hidden away in it. Like, it can sense when the bike tips over by more than 10 degrees and will instantly cut power. That way, if you fall over, the bike doesn’t try to make a break for it. I’ve never felt like that was a feature I was previously missing, but they give it to you anyways, so there you go.There’s also a cute little removable battery. It’s tiny, which is a good thing and a bad thing. The good news is you can easily take it out and carry it inside to charge. Guys might even be able to fit it in their pants’ pockets (sorry ladies, don’t blame me – blame fashion for cursing you with small, non-utility pockets). The bad news is it is very low capacity – to the tune of 230 Wh. They say that’s good for 25 miles but only in the lowest pedal assist setting. Still, this isn’t a high-power e-bike, and so the battery does actually last longer than you’d expect since it doesn’t have to provide a lot of power at once.So let’s break it down, because there are some interesting things that I really like about this e-bike, but there are also some downsides.On the upside, it’s a cool design with a neat look, it’s fairly lightweight (just 44 lb. compared to many 60+ lb. folding e-bikes), it folds into a small package, and it’s got some interesting advantages like the fully enclosed drivetrain.On the other hand, it has a fairly small battery, isn’t powerful enough for big hills, and only has a single gear ratio.For the current price of $1,799, you’ll have to decide if the novelty and fun design is worth it enough for the lower performance. At this price, if all you care about is performance, then there are better buys out there. But if you want something unique and that works well, even if you have to pay a bit more for it, then this is one to keep on your list.",ebikes
2021/06/15,"Dutch electric bicycle company Gazelle has been making major inroads with US customers. Now the company’s new Class 3 Ultimate C380+ trekking e-bike is offering up even more exciting speed and is likely to further Gazelle’s US growth.The announcement of the new Class 3 version of the e-bike marks the first major update to the Ultimate C380 model that was announced last October.The original launched as a Class 1 e-bike, meaning it was limited to a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) under pedal assist in the US.Now Gazelle is offering the Ultimate C380+ with a more powerful Bosch Performance Line Speed mid-drive motor. That bumps the bike up to a maximum speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) under pedal assist.It also gives the Ultimate C380+ the honor of becoming the first Class 3 belt drive e-bike in Gazelle’s lineup.That belt drive is provided by Gates Carbon Drive, widely seen as a leader in the industry for electric bicycle belt drives. In fact, the company also supplies final drive belts for leading electric motorcycles such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire and the Zero SR/F.As Gazelle North America’s general manager Ewoud van Leeuwen explained:“We have seen a tremendous response to the belt drive models we introduced last year: the Gazelle Ultimate C8 and C380. Rider feedback has been extremely positive: from the ease of shifting to the hassle-free nature of the low maintenance belt drive. The only request has been for a Class 3 belt drive option, and so we are thrilled to now offer this with the Ultimate C380+.”That belt transfers a powerful 85 Nm of torque from the Bosch Performance Line Speed motor and dumps it into an Enviolo continuously variable transmission. The Enviolo 380 rear hub uses stepless shifting to provide a smooth gear transition through a wide 380% gear range.The transmission allows riders to shift under load and at rest – two key advantages over typical derailleur-based bicycle transmissions.It’s a piece of kit I use on one of my own e-bikes and I absolutely love it for its advantages.The Class 3 Bosch motor, continuously variable Enviolo rear hub and the Gates belt drive are three premium components gracing the Gazelle Ultimate C380+, but they aren’t the only high-spec parts.Riders will also find premium four-piston Shimano Deore hydraulic disc brakes, an 80 mm suspension fork, and 500 Wh of battery. While we see many e-bikes with larger batteries these days, 500 Wh remains plenty for a pedal assist e-bike that operates more efficiently than the throttle-enabled e-bikes that are commonly available in the US.The 55.5 lb (25.1 kg) bike also comes standard with integrated front and rear lighting, a rear rack with bungee straps, a cafe lock on the rear wheel, fenders, belt guard, and a Gazelle bell.There are three mid-step frame sizes available along with two high-step sizes. The high-step frame also has room for a dual battery option, allowing riders to double the bike’s range.This new model is chock-full of high-end parts, and so it isn’t cheap with an MSRP of $4,749. Those that are ready to pony up the cash won’t have to wait long though, as the new Gazelle Ultimate 380+ is already en route to Gazelle North America’s network of retailers.",ebikes
2021/06/14,"Single-speed e-bikes are excellent options for anyone in search of a lightweight, straightforward e-bike that simply works. And one of the best options on the market in the US has proven to be the Propella V4.0. This new update to the Propella line brings several upgrades over the last version of the bike I tested nearly 18 months ago. The latest Propella V4.0, which also available in a 7-speed setup for those that have to deal with annoyances like hills, remains one of the most affordably priced commuter e-bikes out there.The single speed version is a reasonable $1,099, which makes it just shy of breaking into the coveted sub-$1,000 e-bikes category. But that extra $99 is probably worth it if you can swing it.Just check out my video review of this new e-bike below to see it tested in a commuter role, then read on for the full review.First off, I’m only covering the single-speed e-bike here since that’s what I tested. As I mentioned, there’s a 7-speed version too, should you feel the need for extra gears. It’s largely the same as the single-speed bike, but costs an extra $200. At a reasonable $1,099, I like the single speed.The motor is powerful enough for all the flat land riding I do and can even help you up medium hills, though this isn’t an overly powerful e-bike.There’s no throttle though, so you’re always going to be adding your own pedal power as well. With the single-speed setup, the somewhat taller gearing combined with the slight lag of cadence sensor-based pedal assist means you’ve got to put a little more oomph into getting rolling. But after that first half pedal stroke or so, the assist kicks in and you’ve got all the boost you’ll need.On Level 1 pedal assist, the motor offers just a nice little tail wind but isn’t very noticeable. Once you click it up into Level 4 or 5 the fun really begins as you blast up to 18.5 mph (30 km/h) decently quickly. Again – this isn’t a motorcycle so don’t expect crazy acceleration. But it does its job of helping you take the edge off as you perform your own pedaling.The battery is quite small at just 250 Wh, but there’s no throttle to drain it quickly and so you can still get pretty decent range. I found that 20 miles (32 km) of range is easily achievable, and you can go much farther with only light pedal assist.The battery itself was actually redesigned for the 4.0 and has a nicer, smoother removal mechanism to lock and unlock the battery from the frame as well as improved waterproofing. There’s also a new, smaller charger to go with it. I love these compact chargers because they are easy to toss in a bag without giving up half of your storage space. And for a small battery like this, a charger that you can take on the go is a great feature for occasional top-ups at your destination. Even better: buy a second charger to keep at the office and you’ll never have to worry about carrying a charger with you for longer rides or on mornings where you forgot to top up the battery.Another upgrade to the V4.0 can be found in the tires. They are premium CST with a deeper tread and are now puncture resistant. That’s an important detail that often gets overlooked, especially on these budget e-bikes. You never know about the flat tire that you didn’t get because your tires held up, but just remember how much it sucked fixing your last tube that popped on the side of the road. You can avoid that with some decent tires.The saddle on the Propella V4.0 was also upgraded. I’m not a huge fan of tiny saddles, but this one seems to split the difference between comfort and staying out of the way of your pedaling. With these pedal assist-only Class 1 e-bikes, a proper saddle that allows for good pedaling form is important. It’s great to see the Propella V4.0 get a more comfortable seat.I know that I sometimes complain about e-bikes that don’t come with racks or fenders. And it’s true that Propella charges you extra for those accessories. But I also understand that some people simply won’t need those components and so the option of adding them means that everyone gets a lower starting price.I do wish that the bike would include lights though. I see commuter e-bikes as personal vehicles – not in the motor vehicle sense (back off, DMV!) but in their extreme utility as full transportation alternatives. Built-in lights on my street-oriented e-bikes just seem like a minimum requirement to me. It’s one thing to leave them off of mountain bikes, but I think street bikes should include them as standard equipment since they are safety features.Other than that, I can’t really complain about anything else here. It’s a solid e-bike that feels sturdy while remaining lightweight, and all the design choices feel appropriate for the price class.The Propella V4.0 seems like the perfect city e-bike for a daily commuter. If you need suspension or mountain bike tires, then this isn’t the e-bike for you. But for anyone that feels comfortable on a hipster bike, the Propella V4.0 will immediately feel at home under you.When all you want is a lightweight, simple, and affordable option to get to school or work, Propella delivers with a well-made solution.",ebikes
2021/06/12,"While the name Radio Flyer may bring up nostalgic images of a little red wagon for some (or little red Teslas for the youngest generation), the company is now branching out into electric two-wheelers with a pair of new fat tire electric bicycles for adults.As Radio Flyer’s Chief Wagon Officer Robert Pasin explained:“We’ve inspired creative play for generations of families, so launching a line that offers adults a fun way to explore their world is a natural fit. This is a huge milestone for us, and truly demonstrates our determination to never stop innovating, even at a legacy brand like Radio Flyer.”The new line of electric bicycles is known as FLYER and includes two different frame styles designed for utility and leisure riding.The first model, known as the Flyer M880, takes on more of a combined cruiser/utility design.The e-bike features fat tires in large 26-inch wheels but combines them with a laid-back step-through frame with adjustable high handlebars.The company actually refers to it as a mid-tail cargo bike, thanks to its large rear rack offering a nod towards its potential role as a utility e-bike. That rear rack is designed with an 80-lb (36 kg) capacity, while the entire bike sports a 300-lb (136 kg) load rating.Sized for riders between 5’2” – 6’3” (157-191 cm), the Flyer M880 also claims to support one additional passenger — presumably provided they are under 80 lb (36 kg).The bike comes equipped with both a half-twist throttle and a cadence-based pedal assist sensor offering five speeds of pedal assist.A 500W rear hub motor is paired with a large 720 Wh battery to create the electrical powertrain, while the pedal powertrain opts for a 7-speed Shimano setup. Use them both, and you could stretch your range up to a maximum of 50 miles (80 km), according to the company.All told, the Flyer M880 is priced at $1,699 before upgrades.For parents hoping to carry two small passengers on back, the Flyer L885 is the better choice.With a longtail cargo bike design, this electric bike has a stretched rear rack with running boards that can support strapped-down cargo or the feet of a pair of passengers.The longer rear rack has a load rating of 150 lb (68 kg), while the entire bike can support 400 lb (181 kg).The L885 gets the same electrical drivetrain as the M880, with both bikes topping out at 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle-only operation thanks to their 500W motors.The Flyer L885 also sports fat tires just like the M880, but the rear 26-inch wheel gets swapped for a smaller 20-inch wheel to make room for more cargo and a lower center of gravity. We’ve seen this before with the RadWagon, though that bike lowered both wheel diameters to 22 inches to create a more nimble cargo e-bike with a lower center of gravity.The Flyer L885 starts at $1,999. Both bikes come with included lights, fenders, and mechanical disc brakes. Neither includes suspension, so make sure you don’t over-inflate those tires, or you’ll be in for a bumpy ride.Both models are expected to begin shipping in October 2021.What do you think of Radio Flyer’s new e-bikes? Let us know in the comment section below!",ebikes
2021/06/09,"Civilized Cycles has just unveiled its new Model 1 electric bike today, and the New York-based company is already claiming that it “rivals a second car or moped.”Judging by the specs and design, they might be right.This is a premium e-bike, and it comes with a premium price of $4,499.With that out of the way, let’s take a look at what Civilized Cycles designed into this e-bike.The Model 1 electric bike seems to combine aspects of electric cruisers, cargo bikes, city bikes, and mopeds.The design uses full-size wheels and a laid-back, upright geometry somewhat like a cruiser bike. But it also includes a deep step-through frame more akin to a moped.The frame is designed to carry up to two adult passengers and also includes expandable rear panniers for a large amount of storage. The company claims that riders can fit four full grocery bags in the rear of the bike – no more dangling bags from your handlebars! The bike is rated for a max capacity of 400 lb (181 kg), which may explain why they spec’d it with that beefy double kickstand and powerful 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes.The mashup of a bike and moped design didn’t happen by accident. The Model 1 was created by Zachary Shieffelin, founder and CEO of Civilized Cycles but also the founder of Vespa Soho – the largest Vespa dealer in North America.Zachary anticipated the type of utility needs that are often addressed by mopeds and scooters when designing the Model 1.As he explained:“We are excited to begin sales of the Model 1 and are eager to show that for local transportation, our greener future isn’t a sacrifice, it’s an upgrade. All of us have people and stuff in our lives, so our bikes are designed from the ground up to accommodate both. Form follows function, so we developed our own bespoke frame designed for two adults, drawing on elements and technologies from across the vehicle spectrum to improve safety, comfort, and sheer usefulness. Whether running errands, commuting, dropping a kid off at school or a romantic moment with your partner, the Model 1 will get you there in effortless style and comfort.”That comfort doesn’t come only from the upright riding position, it’s also thanks to the full-suspension design of the bike. The Model 1 claims to be the first bike to offer automated self-leveling suspension. The patented system uses an on-board compressor, air spring, and sensors to adjust the suspension based on the bikes weight. If you change the load on the bike, such as removing cargo or taking on a second rider, the press of a button will reset the suspension based on the current weight distribution.The company claims that results in the smoothest ride possible and that it is more comparable to that of a car than a bike.A 750W mid-drive motor is paired with a 5-speed Sturmey Archer rear-wheel hub transmission, and is controlled with either pedal assist or a “Launch Control” throttle. The on-board display offers PIN code locking that is also accessible through a remote app, and there’s an optional GPS theft-tracking device as well. The expandable panniers are likely the most eye-catching part of the bike, after that step-through frame. They are rated to support up to 50 lb (22.6 kg) of cargo – which Civilized Cycles surely can’t say, but we all know means that you could conceivably stuff a bunch more in there. The water-resistant and lockable panniers also hold closed with a magnetic clasp when not in use and double as leg protection for the second passenger.You might want to grab a spare battery to stuff into one of those panniers, too. With just 500 Wh of capacity, the bike seems to offer excess in everything but the battery department.The Model 1 is available in Black, Imperial Red, and Silver. Riders can choose one of those options today now that pre-orders have just opened, but shipping isn’t likely to begin until Q4 of this year.Oh and that $4,499 pre-order price we mentioned at the top? That’s promotional, so you might want to hop on this one quick before the MSRP of $5,499 kicks in.",ebikes
2021/06/08,"Electric bicycles in the rugged moped style are all over the place these days, and for good reason. Unlike fitness e-bikes that are often used for a combination of exercise and leisure riding, electric mopeds are built mostly for good old fashioned getting around. And the Addmotor M-66 R7 moped fully embodies that design ethos. It’s a transportation e-bike that will have you zipping around your city faster than a car and cheaper than a public transport season ticket.Check out the video below to see me testing the Addmotor M-66 R7, then don’t forget to keep reading for the rest of my full review!While some electric moped-style bikes are more like dual-sports designs for both on- and off-road adventures, the Addmotor M-66 feels like a dedicated urban warrior.Its 80mm travel dual-crown front fork means it handles the occasional trail better than a totally rigid bike, but this isn’t a serious all-terrain vehicle. Instead, it’s an awesome street bike.Outfitted with lights and full metal fenders (not those dinky plastic fenders that shake around like a rubber pencil), this e-bike comes right out of the box with everything you’d need to handle daily commuter tasks.There’s even a cool rear rack that can be bolted on for more utility work, though that’s a $69 upgrade. Without upgrading anything, though, it’s already set to carry you and a passenger anywhere you’d need to go in a city. And that long bench seat combined with solidly made passenger pegs will make your riding buddy feel secure, too.The bike is technically limited to just 32 km/h (20 mph) right out of the box, but I played around in the settings and found that you can remove the speed limit, opening up a little more room on the top end to get you to 36 km/h (23-ish mph) with a full charge.The fairly large battery is also a welcome addition, with 674 Wh of capacity. The claimed 55 mile range is a joke – you’ll never see that unless you actually keep it in pedal assist level 1 all the time, but half of that range is definitely doable.Here’s the kicker – this bike isn’t a great pedaler. It’s fine, it works, but it’s not optimized for pedaling since you can’t adjust the seat. I just scoot forward or backward on the bench seat to find my most comfortable spot, but there’s only so much you can do there. You still end up with that high-knee feeling when you pedal, which isn’t great for covering long distances.The fact that they even give you a footrest should be an indication that this isn’t really meant to be the most normal-to-pedal bike out there.I tried the foot rest, but it feels a bit foreign to me. I’m not used to my feet being that high up on a bike, and I feel much more natural just leaving them on the pedals.If you do choose to pedal, you’ll of course improve your range. But with nearly 700 Wh of battery capacity, even throttle-only riding will still net you decent range in the 40 km (25-mile) ballpark.For the most part, Addmotor did a great job with the M-66 R7 electric moped.It’s quick, fun, and comfortable to ride, thanks to that plush seat.The handling is pretty good, and the front suspension fork makes the ride even better. I also appreciate the spokeless wheels, as you won’t ever have to worry about spoke tension or bending a spoke if you smack it on something. The mag wheels are more rugged and they look pretty cool, too.On the other hand, there are some areas that I’d like to see improved. The tail light is nice to have, but it isn’t connected to the main battery like the headlight. That means you have to turn it on at the tail light instead of the display, and you’ll eventually have to swap the batteries out when they die. I also wish they had sprung for hydraulic disc brakes. I should emphasize that the brakes are plenty strong, and there’s nothing inherently wrong with mechanical brakes. I even like that they used those mechanical brake levers with the built-in bell – it’s a useful tool and saves space on the bars for other accessories. But for $1,999, including hydraulic disc brakes would have been appreciated.And of course there’s the somewhat-awkward-to-pedal situation, but that’s just how these electric mopeds go. I’ve yet to see an electric moped that was great for pedaling; it just isn’t their forte. All told, I’d say the Addmotor Motan M-66 R7 still did a great job at fulfilling its role of a laid-back city moped. It’s tons of fun to ride, has plenty of power, and gets you where you need to go in style. Works for me!",ebikes
2021/06/02,"Electric bicycles are fun and effective tools for both recreation and transportation, but they don’t have to cost thousands of dollars. We’ve tested plenty of great e-bikes that don’t break the bank, and would be perfect for cruising around this summer! Ever since I first threw a leg over the RadMission, I fell in love with it. I own several e-bikes, but the RadMission is one of my main go-to bikes. I use it for both city-style riding and even light-duty off-roading for nature trails and dirt paths. The bang for buck with this e-bike is incredible because it offers so much utility for such a low price. In fact, this past December my wife and I bought five RadMission e-bikes and donated them to people in need of transportation – that’s how effective I think this model is. Shoutout to Rad Power Bikes for donating another five bikes along with us!Normally priced at $1,099, the RadMission is currently on sale for $999 if you use the coupon code MISSION-100. Don’t wait too long though – the price returns to its MSRP at the end of June.Another #nothrottlethursday this time on my RadMission e-bike from @RadPowerBikes. It’s way out of its element but I’m turning it into the most affordable gravel e-bike ever. Performed great on a 35km ride with over 50% battery left. Full story later today on @ElectrekCo pic.twitter.com/xtb475mbtwAnd that price is a steal. Not only do you get great performance (20 mph, 500W motor and 500Wh battery), but you get a lightweight, easy-to-ride e-bike backed by the largest e-bike company in the US.Rad Power Bikes is known for excellent customer service. Last time I checked they had something like 50 full-time employees on customer service and support, but that number is probably outdated now because they keep growing so quickly. The company also operates its Rad Mobile service that can arrive right at customers’ driveways with a mobile bike shop in a van.The RadMission brings the type of quality and performance you’d expect from Rad’s $1,300-$1,900 e-bikes and packages it in a simplified, stripped-down e-bike for under a thousand bucks. That’s a deal, folks.Check out my video review of the RadMission below to see it in action.Unlike the RadMission above, the Lectric XP 2.0 is a totally different format of e-bike, sporting a folding frame, wider yet smaller diameter tires, front suspension, and a built-in utility rack.The Lectric XP 2.0 was just released a few weeks ago by Lectric eBikes, and is a follow-up to the popular low-cost Lectric XP e-bike.The price rose by $100 to $999 for the Lectric XP 2.0, but riders get a pile of upgrades for that price.The new version of the bike drops the tires from 4-inch fat tires 3-inch balloon tires. These are closer to what you’d expect to find on a moped or utility bike and make the bike more nimble.A hydraulic suspension fork was added, which is a nice improvement over the rigid fork found on the original Lectric XP, and is also much nicer than the typical cheap spring forks that many low-cost e-bikes include.A heavier-duty rear rack was included on the new model of the bike, and there is now a mounting point for a front rack or basket as well.Perhaps most importantly though, the Lectric XP 2.0 sports seriously good performance. The 800W peak motor propels the e-bike up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with pedal assist or 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle-only. The removable battery, which gets hidden inside the frame, offers a range of around 25 miles (40 km), though that can increase or decrease depending on how you ride.Check out my video below showing off the many upgrades on the new Lectric XP 2.0.Ariel Rider is perhaps best known for its high-power electric mopeds. The last e-bike I tested from Ariel Rider was the 52V X-Class, which reached speeds of around 35 mph (56 km/h).But the company recently released a low-cost and more reasonably performing commuter e-bike known as the Ariel Rider Rideal.The $999 Rideal fits into a similar class as the RadMission above, and in fact sports many similar parts.However, it replaces the single-speed drivetrain with a 7-speed transmission and also upgrades the power with a 750W rear motor.The bike includes lights, fenders, and a kickstand, making it a great 20 mph (32 km/h) commuter e-bike right out of the box.I’m currently testing one for an upcoming review, and it’s definitely one of the strongest contenders in the affordable commuter e-bike category.The Metakoo Cybertrack 100 is an Amazon e-bike that fits in the electric mountain bike class, but is probably better described as a trail bike.The front suspension is decent, but it isn’t designed for any extreme mountain bike adventures  – it’s more of a fun nature trail e-bike. That’s exactly how I rode it in my test rides.The 350W motor and 375 Wh battery can’t be accused of being overly large, but they work together nicely to create an e-bike with moderate boost that adds to a fun pedal assist ride.There’s a half-twist throttle on the right bar that sends the bike up to 20 mph (32 km/h) without any pedaling, but it drains the battery quicker than sticking to the pedal assist.The Cybertrack 100 is fairly well made and doesn’t cut too many corners on cheap parts like plastic pedals or junky brakes. The parts it gives you are just fine for a $799 e-bike, and it seems to get the job done for leisurely riding. Just don’t expect to bomb any major downhill trails on this bike.Check out my Metakoo Cybertrack 100 video review belowI’m going to sneak the Ride1Up Roadster V2 into this list even though it’s technically priced at $1,045, up from its original promotional price of $999. But it deserves to be here because it is such an awesome ride and still offers an insanely low price for a belt-drive e-bike.The Ride1Up Roadster is a hipster-looking metro e-bike with skinny tires and a single-speed drivetrain. It can handle medium hills with its 350W motor but is better for mostly flat ground riding, in my experience.The bike sports a silent and maintenance-free belt drive that gets powered by its hidden 250 Wh internal battery. The whole thing looks like a typical bike – you almost can’t even tell it’s an electric bike.The power is on point though, and helped me get close to 25 mph (40 km/h) in the highest pedal assist mode. The lower modes are great for fitness riding, which is mostly how I rode it. The lightweight e-bike is an excellent exercise bike that doesn’t make a statement. It just looks like any other bike out on the road, yet is so much fun to ride when the variable assist kicks in.I also love how the bars are so clean and uncluttered. There’s just a tiny display and two brake levers – that’s it. No throttle, no shifters, no lights, no anything. It’s a simple, easy-going e-bike that packs more power than you’d expect in a pretty little package. Oh, and that awesome belt drive. All for barely $1K!MacWheel is another one of the Amazon e-bike brands, but it’s a bit higher quality than I normally see with Amazon e-bikes.Both the Wrangler and Cruiser use similar frame-integrated batteries. The batteries are lockable and removable, but they slip inside the frame and thus look much nicer than bolted-on batteries.The Wrangler is more of an electric trail bike and packs more power from a 500W motor and 480 Wh battery.The Cruiser is a bit more laidback and easy-going with a 350W motor and 360Wh battery. It’s also the better option if you’re commuting since it comes with lights and fenders already. Though if you commute in a hilly area, you might prefer the extra power in the Wrangler.The MacWheel Wrangler is currently priced at $899 while the Cruiser is a bit more affordable at $849. Both are priced around $50-$100 higher than their original introductory prices, but we’ve seen prices rising all around the e-bike industry lately.Last but not least is the good ol’ Ecotric 500W fat tire e-bike.Ecotric is another one of those Amazon brands with no-thrills e-bikes. Heck, they didn’t even give this e-bike a real name, it’s just called the Ecotric 500W fat tire e-bike. But at just $949 for a full-size fat tire electric bike, I can forgive the lack of a name.The bike’s only real downside is the lack of suspension, but that can be mitigated with moderate tire pressure in those giant tires.Other than that, it’s a powerful and fast e-bike that can get up to around 23 mph (37 km/h) and works equally well on and off-road.I tested one in the Los Angeles hills and found that it could actually climb moderate hills decently well, but did need some help when the inclines got steeper.While the bike doesn’t offer any fancy features, it is built well and offers one of the best prices around on a full-size fat tire e-bike.Check out my video review of the Ecotric below.With e-bike adoption rates soaring and companies scrambling to keep up, this summer should be a great time to hit the trails and even make some new e-bike friends.Just be sure to act quick – parts and e-bikes are in short supply due to the increased demand, so you could end up with a lengthy wait for some e-bikes.Are there any good e-bikes we missed that are under $1K?

2021/06/01,"Metakoo is a fairly new e-bike brand that was spun off by the same company that brought us the MacWheel series of e-bikes that we enjoyed testing late last year. These bikes aren’t known for being top shelf (or even mid-shelf), but they do present strong bang-for-your-buck in the entry-level class. The company’s first model, the Metakoo Cybertrack 100, offers a quasi-mountain bike format designed for price-conscious consumers.Check out my video review below of the Cybertrack 100 to see this e-bike in action!I’ve reviewed all sorts of e-bikes, from fancy and expensive e-bikes to bargain basement models. This is very much the latter, thanks to its budget price of just $799.So you have to go in with realistic expectations.This isn’t going to be an overly powerful e-bike or a super long range e-bike. We know that before even tossing a leg over the bike. With a 350 W motor and 375 Wh battery, these are very entry-level specs.But with that frame of reference, we can judge the e-bike within its class to see if it’s worth the money.And spoiler alert: It’s a pretty decent e-bike when looking through that lens. It won’t win any races against the more powerful options out there, but that’s not what this e-bike is for, either.To me, this is a low-cost way to get into off-road electric bike riding. Not serious downhill riding or hitting any sweet jumps, but rather some good old-fashioned trail riding on an e-bike that will give you a nice boost to help you go faster and farther than you’re used to.This is one of the few e-bikes I’ve tested (out of hundreds!) that has a front derailleur in addition to the rear derailleur. That gives it a whopping 21 speeds. To be honest, that’s about 14 more gear ratios than I think is really necessary. If you are so refined in your cycling that you need two gears in between every gear us casual 7-speeders are used to, you’re also probably not interested in a cheap e-bike.I don’t think most people really need this level of gradation in their e-bike drivetrain. It’s one thing on a pedal bike, but with the motor assistance, you can be a little less optimized with your gear ratios – you don’t always need the exact perfect ratio for every single incline. But for those that do want more choices, the Metakoo Cybertrack 100 certainly doesn’t hold back.The pedal assist uses a cadence-sensor, which doesn’t give as good of a response as a true torque-sensor, but it works just fine for our entry-level ride here.I also really like that the bike has a half-twist throttle instead of a thumb throttle. I hate when off-road e-bikes come with thumb throttles, because they’re hard to hold in one position when terrain gets uneven since your thumb is bouncing up and down along with the bike. But half-twist throttles are perfect for that scenario, since your palm grips both the throttle and the non-moving grip next to it, maintaining your throttle position.I appreciate that Metakoo didn’t cut the usual corners and install a bunch of cheap parts like plastic pedals. There are real alloy pedals that are nice and toothy to stay under your shoes while bouncing around on the trail. The company even went the extra mile to include a 4A charger, which is around twice as powerful as most budget e-bike chargers. A 4A charger paired with this battery means you can get a full charge in barely three hours.That being said, corners were of course cut in some places to get down to this $799 price. The welds look about as pretty as Rocky at the end of the first movie. There are no lights or fenders, which means you’d need to add some parts to this bike to turn it into a commuter. And the suspension fork is acceptable but not at all high-end.There are better bikes out there for commuter use, so I’m not sure this is the one you’d want to buy for daily road riding, and thus the lack of lights and fenders don’t bother me too much.Everything else on the bike pretty much screams “good enough” to me. The brakes are fine, not fancy. The saddle is acceptable, not stellar. The frame is fine, not overbuilt but fine (and at least it has partially internal wiring). The shifters are fine for this level of e-bike.It’s all acceptable for a leisurely, fun e-bike designed to get someone out of the house and onto the road or trail. You’re likely giving up some serious service and support by going with a fairly young Amazon company based in China, but you aren’t giving up too much in quality. And if I had to choose one, I guess I’d rather have a decent e-bike with a company that’s harder to contact than a crappy, falling apart e-bike with a company that I can talk to any time I want. The former keeps me in the saddle, while the latter keeps me hearing the phrase, “We understand this is frustrating to you…”So for a pretty decent e-bike priced under $800, this is actually a nice option in the off-road and trail riding categories. It’s not too heavy on the back or the wallet and it offers up a decent amount of performance for the price. And that’s all many price-sensitive buyers are looking for.",ebikes
2021/05/30,"Summer might not be here yet, but this weekend at least marks the unofficial start of summer in the US – and thus a great time to soak up the good weather outdoors on an electric bicycle.With global electric bicycle use surging, we caught up with the US’s largest electric bike manufacturer, Rad Power Bikes, to discuss tips for safe, enjoyable e-bike rides this summer.As the company explained, “after a year of quarantine, people are eager to get outside to hike, camp and travel. More camping sites, hiking trails and National Parks are modifying their paths to accommodate those using an e-bike.”With more locations accessible by e-bike than ever before, these tips can help you have a great time out there this summer.Choosing an appropriate electric bike is a topic we’ve covered in detail before, and is critical to having the safest, most enjoyable experience.Different styles of e-bike are geared for different types of riders. Metro e-bikes are better for those that do most of their riding in the city, while electric mountain bikes or fat tire e-bikes are likely a better option for those that spend more time on trails or riding in sandy or deep soil conditions.Bicycle frame geometry is also important. As Rad explained, “if you’re having a hard time swinging your leg over the saddle, even when you’ve adjusted the seat, you may want to look into a Step-Thru model. Alternatively, you may be too short or too tall for the bike you have in mind.”We wrote an entire guide to choosing among the different styles of e-bikes here.If this is your first electric bicycle (or especially if this is your first time back in the saddle in years), spend some time practicing before you hit the crowded bike lanes or trails.An empty parking lot, open field or even a cul-de-sac is a great place to get your cycling legs back and practice controlling your new e-bike. Some electric bicycles have hand throttles that allow riders to power them like a moped, while others only have pedal assist that simply provides power when the rider pedals. Get to know your e-bike and become comfortable with its controls before you start riding in more crowded environments.Studies have shown that riders on electric bikes typically ride farther and stay out longer than riders on pedal-only bicycles.That you means you’ll want be prepared by packing any necessary items you’ll need for longer rides. That could be water, sunscreen, a first aid kit or anything else that you might need along the way.As Rad explains, “Make sure to pack the necessities and calculate how long you will be out. Storage is key. Make sure there is enough room to pack your bike and that the bike rack you have bought is up to the task. There are a lot of factors to consider when packing and planning for your adventure – remember that your battery life will be affected by cargo weight.”Personally I tend to switch off between several e-bikes that I own and not all of them have a rack or pannier bags. That’s why I often bring a backpack on my rides, especially when I’m out for many hours. For longer trips and bikepacking-style adventures I have a larger Cotopaxi travel bag that fits everything I need (and that also has become my favorite airplane carry-on bag!). But for general day trips I switch back and forth between two different CamelBak bags that have become my favorites for normal daily rides.In fact, I wrote an entire guide on my favorite e-biking gear that I use on my rides.Defensive riding is a mindset.This has proven to be critical to me in my rides. Whenever I go out, I’m always hyperaware of where dangers are lurking, especially since they tend to pop up in places you least expect them.Whether it’s assuming cars are out to get to me or that any number of dangers could be lurking around blind turns on trails (or from someone else’s perspective, I could be the danger coming around blind turns), I try to keep my wits about me at all times.And Rad seems to agree, saying riders should “Take control of the situation by riding defensively. Sometimes, the threats aren’t as easy to spot. Puddles can obscure hidden dangers under the water, and you never know what may be covered up by that wet pile of leaves in the road. It’s better to play it safe and avoid them entirely when you can.”This doesn’t mean that you should spend your rides scared that every path holds a hidden danger. But it means that you should remain aware of the higher risk locations – many of which are areas where you don’t have the full picture or you lack complete visibility – such as those blind turns and puddles of unknown depth.A cyclist friend of mine in college hammered that one home for me, explaining that a puddle that looks like it’s a half-inch deep might actually be a 6-inch deep pothole with a sharp edge just waiting to give you a flat. That’s something you’d obviously avoid on a dry day but might not think about when it’s obscured by water.If you asked me what the single most important safety component of an e-bike is (or any bicycle for that matter), I probably wouldn’t say the brakes. I’d say the tires.They’re the most critical part of the bicycle that affects its stability at every moment you’re on it – both on casual straightaways and in hard, fast turns. They’re the only thing keeping you up and they’re your only point of contact with the road. Good brakes mean nothing if your tires can’t translate that braking force to the ground.Equally important is ensuring your tires haven’t picked up any sharp bits of debris along your rides. Small objects can become embedded in tires, especially in the deep treads, and then work their way deeper over time. Getting a flat doesn’t just ruin your ride, it can be dangerous at the wrong moment.That’s why Rad also says that checking your tires is critical to ensuring the safety of your ride. “Examine your tires before and after every ride to make sure they’re in good condition. This means inspecting them for any shrapnel you may have picked up while riding. If you notice anything that’s become embedded, pick it out with a sharp blade or needle nose pliers. Leaving it in there gives it the opportunity to slowly work its way in deeper and ultimately puncture your tube. Also keep in mind that maintaining proper tire pressure is important. When your tires are filled correctly, you can enjoy smoother, faster rides. Another big bonus? It helps you avoid flats. To help avoid these, use a bicycle pump and a bike tire gauge to make sure your tire is consistently at the recommended PSI.”Lastly, just because I think tires are the most important safety component on a bike, that doesn’t mean I neglect my other safety equipment. I give my brakes a quick test each time I hop on my bike before I get rolling, and try to give them a more thorough cleaning and inspection several times a year.Maintaining lights, reflectors and other safety equipment is also paramount.No matter what type of e-bike you ride or where your favorite stomping grounds are, these tips can help you have more fun and ride safer this summer.As more people join the growing e-biking community and experience the fun and utility that electric bikes offer, it is more important than ever to do our part in ensuring that we’re all responsible riders.What tips would you add for enjoying your rides this summer?

2021/05/26,"The Ariel Rider X-Class 52V e-bike is one of those electric bikes that just straight up looks like it needs to be ridden. Everything about it screams, “Hop on and rip it!” so that’s exactly what I did.If there’s one thing Ariel Rider knows how to do well, it’s making fun e-bikes.There are plenty of other companies out there making high utility e-bikes, or value-priced e-bikes, or any other niche/specialty. And while the Ariel Rider team can compete there as well, if you only allowed me one word to describe this e-bike, I could do it in three letters.F-U-N!You’ve seriously got to check out my ride video below to see the Ariel Rider X-Class 52V in action. And don’t forget to keep scrolling to read the rest of my review!I really didn’t expect the X-Class 52V to be this powerful. Sure, it’s got a big ol’ chunky motor in back, but it’s just a single motor. The Ariel Rider D-Class I tested last year was crazy powerful because it had two motors. But the Ariel Rider X Class still offers tons of oomph with even the single motor.That’s thanks to its 1 kW continuous power rating that actually peaks at 2 kW. For those keeping score at home, that’s a lot of power in one e-bike.It’s enough to make this thing really fly. I made it up to a top speed of around 36 mph (58 km/h) with the bike unlocked, though I should point out that it arrived in Class 2 mode with a 20 mph (32 km/h) limit.When it comes to riding in the road with cars, faster e-bikes always feel safer to me. I really appreciated the higher speed of the X-Class 52V here because I could keep up with cars for the most part. That meant I wasn’t getting passed on the side of the road by drivers constantly buzzing my left handlebar.And with nearly a full kilowatt-hour of battery capacity (52V 18Ah), I got surprisingly good range out of the bike, too. You’ll basically never see the optimistic 75 mile (120 km) range that Ariel Rider claims, since that would require you to keep the bike in the lowest pedal assist mode. With moderate throttle use I found that 25-30 miles (48-ish km) of range was doable. Staying at top speed will drop that range, while easing off the throttle and pedaling a bit will increase it.When it comes to pedaling, it’s possible – believe it or not. But it’s not the best pedal assist e-bike. It’s not that the pedal assist doesn’t work. It works well. The issue is the bike’s geometry. It’s just not set up for comfortable pedaling. The seat isn’t adjustable, so you wind up with high knees. It can fit a wide range of riders just sitting on it and throttling along, but the pedal geometry just isn’t there to make it a good pedaling bike.If I had to pedal the bike home, I could do it. But it’s not comfortable for long periods of time. If you’re looking for a fitness e-bike, this ain’t the one. Get something else.If you’re sticking to the throttle, though, the bike is plenty comfortable. That cushy seat felt great to me, and there’s also the option to swap on a longer bench seat that can fit two riders. There are even super beefy passenger foot pegs so your pillion rider has a comfortable place to put his or her feet. I commented on the D-Class’s somewhat wimpy foot pegs when I reviewed it last year, and Ariel Rider let me know they were replacing them with stronger foot pegs. This is the first time I’ve tested the new model of foot pegs and I can confirm: Ariel Rider came through in a big way.One last note about comfort, but it’s a big one: The X-Class has a very forward-leaning seating position. Gone are the D-Class’s high handlebars. They’ve been swapped for low bars on the X-Class, giving a more cafe racer ride stance. It’s super sporty, but it might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Fortunately, there is an adjustable stem riser that allows you to lift up the bars and bring them back in by a few inches if you’d like. You can see what I mean in my video review above.The other main improvement compared to the D-Class is the suspension. Both the X-Class and D-Class received new motorcycle-grade suspension forks recently, but the X-Class also has very nice rear suspension.There’s no sophisticated linkage like on a mountain bike, but it does its job by soaking up those potholes, speed bumps, and curbs. It’s also adjustable in both preload and rebound, meaning you can dial it in to your perfect setting based on your weight and ride style.Out of the box, I felt like the rear shock was a bit stiff, but after playing with the suspension’s adjustments, I was able to dial it in for my tastes and then it performed like a dream.For the most part, all of the components perform like I’d expect. The brakes are strong, the suspension is comfortable, the tires are more than sufficient, the battery is large, the shifter… shifts. The only part that surprised me in a negative way was the headlight. It’s got a massive housing so I expected it to be blinding, but it was just OK. Not crazy bright – not something that will light up the road way ahead of you on a pitch black night. But plenty for letting cars know you’re there. It’s a be-seen light, similar to most e-bikes. It just comes with a more badass housing, that’s all. I did find that some dude on YouTube made a tutorial to swap the lower-intensity LED bulb to a motorcycle LED bulb (it takes a little finessing), so you’ve got that option, assuming it doesn’t void the warranty.Otherwise, everything either met or exceeded my expectations on the Ariel Rider X-Class 52V. The company even goes the extra mile to include small things like a bag of extra mounting screws and some touch-up paint that matches your bike. Those things obviously don’t add much to their costs, but it’s a nice way of saying “We care” that you just don’t see very often in this industry. For a $2,099 e-bike, you’re getting huge performance. Though there’s also the option of turning the bike into something of a utility or even delivery e-bike with a rear rack and basket. I installed both on mine and it added some crazy storage space to the back. You could load that sucker up and still have the power to climb hills. If the bike can carry a passenger, you better believe it can carry a bunch of cargo.I think $2,099 is a fair price for such a high-performance e-bike, but if you’re looking to save a few bucks with a slightly lower-power version, the entry-level X-Class sports a 48V system and is priced at just $1,599 – which frankly is a steal. What do you think of the Ariel Rider X-Class e-bike? Let me hear your thoughts in the comment section below!",ebikes
2021/05/25,"While new e-bike launches are fairly common these days, powerful mid-drive electric mopeds are still a rarity. That makes the new Ristretto e-bike all the more interesting.It isn’t your typical electric moped, with its large 26″ diameter wheels and a more traditional bicycle-style frame.It also goes its own way on the saddle, which appears to have been swapped for a library book – perhaps thanks to the e-bike industry’s severe supply shortage right now. But the Ristretto e-bike still packs in the power, offering speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) in Class 3 mode or 40 mph (64 km/h) when unlocked.That unlocked mode might not be legal on public streets though, depending on your local moped laws. If not, consider that a private road or track option only.Helping the bike achieve those high speeds is a CYC mid-drive motor rated for up to 3,500 watts (4.7 hp). We’ve played around with CYC motors before and the power is palpable, to say the least.Even if the seat doesn’t look particularly comfortable, the front and rear suspension should help smooth out that ride. Both the front and rear suspension include adjustments for pre-load, rebound, and compression.The bright LED lighting on the Ristretto is definitely of the “seeing” variety, not just the typical “be seen” lights found on basic e-bikes. The company claims the headlights provide 100 yards (91 meters) of visibility in front.The 52V and 17.5 Ah battery offers up to 55 miles (88 km) of range. That’s only 910 Wh of capacity for a 40 mph bike, so don’t expect to get that kind of range at full speed. The maximum range was likely calculated using the bike’s pedal assist at lower speeds.Pedaling the 84 lb (38 kg) bike might sound like a tall order, but it does include an 11-speed Shimano drivetrain that should make the task a bit easier.The Ristretto also includes a smartphone app that allows riders to make adjustments to ride parameters. An optional GPS tracking upgrade is available as an add-on, which would let riders track their bike in the app if it was ever stolen.For those wanting to put one of these high-powered electric mopeds in their own garage, be prepared to wait. After plopping down $3,099 for the pre-order, bikes won’t start shipping until October of this year.The pre-order system is being offered via Indiegogo. We always advise caution with crowdfunding campaigns since you are backing a project instead of directly buying a product. It’s a common method for pre-selling new e-bikes, and is used by small and large companies alike in the e-bike industry.",ebikes
2021/05/23,"The Torque 1 electric commuter bike from St Petersberg, Florida-based Ride Scoozy may just be one of the most affordable electric bicycles out there with a torque sensor.For those that don’t nerd out about e-bikes as much as the rest of us, a torque sensor is just a more elegant way of controlling power on an electric bike.E-bikes that lack throttles are powered by a Pedal Assist System (PAS) that engages the e-bike’s motor when it detects that the rider is pedaling.The most simple form of PAS uses a cadence sensor that measures roughly how fast the pedals are turning. The faster the rider pedals, the more power is sent to the motor. It works, but it has a few drawbacks. For example, cadence sensors tend to exhibit power lag while the system is counting the first few pedal rotations to determine speed. When the user starts to pedal, it takes a second or two for the power to kick in.A more elegant PAS sensor is a torque-sensor. These measure how hard the rider is pedaling, not how fast. The reading is nearly instantaneous, which means that the power comes on quickly.It also adjusts more effectively as the rider often pedals harder on hills or when starting from rest and thus needs more power.Most e-bikes that feature torque sensors instead of cadence sensors are found on the higher end of companies’ product lines. The Torque 1 from Ride Scoozy though is priced at a mere $1,199 – far below the average electric bicycle price in the US.The 20 mph (32 km/h) e-bike is considered a class 1 e-bike in the US and thus can ride just about anywhere bicycles are permitted.The 38 lb (17.2 kg) e-bike uses a single speed drivetrain tied into a 350W rear hub motor. The internal 36V and 10.5 Ah battery offers around 380 Wh of capacity, or enough for 25-50 miles (40-80 km) of riding depending on the power assist level selected.The battery is integrated into the downtube of the frame, which comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Integrated batteries make the bike look sleeker and stealthier than bulky external batteries, and the batteries are also harder to steal. On the other hand, the batteries also can’t be easily removed for charging (most are designed to be removed only for servicing) and thus the battery must be charged on the bike.Helping to keep the price down, the bike is only available in one color (white) and one size (fits 5’5 to 6’2 or 165-188 cm).The single-speed drivetrain and narrow 700Cx28mm tires help keep the bike’s weight down too, though a lack of fenders means you might want to add your own for all-weather commuting.The bike is certainly simple, offering just an LED display and basic mechanical disc brakes. But at $1,199, the Torque 1 is designed as an entry-level commuter e-bike that just happens to feature a non-entry-level torque sensor for an improved ride.It’s an interesting combination of low and high tech, one we haven’t seen much of before in this industry.",ebikes
2021/05/21,"You know those sleeper cars that roll up looking like any other bucket on the road and then proceed to shred a set of tires right before your eyes? The Biktrix Swift Step-Thru is pretty much the electric bicycle equivalent. It’s a fine-looking e-bike, though nothing fancy initially jumps out at you. But when you start to examine it deeper, you realize all of the hidden high performance that makes this an electric wolf in sheep’s clothing.When the bike first rolls up, you’d never guess that it is packing so much power.It looks (and feels) like something between a cruiser and a city commuter bike. The forward pedals, step-through frame, high bars, and plush saddle all contribute to the easygoing, comfortable feel of the bike.The 1.95″ tires also give it a nice city bike feel, and don’t give that same heavy sense like with fat tire e-bikes.But that 1,000W motor hiding in the rear wheel is all business, and it came to work.When you saddle up and hit the throttle, you’ll blast up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with surprising ease. Trying to control my inner racer, I resisted the temptation of the easy throttle-riding as much as possible so that I could enjoy the torque-sensor-based pedal assist as well.With both a cadence and torque sensor controlling the pedal assist function, power delivery is smooth and comes on without delay.In the lower settings, the motor doesn’t feel overly powerful, and you actually get a nice, calm ride that feels like it better matches the appearance of the bike. In high pedal assist levels, that 1,000W motor comes alive and you’re back to that kid-in-a-candy-store grin as you fly along your path.There are multiple large battery options ranging from 840 Wh to 1,008 Wh, providing more range than most people will ever need. Even with the smallest option, you’ll likely never see less than 30 miles (48 km) of range, and you’ll easily get more than double that with even moderate pedal assist. The largest battery option will likely last you for days of casual riding.The power is great, but the loadout is where the price comes in. That price – by the way – is $2,599.The higher than normal power motor and higher than normal capacity battery certainly play a role in that price, but the bike’s loadout is where it all comes together.Features like the dual piston hydraulic brakes, torque sensor pedal assist, color display, and 60 mm front suspension all add to the upgraded feel compared to typical mid-level e-bikes in the $1.5K-$2K range.The rear rack is also a nice touch. It’s color matched and bolted along the length of the seat stays, meaning it basically becomes part of the frame. It doesn’t look like those flimsy racks that get added to a lot of budget e-bikes. Instead, it becomes part of the bike. And there’s even a mounting bracket up front for a large front rack or basket that rigidly mounts to the frame instead of turning with the fork. Unlike the rear rack that comes standard, a front rack or basket will cost you extra.While I love these front rack mounts on the headtube, this style doesn’t look nearly as nice as we’ve seen elsewhere. The mounts seem to just be blocks that are drilled and tapped. When you don’t have the basket or rack on the front, they look a bit funny. I’m not normally an asthetics guy, and to be honest I don’t really care whether the front rack mounts look nice or not (I judge a bike by how it rides), but it’s worth pointing out for those that do.And then you’ve got your basic niceties, things like LED lights and included fenders. They’re nice to have but they don’t wow me on their own. At this price level, companies pretty much have to include them as standard equipment or I’m going to roast their bike. Fortunately Biktrix checks those boxes for me.The bike had a Microshift transmission when I tested it, but it seems now they’ve switched to a Shimano Altus 7-speed derailleur, which is a bit of a bummer in my opinion. To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with this derailleur and it’s just fine. But it’s Shimano’s entry-level derailleur and I would have hoped to step up to a Shimano Alivio at this price point, which is just a nicer version. For a bike like this that is such a fun one to actually pedal, any drivetrain upgrades are certainly appreciated. But the worldwide bike component market is turned on its head right now and many companies are in a pinch to get any components whatsoever, so I imagine that you take what you can get at a certain point.While the entry-level bicycle transmission doesn’t wow me, it’s perfectly fine for everyday riding – it just isn’t as fancy as the rest of the bike.The only other complaint I have, which is admittedly superficial, is the Champagne color doesn’t really do it for me. Check it out in Classic Blue below. Mmm, now that’s an e-bike!The take-home message about the Biktrix for me was the interesting combination of comfort and power in a city-style electric bike. I’ve ridden plenty of comfortable city e-bikes and I’ve ridden plenty of 1,000 W e-bikes, but they rarely overlap like this. Biktrix has gotten great at providing e-bikes with excellent rides and that pack in more power than you’d expect. In this case, the Biktrix Swift Step-Thru has managed to take a comfortable geometry frame, outfit it with great components, and then pack it full of more power and battery capacity than you probably need (but that you’ll absolutely be grateful for once you try it).While it looks like a casual e-bike that you’d take on a Sunday cruise, it has the muscle to keep up with the best of them.",ebikes
2021/05/20,"These days electric bicycles have become a common form of transportation and recreation. But while pedal-assist e-bikes that provide motor assistance when the rider pedals have been widely accepted as a faster and more convenient transportation tool, questions have remained in some circles regarding their efficacy from a fitness standpoint.We’ve seen plenty of studies documenting the various benefits of pedal-assist e-bike exercise before, but a new study recently compared e-bikes and pedal bikes in a controlled head-to-head experiment to determine exactly how they stack up against each other.As the Miami University study explained, most health organizations recommend that adults partake in 2.5 hours of moderate intensity exercise each week. Doing so results in a significant drop in the rates of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and early death.While cycling on a pedal bicycle has long been established as fulfilling this exercise recommendation, the study set out to determine if pedal-assist e-bikes can also provide such a workout.The study created a simulated 5 km (3 mi) commute that was performed by riders on both a pedal bike and a 350W class 1 electric bike. The same rider performed three simulated commutes: on a standard pedal bicycle ride, on the electric bicycle in pedal assist level 1 and again on pedal assist level 2. The order of the rides was randomized for each rider.During the rides, heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption (V̇O2) of the riders were continuously monitored, enabling the study’s authors to calculate a number of cardiometabolic figures.At the end of each ride, the subject also self-reported a rating for perceived exertion (RPE), or how much effort they felt that they exerted. As you can imagine, the data indicated that pedal bicycles provided higher cardiometabolic and RPE feedback.The percentage of maximum heart rate reached on the pedal bicycle, e-bike at assist level 1 and e-bike at assist level 2 were 66%, 62%, and 56%, respectively.Similar results were found for V̇O2max (55 vs 47 vs 39), RPE (12.3 vs 9.8 vs 8.4), metabolic equivalents (METs) (6.5 vs 5.6 vs 4.6), caloric expenditure (505 vs 422 vs 344 kcal·h−1), and time (865 vs 748 vs 681 s), respectively.The study concluded that while riders engage in higher intensity exercise when using a non-electric bike, the amount of exertion on the electric bike still provided the moderate intensity exercise level that is recommended to avoid or reduce the risk of serious health conditions.As the authors also learned, many riders found the e-bike rides to be more enjoyable than the pedal bike, which speaks to the e-bike’s higher potential to convert car commuters into cycling commuters. As the study reported:Positive perceptions toward e-bike riding occurred in most participants, and qualitative analyses included perceptions of commuting with an e-bike as “easier” and “fun,” among other positive terms. Together, these results imply that e-bikes are viable options for active transportation that can benefit individual health and reduce congestion and pollution from gas-powered vehicles.",ebikes
2021/05/19,"San Diego-based Juiced Bikes has just launched the brand’s latest electric bicycle, the Juiced RipCurrent S Step-Thru.The updated open frame is designed to be more accessible to a wider range of riders. On these large fat tire e-bikes, that can be a huge benefit. Throwing a leg over a large bike isn’t always easy, especially when that rear rack is piled high. Hopping on and off of a step-through bike is simply more comfortable.The new model was teased last week ahead of today’s launch, though we might have spoiled the launch a bit with a spy photo of the new bike.Leaks or no leaks, the new bike is now out and shows off Juiced’s signature expertise when it comes to packing in the features and the extra battery capacity.The company has standardized around 52V batteries, and the new Juiced RipCurrent S Step-Thru comes with the largest model offered by Juiced, a 52V 19.2Ah pack. That’s just shy of 1,000 Wh of capacity.To put that in perspective, most e-bikes currently average between 350-650 Wh of battery. The largest e-bike company in the US, Rad Power Bikes, has standardized on a 672 Wh pack. Very few e-bikes come close to 1,000 Wh.According to the company, that big battery gives the new RipCurrent S Step-Thru a maximum range of 70 miles (112 km), though that is with pedal assist support set on low. Harder throttle-enabled riding is more likely to see 35-40 miles (56-64 km) of range.Riders sticking with pedal assist will be happy to see the inclusion of both a torque sensor and a cadence sensor, which combine to provide smoother, more responsive power delivery.With a 750W continuous motor in the rear, the Juiced RipCurrent S Step-Thru reaches a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). There’s also a 9-speed transmission that riders can run through on their way up to max speed.The bike comes standard with a heavy-duty rear rack as well as front and rear fenders for all-weather riding. And with large 4″ fat tires, a front suspension fork, and dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, the RipCurrent S Step-Thru is ready for all-terrain riding, too.A super bright 1,050 lumen headlight provides actual night-riding visibility, instead of just being an indicator for cars of the bike’s presence. Anyone doing fast trail riding at night may want to add an even brighter light, but this stock light will still be good for illuminating pitch-black trails on its own.The bike is available in standard White and Black colors as well as two attractive new options of Beach Blue and Yellow.While the bike is officially being launched today, prospective riders won’t be able to toss a leg over (or through) it until later next month. Pre-orders are now being collected for a mid-June shipping date.Priced at $2,699, it’s a pretty penny higher than popular competitors, but also offers a number of higher performance parts such as the larger battery, more powerful motor, and higher-spec bike components.",ebikes
2021/05/18,"The team over at Lectric eBikes has just released a new version of the company’s popular folding fat-tire e-bike, dubbed the Lectric XP 2.0.Founded in 2018 by two childhood friends, Lectric eBikes quickly grew a huge following for the duo’s first model, the Lectric XP e-bike. While the original version of the Lectric XP offered impressive performance for its low price of $899, there were still a number of upgrades that many riders hoped to see implimented.Now the Lectric XP 2.0 has been released with several of these key upgrades, including added suspension, increased cargo carrying capacity, improved handlebar ergonomics, and more.The main specs remain the same, including a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) from a 500W continuous and 800W peak rear hub motor and a range of 25-45 miles (40-72 km) from a 48V 500Wh battery. The bike is also still available in two frame styles: Standard and Step-Thru.To see the Lectric XP 2.0 up close, along with my own thoughts on each of the upgrades, check out the video below covering the launch. Then keep reading below for the full details.The first major upgrade found on the Lectric XP 2.0 is the new adjustable suspension fork featuring hydraulic damping. It looks like it has around 2 inches or so of travel – not the longest travel fork out there – but certainly a huge improvement over a lack of suspension. And the fact that it’s an actual oil fork means you’re getting true damping suspension, not just a bouncy spring.There’s also an option for a comfort upgrade that adds a suspension saddle with a suspension seat post, giving riders even more cushion beneath them.Next we can see that the new version has upgraded mounting for increased cargo capacity. The rear rack has been upgraded from the lighter-duty 50 lb-rated rack to a sturdier 77-lb rack. There is also mounting for both front and rear baskets, turning the folding e-bike into something of a utility e-bike as well. And for added security, there’s a mounting point for a lock to be installed on the bike, keeping it in reach for pit stops when the bike is locked outside (and meaning you don’t need to jury-rig or zip-tie a lock mount onto the bike’s frame).The previous 4-inch fat tires have been swapped for 3-inch tires. Those tires offer improved agility and responsiveness while still maintaining a wide contact patch for comfortable riding on varied terrain. New handlebars are now wider and more ergonomic. They also feature more space for adding accessories like mirrors and phone holders, in addition to offering a more comfortable riding position.The bike also comes rated for IP65 water and dust resistance, making it even safer to take it out into the elements wherever your rides take you.As you might expect, Lectric eBikes wasn’t able to add all of these upgrades for free. The new Lectric XP 2.0 sports a price tag of $999, marking a $100 price bump from the previous version’s price.Considering all of those upgrades though, the price seems more than reasonable. And it comes at a time when nearly all major electric bicycle companies in the US are raising their prices due to a number of cost increases in the industry.They’ve done it again. The Lectric XP 2.0 and its upgrades are somehow an even better value than the first version! For anyone on the hunt for a low-cost way to enter the electric bike market and still get an e-bike with good performance, it’s hard to beat this.Now let’s be real here: The Lectric XP 2.0 is not a high-quality e-bike. It’s a mid-tier e-bike with a low-entry price. And riders have to know that going in. The parts are all good enough, but nothing fancy. There’s nothing to shave off grams or to future-proof the bike. There’s no embedded smart sensors or GPS tracking or hydraulic brakes or anything else you’d see on higher-dollar e-bikes.Pretty much all of the components are found on the lower end of the component brand’s hierarchy. But for an e-bike that’s just for getting around town and having fun, that’s all most people need. We may be looking at Shimano’s beginner derailleur, but it works just fine for the everyday riding that most people are looking for.I’ve personally ridden multiple versions of the original Lectric XP, from the prototype to the production version to the updated step-thru version. They’ve all been awesome rides, even if they aren’t fancy. They do exactly what I need them to do.And now with the added upgrades, the Lectric XP 2.0 looks like an even better value proposition. It’s fast, decently powerful and now comes with improved comfort, agility, and utility. That’s a lot of bang for your buck – or bang for your 999 bucks. So while there are better e-bikes out there, it’s hard for any company to compete with the bottom line value offered by Lectric eBikes.",ebikes
2021/05/17,"Seattle-based electric bicycle company Ariel Rider was already sitting on one of the most powerful moped-style e-bikes when it released the Ariel Rider Grizzly late last year.Now the company is announcing several new updates to the model that not only make it more powerful, but also boost the quality even further.The original Ariel Rider Grizzly came with some fairly audacious specs.The first version sported dual 750W motors that gave the bike a combined 1,500W continuous power rating and a peak power rating of 3,000W.The dual 52V batteries added up to 32Ah or 1,664Wh of capacity.More than just a pair of big motors and big batteries, the bike sported a dual suspension design that meant the high-power ride wasn’t going to jar users’ teeth out either.But thanks to a series of new updates, this electric moped will soon be even more intense.The dual 750W motors are now being upgraded to dual 1,000W motors. The 2,000W continuous power rating is only half of the potentially 4,000W peak rating, though the company told Electrek that they paired the true peak output back a bit to 3,700W “for safety.”We’ve previously tested out Ariel Rider’s dual motor setup on the D-Class e-bike, where the high power and torque allowed us to do dual wheel burnouts. Check it out in the video below.The electronic speed controller on the updated Grizzly has also been beefed up with higher power mosfets to handle the increased power and improve the heat dissipation – a serious concern when operating at these power levels.The bike should be capable of a top speed of around 36 mph (58 km/h) when in unlocked mode, though it still ships locked to 20 mph (32 km/h) max speeds. Those riders that want to exceed the Class 2 capabilities of the e-bike will have to take it upon themselves to unlock the full performance.To help riders stay on their bikes longer, Ariel Rider also increased the battery capacity of the bike by moving to 21700-format cells and bumping the batteries to 35 Ah or 1,820 Wh. The larger-format cells are slightly more energy dense, meaning the batteries actually weigh slightly less even though they have around 10% more battery capacity.A second charger will now be included with each bike so that riders don’t have to use a single charger to charge each battery one at a time. The chargers are a smaller, more compact size now as well.The Ariel Rider Grizzly already sported full-suspension, but the front fork is being updated to an adjustable model. The rear coilover suspension is getting upgraded with longer travel.Fortunately, all of these changes and upgrades haven’t seemed to inflate the bike’s $3,299 price. In fact, Ariel Rider is currently offering a $300 discount with the bike on sale for $2,999.While the Ariel Rider Grizzly represents one of the most powerful electric bicycles currently available on the market, the company also made headlines earlier this year when it unveiled a distinctly lower power electric bike. The $999 Ariel Rider Rideal draws on much of the company’s experience with past e-bikes to help reduce the pricing while still offering a capable 20 mph (32 km/h) commuter-style e-bike.",ebikes
2021/05/13,"A teaser image released by the San Diego-based electric bicycle company Juiced Bikes suggests that the popular e-bike brand has a new electric bike set to debut soon.But another photo may have already spoiled the surprise.In the official teaser photo released by Juiced Bikes, two e-bikes appear partially obscured.The white and blue electric bikes are shown sporting fat tires and suspension forks, as well as the standard 52V battery that Juiced Bikes has adopted across its line.Other than the downtubes, we don’t see much of the bikes’ frames. That makes it hard to tell if these are totally new models, or perhaps an update to an existing model.In the teaser, the company refers to the model only as “a new addition to the Juiced lineup!”Can you tell what kind of bike it could be from the teaser image below? The good news is that you may not have to wait long.Just a peek 👀 Who's ready for some summer fun? Stay tuned for more details on a new addition to the Juiced lineup! ☀️🚲 #JuicedBikes #SneakPeek #Ebike pic.twitter.com/sMTP8nFcnZWhile the teaser leaves much of the bike to the imagination, a photo posted by a Facebook user to the company’s Facebook page may have just revealed the entire bike – or better yet several of them.The photo shows what appears to be four Juiced RipCurrent electric bikes with a yet-unseen step-through frame. Two of the bikes sport the Juiced RipCurrent rack, helping to further identify the model.The two bikes in the bed of the truck seem to match the two bikes in the official teaser photo released by Juiced, while the other two bikes on the rear carrier were likely used in additional marketing shots. All four bikes have their batteries removed, which is standard procedure when transporting an electric bike. It both lightens the bike and removes any risk of damaging the battery if the bikes are dislodged.There are no details or background associated with the photo, but it may have been taken during a marketing session to shoot the new models.An update to the RipCurrent line would make sense for Juiced.The RipCurrent is the company’s main fat tire e-bike, featuring a 750W continuous motor, hydraulic disc brakes, and a top speed of up to 28 mph (45 km/h).It’s a big bike however, and that can make it difficult for some riders to mount. Step-through frames are much easier to use for riders with mobility issues or anyone who finds it difficult to swing a leg over a tall bike.The new model’s announcement would follow quickly on the heels of another Juiced Bike reveal, the Scorpion X.The new Scorpion X was revealed just last month, replacing the previous base model Juiced Scorpion electric moped and upgrading its performance.There’s no word yet on exactly when this new step-through model will be released, but Juiced Bikes better hurry if it wants to beat other high-level e-bike announcements expected soon.Popular budget e-bike company Lectric eBikes plans to unveil a new generation of the popular $899 Lectric XP e-bike next week, as revealed in a similar teaser announcement on Tuesday.",ebikes
2021/05/12,"There’s no two ways about it, Rad Power Bikes is absolutely crushing it in the e-bike market. The Seattle-based electric bicycle manufacturer holds the largest share of the US market by far with all other companies competing for a distant second.To learn more about what the leading e-bike brand is up to next, we caught up with founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh. In speaking with Mike, it is obvious that he is an e-bike rider first and CEO of an e-bike company second – his passion for the electric bike community shines through every time he talks about the company. Having founded Rad Power Bikes after working on his own experiments with building electric bikes in his garage, he’s seen the larger industry grow even as Rad has grown within it.But it’s impossible to talk about the direction of the e-bike industry as a whole or Rad Power Bikes’ position in it without also discussing the long shadow cast by the COVID-19 pandemic.Back when COVID-19 first hit the US in early 2020, the skies looked dark on the e-bike horizon.Like many companies, Rad Power Bikes began preparing to batten down the hatches and weather a tough period, Mike explained to Electrek.But only a few months later the story had changed drastically. It quickly became obvious that e-bikes were a surprise winner in the rewritten COVID-19 economy, with most electric bike companies quickly selling out of inventory. Commuters sought safer socially distant forms of cheap transportation while countless others wanted a fun way to get outside for exercise after months of lockdowns.Rad Power Bikes, as the largest e-bike manufacturer in the US, was hit with crushing demand that piled on top of what was already considerable year-over-year growth pre-COVID-19. Customers lined up for waiting lists, sometimes months-long, to get e-bikes as soon as Rad could get them into its warehouses.“We aren’t constrained by consumer demand at all – we’re constrained by inventory,” explained Mike. And despite the unprecedented peak demand during COVID-19 having calmed somewhat by now, e-bike sales are still stoutly high. “All of the tailwinds that have been supporting e-bikes as a resilient and prolific form of future mobility are still alive and well, both pre- and post-COVID-19. Now that we’re over a quarter of the way into 2021, we’re still seeing that exponential growth. Frankly, we’ve been shocked by the first few months of the year,” he expanded. The company has used the increase in demand to better optimize its operations. Improvements include the customer service team expanding at breakneck speed, shipping often occurring same or next day after an order, Rad becoming even more focused on further improving their logistics, and growing their Rad Mobile service that builds, delivers, and maintains e-bikes. The company’s retail presence is also using the opportunity to better prepare in advance of an expected resurgence of physical retail sales.Rad also launched an entirely new e-bike platform late last year with the release of the $1,099 RadMission metro commuter e-bike. We reviewed that e-bike recently and found it to be one of the best value-bikes for those looking for a city e-bike on a budget. In fact, it even made our Top 5 Affordable E-bikes of 2021 list.One of the biggest changes currently going on behind the scenes at Rad is just how many new faces are showing up each day. As Mike continued, “It’s quite an exciting time. Just to give you an idea of the scope, we’ve got eight full-time internal recruiters, plus from time to time another 5 to 10 contract recruiters for various specialized roles. We’ve got around 100 open roles right now. The team has now grown to 400 employees – it’s just insane team growth. We’ll be closing in on at least 650 employees by the end of this year.”Much of the hiring now is centered around both supply chain and customer service, with Rad priding itself on its mission statement of providing “a reliable customer experience.”We’ve tested a lot of e-bikes from Rad Power Bikes and talked to a lot of Rad owners over the years. One of the biggest draws for many of them has proven to be that they know what they’re going to get with Rad, which is a solid company that supports its products, responds to customers, and will continue to be around for years to come offering the same level of service. Throughout my conversation with Mike, it was apparent just how much Rad prides itself on those principles. “We’re just pouring huge amounts of talent into customer service right now to prepare for the year ahead. It is important to us that we be the best stewards we can be for the e-bike movement. That’s always been a big part of our hiring, to have well-trained experts on the other end of the phone and in our vans and our stores. That’s a big part of the hiring too, is expanding our stores and our mobile van rollout. We aim to have 75% of North America covered by Rad-owned and partnered service providers by the end of the year. And then it will continue to tick up at an exciting rate.”Part of Rad’s ability to expand in so many directions so quickly is thanks to a massive new funding round the company secured.The round was the first major institutional investment ever in an e-bike brand, and was led by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Fidelity Management & Research Company, The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform managed by TPG, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.It wasn’t just about snagging the first ever institutional investment in the industry though. Mike explained how the partners that Rad chose were “a carefully curated group that we went out to. And frankly I was blown away that we were able to get this entire group to come together like this – it’s very unusual and I didn’t expect this to happen so soon. But that’s how we’ve built this, as a kind of special business in the sense that we’re a profitable company and we’re growing like crazy, but we’ve also got all of these themes around it, the environment, cleantech, alternative energy, electric vehicles, mobility, health and wellness, etc.”It’s that combination of a profitable and growing company alongside the several key industries straddled by Rad that many have found so intriguing, not the least of which is the diverse group of investors Rad has partnered with.But it’s about more than just the money that those groups bring. Mike continued, “It’s not just about the capital infusion, it’s also the network of groups like this. At each stage in the journey you need different types of support. For some of the smaller e-bike companies, it makes sense to partner with earlier stage investors. What we needed though was this group, the large-scale partners that can give us the power to leap quickly to the next stage. And now we can continue to double down on the things we know work while also giving us the freedom to sort of experiment with some more customer-focused initiatives, new online tools and digital tools. To help Rad make the leap from only being a hardware business to also being a software and technology business as well.”Mike wasn’t able to reveal too much detail on this new front that the company is exploring as much of it is still proprietary and not ready for public release, but it sounds like Rad wants to develop a consistent experience that follows the user from his or her bike to the online experience and even further to interactions within the Rad community.It also sounds like Rad wants to further integrate the company’s customer service into the software experience, both with online support and the company’s fleet of Rad Mobile mechanics that show up at riders’ doorsteps. Mike also described the experience as “tools and technology enabling the community.” I don’t think we’ll be getting a Rad-branded Facebook any time soon (or maybe a Rad-ish Strava?), but the ability to interact with others in the Rad community certainly sounds intriguing. It also speaks to the company’s goal of not just providing an e-bike, but of being stewards for e-biking in a larger sense.But Mike also explained how Rad has had to be patient with these developments and learn how to say “no” along the way to projects that might have served as a distraction and that wouldn’t add real value yet. He explained that too many companies have done “an app just for the sake of an app,” and that Rad has resisted those temptations to enable it to focus on its core direct-to-consumer market and the over 200,000 customers it serves. With that many customers now providing feedback and surveys, Rad has been better able to determine what the community actually wants to see and separate it from flashy distractions that don’t create true added value for riders.Before the end of the call I had to push Mike for any intel he could share with me about what was going on in the skunkworks section at Rad – all of the secret projects that are undoubtedly awesome but that we generally never get to see during development.To his credit, Mike again chose his words carefully, only letting on that the team was “going to be building bikes and accessories that push the boundaries of what people can expect from an e-bike and from an e-bike company. And that includes both the physical products as well as digital tools like we discussed. And I’d extend that to say that we will develop the same sorts of groundbreaking products for commercial customers as well, for commercial deliveries. Things that can be more efficient and less taxing for delivery operators and can cut down on delivery times while maximizing the economics on the business side of e-bikes.”So while we don’t necessarily have the clearest picture yet for what we’ll see next from Rad, we can expect the company to continue further down the path it has set: enabling a vast community of riders by building approachable electric bikes that are supported by an extensive team, both digitally and physically.Sounds pretty Rad to me!

2021/05/11,"In other “this wasn’t news that I was expecting to write today” news, the video game firm behind a series of classic titles has inexplicably developed a new electric bicycle, and it actually looks pretty slick. The Paperboy electric bike is designed as a no-nonsense commuter that you can barely tell is an e-bike.Developed by Elite Systems, the video game designers behind a number of games developed for the Commodore 64, Acorn Electron and Atari 8-bit, announced today the sale of the company’s Paperboy electric bicycle.The bike is named after the company’s classic game Paperboy, originally released in 1984 as an Atari console game before Elite rereleased it for home systems in 1986.Other than the fact that the e-bike announced today could be conceivably used by a paperboy (do those still exist?), that’s approximately where the logical connection to past and present Elite Systems ends.Elite Systems’ Steve Wilcox, one of the Paperboy e-bike’s co-designers, explained the inspiration for the company’s new product:A bike’s my preferred method of getting around. In a normal week I cover 60 to 80 miles. During the UK’s first lock down last spring I was seeing a lot of favourable press about a 3rd generation e-bike from an emerging European brand. Out of curiosity I booked a test ride. The e-Bike was stylish but felt heavy. Its derailleur gears had been replaced with a rear hub gear. Its chain had been replaced with a belt. It seemed the changes were solutions to non-existent problems. Long story short, the e-bike was expensive – a couple of grand – I was underwhelmed. So, I started looking for alternatives.The design definitely embraces a “less is more” philosophy in everything from the spec sheet to the price tag.For starters, it’s a stealthy design. The entire 375 Wh Samsung battery is hidden inside the frame, leaving the appearance of a non-electric bike. The only giveaways that the Paperboy gets any electric assist are the small hub motor hidden in the rear wheel and the LCD screen with hidden USB charger on the bars.Since the company is British, they conform to UK electric bike laws and limit the motor to 250W locally, though they also offer a 500W model for American customers. Neither option has a throttle, so both would be considered Class 1 pedal-assist e-bikes in the US. There are five levels of pedal assist, plus a 0 level that turns the bike into a standard pedal bike.The UK model has a limited top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph), while the US model gets bumped up to 32 km/h (20 mph).There’s also a Shimano Tourney-based 21-speed transmission on the bike, which is actually quite rare in the e-bike world. Few electric bikes come equipped with multiple chainrings, and most e-bikes in this price class sport simple 6-speed or 7-speed drivetrains.Speaking of the price, the Paperboy is being launched at a reasonable $999, though that price doesn’t include shipping.Very few e-bikes retail for under $1,000, and that means that some compromises were made on the Paperboy. The bike seems to lack fenders and a tail light, though a front headlight is included. The brakes are mechanical Tektro stoppers instead of hydraulic, like we often see on higher-end e-bikes, and the battery is a bit smaller than we typically see as well. While many e-bikes feature batteries twice this size, the Paperboy’s 18 kg (39 lb) curb weight keeps it much lighter than most e-bikes with higher capacity batteries. And the few e-bikes that do match its weight class are known for having smaller batteries.Despite the smaller 375 Wh battery, the fact that it is completely hidden in the frame is a significant advantage for those that want a sleek-looking e-bike (though not for those that want a removable battery).And Paperboy even claims a maximum range of 80 km (50 miles) if you pedal hard enough, so the battery doesn’t seem to hold them back.To put the bike to the test in the real world, Steve Wilcox and co-designer Dave Neale took the Paperboy on a 2,000-km (1,200-mile) journey this winter and plan to release a short film about the experience soon.In the meantime, those interested in the Paperboy can check out the Indiegogo campaign for the bike and reserve one of the first units. Currently the company is only shipping bikes to the US and UK (thanks, Brexit) with shipping slated for later this summer.We always advise caution when considering crowdfunding campaigns since customers are actually “backers” that support a project in return for a product. In fact, we generally only cover crowdfunding projects from companies that have a history of delivering products or that we’ve tested personally to verify the product works.Despite Elite’s 1980’s Paperboy roots, the company continues to develop and deliver games to this day. While that doesn’t guarantee that they can get e-bikes out the door, it at least puts them a couple steps ahead of unknown entities and overnight startups. ",ebikes
2021/05/11,"Lectric eBikes’ cult-classic Lectric XP electric bike appears to be getting a new generation next week.That’s what we’re seeing from a teaser just released by the company. A shadowy image of a bike shop pegboard shows the Lectric eBike company’s logo along with the date “5.18.21” followed by the words “A NEW GENERATION.”The teaser image doesn’t immediately offer any details other than the launch date and a hint at a new e-bike.As usual, we generally go all CSI on these teaser images, bleaching them out to reveal any hidden details. In this case, all we can see is what appears to be a bike shop tool room. If there’s a new e-bike coming, the team at Lectric eBikes aren’t showing us just yet.But this is still likely to be one of the most anticipated releases of the year.The Lectric XP has an interesting backstory. It was originally released in the summer of 2019 after two young entrepreneurs and lifelong friends, Robby Deziel and Levi Conlow, spent their last few dollars to produce 10 prototypes.They sent those prototypes around to YouTube reviewers (with Electrek being one of them). The internet went nuts for the $899 electric bike, and the rest was history, as they say.After starting out in their apartment and garage, the duo quickly grew the business and sold tens of thousands of e-bikes in the first year. Soon afterward, they had already surpassed $20 million in revenue.The Lectric XP was successful largely due to its low price and simple design. The folding fat tire e-bike didn’t offer any bells and whistles (well, that’s not fair, it did come with a bell), but it debuted as a fast electric bike at 28 mph (45 km/h) that was a fun ride for both street and light trail riding. Its compact-ish folding nature made it popular with riders who needed to stow the bike in small spaces, such as car trunks and in RVs.The bike also scored points with its internal battery that was both theft-resistant and sleeker looking than external packs. There weren’t many options or accessories available for the bike in the early days, and the bike was available in just two colors: white or black.The company followed up with a second frame design offering a step-thru geometry designed to make the bike more accessible to a wider range of riders.The addition of the Lectric XP Step-Thru was the last major update to the bike, so this “new generation” could bring a whole new wave of features. A few of the areas that could stand to be upgraded include higher-end parts like suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, integrated lighting built into the frame, a larger battery, sturdier rack, or even more fanciful additions like a mid-drive motor or belt-drive setups.Since the Lectric XP has long been the champion of the budget e-bike market, it’s hard to imagine the team getting too fancy with the new generation’s loadout. But then again, offering both a higher-end and budget-level e-bike could help the company expand its market and challenge some of the large incumbents out there.One other unknown hanging over the launch is whether Lectric eBikes will be able to maintain its low $899 price point. Most major electric bicycle manufacturers have been forced to raise prices recently due to a number of pressures in the industry, but the Lectric XP has held fast. Will it remain at its industry-leading price? No one knows for now.We’ve got a week left before the unveiling, but we’ll be sure to update if we can get a hold of any other teasers. In the meantime, check out our review of the Lectric XP below, and make sure to check back here on May 18 for the full unveiling details. We’ll be sure to break the news first.",ebikes
2021/05/11,"Toronto-based light electric vehicle (LEV) company Daymak has announced that it has over $300 million in pre-order commitments across its Avvenire line of various electric vehicles. The Avvenire line includes a wide range of EVs from smaller electric bicycles to a three-wheeled electric car and even a flying vehicle.Back in March, Daymak kicked-off the presale of its Spiritus electric vehicle.With a top speed of 130 mph (209 km/h), the company refers to the Spiritus Ultimate as the “fastest three-wheeled electric commuter vehicle on the market.” The somewhat lower spec’d Spiritus Deluxe has a more muted top speed of 85 mph (137 km/h), which puts it closer in line with other three-wheeled electric vehicles on the market.In the first 30 days of the campaign, the company says it has received over 4,000 pre-orders for the electric three-wheeler.And the staggering $300M in pre-order commitments starts to make sense when considering that the Spiritus Ultimate boasts an MSRP of $149,995. The lighter-duty Deluxe version’s price tag of $19,995 suddenly looks a lot easier to stomach. As Daymak president Aldo Baiocchi explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“At Daymak, we’re rallying a movement of people who are passionate about tech, the environment, and want something better out of their transportation – faster, cooler, and greener than ever built before – which we believe is a gap that exists in the market today. The market validation that we have received through our commitment campaign is certainly encouraging and we’re tracking to meet our 50,000 pre-order goal for the Spiritus model by July 2021.”While the Daymak Spiritus is one of the more visually striking members of the Avvenire line, there are several other notable vehicles on the roster as well.The Terra is an all-terrain electric bike that includes interesting built-in tech including solar panels, GPS tracking, and speakers.The bulky bike certainly provides extra real estate for those solar panels, but they are only designed to trickle charge the battery – not to quickly recharge it from nearly empty. Even so, any extra charge that an EV can capture while parked is essentially “free” and helps add to its utility.For commuters who want to bike in the rain, Daymak offers the Foras. The enclosed electric bike has the rider laying on his or her back beneath the canopy. The rider pedals like in a traditional bicycle, yet from a reclined position.The Foras single-passenger light electric vehicle has a range of 200 km (120 miles) and features tech normally reserved for larger vehicles, such as a GPS-based anti-theft alarm and a backup camera.The Daymak Tectus is a fairly unique EV, combining something of a mobility scooter and an ATV into one accessible adventure vehicle.The all-wheel-drive trike is designed to tackle various surfaces and in all weather conditions.It’s a stark departure from even the most classy mobility scooters we’ve seen from Daymak in the past.The Daymak Aspero is a high-end electric ATV – a market that hasn’t seen an overabundance of entries so far.Daymak claims the Aspero is “adaptable to multiple terrain types and riding conditions, and perfect for camping, hunting, and wilderness exploring.”Like several of the other light electric vehicles in the Avvenire line, the Aspero includes solar trickle charging from built-in solar panels.It also sports rear storage, plow/trailer hitch, and a quick charge time of just two hours. With most light electric vehicles charging in between four to eight hours, that’s a fairly fast charge!The most far-out vehicle in the Avvenire line is definitely the Skyrider, which is a personal electric flying vehicle.Daymak hasn’t provided many details regarding the Skyrider, only saying that it “is an elegant and high-performance electric vehicle capable of flying. No traffic, no cars, no pollution. The future flies well.”While some of the Avvenire vehicles seem fairly doable using today’s tech, the Skyrider definitely pulls in more sci-fi vibes.You can still pre-order any of the Avvenire vehicles with a refundable deposit, so it’s not too late to get in line for a solar-charging e-bike or your own flying saucer!And in case you’re curious how many others have put their name on the list ahead of you, Daymak keeps a running tally of the Avvenire line’s pre-order numbers on its site, which you can see here.",ebikes
2021/05/10,"While electric bikes are loads of fun and make for great utility riding, they aren’t known for being cheap. Adding extras like fat tires or full-suspension only send the price higher. So I wanted to see how good one of the cheapest full-suspension fat tire electric bikes on the market could be. And to do so, I turned to the Aostirmotor S18 e-bike.They say that seeing is believing, right? If you want to see me testing out the Aostirmotor S18 while you get an up-close look at the bike in action, watch my video review below.The Aostirmotor is priced at $1,599 on the company’s site (and is sometimes on Amazon but seems out of stock there right now), which makes it one of the lowest-cost full-suspension fat tire e-bikes I’ve seen.As you would imagine, that also means that the bike doesn’t come with the fanciest parts, but I found that the bottom-shelf components still made for a fun ride, even if they take a bit of getting used to.Let’s take a quick look at the sacrificies that were made before we dive into the ride experience.While the bike is full-suspension, neither the front nor the rear suspension are high quality. The Zoom fork isn’t the cheapest out there, but it’s not a luxury part by any stretch of the imagination. The rear suspension is basically just a spring. It means that big bumps don’t send the saddle into your lower intestine, but it doesn’t provide real dampening like you’d expect of a high-dollar electric mountain bike.The brakes are pretty basic and the rear caliper doesn’t bite the disc nearly as hard as in the front. That can be common with mechanical disc brakes since the rear has a longer cable and more stretch, but the Aostirmotor S18 had ever weaker rear brake performance than I’m used to. The brakes still stopped me just fine, and its true that somewhere around 75% of your braking power on a bike comes from the front brake anyways, but the soft rear brake was still a bit of a bummer.And the last major sacrifice were the ultra-cheap fenders. They flop around, especially in the rear, and generally just make a bunch of noise. They do their job too, but they aren’t high-quality wheel-hugging fenders either. The cheap plastic may stop water and mud spray, but they don’t inspire confidence.As a side note, the bike is heavy as hell. At around 80 lb (36 kg), have fun loading it in the back of your truck. If you live close to your favorite riding location then this likely won’t matter much to you. But for anyone who transports their e-bike often, note that this is definitely not a lightweight e-bike.But now that we’ve got those cheap parts and few downsides out of the way, we can focus on what the bike does well. And it definitely still has much to offer.The far tire e-bike has a powerful 750W rear hub motor that blasts me up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with either throttle-only operation or pedal assist. You can of course ignore the throttle if you want to use the pedal-assist only functionality.The giant tires are a brand I’ve never used before (Chaoyang), but they worked just fine for me. The large air volume supplements the mediocre suspension and makes for a pretty decent ride – certainly better than a hard tail mountain bike. Or at least more comfortable, as “better” is a bit loaded. Obviously you won’t have the same nimble ride as a mountain bike since the heavy fat tires aren’t nearly as responsive, but the bike still remains fairly sporty thanks to the shorter frame. I’ve reviewed giant fat tire full-suspension e-bikes that tend to feel more like a land yacht, and the Aostirmotor S18 definitely felt more nimble by comparison.The bike also sports a very novel-shaped battery in its novel-shaped frame. Two locks (one electrical/mechanical and one purely mechanical) hold the battery case into the center of the bike. There’s a little handle on top that lifts up to pull the battery out once you’ve unlocked it, making the process easier.The case is a bit odd, but I’ll give the company style points for using a new battery shape instead of repurposing one of the half dozen common designs we see on every budget e-bike.The 557 Wh battery gives a sufficient range of around 15-20 miles (25-32 km) on throttle-only riding if you’re being reasonable with the throttle, and you can eke out more range if you add some old-fashioned pedaling. But this isn’t a high-capacity batter – it’s a good enough battery.Another note about that odd-shaped frame wrapped around the battery is they use it to integrate the rear tail light directly into the frame. I’m actually a fan of that method because its one less component to break off. It ensures that the light will also function since it runs off the e-bikes main battery. Having to swap out AAA batteries in bicycles lights or recharge them on USB is a big pet peeve of mine.There’s a typical LED headlight up front like you’ll find on most basic e-bikes. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. The fact that there are built-in lights at all though is a nice addition to add commuter functionality to what is likely to be a dual-purpose bike for many people. While the Aostirmotor S18 definitely works for trail riding, a lot of riders enjoy fat tire e-bikes and full suspension models for road riding. The same features that make them great for trails (suspension and fat tires) also make them great for urban obstacles like pot holes and curbs.Given that the Aostirmotor S18 isn’t a highly tuned off-road machine, this dual purpose use seems appropriate for it. If all I wanted to do was ride trails all day, I’d choose a higher quality dedicated electric mountain bike. If I only wanted to commute, I’d go for a purpose-built commuter e-bike. But if I wanted to get into varied e-bike riding with a fun full-suspension fat tire e-bike for a much lower price than these bikes tend to command, the Aostirmotor S18 would be a good choice. It’s a great beginner fat tire full-suspension e-bike for anyone that doesn’t want to part with several thousand dollars in one go. ",ebikes
2021/05/06,"Belgium’s Cowboy has already run through several generations of its popular urban-oriented electric bicycles. Now the company has just unveiled the new Cowboy C4 e-bike, which is available in two different models.The new C4 upgrades the classic Cowboy e-bike, while the C4 ST introduces Cowboy’s first step-through frame.Both models are now equipped with 50% more torque than Cowboy’s previous model, the C3.That torque bump is only 15 Nm more than the former 30 Nm, so don’t plan to climb any walls just yet. But it should add a nice little boost compared to the earlier models.Unlike most electric bicycles, Cowboy doesn’t offer multiple power settings. There aren’t any gear shifters, either. And since this is a European e-bike, there’s of course no throttle. That makes for a very clean set of bars.It also means that the bike decides how much power you want or need, using a torque sensor in the pedal drivetrain to interpret power requirements. Take it easy and the bike will give you a gentle assist. Pedal hard and the bike will add more power to your ride.Cowboy refers to this setup as its “automatic transmission.” I can see how they got there through some lingual gymnastics, but this is definitely not an automatic transmission like we’re used to seeing on a bike – one that would automatically switch gears to keep you in the proper gear ratio for varying hill climbs and pedaling speeds. This is just a single-speed drivetrain that automatically decides when to add motor assist.The single-speed transmission makes it easy to include a Gates Carbon Drive using a carbon-fiber reinforced belt. Belt drives are essentially maintenance-free and last longer than chain drives. They also make less noise and don’t require derailleurs or tensioners. But perhaps my favorite benefit is that they require no oil and thus leave your pant legs nice and clean.The C4 and C4 ST both use a similar style 2.4 kg (5.3 lb) battery that mounts just behind the seat tube. It makes the tube look quite chunky, but leaves the front triangle nice and open like a typical commuter bike. The 36V and 10Ah battery offers 360 Wh of capacity, which Cowboy claims will translate into 70 km (43.5 miles) of range. The slower EU-limited speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) helps stretch that range out, making the battery last longer.The C4 and C4 ST also feature a number of smart features. The bikes include theft prevention in the form of theft detection and tracking, though that feature will cost you an extra € 10/month. Other smart features include remote unlocking when the app senses you’re in close proximity to the bike, crash detection that can recognize a fall and will “talk to the app to alert your emergency contacts,” and navigation via the app itself. A magnetic phone holder mounts your phone front and center on the handlebars, keeping the navigation screen right where you need it.The rather lightweight 19 kg (42 lb) e-bikes start at €2,490 and £2,290, or just shy of US $3,000. Cowboy currently delivers its bikes in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.Americans will need to look elsewhere for belt-drive commuter e-bikes, though there are many options in the US as well.",ebikes
2021/05/05,"The Aventon Aventure was just released earlier this week, marking the popular e-bike company’s first foray into the full-size fat tire e-bike market.And that’s good news for anyone on the hunt for a full-size fat tire e-bike that combines a sleek design with the latest tech.I’ve spent the last week testing out the Aventon Aventure, riding it on a combination of manicured streets and off-road trails.The bike has eaten up everything I’ve thrown at it so far without a moment’s hesitation. And it’s done so without breaking the bank. It is priced at just $1,899, which is a steal for the kind of performance, components, and built-in tech that this e-bike offers.Don’t believe me? Check out my test riding video below to see the e-bike in action along with an overview of all the cool features it packs in.Then keep reading for my full nitty-gritty review.First of all, the Aventon Aventure hits hard right out of the gate with extra power and battery capacity. Unlike full-size fat tire e-bikes that peak at 750W, Aventon outfitted the Aventure with a 750W continuous-rated motor. The real power output at peak levels is 1,130W.Then there’s an even larger 720 Wh battery pack to feed that hungry motor more energy.The bike has a new headlight and a sweet integrated tail light. The tail light is built right into the rear seat stay on the left side. As cool as the tail light is and as much as I like how it is built right into the frame, I wish they had included it on both sides. It makes sense that in the US you’ll be sticking to the right side of the lane most of the time and so cars will usually see your left seat stay clearly, but having it on both sides would have ensured complete visibility from any rear angle. As it is, the LED tail light is several inches long and still likely to be seen from the right side through the wheel unless you’re at the perfect angle to block it with the tire.Another big addition is the much nicer screen. This beautiful color LCD screen shows way more information and gives you much more control over your e-bike’s parameters. The bike ships as a Class 2 e-bike limited to 20 mph (32 km/h), but you can enter the settings and bump the speed up to 28 mph (45 km/h) to enter Class 3 e-bike territory.Going that fast on off-road trails is a whole different level of fun. And when you’re back on-road, the extra speed feels safer because you can more easily keep up with traffic.And if the screen didn’t give you enough info, the new companion app that comes with the bike goes even deeper, offering stats like calorie counting, kilograms of C02 saved (compared to car transportation), a more precise battery meter down to the single digit percentage, control for your lights, and the ability to log your rides over time along with viewing those ride maps.Other than those fancy features, the rest of the bike is pretty much what you’d expect of a good quality fat tire e-bike. The welds are amazing, as Aventon’s welds always are.The 80mm travel front fork adds plenty of suspension for trail riding.The Ares Bengal hydraulic disc brakes bite hard on large diameter disc rotors.The integrated battery looks great and doesn’t detract from the profile like a bolt-on battery does.The included fenders keep the spray off your back.It’s all what you’d expect from a quality e-bike company like Aventon.There’s a lot to like about this e-bike, though I found a few things that bugged me too.We’ll start with the pro column.The ability to ride just about any terrain is awesome, and the Aventon Aventure actually packs enough power to make true off-road riding possible.I also LOVE that Aventon is straightforward with providing real-world range testing data. It’s so much more useful to the customer than just hearing an ideal range in lowest power mode.Next, that smartphone app offers functionality that is close to what I get from my NIU electric scooter’s app – and that’s a 50 mph motor vehicle that cost over 3x as much as the Aventon Aventure.The ability to add front and rear racks also increases the utility of the bike, making it great for hauling your camping gear into the wild or hauling your groceries through the urban jungle.There are also three frame sizes, meaning you aren’t stuck with the one-size-fits-most philosophy of many e-bike companies in this price range.There’s even both a step-over and a step-thru frame option, allowing you to go old-school top tube or easy mount/dismount, depending which you prefer.That being said, despite all the things I love about the e-bike, I have a few gripes as well.I already mentioned that I think they should have included a tail light on both sides of the rear frame, but that’s basically just saying I want more of one of the cool upgrades.A true gripe is that the e-bike is quite heavy, weighing in at 73 lb (33 kg). Try lifting that into a truck by yourself. It’s tricky, especially with a big and bulky e-bike like this. And I understand that you can’t ask for big tires, a big battery and a big motor, and then complain about the heavy weight. But I’m still going to do it.And while my next gripe might be trivial, I’m not a huge fan of the “Aventure” name. I imagine that “Adventure” was likely a copyright litigation nightmare, but trying to tell someone on the street the name of your bike is going to be nearly impossible. “Cool bike, what is it?”“Thanks, it’s an Aventon Aventure!”“Adventure?”“No, Aventure.”[Cue Abbott and Costello routine]To bring it all together, I’m a huge fan of this e-bike, even if I have a few small complaints.Aventon did a great job on its first full-size electric fat-tire bike.It’s well-made with excellent build quality, plenty of power and battery capacity, includes great components and comes with honest marketing. What more can you ask for at this $1,899 price point?The Aventon Aventure would make an excellent e-bike option for anyone that needs a single e-bike to cover both work and play, and who wants to get a few nicer components than a typical value-based e-bike would offer. What do you think of Aventon’s newest e-bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below.",ebikes
2021/05/03,"Ribble is no stranger to lightweight e-bikes. Now the company’s latest model, the Ribble Endurance SL e Hero, is pushing the brand even further as it becomes one of the lightest e-bikes in the world.The true title of lightest e-bike is a bit hard to nail down.Technically the 6.872 kg (15.15 lb) Freicycle electric bike likely takes the cake, though it was a one-off DIY build.The HPS Domestique is probably the current lightest production electric bicycle at just 8.5 kg (18.7 lb).Hummingbird has the lightest folding e-bike at 10.3 kg (22.7 lb), while Trek claims to have the lightest full-suspension electric mountain bike at 15.75 kg (34.72 lb).Those e-bikes are extreme examples of lightweight e-bike design, but Ribble’s newly unveiled Endurance SL e Hero holds its own against them with an impressive weigh-in of 10.5 kg (23.1 lb). While it won’t set a new record, that’s still lighter than plenty of pedal-only bicycles.Ribble achieves that lightweight design with a combination of the minimalist Mahle EBM X35 motor and e-bike system as well as an ultra lightweight carbon fiber frame. The carbon fiber doesn’t end there though – it continues into the handlebar, stem, and wheels as well.That Mahle X35 e-bike system is a popular one for ultra lightweight and high-performance e-bikes, such as those designed by cycling legend Gred LeMond.As you can imagine, shaving off those extra few pounds adds to the price… significantly. The Ribble Endurance SL e Hero is priced at £6,999 (approximately $9,700), though the standard Endurance SL e that weighs slightly more at around 12 kg (26.5 lb) is price at £2,999 (approximately $4,160). And if you’re okay with a comparatively hefty 13 kg (28.6 lb) e-bike, the aluminum-frame Ribble Endurance AL e is priced at a much more reasonable £2,699 (approximately $3,740). Even 13 kg is still quite respectable for an electric road bike.While the fancier and ultra lightweight Ribble Endurance SL e Hero commands such a high price due to its lightweight design, it still features a few extra high-end components such as Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 electronic shifting and tubeless carbon-wheels.And sure, you could still slap a DIY e-bike conversion kit on an Amazon road bike to create a 20 kg (44 lb) ride for barely $900. But anyone wanting to experience these crazy low weights in an e-bike will still have to pay to play, and the entry price isn’t cheap.",ebikes
2021/05/02,"Aventon has long offered some of the sleekest e-bikes available in the realistic every-man’s price range. Until today, the company’s e-bikes all ranged from $1,199 to $1,699. With the launch of the new Aventon Aventure fat tire e-bike, Aventon has managed to expand into the adventure class of e-bikes without seeing a huge price bump.The new Aventon Aventure is priced at $1,899, marking only a slight increase in price from the company’s existing models.But for those extra couple hundred bucks, you get a lot more on your plate.The Aventon Aventure improves upon the Aventon Sinch — the only other fat tire e-bike in Aventon’s lineup — by going full size. The large 26″x4″ fat tires make quick work of sand, snow, dirt, grass, or pavement. Basically anything surface you can think of, a full-size fat tire bike can probably ride it. And since the bike is full-size, you don’t have the limitations of a folding frame or the small diameter wheels that go with it.With the Aventure, the same bike can hop in the bike lane to get you out of the city and then turn off at the trailhead or onto a beach path for more adventurous riding.When an e-bike is equipped with these big tires, you’ll generally want a big motor as well to make sure the bike doesn’t feel sluggish. Aventon has outfitted the Aventure with a 750W continuous motor that pulls a peak power rating of 1,130W.That’s enough for 28 mph (45 km/h) speeds on pedal assist or 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle-only riding.That beefy motor is fed by a 48V 15Ah battery with 720Wh of capacity — or enough for up to 45 miles (72 km) of range, according to the company. Aventon is one of the few e-bike companies that provides real-world range data, and it turns out that the listed 45 mile range figure is actually achieved when using pedal-assist level 2. Riders who drop down into pedal assist level 1 will see an even higher range of 53 miles (85 km), while riders who indulge themselves with higher power in level 5 will see the range dip to 19 miles (30.5 km) while flying at 28 mph (45 km/h). Riding throttle-only at 20 mph (32 km/h) nets you 27 miles (43 km) without using the pedals.I’ve always been impressed that Aventon provides the real world range data for every pedal assist level, plus throttle-only riding. They don’t hide behind “ideal conditions range ratings” or simply advertise the best level 1 pedal-assist range.The battery is also entirely hidden in the frame’s downtube, yet remains removable with a keyed lock.Speaking of the frame, the bike comes in either a step-over or step-thru, and each has multiple size and color options. In a world of one-size-fits-most e-bikes, this level of customization is a much appreciated rarity.Other nice components on the bike include an 8-speed Shimano Acera derailleur, Zoom Forgo 80 mm travel fork, Bengal Ares 3 hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm rotors, full fenders, plus a fancy new color screen with accompanying smartphone app.There’s also a headlight integrated into the handlebars, and a tail light built right into the seat stays on the rear of the frame.Aventon has both front and rear racks designed for the Aventure as well, making it easy to haul more stuff with you on your own adventures.We’ll have a review of the new Aventon Aventure coming up shortly, so keep checking back for that. So far the bike is shaping up to be a win, though, showing that Aventon has been able to successfully take its urban/recreation roots and employ the same level of attention to detail and sleek design chops towards the adventure segment.

2021/05/01,"Electric bicycles are all about putting a smile on your face while taking the pain out of cycling. I’ve seen macho men hop on their first electric bike and roll around giggling like a toddler. And what could be better than sharing that kind of fun with a passenger in an old-fashioned sidecar? Today’s entry in the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week series is just that – an electric bicycle that takes a cue from old-school sidecar motorcycles.And while this series often pokes a bit of good natured fun at some of the weirder Alibaba electric vehicles out there, this is one weird-mobile that I actually want to put in my garage!For a reasonable $1,250 you get this vintage cruiser-style electric bike coupled with a sidecar.The whole getup is powered by a Bafang rear hub motor. There’s a 250W version for those poor suckers in Europe that aren’t allowed to have fun, and there’s a 500W version packing twice the power for our American friends who thrive on excess.The speed varies as well based on location, with a 25 km/h (15.5 mph) limit for anyone who writes dates with the day first, and a high speed 45 km/h (28 mph) thrill ride for those that have a gun in every room of the house plus another in the shower.After you get past the power and speed variants for the European vs American models, the rest is nicely equitable.Battery capacity options start at a measly 360Wh but can be upgraded to 720Wh. An LCD display comes standard on all models and the combined bike/sidecar situation supports a max load of up to 200 kg (440 lb).But the real belle of the ball here of course is that sidecar itself!There are multiple options that include features like a pullover shade for shielding little ones from the harsh afternoon sun, to a barebones basic model simply designed to keep the occupants hands and feet inside the vehicle for the duration of the ride.And I don’t know about you, but the whole thing sure looks a lot safer than that coffin-on-wheels of a sidecar electric drift trike we saw a few months back.You can also choose between a retro designed bike with normal tires or a retro-designed bike with fat tires, which the company conveniently refers to as “Harley Old” and “Harler Fat.”With the number of Harley-Davidson knockoffs floating around, that seems pretty much par for the course.If you’re sitting there all giddy, wallet in hand just waiting for me to give you the confirmation bias that you’re looking for to buy this thing, then keep sitting pretty for another hot minute. While I’ve had great interactions with a lot of Alibaba sellers, this one doesn’t necessarily give me the same Beach Boys cool vibes.The vendor kept blowing me off when I asked for more info on the bikes, and couldn’t even give me shipping info because “the logistics costs fluctuates day by day”. Alright, fine – just give me an estimate for today. Or yesterday. Or whatever, man. I’m trying to make you internet famous here.So while I love just about everything about this awesome sidecar electric bicycle, I’m not saying you should plunk down your hard earned cash on a gamble with this vendor.That being said, I’ve personally bought loads of stuff on Alibaba and her sister site AliExpress. I usually try to find a product where the vendor seems much more eager to help, and then I spend a lot of time communicating to make sure we’re all on the same page, paragraph and sentence.If you want to go your own way and pick up one of these awesome electric trikes, definitely let me know how it goes! And if you happen to stumble upon your own awesomely weird electric vehicle while perusing Alibaba,  drop me a link! It just may wind up in one of my weekly Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week articles. You can find my contact info in my author bio below.Until we meet again next week, consider checking out some of my other awesomely weird Alibaba finds, such as a cheap little solar-powered electric family car, a dangerous-looking electric motorcycle with only one wheel, or an electric horseless carriage fit to take Cinderella to the ball!",ebikes
2021/04/30,"When I think of the bicycle company Specialized, I tend to think of their hardcore road bikes, or perhaps their mountain bikes. They make awesome models of both, though as an e-bike journalist I find myself particularly drawn to their Turbo line of electric road and e-mountain bikes. But until I learned about the company’s Turbo Como line, I didn’t realize how awesome their “Active” line of comfort cruising-around bikes were. And the latest Specialized Turbo Como SL brings a whole new level of approachability (and lightweight design) to the e-bike line.That SL in the Turbo Como SL stands for “super light.”The spandex-clad among us might laugh at the idea of a 45 lb. (20.4 kg) bike being considered lightweight, but they likely don’t realize that electric comfort and cruiser bikes can easily be 50% heavier.Most people can lift a 45 lb. bike, if necessary. Add another 20 pounds to a bulky, awkward-shaped object like that and the percentage of people who can throw such a bike around drops considerably. The Turbo Como SL here though maintains a manageable weight, especially with the inclusion of that nicely placed grab handle in the middle of the bike.But the Turbo Como SL isn’t just about being lightweight, it’s also about providing a high-quality, comfortable ride that offers a low maintenance option for a convenient comfort/utility e-bike.It’s the kind of e-bike you buy when you just want to ride for fun without any worries. You know it’s going to work well every time you hop on and you know it’s going to last for years.Check out my video review below to see this pretty yellow e-bike in action, then keep reading to get into the details.Electric cruiser bikes have never really been a luxury category, and Specialized even shies away from the cruiser label on the Como. They refer to it as part of their “active” line, but it basically fits and rides like the fun, laid-back cruisers we all know and love.The upright seating position and high bars make this likely the most comfortable electric bike in Specialized’s lineup.It’s not overly powerful, but has the oomph riders need when put into a high pedal assist level. I saw peaks in the 400’s of watts several times when I really pushed it, though I tended to keep it in the middle range of pedal assist to ensure that I was doing some honest riding too.When I really pushed it, I could max the bike out at its top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). Let’s just say that the claimed motor power of 240W seems a bit low for a 28 mph e-bike, but we’ll let them put whatever sticker on it they want.Unlike a typical cheap cruiser e-bike, the Specialized Turbo Como SL 5.0 comes loaded with a combination of high-end components and serious utility features.On the component side there’s that custom Specialized mid-drive motor, a Gates belt drive and a Shimano Alfine 8-speed internally geared hub.The custom motor is somehow both physically tiny and highly responsive. When you’re ready, it gives you the power you’re looking for without being overbearing. I actually had the chance to speak with the product lead for Specialized’s Turbo bikes Marco Sonderegger about that motor and why Specialized decided to do their own custom motor. As he explained:“We could have gone the easy route and buy a Bosch system or a complete system from Shimano or another brand. But then you can’t change anything. And what we do is totally different.”And being able to design their own parts and their own power profile definitely makes a difference. The response is super smooth and exactly what you’d expect of a luxury e-bike like this.And since it’d be a shame to pair a loud chain and derailleur with a smooth and quiet motor like that, Specialized used a Gates belt drive and internally geared hub combo, which I’ve said before is probably my favorite drivetrain setup on e-bikes. The combination of mid-drive motors, belt drives, and internally geared hubs means an entirely maintenance-free, no-fuss drivetrain and transmission.And instead of holding back with a 3-speed or 5-speed transmission, Specialized invested in the 8-speed Alfine internally geared hub. On the one hand that’s almost more gears than I think I’d need, but I’m also pedaling around in fairly flat Florida. In hilly San Francisco those extra gear ratios are probably nice to have.On the utility side, the bike is nicely outfitted with a large and sturdy front basket as well as fenders that double as a rear rack for mounting panniers. The basket is designed with slots that perfectly mesh with a bungee cargo net ensure that you can carry large and odd-shaped objects without them bouncing out (remember there’s no suspension here!).The rear rack hides away as part of the fender so you don’t have some cheap-looking rack junking up your rear end, but you still get full pannier support. It’s a slick design that adds invisible utility to the bike.That being said, the rear tail light that is built into the fender consists of just three small LEDs. It’s bright, sure. But I wouldn’t have minded a larger light just to be that much more visible.Lastly, the frame is built with a small cross bar that is nicely balanced to serve as a lift point near the bike’s center of gravity. That makes it easy to grab the bike nice and low to carry it up a quick flight of stairs. No more awkwardly trying to hook the saddle and bars while dragging the tires over every step.All together, the Specialized Turbo Como SL rides and feels like an expensive, premium e-bike. Which is good, because that’s exactly what it is. The 5.0 version that I tested starts at $4,800. That’s a pretty penny, though I think the price is worth it for what you get.Specialized obviously isn’t for everyone. You can get e-bikes for a third of the price that also get you from point A to B. In my opinion, the reason someone would spend extra for a bike like this is for a combination of the super smooth operation and the longevity of the bike. With Specialized designing each part to work together seamlessly, the bike doesn’t feel like a combination of components nor does it carry the usual compromises that leads to. It feels like an e-bike that was designed from the ground up to be a comfortable urban cruiser/utility bike. And to know that your bike is going to last for years is the kind of peace of mind that spending this much money buys you. I could cheap out and get a low-cost cruiser from Amazon, but who knows if the company will be around in several years if I need servicing or a new battery. Of course no one can tell the future, but it doesn’t look like Specialized is going anywhere soon.So while a lot of the e-bike market will unfortunately be priced out of a fancy e-bike like this (myself included), I can definitely see it being worth it for those that have the cash.",ebikes
2021/04/28,"[Ed: first of all, nice color gradient on that logo]Want the fun and utility of a seated electric scooter but without the hassle of a motorcycle license or insurance? Hybrid e-bike/scooters like the Zebra could fit the bill.Electric scooters and mopeds offer a more comfortable seated riding position than a bicycle, yet are easier to mount and offer more utility.The problem is that Vespa-style electric scooters or mopeds usually qualify as motorcycle-level vehicles.The laws vary state to state in the US, but scooters like the CSC Wiz generally require at least a motorcycle license and sometimes even insurance or inspections.But the Zebra is different. Even though it looks like a seated scooter, it actually sports a pair of bicycle pedals — something we like to call vestigial pedals since they don’t really do anything. Sure, you could pedal them, but let’s get real — they’re mostly there to make the Zebra compliant with electric bicycle laws.The fact that the Zebra rides on two wheels, has a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a 750W motor, and has functional pedals means that it is classified as a Class 2 electric bicycle in the US and can ride on pretty much any road or bike lane where pedal bicycles are allowed.Unlike a bicycle, though, the Zebra has a big comfy seat, a rear trunk box, a step-through scooter design with plenty of space for your feet (or for shoving odd-shaped cargo that won’t fit in the trunk), automotive-style LED lighting with turn signals, hydraulic disc brakes, mirrors, etc. All of the models even have a steering column lock, and there’s built-in GPS tracking on the higher-spec units as well — features that are normally only found on motor vehicle-level electric scooters. The Zebra certainly seems to blur the line between e-bikes and e-scooters.While some people might question whether 20 mph (32 km/h) is fast enough for commuter or utility use, keep in mind that 20 mph is the same speed that all Class 2 e-bikes are limited to. So if it works for millions of people riding normal e-bikes, it should work just fine here. Plus, these types of bike/scooter hybrids that are hugely popular all over China are limited to an even slower 15 mph (25 km/h), yet somehow they have become a dominant form of commuter vehicle. So as long as you are sticking to bicycle-friendly roads or bike lanes, the Zebra seems like it has all of the performance of an e-bike, yet packs in those extra features found in larger scooters.And its scooter shape gives it some serious benefits as well. Thanks to its format, it is also capable of hauling more battery. Under the seat, you can fit one or two 48V 26Ah removable batteries, depending on the model chosen. That 1,248 Wh of capacity per battery is way more than you’d find in a typical electric bicycle battery.The entry level and single seater Zebra Z1 gets a range of 35 miles (56 km) and is on sale for $1,795.The next step up gets you the two-seater Zebra ZX1 with a larger 60 mile (97 km) range for a sale price of $2,005.The highest-spec model is the Zebra ZX2. It uses two batteries to offer a 120 mile (193 km) range for a sale price of $2,795.A post shared by Zebra (@zebranow)It’s about time these types of e-bike/scooter hybrids started making their way to the US.They are incredibly popular all over Asia and are the only form of transportation used by many families.The only downside here is the somewhat limited 20 mph speed, but I certainly understand that you can’t go faster without losing the benefit of it technically being an “electric bicycle” — at least as far as the law is concerned.That being said, keep in mind that buzzing a pedal cyclist in a bike line while riding one of these isn’t going to make you many friends. So when you’re sharing the space with actual bicycles, you should definitely give others the right of way and perhaps a wide berth as well.But as long as people ride these responsibly and courteously when in shared spaces, I can see Zebra bikes being a huge benefit. They’ll help reach those stragglers that aren’t ready to give up their car for trips in favor of a pedal bike or e-bike, but that might just go for something that looks a bit more, well, substantial. I love riding seated electric scooters and use one as my daily driver. If more people can discover the joy and utility that electric scooters offer and that gets more cars off of the road, then everyone wins!We’ll be testing one of these Zebras out shortly, so be on the lookout for our full review coming soon!",ebikes
2021/04/26,"Swiss electric bicycle company Stromer has just announced an update to the company’s ST2 line of electric bikes, making the Stromer ST2 better than ever.The Stromer ST2 is the first bike in the company’s lineup to offer a Gates carbon belt drive.These drive systems are prized for their low maintenance, clean operation, silent pedaling, and incredibly long lifespans.The belt drive system is paired with a 5-speed internally geared hub that allows riders to shift from rest.Stromer is one of the few high-end electric bicycle brands to employ a hub motor, or a motor housed in the center of a wheel. The Stromer ST2 features a 750W CYRO hub motor in the rear wheel that powers the bike up to a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). That speed is the legal limit allowed for Class 3 e-bikes in the US. In Europe, that classifies the Stromer ST2 as a speed pedelec.The ST2’s 618 Wh battery is rated by Stromer to achieve a range of over 75 miles (120 km). The company also offers a larger capacity option that can increase the range up to 100 miles (160 km).A full light package on the bike includes daytime running lights as well as both low-beam and high-beam head lights. There’s also a tail light that includes a built-in brake light.The bike features a number of connectivity-based features that use either 3G or Bluetooth to offer ride statistics, over-the-air (OTA) updates and theft deference such as GPS localization and a Smartlock system.The bike also includes Stromer’s cloud-based Stromer OMNI Connect platform that operates on the ST2’s touch display and on the accompanying smartphone app.Rolling on large volume 27.5-inch tires, the commuter e-bike has a bit more cushion under its wheels for a more comfortable ride. Both a suspension fork and a suspension seat post can be added as factory option for those seeking even more comfort in their ride.As Dan Delehanty, general manager, North America at Stromer, explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“Completely redesigned for 2021, the Stromer ST2 e-bike replaces the previous model by forging new paths in terms of features and technology. The first Stromer bike with a Gates Carbon Drive Belt, the ST2 combines the best in power, range, design, digital connectivity, comfort, and safety. Whether you work in an office or remotely, the ST2 delivers a premium riding experience for your commute or recreational outings. The low-maintenance equipment is ideal for daily activities, whatever they may consist of in today’s new normal.”Priced at $5,699, this Swiss e-bike isn’t for the feint of heart – or wallet. Stromer undeniably makes very nice bikes. And there are plenty of nice parts on the new ST2 to help float that MSRP sky high.But at the same time, there are still some head scratchers here. While I’ve never counted myself among the mid-drive elitists and I recognize that hub motors have plenty of advantages, we still don’t normally see them on bikes of this price level. They throw the center of mass of the bike much further back, which is fine as a compromise on a cheaper e-bike, but seems a bit out-of-whack with the $5.7K price tag here.Granted the price is lower than their $10,000 e-bikes, but we’re still looking at a pretty penny here.I do think it’s pretty sweet that they’ve integrated a 5-speed hub transmission with the hub motor though, I’ll give them that.And the fact that the bike is nicely outfitted for commuting is a plus, too.But this price level demands a serious ride, and so I’ll have to save my final judgement on the new Stromer ST2 until I can throw a leg over one and test the ride.",ebikes
2021/04/25,"While bicycles have generally been a “one bike, one rider” type of proposition, electric bicycles flip the script by using motor assist to add extra utility. And a new wave of multi-passenger electric bikes are opening the door for two-up riding that hasn’t typically been possible on unassisted pedal bikes.Sure, you could carry a friend on your pedal bike’s rear rack or perhaps plop your girlfriend down on the handlebars of your cruiser. But good luck powering the two of you up a hill on leg power alone.With utility and moped style electric bikes though, the extra weight (and space) of a passenger is no problem.Of course this requires a fairly high power motor, meaning you won’t be running a moto taxi service on your Specialized electric road bike. But higher power electric bikes such as electric cargo bikes, utility bikes and e-mopeds are now making it a breeze to ditch your car for a bike and still carry a passenger (or two!) around with you.Super73 just added new 2-up seats to the company’s lineup, converting their popular S1, S2 and R-Series electric bicycles from one-seaters to two-seaters.To carry a passenger comfortably you’ll want to add a pair of rear foot pegs – or find an e-bike that comes with them pre-installed.When I reviewed the dual motor Ariel Rider D-Class e-bike, I carried my nephews around on the long bench seat and included foot pegs. Back then the foot pegs were a little weak looking, but the company responded by upgrading to massive cast iron folding pegs on their new models that look like they could support a circus bear.Both the Ariel Rider X-Class and new Grizzly models offer these big rear foot pegs, and the Grizzly even has dual motors plus dual batteries to give you extra power and range for flying up hills with a passenger on board.While the Grizzly is a bit steeper at $2,999 (though worth it for the high power dual motors and dual batteries), the entry-level X-Class gets you rolling with passenger pegs for a cool $1,599, though you’ll want to upgrade to the $89 two-person seat to make the most of those chunky rear foot pegs. Even so, for under $1,700, you’ve got a crazy powerful, full-suspension electric bike capable of carrying two passengers – that’s a lot of utility!Other famous moped-style e-bikes like those from Juiced Bikes also make it easy to carry passengers, though not right out of the box like the Ariel Rider bikes above.The Juiced Scorpion X, HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler 2 models all come with foot peg attachment points on the rear swingarm. For $39 you can add foot pegs to carry a rear passenger.The HyperScrambler 2 comes with a long bench seat perfect for two riders, while the Scorpion series can be upgraded to a longer bench seat. Out of the box, the Scorpion e-bikes have a shorter single-passenger seat that leaves room for the utility rack behind the rider.But it’s not only moped-style e-bikes that are offering the ability to ride 2-up. Electric cargo bikes and utility bikes are also getting in on the action.Tern’s Team Captain Josh Hon once took me for a spin on the rather unassuming looking Tern GSD e-bike, showing me how the throttle-less electric bike had no problem ferrying two adults around. Technically the carrier on the rear was designed for kids, as evidenced by its guards to keep kids from falling off, but it held me just fine.Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes has a pair of passenger-ready e-bikes in its line up.The $1,299 RadRunner electric utility bike has a passenger package option that adds a long padded bench seat, foot pegs and a rear wheel skirt to make sure no calves or feet find their way into the wheel spokes.I’ve personally used the RadRunner to carry my two nephews around, turning the RadRunner into a three-person e-bike. But with two adults, my brother and I have gone 2-up on the bike, showing how it easily carries over 350 lb (160 kg) of riders.For a bit more space, the $1,899 RadWagon electric cargo bike provides the option for an even longer rear bench seat, either foot pegs or running boards and a deck hand accessory that gives the rear passenger a large grab handle to hold on to.The increasing number of passenger-enabled electric bikes serves to further underscore the extreme utility and versatility of e-bikes.While some models are designed for fitness and others for recreation, e-bikes that can carry passengers make it that much easier for commuters to ditch their cars and save money with an electric bicycle.Electric cargo and utility e-bikes might not be able to completely replace a minivan, but they sure can help replace many of the same trips that many people perform with cars.And as e-bike adoption rates continue to climb, we’re all but certain to see more interesting utility offerings in the space.",ebikes
2021/04/21,"Americans are getting closer to a federal tax credit for electric bicycles, a proposal that could be similar in concept to the electric car and motorcycle tax incentives already on the books.Back in February, a new bill was proposed known as the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act.It was introduced by Representatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), and stipulated a 30% tax credit in the US for a purchase of an electric bicycle.The incentive would be capped at a maximum of $1,500 and would apply to electric bicycles priced under $8,000.E-bikes would also need to be limited to 28 mph (45 km/h) and contain “an electric motor of less than 750 watts.” The power rating will likely be updated to read “not more than 750 watts” to better align with current e-bike laws in the US that limit motors to a maximum of 750 watts.Several representatives have signed on as cosponsors to the bill in the last few weeks.The current list of cosponsors includes:So far no Republican lawmakers have signed on to support the bill.The proposed legislation is still in an early stage, currently being reviewed in the House Ways and Means committee. If the committee releases the bill to the House, it could pass with a simple majority vote. It would then go through the same process in the Senate.Assuming the legislation passes in both chambers of Congress, it would then head to President Biden’s desk to await his signature and become law.If you’d like to see the proposed bill become law, reach out to your US representative and ask him or her to support the E-BIKE Act.

2021/04/20,"San Diego-based Juiced Bikes has just officially launched its new electric moped, the Juiced Scorpion X, designed to replace the original Juiced Scorpion and provide several key upgrades.The new model was first unveiled last week, showing off several new improvements to the original Juiced Scorpion moped-style electric bike.Carrying an MSRP of $2,199, Juiced Bikes is launching the Scorpion X at a promotional price of $1,999.The Scorpion X improves upon the original Juiced Scorpion by increasing the power, speed, and range of the bike.As Juiced Bikes founder and CEO Tora Harris explained:“With the Scorpion X, we really wanted to create a more powerful ‘base model’ electric bike. The original Scorpion is an amazing bike, but I thought it was important to take it up a notch with more power, torque, riding range and just a better riding experience. By taking things up a notch, especially with the development of our new, custom Bafang 750-Watt RetroBlade motor, riders get an insane riding experience that we’re incredibly proud of.”The original motor previously found in the base model Scorpion has now been replaced by Juiced’s RetroBlade motor that was custom designed together with Bafang. The motor is also in use on the high-powered Juiced HyperScorpion and Juiced HyperScrambler 2 electric bicycles.The motor helps boost the Scorpion X’s speed up to 28 mph (45 km/h), which is the maximum allowed by law for Class 3 e-bikes. The bike can also be limited to 20 mph (32 km/h) to conform to Class 2 e-bike regulations.While the previous Juiced Scorpion model also carried an advertised top speed of 28 mph, we found in our testing that we often fell a bit short of that speed. The new RetroBlade motor upgrade in the Scorpion X is expected to help boost the power and speed of the updated model.The range rating of the Scorpion X has also been boosted to a maximum of 55 miles (88 km) with pedal assist. That higher range is thanks to a 15% larger battery capacity, increased to a 52V and 15Ah pack (from 13Ah) for a total of 780 Wh. The Scorpion X also gets the HyperScorpion’s ultra-loud horn, key-switch for security, and RelayRack on the rear.It continues to offer the same step-through frame design, full-suspension setup, dual piston hydraulic disc brakes, tall-seat adapter for longer leg riders (the standard seat is capable of supporting riders down to a minimum of 5’2″), oversized headlight, and puncture-resistant street tires.The Juiced Scorpion series of electric bikes has often been imitated but is still seen as one of the best options on the market for high-quality construction that borders on motorbike-level design.To see our own thoughts on other models in this series of moped-style e-bikes, check out our reviews of the HyperScorpion and the HyperScrambler 2.

2021/04/19,"I’ve watched in fascination as Erik Buell’s latest two-wheeler company, Fuell, unveiled and then began deliveries on a high-end electric commuter bike. Now that the company let me borrow a Fuell Flluid for a test ride, I can finally tell you what I think of the bike.Spoiler alert: It’s pretty sweet.Due to a series of tight schedules, the company and I could only align for a few hours, but I made the most of the time.Armed with one Fuell Flluid and one pretty awesome Fuell-branded helmet with built-in face shield, I was off for the races as soon as they rolled the bike out of the van.I even managed to grab enough footage during my testing to put together a fun first ride video.You can check it out below, then keep reading to hear my detailed thoughts on this electric bike built by a motorcycle designer.I’ve ridden a lot of e-bikes, and their quality level has run the gamut. I’ve tested fancy $10K e-bikes and cheap $500 e-bikes. The Fuell Flluid falls in the middle of that range, with a current price of $4,995 – up slightly after pricing pressure in the industry has been forcing prices higher across the board. But the quality of the bike pushes it further up toward the fancy-pants end of that spectrum.The bike was designed by legendary motorcycle builder Erik Buell, and he wasn’t messing around when he chose this nice suite of parts. It’s easy to try and save a few bucks here or there, but the Flluid didn’t skimp.The bike features components like a custom Bofeili mid-drive motor with built-in torque sensor, Gates carbon belt drive, Shimano Alfine 8-speed internally geared hub, ultra-bright LED lighting, double kickstand, Pirelli tires, GPS tracking, built-in keyed rear-wheel lock, suspension seat post, etc. The Fuell Flluid comes fully oaded with this impressive collection of high-end components. These are not cheap parts, and they make a serious difference in both the ride quality and ease of use of the e-bike. The Fuell Flluid doesn’t have a throttle, which keeps it classified as either a Class 1 or Class 3 e-bike, depending on which model you choose.The custom motor features a torque sensor that helps create a comfortable, responsive pedal assist system that basically feels like you’re pedaling a typical bike (albeit a bit of a heavy one). It doesn’t rocket off like a typical throttle e-bike, but the power is palpable if you put it in higher pedal assist. This is definitely an e-bike for people who enjoy the act of cycling though. If you’re searching for a moped, look elsewhere.Complimenting the smooth pedal assist is an equally smooth Gates carbon drive tied into an internally geared rear hub. That Shimano Alfine 8-speed is a thing of beauty. I’m firmly convinced that a mid-drive motor and internally geared hub transmission are pretty much the nicest way to ride an e-bike. And if you can slip a belt instead of a chain in there too, then all the better!Interestingly that seems to be a consensus among motorcycle manufacturers-turned-e-bike-builders. Harley Davidson’s electric bicycles also went with the trifecta of a mid-drive with a Gates belt drive paired with an internally geared hub. Motorcycle manufacturers must know something e-bike companies don’t, or they’re just more focused on the ride experience than the price.Even though the Fuell Flluid retains the pedal feeling of an e-bike, the handling almost feels more like a motorcycle. It’s just so smooth and planted that I feel like I’m riding more of a roadster motorcycle than an e-bike sometimes. Maybe it’s the geometry. Maybe it’s the grippy Pirelli tires. Maybe it’s all the nuances that I’ll never even know exist but that go into the bicycle design process to create that feeling. Whatever it is, the team at Fuell have absolutely nailed the ride quality on this thing. It’s an odd mashup of a 100% bicycle-style ride but the feel of something more planted.Generally speaking, I’m blown away by the ride and the quality of the Fuell Flluid.But of course no e-bike is perfect.Even though the dual batteries give the bike incredible range (helped even further by the lack of throttle), they also make it heaaaavy. I’m talking 36 kg (79 lb) heavy.You feel the weight a bit while you’re riding, but it isn’t a deal breaker. I suspect the higher of the two batteries is what I’m feeling more as it creates a bit higher center of gravity that is more noticeable at slower speeds. But the bigger issue is when maneuvering the bike. I helped Fuell’s guy Robert get the bike in and out of the van. It could be a one man job, but it’s easier with two. The point is this isn’t a lightweight bike so don’t plan on throwing it over your shoulder like a road bike.It’s also still a bit pricey, even if the bike absolutely warrants the price. I think the price is fair, but it is still going to price out those who aren’t ready to spend what is likely a good chunk of a month’s pay on an e-bike.But if you have the cash and want to invest in a high-quality e-bike that will withstand the test of time, and that rides like a dream, the Feull Flluid definitely gets two thumbs up from me.I wasn’t sure what to expect when I heard Erik Buell would build an electric bicycle, but I should have known that he’d knock it out of the park.",ebikes
2021/04/19,"Sur Ron’s latest electric motorbike, the high-powered Storm Bee, is now coming up on nearly two years since the initial debut. We still don’t know exactly when it will finally make it into the hands of reservation holders, but we’re at least getting to see some real-world testing and an up-close look at the bike.The latest test ride and walk-around come to us from the popular Australian electric bike channel BrunoPOWEEER.In the video, Bruno is joined by the Australian Sur Ron dealer Adam Brennan, one of the first Sur Ron dealers ever outside of China.I’d say the two put the bike through its paces, but it was more like a round of shenanigans — which, of course, is perhaps even more fun.Check out his video below, then read on for the details.Oh and fair warning: Bruno is a high energy guy!The bike that Bruno tested is apparently the street-legal version of the Storm Bee. At around 130 kg (287 lb), the street-legal model is around 15 kg (33 lb) heavier than the motorcross version.That extra weight comes from heavier wheels and tires, an added light package, a license plate holder, and other additions that are required for homologation.The giant 30 kg (66 lb) battery is removable for charging. That also means you can take nearly a quarter of the bike’s weight off, which might be helpful for maneuvering the bike into a vehicle or up a ramp.The Sur Ron Storm Bee’s 22.5 kW motor provides the bike with a final output of 520 Nm. The motor is around 4x more powerful than the motor on the smaller Sur Ron Light Bee. It is the same diameter as the smaller bike’s motor but over twice as wide. The bike comes with three power modes and includes a turbo button that can provide around 30 seconds of peak power.To make maneuvering the bike even easier, it also includes a reverse mode.Traction control is available on the street-legal version as well, which uses Active Spin Reduction (ASR) to monitor any difference in wheel speed from front to rear and chop power to correct the spin. Interestingly, the bike has been future-proofed with a controller that can handle 150V, even though the Storm Bee only has a 90V battery currently. The designers increased the voltage capacity of the controller so that if battery advancements allow for a higher voltage battery to be created in a few years that will still fit within the same battery compartment size, the Storm Bee will be able to accept the upgrade.The Australian Sur Ron dealer explained that he already has a long list of customers waiting for the Storm Bee to arrive in Australia and New Zealand, though this production prototype doesn’t necessarily mean that their production bikes are coming anytime soon.We reached out to the US Sur Ron dealer and founder of Luna Cycle, Eric Hicks, who confirmed that there is no set date for the bikes to become available yet. He explained that they’re still waiting on Sur Ron but that Luna Cycle will carry the Storm Bee in the US once it is available.",ebikes
2021/04/18,"A San Francisco woman has learned firsthand that electric bicycles aren’t just for recreation; they also make efficient and cost-effective alternatives to typical transportation like personal cars.That’s exactly what Maureen Persico has discovered after she made the switch, though e-biking wasn’t part of her original plan.In 2014, her car was totaled when she was hit by an uninsured driver.Her insurance wasn’t enough to cover the cost of a replacement car, so she had the idea to try switching to an electric bicycle instead.She had already been increasingly involved in cycling, having taken it up after her pregnancy as a way to get back into shape as well as reduce her own impact on the environment by leaving her car in the garage more often.But now that her family was without a car, she and her husband decided to see how long they could go without it.Maureen used the insurance money from the accident to purchase an electric bicycle. That was seven years ago, and they have yet to get another car.It’s my car(e) free anniversary.  7 years ago today our family ditched the car and bought an electric bike from @newwheel pic.twitter.com/auiRv2ycJ3They use their e-bike to perform most of the same trips they used to do in the car, even dropping their son off at school. There’s a large hill on the way, so Maureen benefits from the electric assist to help power the two of them up and over the hill.And it doesn’t appear that the smaller form factor of an electric bicycle has limited Maureen’s ability to move about the city or carry cargo with her.Armed with a set of bike panniers, bike racks, and some obvious ingenuity, she has done some pretty impressive utility riding.LOL!  In collaboration with nonprofit @SCRAPSF I delivered art supplies to school and nonprofits throughout hilly San Francisco using my electric bike.  I’m in my 50’s with arthritis in my knees. pic.twitter.com/IS3k8AtmWGMaureen estimates that she’s saved over $50,000 in the last seven years by not owning a car. That matches with AAA’s data that suggests car ownership in the US costs around $700 per month on average.Maureen explained to SFGate’s Tess McLean that she still occasionally rents a car when they need one for road trips or other occasional tasks that can’t be performed on the electric bicycle.But these days, there are so many different types of electric bicycles, including electric cargo bikes that can carry several passengers or hundreds of pounds of cargo, that more and more people are going totally carless in favor of e-bikes.Electric bicycle sales have skyrocketed over the last year, with the COVID-19 pandemic further fueling the already rapidly-growing e-bike industry.Now, a new federal tax incentive program is trying to help more people like Maureen purchase an electric bike to reduce or replace their car use.If the pending E-BIKE Act passes, it would provide a 30% tax credit for an electric bicycle purchase in the US, up to a maximum credit of $1,500.Outside the US, e-bike incentives are much more common. Some European countries already offer grants for an e-bike purchase in exchange for trading in an old car. France is also considering this type of incentive, with the current plan offering up to $3,000 towards an e-bike purchase in exchange for trading in an old car for scrap.",ebikes
2021/04/16,"A new personal electric vehicle company has just debuted, joining a segment that has seen impressive growth lately. The aptly named X Mobility startup is already showing off a wide range of light electric vehicles.The first three products that X Mobility has rolled out include an electric bicycle, e-scooter, and e-skateboard.None of the three are high-power, but that helps them all achieve relatively low price points.The company’s first e-bike model is a 20-inch folding electric bike.It comes outfitted with a 350W rear hub motor that propels the bike up to a top speed of 15 mph (25 km/h). The bike doesn’t sport too many extra creature comforts or fancy features outside of the included fenders, but it does fold compactly to make it easier to store under a desk at work or carry onto a train.The small 187 Wh uses its compact size to neatly hide itself in the frame tubes, making it hard to tell from a quick glance that the H01 is anything other than a typical folding bike. With a promotional sale price of $869, X Mobility appears to be competing on cost. How will it stack up against other folding e-bikes in its price class? That remains to be seen.For those that like to be a bit more nimble on their feet during a morning commute or pleasure ride, X Mobility is also showing off its M1 electric skateboard and i1 electric scooter.Priced at $539, the M1 electric skateboard uses a pair of 300W hub motors and a 187 Wh battery to reach a top speed of 22 mph (35 km/h).It’s also outfitted with a handle in the deck to make it easier to carry when not riding.The i1 electric scooter is only slightly more expensive at $599. It features a sleeker design than many of the basic electric scooters we’ve seen before.A 300W hub motor is combined with a 270 Wh battery to give the i1 a top speed of 15 mph (25 km/h).While X Mobility has started by offering its smaller electric scooter, e-bike, and e-skateboard, the company’s unreleased products sound even more tempting.An electric moped known as the Z1 (not to be confused with the Super73 Z1) and a pair of electric motorcycles badged as the T1 and T2 haven’t been launched yet, though we can see their design renderings.We don’t have any word on their tech specs or an estimate for the release date just yet. But the designs indicate that X Mobility has larger aspirations than just low-cost electric mobility devices.Such an expansion wouldn’t be without precedent. SONDORS began as an ultra low-cost electric bicycle company that then expanded into electric mopeds and higher-quality e-bikes before recently unveiling an electric motorcycle known as the Metacycle.",ebikes
2021/04/14,"Cash-for-clunker style programs that offer an incentive to swap an old gas-powered car for a new electric bicycle are gaining steam across Europe.The latest country to hop on the electric bike rebate bandwagon is France.A new proposal would see French citizens offered €2,500 (USD $2,991) toward the purchase of a new electric bicycle. That would go a long way toward the purchase of an electric bicycle, especially since most European e-bikes are more expensive than imported models.To receive the credit, new riders will have to surrender an old gas-powered car to be scrapped.The goal of the legislation is two-fold. Replacing old, inefficient gas-powered vehicles with zero-emission electric bicycles will help reduce transportation-based carbon emissions in France. At the same time, the smaller e-bikes free up space on French roads, reducing traffic and congestion for everyone.The €2,500 grant is quite high, presenting several possibilities for new riders. French-made electric bicycles like some of Peugeot’s new models can be purchased for €2,500, which would allow riders to get a free e-bike out of the deal. But a single car trade-in could also buy a pair of even more affordably priced imported e-bikes, turning a single car family into a two e-bike family.More likely, a two-car family could become a one car and two e-bike family, as many households still need a car for longer distance trips or when carrying more cargo – though cargo e-bikes may be able to help there.The proposal hasn’t quite made it into law yet though.French lawmakers have approved the measure in a preliminary vote, where it was added as an amendment to an existing draft climate bill, according to Reuters.The new program is gaining support on the street. As the president of the French Federation of Bicycle Users (FUB) Olivier Schneider explained:“For the first time it is recognized that the solution is not to make cars greener, but simply to reduce their number.”Of course this wouldn’t exactly be the “first” time, as programs like this have been instituted elsewhere in the EU.Late last year we covered a similar program that was rolled out in Lithuania.There the cash-for-clunkers program was spearheaded by Lithuania‘s Environmental Project Management Agency (APVA).The program began in the summer of 2020 with a budget of €8 million.To qualify, citizens were able to apply for and then receive a grant of up to €1,000 (nearly USD $1,200) for the purchase of a new electric bicycle, bicycle, e-scooter, e-moped, e-motorcycle, or even public transportation credits, after exchanging their old vehicle.In fact, many of the older cars being traded in turned out to be worth less than €1,000, meaning their owners ultimately came out ahead on the deal even before factoring in the additional savings on everything from car insurance to gasoline and parking permits.With the French program offering 2.5x the trade-in value, it is even more likely that those who take advantage of it will come out far ahead financially even before factoring in those additional savings.",ebikes
2021/04/14,"Ampler Bikes has just released its latest sales figures as well as its plans to continue its European expansion in order to grow its e-bike market.The Estonian-based company produces a range of electric bicycles focused on commuter roles. Ampler’s electric bikes are well known for their combination of lightweight designs and upper-tier bicycle components. The bikes are also so stealthy that they don’t even look like electric bikes, as you can see in the image above.New figures released by the company show that Ampler grew its revenue by 115% year-over-year in 2020 – a year that saw massive growth in e-bike adoption around the world.Germany is the largest market for Ampler, and revenue in that country alone grew by 136% in 2020. Demand was driven largely by a significant shift away from public transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic.At a time when many companies were forced to lay off much of their staff, Ampler grew its headcount from 45 to 85 between the company’s German and Estonian offices. Ampler claims it plans to double that number by the end of this year.Ampler has plans to bolster its impressive growth by expanding its European operations, as the company explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“Ampler intends to sustain its fast growth rate in Germany while expanding in other markets, such as Switzerland and the Netherlands where the company has plans to open flagship stores in 2021.”Ampler’s second German showroom was opened last spring in Cologne, and the company appears intent on growing its physical retail space as it eyes a return of customers to physical storefronts.Even so, one of Ampler’s biggest advantages during the pandemic was that it also operated a direct-to-consumer (D2C) model. The company reported that around 90% of its revenue was generated from sales on its website. With shutdowns across Europe often forcing showrooms to close, the company was able to continue selling and delivering e-bikes via its D2C model.The entire electric bicycle industry has faced growing problems over the last year, ranging from pressure to raise prices to a shortage in customer service as e-bike sales skyrocketed.But Ampler’s CEO and cofounder Ardo Kaurit is still optimistic about the company’s outlook:“We believe in fast paced but sustainable growth. Although the bicycle industry in general will most likely continue to face challenges in terms of frame and component availability in 2021, we believe in our set-up.”Ampler has also been expanding its operations on other fronts, including a new video series about the cycling industry and preparing to build a new carbon-neutral factory in Estonia, expected to begin construction later this year to replace the company’s current Tallinn factory.By building its e-bikes locally in Estonia, Ampler has been able to maintain a level of quality control that isn’t possible with overseas manufacturing.We tested out the Ampler Stellar late last year, a beautifully built electric city bike, and the quality is quite obvious. You can see that bike in my review video below.",ebikes
2021/04/12,"One of the most common uses for electric bicycles is as an alternative urban transport vehicle. Why drive a 3,000 lb car when a 60 lb electric bike can move you through the city quicker and cheaper? But unlike typical metro e-bikes, urban e-mountain bikes like the e-JOE ONYX add a bit of sportiness to the mix.We’ve covered the concept of urban electric mountain bikes before.They aren’t truly mountain bikes, they just borrow some of the geometry and ruggedness to better take on the urban jungle.The e-JOE ONYX is a great example, as it combines a sporty mountain bike-style frame with utility features needed for a proper urban commuter e-bike, and then throws in a bit of comfort as well.See it all in my video review below. Then keep reading for my detailed thoughts on this e-bike mashup.Even though the e-JOE ONYX looks like it’s hiding a mid-drive motor down by the pedals, don’t be fooled.That seems to be a decoy (or rather a convenient place to stuff the controller and wiring). Instead, you’ll find a 750W continuous and 1,000W peak MXUS hub motor in the rear.But I’ll give the company props for the side covers that try to give the appearance of the mid-drive motor and make the bike look a bit fancier than it really is. Nice play.Even with an old-school hub motor, the bike is quite peppy. The 1,000 watts of peak power send the e-JOE ONYX scooting right up to 25 mph (40 km/h) without a problem. There’s a throttle for those that need it as well as decently responsive pedal assist for anyone in search of an honest workout. Though with five levels of pedal assist, riders can choose anywhere from serious fitness riding on one end or high electric assist on the other end.I also liked that the pedal assist levels also control the throttle intensity. A low PAS level also means the throttle power is limited, while a high PAS level gives full power when you apply the throttle. There are times when a lighter touch is nice, especially with a 1,000W peak motor, and so this is a good feature to have.As a commuter bike, the powerful motor is handy for zipping around the city. While I enjoy the pedal assist to keep me in tune with my bicycle roots, the throttle definitely comes in handy when I need a quick burst of speed or I just feel a bit lazy at the end of the day.The throttle is mounted on swept-back handlebars that lure you into a false sense of cruiser security. This isn’t a cruiser bike by any means, but the cruiser bars do give it a more upright ride than a typical mountain bike. And with the front suspension, the bike is – dare I say – even quite comfortable for a sporty bike.“Powerful” and “cruiser” don’t normally go together in the same sentence, at least not in the e-bike world. But the mashup of parts work well here and combine to create a sprightly, fun, and easygoing ride.But the e-JOE ONYX isn’t designed to be a leisure or recreational e-bike, even if it can certainly dabble in those areas. It’s meant for commuters and comes with the utility for that role. Included with the bike are a pair of fenders, a rear rack, and built-in lights.That trifecta of necessary commuter components means you won’t have to start searching around for accessories to add to your bike, as the important ones are all right there. You could easily add a set of panniers to the rack and have a sporty e-bike that works as a grocery getter as well. You’ll be hopping curbs on your way to Trader Joe’s, then sticking to the smooth bike lanes on the way home to get your eggs home intact.A few of the choices had me scratching my head, though. This isn’t a low-end e-bike, as evidenced by parts like the nice hydraulic disk brakes. We’ve reviewed e-JOE e-bikes before, and they make some nice models. But then they went and slapped a pair of plastic pedals on this otherwise fairly nice e-bike. Come on, guys… give me some legit alloy pedals. These plastic ones may work fine but feel a bit cheap to me.Interestingly, the company splurged in other areas. The bike arrives almost entirely assembled, and that requires a much larger box than most e-bikes. Many companies offer free shipping on their e-bikes and thus try to cut their own shipping costs as much as possible by disassembling the bike to fit in a smaller box. That leaves the user having to bolt together more components after unboxing.Even though e-JOE also offers free shipping, the bike arrives in nearly completed assembled form. The giant box must cost a fortune to ship, especially since they use a freight forwarder instead of shipping by Fedex or UPS. That also means the box arrives in much better condition since it doesn’t come from a UPS driver slowing down while he kicks it out of the van near the end of your driveway.Just for fun, I took the e-JOE ONYX out of its element for a bit of trail riding to see how it would do.I was pleasantly surprised by the bike. The cruiser bars are a bit new to me for off-road riding, where I generally prefer straight bars, but the bike held its own on some sandy double track. It was sliding around a bit, too, but that’s to be expected with urban-optimized tires that are designed more for splashing through a city puddle than cutting corners in dirt.The front suspension is not a high-end fork but it works just fine for my recreational riding needs. And again, this bike is really meant more for urban use, so the fact that it handled a bit of off-road riding just fine was a nice surprise.While the e-JOE ONYX’s MSRP of $2,199 is a bit on the high end, it’s on sale for $1,799, which feels like a great price to me.Between the hydraulic disk brakes, suspension, built-in lighting and powerful motor, not to mention a nicely integrated 672 Wh battery, there are plenty of components that place the bike a cut above the many budget-level e-bikes out there.And with free shipping in the US, there aren’t any extra hidden costs to worry about, either.While the bike doesn’t blow me away with fancy design or high-tech features like a companion app (or even a display that is big enough to read while bouncing over potholes), it works great as an urban commuter with a bit of extra sportiness and comfort thrown in for good measure.If you’re the kind of rider that enjoys the fun ride of a recreational bike like a RadRover but want narrower tires that turn it into a better urban assault e-bike, the e-JOE ONYX could be a great choice for you.If you’re mostly in the market for an electric mountain bike that can also do some commuter work, I’d say look elsewhere.",ebikes
2021/04/09,"Juiced Bikes quietly dropped the original Scorpion electric moped from the company’s site earlier this week, replacing it today with the updated Juiced Scorpion X.The new version upgrades the iconic electric moped with key performance enhancements.Built on the same full-suspension frame as the original Scorpion, the new Scorpion X comes with the more powerful Retroblade motor originally developed for the HyperScorpion.The Juiced HyperScorpion is something of a big brother to the Scorpion, offering a significant upgrade in performance.Now the Juiced Scorpion X seems to split the difference between the original Scorpion and the high-performance HyperScorpion.In addition to the more powerful Retroblade motor, which is rated at a nominal 750W but puts out even higher peak power, the Scorpion X also receives a larger battery.The new 52V 15Ah battery offers 780 Wh and comes with a maximum range rating of up to 55 miles (88 km). That maximum range is based on the bike’s pedal assist mode, and throttle-only operation is likely to return a reduced range figure.The pedal assist experience on the Scorpion X also gets an upgrade, with the new model featuring both torque and cadence-based sensors. That results in a smoother application of pedal assist and more responsive pedal-based performance. E-bikes that rely solely on cadence-based sensors usually have telltale lag in the pedal assist performance because the sensors have to wait to determine how fast the pedals are turning.Torque sensors can determine nearly instantaneous pedal input based solely on the force the rider applies to the pedals.The Scorpion X comes with an advertised top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). That’s the same speed as the original Scorpion claimed, though in our testing we found that it was hard to maintain the upper end of that top without significant pedaling. The Scorpion X’s higher power motor is likely to result in greater ease maintaining the claimed top speed.Other upgrades include a new 8-speed Shimano transmission with a 56T-11T rear cassette for easier pedaling at higher speeds and a 100 db electronic horn borrowed from the HyperScorpion as well.Like the original Scorpion, the new Juiced Scorpion X will be available in either blue or black. Orders will open on April 20. While the Scorpion X carries an MSRP of $2,100, it will start on sale at a discounted price of $1,999. Deliveries are expected to begin by late April.",ebikes
2021/04/06,"San Diego-based Juiced Bikes is a leader in the affordably priced performance e-bike category, and it looks like the company has an interesting new e-bike up its sleeve.That’s what we’re seeing from a new image shared minutes ago on the company’s social media profiles.The image is a photograph taken from above that shows an electric bike with a rider parked over a large “X” drawn in the sand.The company invited speculation about the upcoming new model in the teaser’s caption:Who’s ready for an epic new #ebike? Any guesses on the name of our new masterpiece?You can see it for yourself in the company’s Twitter post below.Who's ready for an epic new #ebike? 💥 Any guesses on the name of our new masterpiece? #ebike #NEW #electricbike pic.twitter.com/DR4J7XeGV5Zooming in on the image provides us with a few more clues regarding the new e-bike.We can easily see the bike sports fat tires, which Juiced Bikes includes on its off-road and moto-styled e-bikes like the RipCurrent, Scrambler, and Scorpion lines.There’s also a double crown fork, which is more commonly found on motorcycles than bicycles, but is present on both the HyperScrambler 2 and Scorpion models.We can also see a giant round headlight, wide frame tubes, and what appears to be a wide saddle with very little taper, all of which confirm something similar to the construction and load-out of the HyperScrambler 2 or HyperScorpion.Missing are a pair of mirrors, though, which are included on both aforementioned bikes.The Juiced Scorpion also lacks mirrors, and looks the most similar to the bike in the image, right down to the space for a rack behind the rider. So could the Juiced Scorpion be getting a big brother?Or is Juiced looking to bridge the gap between the base Scrambler line and the Scorpion line with a new type of electric mini-bike?Or is this simply a totally new e-bike that seems to borrow the fork, headlight, and saddle of the Scorpion?Who knows? We’ll have to wait for more info from Juiced Bikes to find out for sure. Until then, join me in the comment section and let’s speculate about what the Juiced gang is cooking up out there in San Diego!",ebikes
2021/04/06,"The Xion CyberX electric moped has just launched today, offering up a high-speed and long-range electric two-wheeler at a price we rarely see in this industry.Developed by San Diego-based Xion Bike, the CyberX is powered by a 5,000W (6.7 hp) mid-drive motor. That motor is paired with a set of pedals to offer pedal assist, though don’t expect to add much useful pedaling when you approach the bike’s top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h).A 72V and 32Ah battery offers a maximum of 100 miles (160 km) of range, but the fine print says that’s with pedal assist. Chugging along on throttle-only at 20 mph (32 km/h) reportedly nets a 75-mile (120 km) range, and full-throttle is listed at “up to” 50 miles (80 km) of range. A 2.3 kWh pack offering 50 miles of range at 50 mph sounds like a fantasy, so we’ll believe that when we see it. Even if the range rating is a bit optimistic, the bike still packs in a lot of interesting features. In addition to the mid-drive motor and belt drive setup – two features almost never seen in electric mopeds – the Xion CyberX includes full suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, motorcycle tires, powder-coated frame, a long seat for two riders and a max capacity of 500 lb (227 kg). It’s even available in three sizes to fit riders ranging from 4’11” to 6’7″ (150 to 200 cm).The bike also sports laser-cut LED-light panels on the sides that can be customized during the ordering process for an extra fee – or riders can choose from a number of eye-catching stock patterns.Xion says the CyberX is made in the US, and the company’s founder Ali Horuz has experience building electric pedicabs in the US. The bike is likely a combination of globally sourced parts, including many US parts, with final assembly performed in the US. Electric dirt bike production in the US isn’t unheard of, but it usually still involves a number of parts made overseas due to a lack of US production of components such as electric motors.It’s both. Or neither.The truest definition of this thing would be an electric moped.But by offering a “Street” mode that limits the power to 750W and the speed to 28 mph (45 km/h), Xion classifies the CyberX as an electric bike that doesn’t require a license.They even go so far as to say it is allowed on mountain bike trails thanks to its e-bike classification. That’s… an iffy statement. First of all, many mountain bike trails are either off-limits to e-bikes or only allow Class 1 e-bikes (no throttle, top speed of 20 mph on pedal assist). Secondly, there’s nothing to stop a rider from opening up Race Mode on a trail. Xion even describes the CyberX as a bike that “…gives you comfortable everyday commutes and does serious damage on a sandpit or trail.” So yeah, that serious damage isn’t going to be welcome on any mountain bike trail I’ve ever ridden.Xion seems to be pitching to the dirt bike crowd as well, which makes a lot more sense to me.The CyberX has the power and speed to keep up with plenty of dirt bikes, and Xion explains how its low-maintenance design compared to a gas-powered dirt bike makes it a much better choice for riders who want to spend more time in the saddle and less time fixing their bike.And compared to other electric dirt bikes or e-mopeds, the CyberX is actually quite affordable.Its $3,699 price undercuts the infamous ONYX RCR electric moped with the DRT off-road kit by $800.Xion also makes a strong case for the CyberX as a commuter vehicle. With the high-visibility lighting surrounding the bike, it certainly makes it easy to see at night.During the day, the combination of high speeds and large battery offer plenty of utility for commuters. And the bike even comes with a VIN and manufacturer’s certificate of origin that should allow riders to register it as a motorcycle or moped in their state, if necessary.You can even customize the bike’s frame and seat color, in addition to the customizable LED side panels.The CyberX might not rival the SONDORS Metacycle for specs, but it comes in at a fair bit cheaper.If you thought this all sounded a bit too good to be true, then you probably smelled a catch coming.Technically the bikes don’t exist yet – the company is pre-selling them on Indiegogo. While that might make some people run for the hills, plenty of companies have gotten their start with e-bikes on crowdfunding sites. Industry leader ONYX first offered the RCR as an Indiegogo project and even heavyweight Rad Power Bikes got its start on Kickstarter.That being said, crowdfunding campaigns do carry more risk than buying a bike from a dealership, so you’ll need to know that going in. If you’re prepared to wait, Xion says they’ll begin shipping the main CyberX in October of this year, though you can grab one of the early VIP bikes with estimated July shipping.",ebikes
2021/04/06,"Diamondback has just announced the launch of its first-ever electric bikes as part of the company’s spring 2021 lineup.Diamondback is owned by parent company Alta Cycling, which has already offered electric bicycles through its other brands including Haibike, Raleigh, and IZIP.Now Diamondback is going electric and getting its first four battery-assisted models.The new e-bikes are designed for the pavement and cover a range of commuter and road bike roles.As Alta Cycling’s VP of product development Michael Brown explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“It has been incredibly exciting to see our hard work, time spent and energy expended come to fruition with this launch. Our four new e-bikes will hit a sweet spot in the Diamondback lineup, with a solid combination of high performing components, a streamlined design and unmatched versatility. With options for a wide variety of users, in terms of both end-use and price point, we’re really pleased that these bikes will be at the forefront of Diamondback’s foray into the e-bike market.”The Diamondback Response is a Class 3 e-bike offering a maximum assisted-speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).That speed is capable thanks to the inclusion of a Bosch Performance Line Speed mid-drive motor.A Shimano 10-speed drivetrain and Magura hydraulic disc brakes help get the bike rolling quickly and bring it back down to zero.The bike wears plus-size Schwalbe tires mounted on tubeless compatible 27.5-inch wheels, which Diamondback claims gives it proper pavement traction while still offering gravel-ready riding.Riders who do choose to head off the beaten path will be happy to have that 120mm travel RockShox Judy Gold fork up front.The Diamondback Response is priced at $4,100.The Diamondback Union 1 is designed for more pure-urban riding as a city commuter e-bike.Also rocking the Bosch Performance Line Speed motor and a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), this Class 3 e-bike is built on an aluminum frame and features internal cable routing. No more snagging your cables on other bikes in the rack!The on-board Bosch Purion display will help riders keep track of how much of that 400 Wh battery capacity remains along with other ride parameters. Additional features include a 10-speed Shimano drivetrain, Tektro hydraulic disc brakes, wide 27.5-in tires and an included rack and fenders. The Diamondback Union 1 is priced at $3,500.The Diamondback Union 2 upgrades the Union line with a bit more of everything.The 400Wh battery is boosted by 25% to a 500Wh pack.An upgraded Bosch Kiox display provides a color screen with more rider data and offers Bluetooth compatibility with heart rate monitors.Other features included upgraded Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and the inclusion of built-in LED lighting. Though that begs the question of why the $3,500 Union 1 commuter e-bike didn’t already have LED lighting, especially if an $899 e-bike does.Either way, for a cool $4,100, the Diamondback Union 2 could in your garage.The Diamondback Current electric bicycle (not to be confused with the Priority Current electric bicycle) offers a dropbar setup and rolls on Maxxis Rambler 700x40c tires.It sports a 500Wh battery paired with the same Bosch motor to reach Class 3 speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). An 11-speed Shimano drivetrain is sure to please more hardcore road bikers that prefer a wider range of gear ratios to choose from.The Diamondback Current is priced at $4,100.Diamondback is marketing its new line of electric bicycles under a campaign known as “Get Amped.” You can see the company’s launch video below, which the company describes as, “Paying homage to the electric guitar and the rich rock and roll history in its hometown of Seattle, Diamondback is switching things up from acoustic bikes to new electric rockstars!”The video has more cuts than that Liam Neeson jumping over a fence scene, but seems to get the commuter-oriented message across.",ebikes
2021/04/05,"As the old adage goes, “Good, fast, cheap. Pick two.” While that’s largely been the case in the electric bicycle world, the Himiway Escape may just break the mold and offer up the elusive trifecta.If the Himiway Escape electric moped looks familiar, that’s because you’ve seen it before on Electrek in slightly different form.The company will likely refuse to confirm or deny this, but it basically looks almost identical to the famous Juiced Scorpion electric moped.It’s an obvious copycat of the Scorpion’s popular and successful design, but anyone can copy an e-bike’s appearance. What we want to know is, How well does the bike perform?I’ve got all the answers and more in my video review below. Check it out to see the Himiway Escape in action, and then read on for my full thoughts on this e-bike.Let’s first look at the e-bike on its own and see how it stands up.The Himiway Escape is of course a moped-style electric bike. That means it has a non-adjustable seat. It fit me great at my 5’7″ (170 cm) height, and Himiway says the height range for best fit is 5’2″ to 6’4″ (157.5 cm to 193 cm). I’m guessing, though, that folks on the very upper end of that range are going to find the bike a bit cramped. With a bench-style seat, you can always scoot back a bit for more legroom and reach.The seat tapers toward the front that helps make the Escape a bit better for pedaling, but this is still not a super pedal-friendly e-bike. You can absolutely do it, and the pedal assist works just fine. But you aren’t going to be at the optimum seat height for pedaling and it may become uncomfortable if you pedal for long periods of time. You’ll find your knees come up a lot higher than you expect on most typical diamond-frame bikes. For those that really want to pedal, the Himiway Cruiser that we also tested is much more of a pedal-friendly fat tire e-bike.These moped-style e-bikes are best used with a throttle, though, as they really feel like mini motorcycles. They’re mopeds in the truest sense of the word. Those wide tires make it tons of fun to lean hard into turns.The throttle response is great and the acceleration off the line is powerful. When they tell you “750W,” you’re getting a true 750W and then some. The higher-end acceleration isn’t nearly as good, and the power tapers off in mid-teens and low 20s of mph, but the power is still there.Out of the box, the Himiway Escape carries a 22 mph (35 km/h) speed limit. You can unlock higher speeds in the display and blast up to 28 mph (45 km/h) or higher, but that’s on you. Himiway sends it to you in almost Class 2-legal shape. You can also lower the speed limit down to 20 mph (32 km/h) to make it a truly Class 2 e-bike.Also keep in mind that higher speeds eat into the battery more quickly. While Himiway says the range is 45+ miles (70+ km), you’d have to do some serious pedal assist to reach that. If you’re heavy on the throttle and only occasionally pedal, 25-30 miles (40-50 km) is more likely.The suspension isn’t high end but it works just fine for typical urban commuting scenarios. The rear suspension is even slightly adjustable, meaning you can tune it a bit if you’re on the higher end of the 150 kg (330 lb) weight limit of the bike.And I must say that I’m quite happy with the few accessories you get included. The rear rack with its wooden platform is classy and useful, the lights are bright and add to the safety (especially that big headlight), and the fenders are broad enough to actually provide good coverage. You also get a Himiway baseball cap, which is kind of fun, I guess.So judging the Himiway Escape on its own, it’s actually a pretty darned decent e-bike. The build quality feels just fine, even if it’s not fancy. The power is palpable. The range is decent, though not spectacular. The suspension is pretty good. The hydraulic disc brakes are powerful and give me the confidence to bring this 41 kg (92 lb) e-bike to a stop quickly. Everything about it is surprisingly good.I say “surprisingly” because this brings me back around to the copycat nature of the e-bike. It’s of course a Juiced Scorpion knockoff, and I expected it to suffer in quality the way most knockoff products do, but it doesn’t.It lacks some of the attention to detail that you get with Juiced. For one, the packaging wasn’t nearly as good and the bike arrived with several scuffs on the paint. Juiced, on the other hand, literally threw their Scorpions around the factory in the boxes to find any weak point in the packaging and ensured they arrive in perfect shape.Some parts are a downgrade, like the lack of a dual crown fork up front.I’m also guessing that several of the components aren’t up to the same quality standards as a company like Juiced. The motor looks fine, but Juiced also worked with Bafang to develop their own motor for the Scorpion, and the Scorpion also has a larger, brighter headlight. So there are still several details like those where Himiway can’t compete.But on the other hand, the Himiway Escape actually has some advantages over the Scorpion as well. I prefer the nice large display to the Scorpion’s small display, and I’d even say the Escape has higher top-end speed, though only in unlocked mode. While the Scorpion is likely the more refined of the two, the Escape actually brings a few things to the table that go above and beyond the e-bike it copied.The Juiced Scorpion is priced at $1,799 (after a recent price hike that hit much of the industry) while the Himiway Escape undercuts it by $100 at $1,699. Knockoffs are usually a fair bit cheaper, but the Himiway Escape seems to offer a good-enough e-bike with enough extra features to warrant just a small discount. If I had to bet on which one would last longer, I’d go with the Scorpion. But if I wanted a faster ride, the Himiway Escape is still very tempting.Ultimately the right choice is subjective and depends entirely on what you’re looking for in an e-bike. Let’s hear what you think in the comment section below!",ebikes
2021/04/01,"I first found my way into electric bicycles over 10 years ago as a form of alternative urban transportation. But lately I’ve been getting more into gravel riding for fitness. And in my never-ending quest to find more affordable ways to help get people onto their first electric bicycle, I decided to take a value-priced e-bike on a gravel ride to see how it would go. If you’re not already familiar, gravel bikes or gravel riding make up one of the more increasingly popular trends in cycling.Gravel riding combines road cycling and mountain biking, usually consisting of longer rides over unpaved roads and trails. Thus gravel bikes are usually designed as a hybrid somewhere in the middle of the two disciplines. They lack the suspension of mountain bikes and instead take on a more road bike form, but are built to be more rugged and designed with features such as larger clearance for dirt and gravel-ready tires.Dedicated gravel e-bikes exist – one of my favorites that I’ve tested is the Yamaha Wabash. At $3,499 it is worth every penny in my opinion, but it’s still far outside the price range of many potential new e-bike riders.So I decided to try my hand at a gravel ride on something more affordable. The bike I chose was the RadMission from Rad Power Bikes. At just $1,099, it offers great specs including a 500 W motor and 500 Wh battery. Another #nothrottlethursday this time on my RadMission e-bike from @RadPowerBikes. It’s way out of its element but I’m turning it into the most affordable gravel e-bike ever. Performed great on a 35km ride with over 50% battery left. Full story later today on @ElectrekCo pic.twitter.com/xtb475mbtwThere’s no suspension since this is really more of a metro commuter e-bike, but gravel bikes are usually built on road-style frames anyway, so it fits the bill in that regard. It also comes with 1.95″ tires with a moderate tread that finds a happy middle ground somewhere between slick road tires and knobby off-road tires. It is by no means a gravel e-bike, at least it wasn’t intended to be.But I don’t let little things like intentions stop me.My best friend is a gravel riding enthusiast and lifelong cyclist, and we set out on a ride together to see if I could keep up. He was on a real gravel bike – one that cost three times as much as my e-bike. On the same bikes I would never be able to keep up with him, I’d have to watch longingly while his spandex disappeared down the road before me. But my e-bikes have always allowed us to cycle together, with a bit of electric assist on my end helping me match his lifetime of cycling fitness. I still get in a good workout, but I can do it at speeds that I wouldn’t have otherwise been able to hit.For the gravel riding though, I wasn’t quite sure how it would go. The RadMission is absolutely at home on streets and in bike lanes, but things get rough when you turn off the beaten path.In true gravel riding fashion though, our route held a mixture of terrains. We started along the Tel Aviv coast, winding along the azure blue Mediterranean waters until reaching the Yarkon Park.My friend could easily hit 20 mph (32 km/h) or more, then sustain it, and the RadMission helped me do the same thing and match his speed. Without using the throttle, I was able to keep the assist on Level 1 – the lowest option. On long straightaways and sprints, I would occasionally bump into level 2 for a few seconds for a bit of acceleration to catch my friend when he got spirited, but level 1 seemed sufficient most of the time. The single-speed nature of the RadMission also means that acceleration is a bit slower since you can’t downshift, so occasionally bumping up the electric assist helps with those first few seconds of startup.The smooth brick trails in the park were a nice start to the ride, but they weren’t what I came for. And after 15 minutes or so we had blasted through the sprawling park and out the other side, spilling onto dirt trails lined with orange orchards one side and the Yarkon River on the other.The terrain was a mixture of rough soil and small rocks – exactly what I had been searching for to put the RadMission’s gravel riding ability to the test.There’s nothing fancy about the RadMission’s Kenda tires, but they worked like a charm in all but the sandiest of sections. Even then, the slight fishtailing at higher speeds added a few shots of adrenaline along the way.In fact I was actually a bit worried about getting a flat out there. We were miles from any road and while I had a spare tube in my Elite Byasi Toolbox shaped like a fake water bottle, it was only one. Two flats would make for a long walk back. But fortunately I didn’t pick anything up in my tires, and I had sufficient pressure to prevent any snake bite flats from hitting all sorts of weird rock edges.The same can’t be said for my friend though. While riding along we suddenly heard the dismaying pffsssss noise from his front tire. He quickly hopped off his bike, lifted the front wheel up, and spun it until a white gunk began leaking. He held his finger over the hole as the sound muffled and then stopped. “Tubeless,” he said, smiling. A minute later we were rolling again. Damn, I’ve got to get me some of those…I matched my friend’s pace as we road side-by-side for much of the trail, switching to tandem when we were met with single track.I had expected to need to boost my assist level beyond level 1 once we reached the true off-road trails, but I soon realized that even though the riding got harder for me, it also got harder for him. Pedaling through dirt, sand, and gravel isn’t easy – even for experienced cyclists on highly efficient bikes. We both slowed a bit, but level 1 was still sufficient for me to match his pace. On hilly sections, especially when passing over depressions caused by seasonal streams and then climbing the opposite bank, I would briefly bump the assist level up to 2 or sometimes even 3 for the steeper sections. This was only the only area where the single-speed nature of the bike put me at a disadvantage, and the electric assist made up for the lack of low gearing. By and large I was able to ride in level 1 for almost all of the trail riding.The trail got rough on occasion and I certainly spent a fair amount of time rising out of the saddle to avoid being pummeled by the irregular surface. In fact I recently ordered this cheap suspension seat post to swap on and provide a bit of suspension (you’ll need the 27.2mm version for the RadMission). But even without any suspension (and before I have had a chance to swap on the suspension seat post), the ride was only rough for brief periods, making it definitely manageable. The worst part was probably my fingers – after nearly an hour of riding they were getting seriously spent from gripping the bars so hard. It wasn’t a matter of needing to wear gloves – the skin was fine. It was that feeling you get after climbing a high rope, the finger pump of your tired muscles that aren’t used to gripping so hard for so long. I’ve never gotten that feeling on my long pavement rides, but the shaking on uneven terrain must have caused me to grip much harder and fatigue out my finger muscles more quickly.Around that point we decided to turn back. I was pleasantly surprised with how well the bike was holding up and how easily I had been able to keep up with my friend. My legs were tired – I was definitely working – but I wasn’t exhausted either.I was also pleasantly surprised with my battery level. The RadMission has a very simple display and only five LED bars to indicate battery level. I hadn’t lost a single bar yet.The return trip went equally well, though was peppered with occasional second-guessing when we reached forks and had brief debates about which direction we had come from.Fortunately we chose right each time and eventually made it back into the Yarkon Park where we returned to smooth paved trails. As my friend started hitting his sprints again, I was getting a bit tired after an hour and a half in the saddle. I rewarded myself for a strong performance by bumping up into level 2 pedal assist and matching his speed as we finished the journey with another beautiful pass along the coast.I ultimately performed the entire ride with almost zero throttle use. I most only blipped it for a second while maneuvering the bike to turn around 180º in the middle of the trail, or for a 20 meter (60 feet) uphill section of deep sand. Probably 99.8% of the ride was pedal assist only. Once returning, I checked my GPS tracker (I use the Runkeeper app) and fitness tracker (A cheap Fitbit Inspire HR) to see how I did.The ride covered 34.7 km (21.6 miles) in one hour and 52 minutes – an average pace of 18.5 km/h (11.5 mph). Not bad, especially since that included stops to take photos, fix a tire, water breaks, debate which side of the fork in the path to take, etc.I finished the ride with four out of five battery bars left, which would presumably mean I only used 20% of my 500 Wh battery. I measured the battery voltage at the end of the ride though to get a more accurate estimation. The voltage of 49.83V implies that I drained somewhere around 35% of the battery. That works out to an efficiency of around 5 Wh/km or 8 Wh/mi. Extrapolated to an entire pack means I theoretically could have ridden around 100 km or 62 miles.That actually exceeds the RadMission’s range rating, and I think this is what happened: While I was riding in level 1 pedal assist, I was actually pedaling decently faster than the motor was attempting to assist me. So all it had to do was give me the boost up to its level 1 speed, and then I was doing most of the work on the top end. I didn’t realize how much of the load was on me – I assumed the e-bike was working harder than it was. It was almost like a placebo effect. Or perhaps a low dose instead of a true placebo. Riding my e-bike made me push harder since I knew I had the assist, but ultimately the assist was set so low that I didn’t even realize I had pretty much taken the wheel.My phone says I burned 875 calories and my Fitbit says I burned 906 calories with a 109 BPM average heart rate. Both of those calorie figures sound a bit optimistic, and fitness trackers are notorious for overestimating calorie burn, but I’m pretty happy with the heart rate. My resting rate is around 46 BPM, so that’s a decent amount of exertion for me while still keeping the experience enjoyable.And that’s ultimately the point. I had a blast while getting in some solid exercise! My legs were tired and my fingers were sore, but it was an awesome experience and I can’t wait to do it again soon. The RadMission was able to get me out on trails, keeping up with a highly experienced cyclist and his several thousand-dollar gravel bike.Now how long is the RadMission going to hold up to this kind of riding? I have no idea. It performed great, but surely it wasn’t designed for this. Riding trails like this every day would likely mean more frequent maintenance intervals. Who knows how those wheel bearings will hold up over time and whether the narrow quick release axle can take this punishment for years. There’s a reason real gravel e-bikes cost thousands of dollars.But since not everyone has thousands of dollars, the fact that a $1,099 e-bike could help me get the same experience and a great workout at the same time is worth it to me.I think this afternoon I’ll go for another ride. I’ve been pushing myself to do more pedal assist-only riding with a little challenge I’ve been calling #nothrottlethursdays. I wonder how far I’ll go today?",ebikes
2021/03/31,"Hot on the heels of a new ultra lightweight electric mountain bike unveiling, Specialized isn’t slowing down. Today the company is releasing a new ultra lightweight electric city bike, the Specialized Turbo Como SL.[Editor’s note: the prices originally published in this article were based on an incorrect draft of a press release. Specialized has since provided the updated pricing information included below.]As opposed to specialized’s electric mountain bikes like the Turbo Levo and Kenovo, or Specialized’s fitness-oriented electric road bikes like the Turbo Creo, the new Turbo Como SL fits in Specialized’s “Active” category of bikes designed not for racing but instead for getting around town.That’s exactly what the new Turbo Como SL specializes in. It’s a comfort-oriented urban e-bike with an emphasis on utility for daily activities.The bike is designed to provide a high-visibility upright seating position that is much more comfortable than a racer’s tuck. And to ensure the bike can handle a daily commute or errands, the frame is designed to accept a variety of utility accessories. There’s even a frame-mounted front rack system that makes it easier and more comfortable to carry loads up front since they won’t swing with the fork when the bars turn.The headtube features a steer-stop system so the bars don’t swing around when the basket is loaded down. The frame also incorporates a lift handle at the center of mass, making it easy to lift the bike with one hand when walking up a flight of stairs or onto a train car.The Turbo Como SL ships with a flatbed rack for the front as well as Specialized’s basket that mounts to the rack, but the company also encourages riders to take advantage of the flat rack by adding their own custom accessories, baskets, and holders as well. The German-made SuperNova light is mounted below the rack instead of on the bars to ensure it won’t be obscured by large cargo placed on the front rack or in the basket. The bike’s cables are all integrated inside the handlebars to avoid interfering with the rack and cargo, and all-weather fenders add both protection and utility.As the company explained:“The Como Super Light isn’t slowed down by bad weather. We designed this bike for all seasons in all regions. With powerful disc brakes and wide Nimbus tires, you’ll feel stable and well-connected to the road. DRYTECH fenders deflect the dirt and water away from you, while integrated lights illuminate the road ahead. And the most important components—Internal Gear Hub, battery, and cables—stay protected from the elements and running clean.”The bike itself is powered by Specialized’s proprietary motor design, which is around half the weight of other major mid-drive motors at just 1.95 kg (4.3 lb).The motor is paired with a Shimano Alfine internally geared hub and a Gates carbon fiber belt, resulting in a quiet and maintenance-free drivetrain that can even be shifted while at a stop. That’s a nice feature to have when loaded down with cargo.The motor is designed to provide a comfortable amount of assist, but not to overpower the rider. At 240W, it will also be legal just about everywhere in the world. The US version of the e-bike will offer up to Class 3 speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h), while the European version will be limited to a maximum of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) to comply with local regulations. Specialized placed extra emphasis on designing the motor to be as natural feeling as possible, so the rider won’t notice large changes in power when the motor activates, or sudden drops in power when the rider’s pedaling exceeds the motor’s assist speed.As product lead for Specialized’s Turbo bikes Marco Sonderegger explained to Electrek:“We could have gone the easy route and buy a Bosch system or a complete system from Shimano or another brand. But then you can’t change anything. And what we do is totally different.”Marco described how Specialized designs all of its own components so that they can have complete control over the smallest details that effect the rider experience and the feel of the bike. Even down to the physical holders of the battery cells, Specialized customizes everything to create that unique experience.Details like those custom battery holders help Specialized cram a 320 Wh battery into the downtube while keeping the frame from looking bloated like many e-bikes. With an efficient pedal assist system, Specialized claims that the battery is sufficient for up to 100 km (62 miles) of range. An optional range extender battery can be slipped into a water bottle holder and add another 50 km (31 miles) of range. Using the bike’s Mission Control app, riders can choose which battery gets used first, or let them drain together. The range extender battery plugs right into the bike’s CAN bus, allowing it to communicate intelligently with the bike’s brain in the controller.Other features that can be accessed via the Mission Control app include over-the-air (OTA) updates and Smart Control, a feature that automatically controls the bike’s assistance level for riders based on the desired trip length or duration. A rider simply enters a distance or riding time and then the Smart Control function will modify the assistance level in real time to ensure the bike has enough battery power to get there. The change in assistance level is controlled to such a gradual amount that riders aren’t able to feel the switch between assistance levels. Smart Control can also be paired with nearly any wireless heart rate monitor to control the assistance level based on the rider’s heart rate, helping maintain a target heart rate or preventing the rider from over-exertion.The Turbo Como SL 5.0 starts at 45 lb (20.5 kg), which makes it one of the lightest weight full-featured upright city e-bikes. While specialized’s other SL variants like the Turbo Vado SL weigh several pounds less, upright utility e-bikes are generally heavier by nature.The Specialized Turbo Como SL is available starting today and comes in three frame sizes: Small, Medium and Large. The Turbo Como SL 5.0 starts at $4,800, while the Turbo Como SL 4.0 is priced at $4,000.We’ve got a Turbo Como SL 5.0 lined up for an Electrek review, so be sure to check back for our complete thoughts on the bike soon.",ebikes
2021/03/30,"Before today, Gocycle already had some of the fanciest folders in the e-bike world, but the company’s new fourth generation e-bikes are set to increase the lead. The new models announced today include the Gocycle G4, G4i, and G4i+. We’re now getting our first look at the new models after previously seeing only teasers from Gocycle earlier this year.The bikes follow the same basic Gocycle design we’ve been familiar with, sporting single supported wheels, a magnesium Cleandrive systen to hide away the drivetrain, and a fast folding mechanism.But the company added a number of new features while shaving more weight off the bikes to make them lighter than ever before.The weight savings come largely from a new carbon fiber mid-frame and front fork. Together, the new setup helps the bikes weigh in at 2.2 lb (1 kg) lighter than before. The new Gocycle G4i weighs just 36 lb (16.3 kg). That’s a veritable featherweight in the world of folding e-bikes, which are usually bloated with extra weight from clunky folding mechanisms and bulky frames.The in-wheel motor also gets an update, with the latest G4drive sporting more torque and better startup power, all while operating even more quietly. Gocycle also claims the responsiveness of the motor is improved, with assist beginning immediately upon touching the pedals.To get that power to the ground, new MotoGP-inspired tires were developed. They incorporate silica into a novel tread pattern to provide better grip and and more confident handling.Other additions include a faster charging system (dropping the charge time from 4-7 hours to just 3-3.5 hours), an improved Bluetooth connection setup for the phone app, and a new USB charging port to keep the rider’s phone or other electronics topped up while on the go.The G4 gets a Microshift mechanical shifter while the G4i and G4i+ both get predictive electronic shifting.Familiar sights that our readers may remember from the last time we tested a Gocycle include the double kickstand for secure parking, rear suspension strut activated by the single-sided swingarm, a boost button as a hidden throttle (or a twist throttle on the two higher-end models), running lights, multiple programmable and adjustable power modes, and hydraulic disc brakes.The bike also still sports a similar-looking 36V removable battery rated for between 40-50 miles of range (64-80 km), depending on the level of pedal assist.The new models are available now, starting from $3,999. An accessory suite that includes mudguards, auxiliary lights, and a pannier rack should be available soon.Gocycle founder Richard Thorpe elaborated on the launch of the new fourth-generation e-bikes:G4 has been in development for many years and represents the most significant product update for Gocycle since our G1 to G2 engineering programme. Our generation four models have been developed through a combination of listening to our customers and our continued mission to develop the best urban electric bikes on the planet. G4 will not only set a new standard for Gocycle, but a new standard for performance for all of our competitors in the portable electric bike segment.What I’m most excited about is our future road map and the potential for Gocycle to continue to innovate at a higher rate than our competitors. At Gocycle, we cook with different ingredients allowing us to redefine what an ebike can be and do. G4 is very exciting for us and provides a platform that will support even more significant developments in our pipeline in years to come!Welp, they ain’t cheap. But they’re pretty amazing e-bikes, so I can see what they spend their money on.Richard Thorpe was previously a designer at McLaren before deciding to shift gears and open his own electric bicycle company with a new design for folding e-bikes. And it is readily apparent that the automotive-level design has carried over.Gocycle has gone as far as not only designing a completely novel frame with a pair of single-sided wheels, but they’ve got their own single-supported motor as well, plus that Cleandrive swingarm so you never mess up your pant legs.Features like daytime running lights, automatic predictive shifting, and those high-grip silica-infused tires also speak to the premium level of e-bike we’re talking about here.Gocycle’s folders obviously aren’t for everyone, but having tested the previous generation myself, I can say that they are worth the price for anyone who depends on a folding e-bike as a daily commuter.",ebikes
2021/03/29,"The Kent Torpedo is the first electric bicycle that I know of designed specifically for children. And it’s so much fun (even for me as a full-fledged adult) that it surely won’t be the last one.Now before I start getting disgruntled comments, let me start by saying this isn’t a small motorcycle – it’s a pedal-assist e-bike. You have to pedal.Yes, it has a motor. But the motor only adds assist when the rider is pedaling. If the rider stops pedaling, the assist also stops.So make all the wisecracks you want about “kids these days,” but the fact of the matter is that a pedal-assist e-bike may just help draw kids away from addicting screens and back out onto a bike, pedaling away to their heart’s content.With a fun e-bike like this, kids that may have never expressed an interest in cycling could be hopping onto the saddle and discover the joy of life on two-wheels. And at just $498, it’s easier for parents to afford than a typical adult e-bike.To see how much fun the Kent Torpedo e-bike is, check out my video review below! Then keep reading for my complete thoughts and testing (yes, I rode it too!).The Kent Torpedo isn’t a powerhouse. The motor is only a measly 180 watts. But for kids, that’s plenty. All it’s doing is adding a bit of a boost – the kid still has to pedal. When it comes to an e-bike designed for children, this is exactly what I want to see: light assist, not a mini-motorcycle.Its 24V 5.2Ah battery is adorably small yet provides up to 15 miles (25 km) of range if the kid keeps it in low power mode.Of course, all the fun is in going fast in high power mode, though that drains the battery quicker. The medium power mode seems like a nice happy middle ground.The 39.4 lb (17.8 kg) e-bike isn’t light, but the helper motor makes it feel lighter than it is.The bike is built on a steel frame and sports 20″ wheels. My 7-year-old nephew struggles to touch the ground while my nearly 9-year-old nephew fits on the bike easily. The fact that younger kids can’t fit on it is probably a good thing. Kids should be a certain age before they are mature enough to handle the extra power of an e-bike, even a low-power one like this.Their 32-year-old uncle (me) also fits on the bike with the seat all the way up, though it’s admittedly a bit small for me. For reference, I’m 5’7″ (170 cm) and 155 lb (70 kg).Of course, the e-bike isn’t designed for me – the weight limit is only 100 lb (44 kg). But that didn’t stop me from putting some healthy miles on it before letting the kids do their thing. I mean, I’ve got to test it first and make sure it’s safe… right?With a front suspension fork that isn’t much to write home about but still works just fine, the bike is somewhat sporty. We built a classic front yard ramp and had fun seeing who could get the most air.I could. It was me.The V-brakes similarly aren’t incredibly high quality, but then again, they work just fine. This is a $498 kids e-bike after all – not a $17,000 S-Works for lycra-clad dads.While the battery seems to last for a while on low power mode, high mode drains it quicker. I asked Kent Bicycles about the possibility of buying spare batteries to swap in and make for a longer ride, and they’re looking into offering them on their website. If they can swing it, I 100% recommend grabbing a second battery. It’s about the size of a small water bottle and easy to stick in your bag when the family goes on a ride. It can help your kids ride even longer, extending that family Sunday ride even further than 15 miles (25 km).Even if the battery does run out, the e-bike simply turns back into a pedal bike. Talk about convenient!Without the battery, the Kent Torpedo is easy enough to pedal, though it will definitely feel a bit heavier than a typical kid’s bike. The geared motor doesn’t provide any extra resistance other than adding a couple pounds of needless weight. There’s also a 6-speed shifter that makes it easier for kids to climb hills in the proper gear, even without electric power. If the battery does die on a ride, the shifter definitely makes it more manageable to pedal.Ultimately, this little e-bike definitely impressed me. As a bike, it’s well made. It held a 155-lb adult flying through the air, even though I was half expecting a pedal to snap off on my repeated landings. But no, the thing is overbuilt for its ratings, just like Kent’s lawyers surely insisted that it should be.As an e-bike, it works great for providing enough of a confidence-boosting electric push to make kids feel like they can conquer anything. I see its best use being to pull kids away from screens and back outside. We need more kids growing up in the streets and cul de sacs of their neighborhoods like I did when I was young. Grumble grumble, something about “the youths, these days.”Even if this takes some kids off of pedal bikes and puts them on e-bikes, I’m not terribly worried about it because, for the last time, this is a pedal-assist e-bike. You still have to put in the effort; it just helps you do it for longer or to go faster. In that case, the kids are doing just as much pedaling as they did before, but now, they have more wind in their faces as they do it. But I still say its best use is for the kids who aren’t really riding bikes that much. This is an incredibly fun way to get them back in the saddle, getting exercise, and smiling the whole time. Just be sure to put a helmet on them!",ebikes
2021/03/27,"China’s Segway-Ninebot loves its affordable little electric mopeds, which it often debuts domestically before releasing international versions in the US and Europe. The company’s latest model, the Ninebot A30C, was just released and comes packed with high-tech features and a low-tech price.The Ninebot A30C carries a similar look to past Ninebot electric mopeds, such as the C80 model that we covered previously.Now the new A30C model is adding upgrades and extra features while sticking with a low price of just RMB 2,299 (approximately US$350).The small electric moped features a single seat for one passenger, but appears to offer both a front and rear child seat accessory. That customization could allow an adult to ride with up to two small children, replacing a typical family car for common trips like dropping kids off at daycare.A 48V and 12Ah lithium-ion battery offers 576 Wh of capacity, which the company claims is sufficient for 40 km (25 miles of range). Considering the Ninebot A30C is marketed as a purely urban transport tool, that range is likely sufficient for most riders.The top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) is the maximum allowed by law for electric bicycles in China. And speaking of electric bicycles, that’s exactly what the A30C is… technically speaking. It features functional pedals that qualify it as an e-bike and thus allow riders to operate it without any additional car or motorcycle driving license.Even though it is technically an electric bicycle, the design encourages riders to use the foot rest and scooter-style deck for resting their feet, meaning the pedals are mostly for show. If the battery ever ran dry before a rider reached home, the pedals could likely still be used to move the A30C along at a slow pace. The 54 kg (119 lb) moped may be cheaply priced at just $350, but it actually packs in some very interesting components. Not only is it a full-suspension electric moped designed for comfort, but it includes additional features like regenerative braking, an NFC card for keyless unlocking and ignition, password protection to allow electronic key sharing with friends, over-the-air updates and cloud-based telemetrics that can monitor and report on the moped remotely via an included smartphone app. The Ninebot A30C is expected to be followed by A40 and A65 models, which will likely offer performance upgrades such as larger batteries.For now the electric moped is only available in China, but Ninebot has usually followed these Chinese releases with American and European versions several months later. That’s exactly what happened with the last ultra-affordable electric moped offered by Ninebot, which was introduced for US customers with a higher speed limit. If the trend continues, there’s a chance we could see these small Asian-style electric mopeds zipping around the streets of New York or Paris later this year.",ebikes
2021/03/24,"The idea that electric bicycles are “cheating” has long since been written off. With the massive adoption of electric bicycles under way and multiple studies confirming that electric bicycles provide nearly as much exercise as pedal bicycles, a new real-world test is now helping us get a better idea of exactly how much exercise different levels of electric pedal assist can provide.The real-world test was performed by Rad Power Bikes, the leading North American manufacturer of electric bicycles. It sought to determine how many calories were burned when riding e-bikes using pedal assist.As Rad’s Justin Duckham explained:A lot of our customers reach out to us and ask if they can use their electric bikes to workout. We wanted to put that to the test, so we got five of our friends and asked them to go on a 30-minute ride around our office. And to make things interesting and to get a better understanding of what kind of workout you can expect, we assigned each of them a different level of pedal assist, which basically determines how much power the motor gives you on your ride.Fitness trackers were used to calculate each rider’s calorie burn during the test.Instead of performing a scientific study with nearly identical riders on identical bikes, they purposefully used riders of various sizes on different bikes to give a sense of the level of real-world exercise across a wide range of rider types.For example, the five riders in the test and their bikes were:Thus, the results are more of an indication of exercise level across a spectrum of riders than a rigorous scientific analysis of exact calorie burn.But through the use of fitness trackers worn by each rider on an identical 30-minute route consisting of both flat and hilly sections (seen in the video below), we’re able to glean some interesting info.Below you can see the results of the calorie burn for each rider.One thing to keep in mind is that larger individuals tend to burn more calories than smaller ones, as do individuals with lower fitness levels that are just beginning an exercise routine.That correlates with the interesting results that show a spread of calories burned across the pedal assist range.While I certainly expected the results to follow the pedal assist level with fewer calories burned when more assist was used, the variation in rider size definitely plays a large role.The heaviest rider on a RadRover fat tire e-bike using Level 1 pedal assist (bless his heart… and quads) burned 325 calories on the ride, or a very respectable 650 cal/hr rate. That definitely makes sense.But interestingly the Level 5 pedal assist rider of medium height and build on a RadWagon electric cargo bike still worked out at a respectable 358 cal/hr. It’s not as high as the Level 1 pedal assist rider, but it sure beats the 75 cal/hr I’m burning while writing this article. Granted, that electric cargo bike isn’t light, but Level 5 pedal assist also means the bike is putting out a lot of power. Yet by pedaling along even with the e-bike in its highest power mode, the rider still got in a fair workout. We can also see how the smaller female riders also burned the fewest calories, which makes sense based on their body masses. It further demonstrates how unique the e-bike exercise experience is for each rider, and how tests like these help illustrate that point.The nice thing about this test is that it allows us to find the rider closest to ourselves and get an idea of our own potential exercise level on such e-bikes. For example, Rider 5 on the cargo e-bike matches most closely with my build, and so I know that I can still get in a decent workout even with max assist on that e-bike.All of this aligns with what several more scientifically rigorous studies have determined: that electric bicycles can provide nearly as much exercise as pedal bikes. In some cases, e-bikes actually provide more net exercise as they cause riders to ride further and for longer durations.Tests like these also go to show that you don’t necessarily need the fanciest fitness e-bikes to get in a good workout. Sure, I’d love a Specialized Turbo Vado SL, but it’s not quite in my budget.Personally, I’ve been experimenting more with e-bike fitness in addition to using e-bikes purely for sustainable transportation. I often switch between my Priority Current for pure road riding and my RadMission for gravel-style riding. The Priority Current was $2,699 when I got mine and the RadMission was an astounding $999, though both have increased in price slightly since then. Both bikes also show that you don’t need an e-bike priced as high as a car to get in a workout.The Priority Current is pedal assist only and thus keeps me honest. The RadMission has a throttle as well as pedal assist. I like the throttle for getting me out of a jam and as a safety feature, but I try to use pedal assist as much as I can when I’m not in a hurry. In fact, lately I’ve been pushing myself with something I’m calling “no throttle Thursdays,” where I don’t even touch my throttle and focus purely on enjoying a nice pedal-assisted ride.However you like to get your e-bike fitness in, you can rest assured that despite the naysayers fading away behind you, you’re definitely getting in some well-earned exercise.Just one of the many benefits of e-bikes!",ebikes
2021/03/18,"Electric bicycle sales have shown exponential growth for several years now, but 2020 saw an unprecedented e-bike boom.Electric bicycle demand skyrocketed all over the world in 2020, fueled largely by fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.In the Netherlands, e-bikes have become such a mainstay that they accounted for approximately half of all bicycle sales in 2020.According to a new report by industry experts RAI Vereniging and Bovag, over half a million of the 1.1 million bicycles sold in the Netherlands in 2020 were electric bicycles.While total volume of sales of bicycles in the country during 2020 only increased by 9% compared to 2019, the total sales figure increased by 31% to €1.65 billion. The larger share of electric bicycles contributed to the higher spending percentage because electric bicycles are typically more expensive than pedal bicycles.The Netherlands is famous for its cycling culture, with the public embracing two-wheeled transport as the norm.Companies like VanMoof and Gazelle have risen to meet that demand, providing electric bicycles that combine classic Dutch inspiration with modern styles and features.Electric bicycles, which in Europe are generally only available with pedal assist and no hand throttles, help riders take the edge off of bicycle commutes by providing assist on arduous hills. They also help riders maintain higher speeds for longer periods – key to long-distance commutes – without becoming overly exhausted.Being able to arrive by bicycle to work without needing to take a shower is often cited as one of the main reasons commuters have switched to an e-bike after passing on adopting pedal bicycle commutes.Many European countries provide incentives that encourage bicycle use for transportation. These have come in the form of government-sponsored incentives as well as incentives offered by employers.UK-based electric bicycle manufacturer Gocycle created its own cycling incentive program for its employees.As Gocycle founder Richard Thorpe explained to Electrek:At Gocycle, we introduced a UK-first policy that sees the business pay its employees 40p per mile [approximately $0.55] when they commute to work by e-bike rather than using their car. There are countless studies that show that encouraging cycling reduces sickness levels and contributes to a more productive, healthier and happier workforce.As Europe leads the way on electric bicycle adoption as alternative transport, perhaps the United States can learn a thing or two.Past incentives in the US have been floated without gaining steam, but a recent push in the US Congress could signify a massive shift.A bill is currently under consideration to create a 30% tax incentive for electric bicycle purchases in the United States. Under the current terms of the bill, known as the E-BIKE ACT, a maximum tax credit of $1,500 could be applied to the purchase of a new electric bicycle.The bill is currently under review in the House Ways and Means committee.Let’s all learn something from the Dutch here.Electric bicycles may not be able to replace all cars for all commuters, but they certainly can for many of us.And those of who can replace car trips with e-bike trips absolutely should. The combination of lower transportation costs, an easier ride experience, and the pure joy of feeling the wind in your face should be incentive enough. But for those that find the higher price of e-bikes to be out of range, government incentives like the E-BIKE ACT could be the missing link the US needs to finally kick e-bike adoption among the masses into high gear.",ebikes
2021/03/15,"There’s just something so natural-feeling about charging an e-bike from solar power. E-bikes are already such environmentally responsible alternatives to cars that they make me want to go the rest of the way and charge them in what feels like an environmentally responsible form too – with solar power that I generated onsite myself. I’ve played with various methods for solar charging my e-bikes before. Some of them feel a bit more like a high school science fair project than the others. But the single easiest method I’ve tried so far has been with the Jackery Explorer 1000 solar generator.This is a big ol’ solar generator with a beefy 1,002 Wh internal battery that can be charged up with Jackery’s SolarSaga solar panels. You can also charge it from a wall plug or a car outlet, but it’s the solar charging that intrigued me.Once it charges up its internal battery from the solar panels (or also during), you can plug in pretty much any device you’d like into it. In our case, we’ll be plugging in an e-bike charger that comes with an e-bike.The Jackery Explorer 1000 has several power outlets in addition to the three 110V AC outlets, so you can get creative with what you run from your solar power. In addition to your e-bike, you can plug in other appliances or devices into the 110V AC outlets or the USB ports. I often charge my phone from the unit just because its fun to think about how every call or swipe is powered by energy I harnessed from the sun.To charge an e-bike, you’ll first need to make sure your Jackery unit is at least partially charged. Think of it like an energy buffer. You fill up the Jackery with solar power and it stores it until you’re ready to dump that energy into your e-bike. You can take both the Jackery Explorer 1000 and the solar panels outside and simply point the panels towards the sun. Or if you prefer a more permanent setup, you can leave the main unit inside and run the wires out through a window. This could be useful for anyone living in an apartment with a window facing the sun.The panels are each 100W, though Jackery also makes 60W panels for smaller units they sell. You can use a single panel or connect two of them together for more power. Jackery includes a helpful parallel connector for just such an occasion. For our use, a single panel is fine since we’ll be slowly charging the Jackery throughout the day, but two panels will charge the unit twice as fast.With two 100W panels I can get 110W of input power during the worst of conditions (morning light, partly cloudy, etc) and over 150W in good conditions.A typical e-bike battery is around 500-700 Wh. The Jackery Explorer 1000 has a capacity of 1,000 Wh and can thus perform around two full charges. Most people ride back with a partially discharged battery instead of a completely empty one, and so 3-4 partial charges is more likely.The beauty of this system versus direct solar charging is that the solar energy is there when you need it. I usually ride my e-bikes during the day and charge at night. If I relied on direct solar charging, which pumps electricity straight from a panel and into the bike battery, then I’d never be able to charge after the sun goes down. But with the Jackery setup, I can easily solar charge when I get home, even after dark.Now there is one big downside to this setup, and the more tech-minded readers will surely have landed on it already. This isn’t the most efficient way to solar charge a device. The two-step system of first solar-charging the Jackery and then charging the bike battery wastes some energy in each of the steps where energy transferred from battery to battery. The second step is even less efficient since you first convert to AC and then back to DC instead of staying in DC the entire time. It’s not as efficient as direct solar charging, but if you aren’t able to direct solar charge during the day then it doesn’t really matter.I use the Jackery Explorer 1000 unit because it is big enough to offer me a few charges. But it’s also a bit pricey at $999. Jackery manufactures several smaller models that work equally as well for e-bike charging, they just don’t store quite as much energy. I bought a Jackery Explorer 300, which is only $299, because the smaller 7 lb device is a lot easier to carry around than the 22 lb Jackery Explorer 1000, and I can still get around half an e-bike charge from it. Since I usually roll in with around half a charge, that’s still quite useful. The Jackery Explorer 500 is a bit bigger and splits the difference.And if you want to go even bigger, the Jackery Explore 1500 Wh unit is coming out within weeks. Michelle Lewis will have a hands-on review of that new beast of a unit right here on Electrek. So be sure to check back for our thoughts on the new massive unit based on her testing.",ebikes
2021/03/15,"EUNORAU has just launched its latest electric bike – this time opting for full-suspension combined with all-wheel-drive. The new EUNORAU Defender S e-bike also happens to be one of the most affordable full-suspension AWD e-bikes on the market.The Defender S actually comes in two variants. The base-level Defender S has a single 750W Bafang hub motor and is priced at $1,799, while the Defender S Pro sports two 750W Bafang hub motors and is priced at $1,999. With dual motors, the Defender S Pro puts out a peak of 1,500 watts from the combined motors.They otherwise carry the same specs. A 48V 14Ah removable battery is integrated into the downtube. That 672 Wh battery can be upgraded to an 816 Wh battery, and riders can also add on a second 816 Wh battery that gets mounted piggyback-style on the first, doubling the e-bike’s range to a maximum of 80 miles (130 km). That range will likely drop with off-road riding, which is known to burn through batteries much quicker, but suffice it to say that 1,632 Wh is a lot of battery! An RST hydraulic front fork and rear DNM air shock combine with the high-volume fat tires to give this e-bike a comfortable ride both on and off-road.Other nice components seen on both EUNORAU Defender S models are a color LCD display, hydraulic disc brakes, and a 9-speed Shimano Alivio derailleur. That 9-speed transmission is a step up in quality compared to the entry level Shimano Tourney and Altus parts we often seen on these lower-cost e-bikes.While $1,999 certainly isn’t pocket change, many full-suspension AWD e-bikes cost twice as much, making this a bargain by comparison. And don’t get even me started on those $6,000 full-suspension fat-tire e-bikes. The EUNORAU Defender S also comes in two frame sizes to fit a wider variety of riders, though the smaller frame size can’t fit the larger 816 Wh internal battery upgrade. It can still fit the 816 Wh piggyback battery, for a maximum combined capacity of 1,488 Wh. Not too shabby.Racks and fenders can be added as additional accessories, as well as a fast charger that increases charging rate by 50%.The company is currently taking pre-orders over the next 30 days for the EUNORAU Defender S. Once funding is completed via the company’s Indiegogo campaign, production is expected to begin in May with shipping slated for October.We always advise that buyers exercise some level of caution with Indiegogo campaigns, as you are actually backing a campaign for a product that hasn’t entered production yet. However, we’ve reviewed EUNORAU e-bikes before, and the company has been building e-bikes for nearly a decade, so this isn’t some fly-by-night startup.EUNORAU is another example of an Asian e-bike company with global operations and that is working hard at building a base of operations in the US. The company has recently established a Las Vegas headquarters, and also has facilities in both Europe and Australia. EUNORAU isn’t just some nameless drop-shipper.Judging purely by the images, videos, and specs, I’m actually quite impressed with the bike. For $1,999, you’re getting a lot of e-bike! And not just that, you’re actually getting good components as well. That suspension isn’t top-shelf, but it’s not the cheap spring suspension we often see either. Those hydraulic disc brakes are quality and so is that mid-tier Shimano transmission.Basically, EUNORAU actually invested in some fairly rugged components on this e-bike; they didn’t just slap two motors and cheap components onto a frame to achieve a low MSRP. This is a low-cost e-bike in name only.It’s a bummer to have to wait until October to get to actually ride the EUNORAU Defender S, but the e-bike industry is currently suffering from crippling supply chain delays following surging demand, and so the wait time makes sense based on the current environment.",ebikes
2021/03/13,"Washingtonians are one step closer to being able to buy an electric bicycle without paying state sales tax.That’s thanks to progress on House Bill 1330.The bill passed in the state House of Representatives last week and has now moved on to the state Senate.The bill would remove sales and use tax on electric bicycles and related cycling equipment. The maximum exemption in the bill is set at $200.With Washington’s 6.5% sales tax rate, e-bikes priced up to around $3,000 could be purchased without paying any sales tax, if the bill passes.Supporters of the bill argue that extra incentives are needed for electric bicycles compared to pedal bicycles due to the higher cost of the former, as well as e-bikes’ increased ability to replace cars as compared to pedal bicycles.Rep Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, who is known to cycle to work and for being a strong supporter of electric bicycles, explained the justification for the electric bicycle sales tax exemption:“They really are a car replacement in the way a regular bike isn’t.”The bill could have multiple impacts, including helping to lower prices of electric bicycles to the point that more people can afford to make the switch from a car, as well as allowing riders to purchase higher quality e-bikes that will last longer and ultimately be more sustainable.As Carolyn Eaton, owner of the Montlake Bicycle Shop, explained to the Seattle Times:“I would hope that by not having the sales tax, the customer who only has that $1,500 budget, maybe they’re able to get something a little bit nicer in that $2,000 price range. Something that’s more reliable, more environmentally conscious, in the long term being something they can hold on to for many years.”This wouldn’t be the first tax incentive for e-bikes under consideration in the US.There is currently a bill working its way through Congress to create a federal tax incentive for 30% of the purchase price of an electric bicycle. That bill would have a major impact on the accessibility of e-bikes across the country, and we’ll continue to cover it as the bill progresses.I think this is a wonderful idea and an important part of making electric bicycles more affordable for Washingtonians. Other states should look to Washington as an example.The small amount of tax revenue “lost” through this program can easily be recuperated through the pile-on benefits of increased e-bike use, such as benefits caused by reduced load on local transportation infrastructure, reduced pollution, improved health of citizens resulting in lower medical. expenses, etc.We’ve covered many budget-level e-bikes in the $600-$700 range, and there are some decent finds. But quality really improves when you hit the $1,400-$1,500 range and continues to rise in the higher price classes as well.By helping riders buy slightly more expensive e-bikes, this will encourage the use of more sustainable e-bikes designed to function for many more years.For the same reason, I fully support the proposed 30% e-bike tax credit bill. And I support Americans using their $1,400 stimulus check to purchase a new e-bike, assuming they have their basic necessities taken care of first. We’ll have more on that last subject soon.Lastly, I’d just like to address those few that are going to get their spandex in a wad over pedal bicycles not being included. Here’s the deal: the point of the bill is to replace cars with e-bikes. That’s it. The reason most drivers aren’t switching to a pedal bike isn’t because they can’t afford it; it’s because they don’t want to be a sweaty mess trying to overcome hills and long pedal commutes. E-bikes are perfectly designed to solve that problem by taking the “edge” off of cycling by making hills less arduous and long commutes more manageable. And considering that several studies demonstrate that e-bikes offer almost as much exercise as pedal bikes, there are serious health benefits to consider in addition to just the transportation infrastructure benefits.Ok, end rant.Now let’s hear what you think! Would you like to see your state follow Washington’s example and remove sales tax for e-bikes? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below. And if you need an idea for a low-cost e-bike, check out my top 5 affordable electric bicycle suggestions.",ebikes
2021/03/12,"Major bicycle manufacturer Kent is announcing today its first electric bicycle designed specifically for children. The Kent Torpedo packs an e-bike system onto a 20″ kids bike, charging up the ride with more distance and speed.Before you start pulling out your pitchforks, know that the Kent Torpedo is a pedal assist e-bike.That means it doesn’t have a throttle. It’s not a mini-motorcycle for children, it’s just a normal pedal bicycle that benefits from an added assist motor.The motor is mounted in the rear wheel and adds 180W of power in full power mode. There are medium and low power modes that provide even softer assist.An LED battery meter is mounted on the handlebars that also houses the power mode selector.The motor doesn’t add any assist unless the rider is pedaling, and the assist cuts out immediately when pedaling stops. The brake levers that control a pair of V-brakes also have sensors to cut motor power any time the brakes are pulled.The motor is supplied by an adorable little 24V 5.2Ah battery with just 125 Wh of capacity. In low power mode, the battery is sufficient for 15 miles (25 km) of range. Of course if the battery ever runs out, the e-bike simply turns back into a standard pedal bike powered by a morning bowl of Wheaties. There’s even a six-speed transmission that makes the bike extra pedal-friendly even without any electric assist.The Kent Torpedo comes complete with a front spring suspension fork so your kid can go nuts taking it off some sweet jumps.The bike is available in four different colors and is priced at $498 with free shipping in the US.I’ll have a review of this kids e-bike coming up soon. I actually already have one on hand and have enlisted my nephews as unpaid child laborers for testing. And even though I exceed the 100 lb (44 kg) weight limit by around 50%, it actually rides really well with me on it. I’ve definitely gotten air on this thing.Be on the lookout for my full review in the next week or two.So here’s the thing: I can see this being divisive. There will undoubtedly be trolls claiming e-bikes are going to make kids lazy. But to be honest, I see this kids e-bike as a great thing.You see, let me tell you a secret. Plenty of kids are already lazy.I see tons of children riding electric scooters these days, which require essentially zero effort to ride. But pedal assist e-bikes, on the other hand, must still be pedaled like a traditional bike. They simply give you more power to ride faster, longer, or climb hills that were previously unconquerable.One of the biggest benefits for adults is that electric bicycles can help make rides longer by not exhausting the rider so quickly. I imagine they could do the same for kids. When the family goes out for a ride together, kids can’t always keep up with their stronger parents. But if the kids have small helper motors, a longer ride is definitely in the cards.If these were throttle-enabled e-bikes, then I probably wouldn’t be so jazzed. Eight-year-olds don’t really need to commute anywhere, so a throttle seems unnecessary. But the pedal assist Kent Torpedo e-bike seems like exactly what a screen-enamored generation of kids need. A “motorbike” that is fun and exciting and tricks them into getting in some exercise sounds just fine by me.",ebikes
2021/03/10,"CSC Motorcycles is perhaps better known for its affordable line of both gas-powered and electric motorcycles and scooters. But after entering the electric bicycle market last year with two impressive fat tire e-bikes, the company is now doubling down with two more e-bikes designed for a broader audience.The two new e-bikes include the step-through fat tire e-bike dubbed the FT750ST as well as a dual-battery electric cargo bike known as the Vista Cruiser.The FT750ST shares many components with CSC’s first two electric bicycles, the FT750-20 and FT750-26, yet updates the design with a step-through frame that many riders will find more accessible.The frame provides an upright riding position that will likely feel quite comfortable thanks to the hydraulic front fork and extra wide 4″ tires. An integrated rear rack is also designed directly into the frame, while a front basket can be added to accessory lugs on the headtube of the bike.A 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear wheel provides 80 Nm of torque and propels the e-bike up to a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). Tektro hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm rotors quickly bring the bike back to a stop.The inclusion of a throttle makes this a Class 2 e-bike in the US.The frame hides away an enclosed 48V and 14Ah Samsung battery with 672 Wh of capacity. That battery is rated for a range of 25-45 miles (40-72 km) depending on whether the rider uses throttle or pedal assist. The battery can be removed from the frame for charging off of the bike, or charged in place.Other components that are nice to see included are stronger 12mm threaded axles instead of quick release skewers, 50 lux headlights and tail lights, Shimano 7-speed derailleur and included fenders.The 73 lb (33 kg) bike is available in either Sapphire Blue Metallic or Fire Yellow.The MSRP of $1,888 puts it a few hundred dollars above some of the usual suspects when it comes to popular fat tire e-bikes, but the higher-quality components like the hydraulic fork, high-quality lighting, thru axles, and hydraulic disc brakes certainly help justify the price. The bike is currently available on pre-order and requires just a $200 deposit to hold your line for shipping later this month.For those needing to carry a bit more cargo than will fit on the rear rack of the FT750ST, the new CSC Vista Cruiser is likely more up your alley.This longtail cargo bike has an extended rear rack and built-in running boards on either side of the rear wheel. A front basket can also be bolted onto the headtube for carrying extra cargo.The CSC Vista Cruiser has a similar drivetrain to the FT750ST, with a 750W Bafang hub motor in rear and a 7-speed Shimano derailleur. Instead of a single battery though, the Vista Cruiser gets a pair of batteries. The 48V packs are built with Samsung battery cells and combine for a total of 1,368 Wh of capacity. Those two packs together offer between 50-90 miles of range (80-145 km), depending on whether you’re using pedal assist or throttle.The 88 lb (39.9 kg) e-bike sports hydraulic disc brakes, a double center kickstand, fenders, 50 lux headlights and tail lights, a thumb throttle, and Kenda HAVOK 27.5″ x 3″ tires.It comes in either Turquoise/Cream or Black/Cream colorways and is currently on pre-order with a $200 deposit toward the full $2,488 MSRP.Here too CSC has opted to outfit the e-bike with nicer components and extra battery capacity, aiming for a niche above the many budget-oriented electric cargo bikes on the market.I’ve previously tested CSC’s other electric bicycles (see my video below) and found them to fit nicely in the space above budget-level e-bikes but below the $3,000 to $4,000 premium e-bikes.They generally offer slightly better components and are designed to be a bit more robust than most entry-level e-bikes in the $1,500-range. Basically, it feels like they were spec’d by a motorcycle company instead of a bicycle company, with emphasis on higher-grade parts designed to withstand more abuse than we normally see in this industry.They aren’t going to give a Riese & Müller a run for its money, but they’re still pretty darn nice for the price.But we’ll try to get on these bikes and push them hard for you in a review so we can report back on what they’re really made of. Judging by my past experiences with CSC, I have high hopes.",ebikes
2021/03/09,"Being able to ride an e-bike on an assortment of trails is one thing. But being able to continue with overland riding once the trail has ended takes an entirely different type of e-bike. When you’re cutting your path through fields, forests and deserts, a powerful all-wheel drive e-bike like the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 can absolutely get it done. The hunter edition of the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 adds functional utility and a camo paint job to help you blend in while silently blazing through nature.You don’t have to be an actual hunter to enjoy this bike, though I hear it certainly is popular with that crowd. Everyone from nature explorers to bird watchers to survivalists can benefit from a powerful e-bike that is armed to the teeth with extra battery capacity and full-suspension to tackle the worst that nature can throw in your path.You’ll surely want to see this e-bike in action in my video review below. Then continue reading to learn even more about this go-anywhere fat tire e-bike.The first thing you’ll notice about the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 Hunter Edition e-bike is the size. This thing is simply massive. It’s available in three frame sizes, but the bike is huge any way you slice it. The wheels and tires are gigantic. There are big batteries seemingly everywhere. Front and rear racks add to the bulk. Basically, if you’re on the hunt for a small e-bike then you need to look elsewhere.The good news is that the massive size also makes this e-bike the ultimate overlanding two-wheeler. As much as I’d love a cool AWD electric farm bike like an UBCO 2X2, the cost is still hard for me and many others to stomach. But a powerful e-bike like this one can perform the same role by allowing you to ride up, over, and through just about any obstacle, trail be damned.At $4,295, this is of course not a cheap e-bike. But it’s also barely just an e-bike; it’s an off-road machine. When you need to push deeper into nature than you ever would on a typical e-bike, yet want to know that you can still get out (even dragging a trailer full of deer, firewood, or whatever else you can haul behind you), this is the type of e-bike for you. Plus, E-cells includes a pile of accessories like pannier bags, tool kits, cargo nets, helmets, electric air pumps and other goodies in with the bike, so you’re really getting a lot for your money here.A pair of massive 52V-powered 1,100 W peak motors make just about anything possible. On pavement I can chirp the tires, they’re that powerful. With enough room to run I can easily break 30 mph (51 km/h). On the dirt I’m slinging earth as I accelerate. In fact, the optional single-wheel drive selector is actually quite handy because sometimes I don’t need all the power this e-bike offers.And of course there’s a lot of battery power here too to make sure those powerful motors can keep running for your entire ride. The two packs add up to over 1,600 Wh of capacity. It’s hard to interpret that into a range rating because this bike is designed to cover such diverse landscapes. On the street that could net you over 60 miles or 100 km of range as long as you go easy on the throttle. Add some pedal assist and you could get even more.If you really get into the dirt and ride hard, 30 miles might be a more accurate range estimate. Suffice it to say that you’ve got a lot of battery at your disposal.There’s something about a full-suspension fat tire bike that brings out the kid in everyone. It makes me go, “Ooh, I want to ride over that!” several times on each ride I take.As an overlanding vehicle, the combination of fat tires and full-suspension are critical when the trail ends and you’re literally blazing your own path. The fat tires almost float through loose terrain like sand. The suspension is actually quite high end, not like cheap suspension we’ve seen on other fat tire FS e-bikes, and is a big part of that higher $4K+ purchase price. When you’re dropping a 95 lb bike over logs though, you’ll be happy you have this nicer suspension.Another high-end component I haven’t touched on yet are the brakes. Not only are these high quality four-piston hydraulic disc brakes, but the rotors are absolutely massive at 203 mm in diameter and even thicker than most at 2.3 mm. Those calipers might as well be biting down on freaking flywheels!And for a transmission you get a 10-speed Shimano Deore derailleur. That’s a nice piece of kit right there, and is a far cry over the entry-level derailleurs you find on most other e-bikes that don’t have a mega-brand label on the side.The bike of course isn’t perfect. I wouldn’t call it nimble by any stretch of the imagination, though few fat tire e-bikes are. I like to keep my tire pressure low in these types of giant tires and that only further reduces the response time for quick steering inputs. But a bike like this isn’t built to be nimble, it’s built to make up for that with sheer power. Even if you don’t pick the perfect line through a gravel berm, you’ve got the power and grip to just power through anyways.One other area I would have loved to have seen improved is the pedal assist sensor. It’s fine, but it’s just a cadence sensor. For this amount of money, a torque sensor would have been a nice upgrade. Torque sensors give you more immediate pedal assist response, while cadence sensors have that tell-tall lag when you first start pedaling. On flat ground I don’t notice the difference after the first few seconds, but startups can be a chore on just cadence sensors. Of course you also have that throttle there when you need a boost getting rolling, even if you plan to use mostly pedal power for a nice workout.There are plenty of dual-purpose e-bikes out there. If you simply need a bike that you can ride on both the street and the trails, you can look at other models. You don’t need this much e-bike. E-cells makes less ridiculously overpowered e-bikes as well. Half this much power is fine for most people.But anyone who really wants to chart their own path and explore nature to the fullest extent, riding where no one has ridden before, this is the type of e-bike for you.This is definitely for a specialty type of rider. Its huge weight rating and the ability to climb massive hills or pull massive loads speaks to that specialization.This is an e-bike that could actually replace dirt bikes and farm bikes as a silent, environmentally conscious alternative. Instead of fiddling with a carburetor before every trip, you could simply unplug and ride. These types of powerful e-bikes don’t just offer stealth to get you into nature unnoticed, they also do it without the annoying roar of an engine underneath you.To me, e-bikes are the ultimate way to explore nature. And powerful e-bikes like these make it possible to simply choose a direction and go, no need to follow someone else’s trail.",ebikes
2021/03/08,"Ariel Rider is showing off its latest electric bicycle known as the Rideal. The e-bike was designed to be the perfect low-cost commuter e-bike that doesn’t compromise on performance.Ariel Rider described it a bit differently:At Ariel Rider we’re known to make fast, robust, e-bikes for any type of adventure. But none of our previous models were as affordable as the Rideal!We’ve created a no-BS commuter e-bike with the high quality materials and parts we’ve been using on our other e-bikes, so that you can commute in style.The $999 Ariel Rider Rideal features a 750W rear hub motor powered by a 48V 14Ah downtube-mounted battery. With 672 Wh of capacity, Ariel Rider rates the e-bike with 30-60 miles (48-96 km) of range. The higher end of that range will of course only be achievable with pedal assist. Making liberal use of the half-twist throttle is likely to garner you closer to the lower end of that range.A 20 mph (32 km/h) max speed keeps the bike street legal as a Class 2 e-bike in the US. While some of Ariel Rider’s other e-bikes can be unlocked for higher speed, the Rideal has a hard limit of 20 mph.The 52 lb (23.5 kg) bike is available in both a mid-step and high-step variant to fit various rider heights, and both frame styles feature a 285 lb (130 kg) load rating.While some low-cost e-bikes have eschewed components like built-in LED lighting, multi-speed drivetrains, and even kickstands, the Ariel Rider Rideal includes all of those features.But to keep costs down, the typical LCD display is replaced by a simplified LED display. Simple mechanical disc brakes bring the bike to a stop, and you won’t find other fancy features like a built-in USB charging port.Options for racks and fenders are available, but they’ll cost extra. Even so, the Rideal seems to offer a nice combination of performance and features for its low $999 price.The Ariel Rider Rideal represents a new direction for the company as it expands its focus to target the budget-end of the e-bike market.Other models such as the Ride1Up Roadster V2 and Rad Power Bikes RadMission have also targeted this niche with no-nonsense commuter e-bikes built on lightweight frames and sporting pared-back features.In the past we’ve reviewed Ariel Rider’s more high-performance offerings such as the dual-motor Ariel Rider D-Class electric moped. That 33 mph (53 km/h) e-bike is focused more on the higher power end of the market, though even the D-Class was topped by Ariel Rider’s recently unveiled 3,000W all-wheel drive Grizzly e-bike.The new Ariel Rider Rideal, on the other hand, is likely to help the company stake its claim to the budget end of the e-bike spectrum.The bike is now available for pre-order with shipping expected to begin in late May.",ebikes
2021/03/07,"Electric bicycle prices have followed a bit of a roller-coaster trajectory over the last few years. While there are still several great options for low-cost e-bikes on the market, prices are currently trending back up. Here’s why. The on-going trade war between the US and China isn’t the only reason for inflated electric bicycle prices, though it certainly hasn’t helped.While exceptions were created that helped e-bikes avoid many of the tariffs over the last year, those exceptions expired on January 1 of this year.There was hope that the Biden administration would extend the tariff exceptions that included e-bikes, but that has not happened so far.In the meantime, we’ve seen several e-bike companies slowly increase prices. Some companies such as Rad Power Bikes, Juiced Bikes, Aventon Bikes, and Priority Bicycles have slowly phased out promotional pricing, effectively increasing prices back to MSRPs.Other companies that have relied on low pricing as a standard model are now raising prices slightly across the board. Ride1up is one such company that announced just this weekend that prices would increase by $100 for all of the company’s models starting on March 10.The original goal of the tariffs was to foster electric bicycle production in the United States. While we have seen rare, promising examples of US e-bike production, most of the industry agrees that large-scale e-bike manufacturing in the US is simply not capable of remaining competitive with Asian manufacturing.As Ride1Up owner Kevin Dugger explained in an email to Electrek:It’s sad to see that the product category of electric bikes, which we find are used by more than half of our buyers as an alternative transportation, is taxed at 25% while billions of dollars of unnecessary frivolous goods are allowed into the country with little to no tariff. Since bikes and e-bikes especially have their entire supply chain in Asia, it isn’t realistic for any one bike or e-bike company to begin manufacturing all of these components in the US. I don’t know a single e-bike company that manufacturers every component in-house. It would be a momentous undertaking that companies with the scale of Tesla can perhaps accomplish, but the ceiling just isn’t high enough in the world of bikes. Since 98% of all e-bikes sold in the US source their bikes or components from China, this tariff is essentially a tax on the growing ultra efficient alternative transportation industry. Which is extremely sad to see at a time when much less efficient and more environmentally costly electric cars are available with a $7,500 tax creditWhile the expiration of e-bike tariff exceptions has played a large role in the current e-bike pricing landscape in the US, it isn’t alone.Other factors are combining to put pressure on electric bicycle companies.As Bicycle Retailer reported, US companies are already dealing with shifting exchange rates that disadvantage their pricing structures. The US dollar has fallen approximately 10% compared to Chinese and Taiwanese currency in the last year.At the same time, the cost of materials used in e-bike manufacturing has risen steadily. Aluminum and steel prices are up 15% and 20%, respectively, since the beginning of 2020. Rubber costs are up 20%, and even corrugated cardboard used to make the large e-bike boxes is up 10%.Most supply chains around the world have been disrupted by COVID-19, but the electric bicycle industry was hit particularly hard due to a combination of reduced supply and unprecedented demand. The electric bicycle industry saw its largest growth ever early in the pandemic when riders everywhere began adopting e-bikes as safer socially-distant transportation alternatives and recreational escapes from lockdown-induced cabin fever.Not every e-bike retailer has followed suit with increased prices. Lectric Bikes, maker of the popular $899 Lectric XP folding fat tire e-bike, has so far managed to hold prices steady.Other companies have only raised prices selectively. Rad Power Bikes has seen some price increases, such as the now $1,599 RadRover fat tire e-bikes. Meanwhile, the company has managed to keep other prices lower, such as the $1,099 RadMission and $1,199 RadRunner.Late winter is not generally a high sales period for the electric bicycle industry, though nothing about the last 12 months has been remotely usual. Seasonal and holiday sales will likely still bring reduced prices throughout the remainder of the year, and all eyes are now on the Biden administration in hopes of seeing a new round of tariff exceptions for electric bicycles.",ebikes
2021/03/06,"Macwheel is a relative newcomer to the US e-bike market but that hasn’t stopped the company from preparing to launch its second brand of ultra affordable electric bicycles, Metakoo. The first e-bike in the model line, known as the Cybertrack, just happens to share 90% of its name with one of the most anticipated electric vehicles in the world.We first began following Macwheel late last year when the company launched a $799 electric city cruiser bike on Amazon.I reviewed that bike, as well a more mountain bike-style followup, and found both to be surprisingly good for the price.They were obviously still entry-level e-bikes with bottom-tier components, but they were a stark improvement over the previous waves of budget e-bikes we’ve seen.Now Macwheel is upping the ante with a second brand known as Metakoo. The brand’s first e-bike model, which is expected to begin sales later this month, is known as the Cybertrack 100.The 46 lb (21 kg) e-bike uses a typical aluminum urban mountain bike frame with a downtube-mounted battery. The rather low-capacity 375 Wh battery is rated for a maximum range of 40 miles (64 km) with pedal assist or 20 miles (32 km) with throttle-only operation. Both of those numbers sound a bit high, but with an expected $699 retail price, I’m inclined to forgive a somewhat lower range.E-bikes like these are designed more to democratize e-biking than for providing high performance. Riders generally trade off higher range and power (among other sacrifices) for lower retail prices.While most e-bikes of this level are paired with 2A chargers, the Cybertrack 100 will come with a higher power 4A charger that is expected to charge the battery in just 2-3 hours.A 350W continuous and 500W peak Bafang hub motor powers the rear wheel up to 20 mph (32 km/h).A small LCD display graces the handlebars, where riders will also find a half twist throttle, 7-speed Shimano shifter controlling a Shimano Tourney derailleur and mechanical brake levers for the Repute disc brakes.It is unclear who supplies the wheels or suspension fork as they are both branded “Metakoo”.A Macwheel representative informs us that the first shipments of Cybertrack 100 e-bikes for the US market has just reached US shores and is en route to the company’s local warehouse. Sales are expecting to begin sometime between March 13-17.The direct price from Metakoo will be $699. [Update: the promotional sale is over and the price is now $799, though that’s still a pretty awesome price.]The company also supplied an unveiling video for the e-bike, which you can see below.It is unclear yet if Metakoo will have any sort of US-based service and support outside of a shipping warehouse.While budget e-bikes like these can help new riders enter the e-bike world at lower prices than ever before, one area these companies often fall behind in is customer support. That’s an area that several US e-bike companies have invested heavily in over the past year.Some Asian e-bike companies are beginning to improve in this area as well. Eunorau, a company we recently covered, has set up its own headquarters in Las Vegas as a way to better serve the US market. But unless Metakoo plans to operate a team on the ground in the US, their main advantage will still likely be limited to shorter shipping times than direct-from-Asia companies.As far as cheap online e-bikes go, the Metakoo’s Cybertrack 100 seems like a pretty decent start. For $699, getting a genuine Bafang motor and 4A charger are nice features to see.The 36V 10.4Ah battery is disappointingly low capacity, but of course this is not a performance machine either.I wouldn’t begin to compare the quality of the bike to more established e-bike companies. But having tested previous Macwheel e-bikes, I would definitely say that they are a great start for someone who only has a budget of $700. While I’d love to see someone on an e-bike that costs twice as much and offers bigger batteries, higher power and nicer components, of course not everyone can afford that luxury. So it is great to see more entries in the ultra-budget end of the market that still seem to offer good value.I hate to say “I told you so” when it comes to these new Asian brands popping up this year, but I definitely called this in January. I’d expect to see this trend continue throughout the year.Oh, and the “Cybertrack” name is hilarious. I have to give them props for doing the absolute minimum amount necessary to avoid copyright infringement. That letter “a” is doing some seriously heavy lifting.",ebikes
2021/03/05,"Portland-based pXcycle has just launched the latest version of its urban electric mountain bike. They call the new pXcycle EX-C+ the “world’s most versatile e-bike,” and the bike is available for 50% off during the current launch promotion and ships worldwide.The pXCycle is available in a few different models with varying specs and accessory loadouts. They all include an urban mountain bike frame with front suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, and a mid-drive motor with a torque sensor for engaging pedal assist.The major differences between the models are the speed and power specs.The entry-level pXcycle EX-C 250 has the lowest power limit pre-programmed into the motor, limiting it to 250W of power. The bike can reach a top speed of 20 mph in the US or 25 km/h in Europe. There’s no throttle, which keeps the bike classified as a Class 1 e-bike in the US and a street-legal e-bike in Europe. The bike sports a small-ish 36V 10Ah battery, though the range is still listed as up to 60 miles (96 km) thanks to the efficient pedal assist operation of this model. On higher pedal assist settings though, expect to see lower range figures.The pXcycle EX-C 250 is currently available for $1,295, which is a 50% discount from its $2,590 MSRP. An additional $200 can upgrade you to the pXcycle EX-C+, which comes with a larger 36V 13Ah battery, integrated LED lighting and both a front and rear rack.For those seeking more power and speed, the pXcycle EX-C+ 400 is priced at $1,595 and swaps in a 48V 10Ah battery that boosts the top speed up to 28 mph (45 km/h). This model peaks at 600W of power and also includes the built-in front and rear racks as well as the integrated LED lighting.Anyone looking for the highest power will want to check out the pXcycle EX-C+ 600, which peaks at 850W of power and sports a 48V 14Ah battery. The bike also includes the same integrated LED lighting and front/rear racks as the previous “plus” models.All of the bikes can accept a throttle add-on for those that don’t want to be stuck pedaling 100% of the time. The bikes also sport backlit displays, 9-speed Shimano drivetrains, alloy pedals and all-terrain tires.In addition to the optional throttle, other upgrades include a color display, a “big boy” high-capacity battery in either 48V 21Ah (1,008 Wh) or 36V 25Ah (900 Wh) variants and a fast charger that cuts charging time in half.The e-bikes are currently available for pre-order with shipping estimated to begin in September.I had the pleasure of testing out an early prototype of the bike that was in its nearly final form, except that it still had a previous version of the motor. The bike was an awesome ride for me as a do-everything urban assault e-bike, and I’m told that the new motor is even better than the previous one. You can see my testing video below.With a powerful mid-drive motor and higher-end components than you’d expect to find at this price, the company is taking aim at some other popular urban e-bikes on the market.In a table posted on the sales page, pXcycle compares the EX-C+ to e-bikes including the Mate X, RadCity, and Juiced CrossCurrent X.I don’t know how well the range figures would hold up in a real-world heads up test as they all have fairly similar battery capacities, but the other figures such as weight, torque, and that mid-drive motor all speak for themselves.Following a trend that we’re seeing a lot of lately, pXcycle has taken to Indiegogo to launch the latest version of the EX-C series.Many electric bicycle companies follow this strategy as a way to reach a larger audience. In general, we don’t often cover crowdfunding campaigns here on Electrek unless they can meet one of two requirements: Either we have been able to test the product first to verify it works well, or the company/founder is a known entity with a proven track record in the industry. In this case, the pXcycle actually fulfills both.So while Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns may send some people running for the hills, in this case we feel pretty good about pXcycle since they’re an existing bike company and have delivered plenty of bikes to customers over the last few years.",ebikes
2021/03/04,"Porsche’s just-announced Taycan Cross Turismo isn’t the company’s only electric vehicle grabbing headlines this morning. The automaker has also just launched two new full-suspension electric bicycles designed for both the streets and the trails.The two new models, known as the Porsche eBike Sport and the Porsche eBike Cross, both feature full-suspension carbon fiber frames.Porsche claims the frame designs follow an “organic shape inspired by the lines of the Porsche Taycan.”Powering the two e-bikes is Shimano’s latest mid-drive electric motor system, the Shimano EP8. The  lightweight 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) magnesium-cased motor was unveiled late last year and boasts up to 85 Nm of torque.On the street-oriented Porsche eBike Sport, an electronic shifting Shimano transmission is paired with high-end Magura MT hydraulic disc brakes, providing exactly the kind of top-shelf component suite you’d expect from an e-bike bearing Porsche’s name.The brake levers are integrated into the handlebars to hide all wiring and cables, while the rear shock is similarly integrated into the top tube to continue the streamlined theme throughout the bike.Magura also supplied the fancy inverted front fork, while Fox provided the rear absorber. Supernova M99 high-spec LED lights are integrated into the handlebars and aerodynamic seat post, and Continental’s SpeedKing tires provide smooth rolling for urban rides. The off-road optimized Porsche eBike Cross sports a similar design but with several trail-ready components. The Magura MT trail brakes grip larger discs to produce less heat under intense braking and the mechanical Shimano XT 12-fold shifting system gives immediate fine-tune shift control that the Porsche eBike Sport’s fancier electronic shifter can’t match.The Porsche eBike Cross also gets a hydraulically operated Crankbrothers dropper post to let riders dynamically adjust seat height in the middle of a run.Both the Cross and the Sport can reach a top speed of 25 km/h under pedal assist, which is the legal limit for these types of electric bicycles across Europe.The new e-bikes will be available later this spring where they will be offered in three frame sizes at Porsche dealerships and select specialist bicycle outlets.The Porsche eBike Sport will be priced at $10,700, while the Porsche eBike Cross will be slightly more affordable at $8,549.If you have the cash for a Porsche Taycan, then you’ll likely be in the group that can at least consider a Porsche e-bike to go along with it. And Porsche has you covered if you ever want to bring them both along for the same trip.That image at the top of the article of the bikes on the rear carrier of the just announced Taycan Cross Turismo isn’t only for show. Porsche actually specially developed that carrier for the job.As the company explained:Porsche has developed a unique strong load-bearing rear carrier for the new Taycan Cross Turismo that can be easily in-stalled, and is perfectly designed for transporting the eBikes. Thanks to long wheel rails and a high payload of 50 kilograms, up to two eBikes can be mounted and the tailgate can still be opened while loaded.",ebikes
2021/03/04,"As electric bicycles continue to explode in popularity, 2021 is seeing a number of interesting and affordable designs. These e-bikes, all of which we have personally tested and reviewed, provide much of the same recreation and utility as more expensive e-bikes, yet at prices that most Americans can afford.The RadMission was unveiled as Rad Power Bikes’ most affordable e-bike to date. Available in two frame sizes and five colors, the RadMission is a metro e-bike designed for cities but that can hold its own for light trail use.When I reviewed the RadMission, I had just as much fun riding in bike lanes as I did on dusty nature trails. The pedal assist provides a nice workout, yet the bike also offers a hand throttle in case you get tired and want to zip away effortlessly.To achieve its low price of $1,099, the RadMission does make a few sacrifices such as a simplified LED display, single-speed drivetrain and slightly smaller motor and battery. But all of these compromises have also created a lighter, more streamlined e-bike that is easy on the wallet.RadMission Quick Specs:The Ride1Up Roadster V2 is one of the most affordably priced belt-drive e-bikes I’ve seen, at just $995.When I reviewed the bike, I was genuinely impressed by how light and smooth it rode, which is largely thanks to that minimalist frame and silent belt drive setup.The battery is a bit small at just 252 Wh, but it still offers a decent range thanks to its pedal assist-only operation. There’s no throttle on this one, but the five different levels of pedal assist can offer anything from a significant workout to a low-intensity joy ride.The bike has a few tradeoffs with the RadMission above, even though they are both single-speed city e-bikes. While the Roadster V2 has a smaller battery and slightly less range, it actually reaches a higher top speed and has a few nicer components, like full metal pedals and an LCD display – not to mention that belt drive!Ride1Up Roadster V2 Quick Specs: The Lectric XP isn’t nearly as light as the previous two e-bikes, but it is lighter on the wallet at just $899.The extra weight in the Lectric XP comes from its more rugged design as a fat tire folding e-bike.The Lectric XP reaches the highest top speed on this list at 28 mph (45 km/h), yet folds into a small and portable package. It has been a favorite among RVers and others who like to bring an e-bike with them on the go.The bike is available in a step-through and standard frame, making it more accessible to a wider range of riders. Shorter riders have also found it to be a comfortable height, though the seat of course adjusts up to fit taller riders as well.For such a low-cost e-bike, the Lectric XP even comes with a few nice features such as a 7-speed Shimano drivetrain, a rear rack and a full-metal fender set. The fully enclosed battery is a nice touch, too!You can see my full review of the Lectric XP here.Lectric XP Quick Specs:Ecotric is one of the better known e-bike companies on Amazon, and their claim to fame is a lineup of e-bikes that are simple, inexpensive, and just plain work. They aren’t fancy, but they get the job done for an affordable price, as I found out when I reviewed the company’s 500W fat tire e-bike.When I bought this e-bike to test it out, the price was a bit lower $850. But inflation has been at work and bumped the price up to $885, which is still a steal for these specs.The bike easily gets to 23 mph with its 500W peak motor, yet its fat tires offer a much wider range of ridable terrain. I covered fire roads, dirt trails, and paved bicycle lanes all in the same ride.The 36V system isn’t terribly overpowered, but it’s enough for fun recreational riding.All in all, this is another great option if you’re on the hunt for a full-size fat tire e-bike and don’t want to spend a fortune.Ecotric 500W Quick Specs:Rad actually made the list twice, which makes sense because they are the largest e-bike company in the US and they focus on value-based e-bikes.Another one of their high-value models is the RadRunner, which offers a more moped-style step-through frame that is high on utility. I was fortunate to be one of the first to review this e-bike, and I’m glad I was because I became immediately smitten with the thing!There is a pile of accessories you can add to the bike, such as passenger kits to carry kids (or adults!) on back, an array of racks and baskets for carrying cargo, or just about anything else you can imagine.The large battery offers plenty of range and the wide tires make it a fun e-bike to ride just about anywhere. At just $1,199, this is one of the most affordable moped-style utility e-bikes out there.The only downside I can see is that you don’t get suspension or a multi-speed transmission. If you need those two features, Rad offers the RadRunner Plus, which is likely more up your alley.RadRunner Quick Specs:",ebikes
2021/03/02,"Trek recently unveiled its new 2021 E-Caliber line of electric mountain bikes. The highest-end version of the pricey e-bike line is claimed to be the lightest full-suspension eMTB on the market.If the frame looks familiar to any fellow Trek fans, its because the E-Caliber shares the same basic setup (with necessary e-modifications) as the non-electric Supercaliber bikes. Unlike the Supercaliber, the 2021 Trek E-Caliber benefits from electric assist via the Fazua electric drive system. The Fazua systems’ main differentiator is that unlike most e-bike mid-drives that only feature removable batteries, both the Fazua battery and motor can be removed from the bike.In their place fits a downtube plug that also serves as a handy storage compartment. Without the Fazua drive installed, the bike returns to an even lighter pedal-only mountain bike.Even with the electric bike drive system installed, the 2021 E-Caliber is already exceedingly lightweight. The top-of-the-line model, known as the E-Caliber 9.9 XX1 AXS, weighs a paltry 15.75 kg (34.72 lb). For a full-suspension electric mountain bike, that’s incredibly lightweight. For those looking to shave off a few more pounds (and lose the electric assist), the bike weighs just 12.45 kg (27.45 lb) with the Fazua unit removed.The E-Caliber’s low weight is largely thanks to the bike’s carbon frame and wheels, short travel suspension, and lightweight components such as the carbon crank.The E-Caliber is designed for more cross country-style riding than pure downhill shenanigans, and thus it can get away with the lower travel suspension (120 mm front and 60 mm rear) and aggressive frame geometry. Trek is marketing the bike as more of an all-purpose electric mountain bike designed to tackle a wide range of trails and various types of riding.The lowest weight and most expensive model in the lineup is priced at an eye-watering $12,999.99, though the model line starts at a (comparatively) more reasonable $6,499.99.While the component sets climb progressively higher up the Shimano, SRAM, and RockShox hierarchy chains on the more expensive models in the E-Caliber family, all of the bikes sport the same electrical specs.The Fazua drive is rated for 250W of continuous power with a real peak rating of 450W. The 250 Wh battery is rather small compared to many other electric mountain bikes, but helps drop the weight significantly.Trek rates the battery as sufficient for up to 70 km (43.5 mi) of off-road riding in the lowest power setting.At nearly $13K, the E-Caliber 9.9 XX1 AXS still isn’t the most expensive e-bike we’ve seen in the past year, but it certainly makes it way to the front of the pack.For those seeking a more affordably priced Trek electric mountain bike, the company’s lineup starts with the Powerfly 4 at just $3,699.",ebikes
2021/03/01,"Lime, a major leader in the worldwide shared electric mobility industry, has just unveiled its latest electric bicycle model. Now the company plans to buy $50 million worth of them.The new 4th-generation Lime electric bicycle is the company’s latest electric two-wheeler to join its shared rental fleet.The new e-bike announcement comes barely a month after Lime shared plans to introduce a new electric moped into the company’s range of rentable electric vehicles.Lime’s new e-bikes include a host of novel features designed to make them both simpler to use and more functional for riders. One of the main upgrades is a new swappable battery that is interchangeable with Lime’s electric scooters.Lime refers to the new swappable battery system as “a game-changer for the micromobility industry.”The company claims that the swappable batteries will allow it to streamline its charging and positioning of vehicles. It will also help Lime reduce its carbon footprint by requiring few gas-powered vans to carry e-bikes back to a central charging location.In what may be a first in the shared e-bike industry, Lime’s new e-bike will also sport an automatic two-speed transmission that reduces the number of inputs required by riders.Other upgrades found in Lime’s latest e-bike include a more powerful electric motor for better hill-climbing assist, a built-in phone holder so riders can view GPS directions while riding and without stopping to check their phones, a new handlebar display that matches Lime’s scooter displays and maintains a standard interface across the product line, and an electric lock to replace the previous cable lock and reduce complexity.As Lime CEO Wayne Ting explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“As we build out the Lime platform to serve any trip under five miles, e-bikes are a key piece of the puzzle as a perfect option for medium-length trips. It’s why we’re making substantial investments to upgrade our world-class e-bike and bring it to more cities across the globe, providing riders a new and exciting way to leave the car behind. Shared micromobility is playing an essential role in getting cities moving again safely so we see this as a critical moment to double down on e-bikes as an open-air, socially-distanced transportation option.”Lime’s electric bicycles are currently available to rent in 25 cities around the world, but now Lime intends to extend that to 50 cities. The new Lime electric bike will launch starting this summer across cities in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.To expand the company’s e-bike footprint and roll out more next-generation electric bicycles, Lime has announced a $50 million investment in the new models.After achieving the company’s first ever profitable quarter last year, Lime is reinvesting in its e-bike program to fuel additional expansion.As the company explained further:“The $50 million investment in hardware upgrades and expansion is a result of Lime achieving its first full quarter of profitability in 2020. The investment is made possible by Lime’s focus on building quality, longer-lasting hardware, improving its operations across the world and building close relationships with cities and the communities it serves to ensure reliable, responsible and safe micromobility service.”Talk about putting your money where your mouth is!Good on Lime for doubling down so heavily on the company’s latest generation e-bike.And by the looks of it, the new e-bike seems to be a winner.The thing looks pretty darn robust. Covered brake levers for security, drum brakes for bulletproof reliability, swappable batteries to streamline operations, a headset that looks like it could survive a couple blows from a sledgehammer… it all looks pretty well up to snuff if you ask me.It sure ain’t the sexiest e-bike I’ve ever seen. The lighting seems a bit underwhelming, the removable battery juts out awkwardly, and the rest of the aesthetics are, well… sufficient? But hey, it’s a rental after all. The bike is designed to work well and be cost-effective more than anything else.The most interesting part to me is the automatic two-speed transmission. I assume that means Lime adopted the Xiongda motor, a neat little geared electric motor that incorporates an automatic shifter for low and high-speed use. It downshifts for low-speed or hill climbing and then upshifts when you get moving fast. That would mean the two speed transmission is actually in the electric drivetrain, not the pedal drivetrain. Those two are still separate systems since the bike uses a hub motor instead of a mid-drive. So your legs will still be stuck with a single-speed, but that’s probably just fine. I ride a single-speed e-bike all the time, and  the single gear ratio is fine since the motor assist makes up for the lack of low-end gearing. Single-speed e-bikes are usually geared for the higher end anyways for that exact reason. That’s a big advantage that e-bikes have over pedal bikes in the single-speed arena, they don’t need to worry about splitting the difference to maintain as much pedal torque at the bottom end.So all in all, I think Lime did a pretty good job with the company’s latest generation e-bike. But who cares what I think? Let’s hear what you think. Sound off in the comments section below so we can hear your thoughts on Lime’s new e-bike!",ebikes
2021/02/27,"As electric bicycle sales have soared to record numbers lately, fewer people are needing much convincing to get out of a car and onto a fun, energy efficient e-bike. But for the few left scratching their heads and wondering what all the fuss is about, this video is for you.The 5-minute video is technically some slick Trek Bikes marketing, though the company admirably took a very light-handed touch on the branding.I’d call the video more of an internet short.Whatever it is, the team at production company and sketch-comedy channel IFHT Films knocked this one out of the park.The video follows our protagonist as he seeks out success and happiness in his life. Having found the former, he searches for the latter by re-taking up cycling, only to remember that sweat-inducing hills ruin much of his cycling joy. As he gets passed by an electric mountain bike rider pedaling much more easily up-hill, he realizes that e-bikes are the future. And that’s not even the end. There’s comedy, there’s heartbreak, there’s even a bit of philosophical pondering. I won’t spoil the ending, but hilarity ensues throughout the entire journey and its worth a watch.Check it out yourself below.The premise of the video is of course comical, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t realistic as well.Here on Electrek, we’ve talked plenty about how easily electric bicycles can replace car trips. Just as the video’s hero takes epic rides to do mundane things like buying groceries and diapers, so too are millions of people around the world replacing car trips with fun e-bike rides.And the number is only growing. Last year saw the sales of electric bicycles absolutely skyrocket.While that explosive growth in e-bike adoption hasn’t been without its own problems, e-bike riders everywhere are contributing to the betterment of cities by reducing both pollution and congestion.There are of course those that can’t replace a car trip with an e-bike, but anyone who does improves conditions for all of us. I personally traverse the city by riding electric bicycles, e-scooters and e-motorcycles almost exclusively. My wife and I rented a car to drive four hours away for a vacation this winter, but otherwise we mostly get around the city on my two-seater NIU electric scooter.And while Trek pokes a bit of fun at more budget-level electric bicycles, cheaper options are making e-bikes accessible to more riders than ever before. At the same time, premium e-bikes like those made by Trek are also helping to expand the market of longer-lasting, more reliable daily-use e-bikes.These days there’s an e-bike out there for everyone. And if you’ve considered testing one out as a way to leave your car in the garage or to get more exercise, then there’s never been a better time!",ebikes
2021/02/26,"EUNORAU is staking their claim of the American wilderness, with the release of their updated FAT-HS bike. With dual suspension, dual batteries, and an overpowered mid-drive motor, the bike is perfectly capable of carrying staunch adventurers back to nature. If you ever wanted to get out on single track trails, this wouldn’t be the bike to do it. But for fire roads and even commuting to the trail, you’re in the right place with this beastly heavy bike. Check out the video below, where you can see a day’s adventure on the FAT-HS.This is really where the FAT-HS shines. The dual suspension makes riding off-road much more comfortable, but also offers a lot better control of the terrain with a decent spring suspension and four pivot design in the rear. The suspension system isn’t going to win any awards for innovation, but it’s adequate for the girth of the bike and mild to moderate off-road trails. Fire roads were amazing on this bike, as it could pick up some speed, spread out across the gravel, and even jump some potholes going up hill. When I took the bike on single track trails, I started to see the limitation, based solely on size. Rocking 2 batteries, the bike weighs almost 80 lbs. Riding the FAT-HS up a slender path is going to feel like threading a needle with spaghetti. Riding down hill is going to feel like being in a bar fight. With the right path, you’d feel right at home taking the FAT-HS to a distant campground usually accessible from four-wheelers and Wranglers. Just be sure you pack light, because…Justifying the FAT-HS as a commuter bike is going to require some stretching. The bike does have an integrated front light, and a separate red tail light. But the business stops there. The rear triangle is compatible with some kind of rear rack, but I couldn’t find one on Amazon that fit. Full-size fenders would have a hard time mounting on the rear, since the tire tolerance is pretty tight, but universal ones would work just fine. Aside from the accessories, commuting on the FAT-HS would be difficult, since the bike would beckon you to jump it off into the trail somewhere, making you very happy, and very late. You’d totally crush that commute though.In my case in Salt Lake City, I could commute about 10 miles to the trail, bike for about 10 miles in the thickets, and make it back home using full throttle all the way. Any other bike I’ve aimed at taking on those trails required planning, shuttling, or downright non-electric pedaling to ensure I could make the whole trek. Maximum range is stated as 80 miles, but with a 30mph top speed and a highly tempting throttle, I know I wouldn’t see 80 miles in a day. Come to think of it, I don’t want to be on a bike seat that long.Comfort could be a big attraction for this bike. The fat tires and dual suspension make for a plush ride on the street or trail. Unfortunately, the seat and stiff seat-post are aiming for adventure. With a touch of customization, (changing the seat and maybe the seat-post), the bike would be comically soft. Some folks have medical or rehabilitation concerns that a stiff bike simply can’t address, and if you’re concerned about getting too far without enough battery to come home again, then you might be in the right place.I wish this bike had a torque sensor instead of the cadence pedal assist. This is a feature that turns on the bike as you pedal. The cadence pedal assist feels like a throttle activated by your feet, doling out power based on pedal spinning speed. A nice torque-based system feels much more natural and rewarding, doling out power evenly compared to the amount of force your feet apply to the pedals. With this heavy of a bike, I would have preferred a torque system for stop lights on the road, and sudden stops when keeping track off-road. I realize it’s extra cost, and I wound up using the throttle most of the time anyway. I don’t particularly like the display and control pad. The display is quite large compared to the limited information it shows you. In contrast, the control pad for the display is strangely small, and the small, square buttons feel like they were taken from a Blackberry phone.Waka Waka Waka! I dig the internal battery mount. I’ve seen various internal battery systems with varying user-friendliness. Even the likes of Haibike and Yamaha had trouble. Making a battery fit snug in the bike, be easily accessible, look decent, and have a usable capacity is a tall order. The Nireeka bike also missed the mark on internal battery ease-of-use. EUNORAU got it right on the FAT-HS. The internal battery is tight, easy to take in and out, looks good, has a great protection plate, and a decent capacity of 48v and 14Ah. The optional, external battery hit a bit of a snag. The secondary battery uses a common Hailong mount, found on all sorts of bikes. In the case of the FAT-HS, a little bit of DIY was in order to get the perfect fit. I covered this part in the video, so I’ll refer you to the 7:00 mark where I go over the fix.I like the FAT-HS as a back-country adventure bike on larger, longer trails. For the sheer equipment on this bike, the price is pretty competitive at $3,199 as you saw in the video. As a daily driver, I think I would prefer something a bit more conventional, but if you want to turn heads to showboat a little bit, then this bike is sure to get some attention.",ebikes
2021/02/23,"You may remember Mastretta from the first ever entirely made-in-Mexico sports car, the Mastretta MXT. Now the brothers behind the automotive design company are tackling e-bikes, and they’re doing it with the same sporty focus they’ve drawn on in the past. The result is the newly launched Mastretta MX3 electric bike.The Mastretta MX3 isn’t a typical e-bike though. It’s not even a typical e-trike.The three-wheeler uses a tadpole trike design with a pair of wheels in the front, but also incorporates a leaning mechanism and suspension into the front end.Leaning trikes provide the ride sensation of a typical two-wheel e-bike yet offer increased stability and convenience inherent to a three-wheeled design. Mastretta’s Tilt Lock System (TLS) allows the rider to lock the MX3 in the vertical position whenever necessary. This can be useful at stop lights so that the rider doesn’t have to put his or her feet down to balance, or to maintain stability when loading or unloading cargo.Equipped as a cargo e-bike, the Mastretta MX3 offers three locations for cargo storage: in the front, middle, and rear of the frame.To help slow the bike quickly even when hauling heavy loads, all three wheels are equipped with hydraulic disc brakes.The battery is mounted as low as possible in the frame to help reduce the center of gravity. Both the fore and middle cargo areas are also fairly low, though the rear cargo rack seems to put the weight fairly high above that rear wheel.The cargo bike is actually available in four different models that offer different features and payload limits:The different models with various accessories can be seen below.All of the models run on 36V systems. The MX3 CARGO 40 uses a hub motor while the other models sport Bafang mid-drive units. Both the MX3 CARGO 40 and 60 offer either a 360 Wh or 720 Wh battery, while the larger two models offer options for 720 Wh or 1,440 Wh batteries.Tilting electric cargo trikes are fairly uncommon, though interesting examples occasionally pop up on our radar.Typical long tail electric cargo bikes are more common by far, even if they don’t offer the same level of cargo capacity or the ability to carry cargo as low in the frame as the Mastretta MX3.There’s no word yet on pricing, but we’ll be sure to update as soon as we learn more. Until then, let’s hear what you think of Mastretta’s MX3 electric cargo bike design in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/02/21,"Folding e-bikes certainly offer unique advantages, but they also comprise a series of compromises thanks to their small frames and wheels. Full-size folding bicycle manufacturer Montague is turning that idea on its head, though, launching the M-E1 full-size folding electric bicycle designed for city riders.While full-size folding e-bikes aren’t entirely new, most of the sporadic examples we’ve seen are on the lower end of the quality ladder. Montagues’ M-E1 bucks that trend, combining a leading mid-drive electric motor with a nice suite of bicycle components to create a high-quality, full-size commuter e-bike that can still fold to fit in a closet.The company describes the M-E1 as the “world’s first full-size performance foldable e-bike.” The 10-speed bike rides on large 700c wheels wearing Schwalbe Energizer 47 mm tires. The Shimano STEPS E6100 mid-drive motor is paired with a high-end Shimano Deore transmission and matching Deore hydraulic disc brakes.The 418 Wh battery is a bit below average compared to other e-bikes in the industry, but the pedal assist-only design of the bike still lends itself to efficient riding. That battery is still likely going to net riders over 40 miles (or 64 km) of range with a decent amount of pedal assist.Built-in Herrmans LED lighting, full coverage mud guards, and VP folding pedals round out the key feature list.The true key feature, though, is of course the folding frame. The step-through design increases accessibility while hiding the folding mechanism right at the base of the frame.Activating the mechanism folds the bike in half, where it can be tipped up onto one wheel and pushed or pulled like a shopping cart. The weight of the bike (a fairly easy 54 lb or 24 kg)  is supported by the kickstand during folding, so you don’t need to awkwardly prop it up on your leg while operating the quick release. A second folding mechanism can fold the handlebars down if you need the bike to be extra slim to fit in a car trunk or similar. It’s actually a pretty slick design – check it out in the video below.The Montague ME-1 is now available at select retailers across the US and will be rolling out more extensively this spring.The bike carries an MSRP of $3,599, a price that includes a five-year warranty on the frame and a two-year warranty on the electric drive components. Montague has several dealers but also ships partially assembled directly to customers or fully assembled at a local bike shop in a customer’s area.Full-size folding e-bikes have long interested me as a way to bring more e-bike accessibility to people living in dense urban centers.I haven’t lived in a traditional house with a garage in 13 years, so I definitely understand the limited space apartment-living lifestyle. It can be difficult to fit a full-size e-bike into that situation, which can be a bummer since not everyone wants a smaller 20″ or less wheel.Montague’s M-E1 looks like an elegantly designed solution to that problem, and a solution that perhaps offers the fewest compromises of all. I could nitpick about Shimano’s battery looking fairly 2016, but by and large, I’m fairly happy with what I’m seeing here.That said, I haven’t had a chance to test the e-bike in the flesh yet, so I can’t comment too intelligently on that front quite yet. I will be testing one soon, though, so I’ll be sure to report back here on Electrek with the complete riding experience.Until then, I want to hear your thoughts.

2021/02/19,"It’s been a big start to the year for US-based electric bicycle companies seeking large investments. The latest eight-digit funding deal is heading SUPER73’s way and will help the company build upon the massive growth that their moped-style e-bike sales saw in 2020.Orange County, California-based SUPER73 landed the $20 million investment from Volition Capital, a Boston-based growth equity firm.SUPER73 is one of the more visible e-bike brands in the US, and has long prided itself on its A-list celebrity and athlete customers, in addition to tens of thousands of riders it has gained over the company’s less than five years of operations. The company regularly hosts riding events around the world and promotes a strong community vibe among its riders, who have embraced the brand as a lifestyle product as much as a transportation device.Originally launched with a successful Kickstarter campaign, SUPER73 was one of the first companies to embrace the moped-style e-bike with a long bench seat, open mini-bike frame, and extra-wide 20-inch tires.The e-bike brand saw massive growth in 2020 along with the rest of the e-bike industry, fueled by much of the world seeking socially distant ways to get out of the house and explore their cities on e-bikes.As SUPER73 cofounder and CEO Legrand Crewse explained:We have always known that there was something special at SUPER73. It wasn’t just about creating a fun electric bike, it was about building a gateway to unlimited adventure and cultivating a true community. Volition Capital not only saw that same vision but believed in it. Together, we now have a real opportunity to take SUPER73 to the next level and help redefine the electric vehicle industry.SUPER73 used 2020 to unveil several news models, including the company’s first full suspension 2,000W electric bikes known as the R-Series.The SUPER73 S2 was also unveiled, updating the classic design that launched the brand years before.Now SUPER73 is sharing how they plan to use the new windfall to grow the brand.As the company explained:SUPER73 grew exponentially last year, but 2021 is the year when that growth will be turned into a sustainable new model of business, with a structure that allows us to compete with the biggest players in the game and achieve our dream of turning this small American start-up into a major player on the global stage. We know that we build a fantastic product backed by an amazing community, but we also know that we have areas where we can rise to meet your expectations.With the help of Volition and its investment, we will be able to build upon the foundation we have started and make every process surrounding your SUPER73 as enjoyable as the e-bike riding experience is. Every department within SUPER73 is about to get the love and attention it needs.The three areas of our business most strained by the rapid growth experienced in 2020 were customer service, production, and supply chain. As such, these are the areas where we will most heavily invest and focus on.SUPER73 isn’t the only company to land a huge investment at the beginning of 2021. Rad Power Bikes recently announced its own $125-million investment to help it continue expanding operations. Both SUPER73 and Rad Power Bikes represent some of the largest players in the industry, but smaller e-bike companies are also finding investors lining up with deep pockets. UK-based FuroSystems announced their own new funding round of £750,000 last week.As investors continue to eye the skyrocketing sales seen in the electric bicycle industry, we fully expect to see more major funding announcements on the horizon.",ebikes
2021/02/18,"Electric bicycles are known for a lot of things, but shaving off the pounds isn’t one of them. That makes the incredibly lightweight HPS Domestique one of a very select few e-bikes known for their incredibly low-weight setups.I won’t bury the lede here for you.The newly unveiled HPS Domestique tips the scales at a featherweight 8.5 kg (18.7 lb).The ultra-svelte electric road bike is the creation of Monaco-based HPS, and features some pretty slick e-bike tech.The motor is a 200W unit hidden in the bike’s seat tube. It is built using German and Swiss components and offers up to 20 Nm of torque across six different pedal assist levels. That’s not a lot of power or torque compared to other electric road bike’s we’ve seen, but it’s also an entirely invisible e-bike drive unit. There’s no visible motor and most people would be hard-pressed to ever spot the HPS Domestique as an electric bike.Part of that camouflage comes from the neatly hidden battery. Other stealthy e-bikes we’ve tested can get away with hiding their batteries in a slightly chunky downtube. But the HPS Domestique’s handmade carbon frame doesn’t offer that chunky downtube for battery concealment. Instead, the company cleverly hid the battery elsewhere. You see that water bottle? As you may have guessed, that’s not really a water bottle. It’s a 193 Wh battery that offers up to three hours of assist on the lowest pedal assist level, and recharges in just two hours.What kind of range does that equate to? Nobody knows, since HPS gives us that vague time-based range rating. But assuming an ultra-efficient 2 Wh/km, that could mean a range of 96.5 km (60 miles). I’m not an overly athletic cyclist and I’ve maintained 2 Wh/km before, so real athletes are likely to see even higher ranges than that.HPS also offers an even smaller 85 Wh battery that recharges in just one hour. The smaller battery has the added benefit of being airline approved, meaning you can easily fly with your e-bike.The European-built e-bike conforms to EU e-bike regulations, meaning it is limited to a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). HPS also mentions that “the system will be set to the laws for the country of order. In Europe, this means that assistance from the system will stop at 25Kph. Any tampering with this speed limit, for instance by fitting aftermarket devices, will invalidate the warranty.” So I guess that means good news, the motor can actually power the e-bike to even higher speeds!I hope you’re sitting down at this point, because here comes the price. The Domestique will cost you €12,000, which is USD $14,449 at today’s exchange rate.That’s a pretty penny.But to be fair, you of course can’t expect the lightest electric bicycle in the world to come cheap. Or at least the lightest-production electric bicycle in the world, since technically the one-off Freicycle e-bike was a bit lighter at 6.872 kg (15.15 lb).We’ve also seen some other interesting lightweight e-bikes before, such as the 10 kg (23 lb) Hummingbird folding electric bicycle.What do you think of the HPS Domestique? Will you be cruising around Europe on your featherweight Monaco-made e-bike? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!via: NewAtlas",ebikes
2021/02/17,"San Diego-based Ride1Up has long impressed me with its value-priced electric bikes. And the company’s Ride1Up Roadster V2 is the ultimate example of a value-packed e-bike, sporting fast speeds and a silent belt-drive setup for just $995!When it comes to fancier e-bikes, Ride1Up has you covered with the Ride1Up LMT’D. But when you’re after something that is light, simple, and affordable, the Ride1Up Roadster V2 that I’m reviewing today definitely hits the spot!It isn’t perfect, and we’ll certainly talk about its few shortcomings below, but this is by and large an awesome e-bike that packs great performance and features into a sleek package.You’ll of course want to see some fun and action-packed riding shots in my review video below. Then read on for my full thoughts on this awesome belt-drive electric bike.Let’s start with appearances. The Ride1Up Roadster V2 e-bike is so nicely designed that you almost don’t even realize it is an electric bike at first. The battery is elegantly hidden away in the downtube of the frame and the handlebars are largely free of clutter thanks to that minimalist display. The only tell-tale sign that this urban runabout is sporting electric assist comes from the 500W hub motor tucked away in the rear wheel.Everything else just looks like a classic, minimalist commuter. I’d call it almost hipster-spec, except that the belt drive screams new age, not vintage hipster vibes.Of course this isn’t some fancy and expensive Gates carbon belt drive, so I’m not sure it’s got a 50,000 mile lifespan like the leader of the pack. But it still gives you that low-noise, maintenance-free ride that makes belt drives so popular. And it does it a price us average Joes can afford. Not like those hoity-toity, elitist belt drives. This is a belt drive that you could go have a beer with.A far as e-bikes go, the Ride1Up Roadster V2 is a featherweight. A mere 32 lb (14.5 kg) is nothing in the electric bicycle world. I’ve ridden several e-bikes that weigh literally three times as much.The low weight combined with the wide open diamond frame make it easy to toss the e-bike over your shoulder and jog up a flight of stairs.Despite the minimalist design though, the Roadster V2 still gets up to a sprightly 24 mph (38 km/h) at full bore. You’ll need to be in the highest pedal assist setting to get there (or just give it a good hard pedal in the lower pedal assist levels).There’s no throttle on this e-bike, as the relatively small 252 Wh battery would be drained fairly quickly. But pedal assist normally squeezes out around twice as much range as throttle operation, so the half-size battery still provides a comparable range to most other e-bikes I’ve tested, at around 20-35 miles.The motor is rated at 350W continuous and 500W peak. In the lower pedal assist levels, you’re definitely doing the lion’s share of the work. But when you max it out, the 500W of power is palpable. This is definitely still an assist e-bike, not a mini motorbike like many other throttle-powered e-bikes. But assuming you’re already cool with pedaling, the Ride1Up Roadster V2 gives you enough pedal assist variation among the different levels to fit either a workout session on low-power end or a short brisk ride to work without breaking a sweat on the high-power end of the pedal assist range.The single-speed drivetrain might be a turnoff for some, but I was surprised by how well it fit my riding style. While non-electric single speed e-bikes can feel sluggish to start, the Roadster V2’s motor made the first few pedal revolutions easy and compensated for the downsides of single-speeds on dead starts.The Ride1Up Roadster V2 is an easy bike to ride because there just isn’t much to it. There are no gears to shift since it is a single speed. There’s no derailleur to tune, there’s no chain to clean (or to dirty up your ankle), there’s just not a lot to this bike.The brakes aren’t fancy but they work well and bring the bike to a quick stop. The cables are also so short that you’re not likely to see much cable stretch, further reducing the amount of maintenance. I imagine you’ll eventually need to tune them over time, but it isn’t likely to be a common struggle.The bike’s touch points are another nice feature. Not only is the saddle so much more comfortable than I expected a budget e-bike’s saddle to be, but the minimalist display’s buttons are actually easy to reach while riding. That’s not always a given, and some displays make it annoying to stab at the pedal assist buttons while bouncing around on the road. But with the Roadster V2, you can easily shift through pedal assist levels without even looking down. The buttons are right where your thumb can reach them by feel without releasing the handlebar.At $995 including shipping, it’s hard to beat this e-bike on value. You get a fast, fun, and lightweight e-bike for a killer price.But there are still a few things missing.For one, you’ll likely want to add a kickstand. This is another trend we’re starting to see with low-cost e-bikes: They lack kickstands to save a few more bucks.If you always park at a bike rack and don’t mind leaning the bike up, then you’ll probably be fine without one (and will enjoy shaving off a few more grams of weight). But for me, the ability to park anywhere without needing a wall or pole to lean on is worth the extra half pound and the $11.Next, there are no lights on the e-bike. Since this is such a great commuter e-bike, lights are an important piece of kit. You’ll definitely want to add some. Again, $11 for some cheap bike lights makes a big difference over… an invisible bike at night.Lastly, there are no fenders. The good news though is that there are eyelets so you can add some if you live in rainy areas.So my only real gripes are on the lack of included accessories. But since those aren’t used by all riders, I can see the logic in offering a low-priced entry-level model and then allowing riders to add only the accessories they need.The Roadster V2 is exactly what you want in an urban e-bike: a lightweight, fast, and nimble ride that combines ease of use with easy maintenance.If you like pedaling and want a fun, minimalist e-bike, this could be the one for you.If you require a throttle or a 7-speed transmission, you’ll want to keep looking.For me, the Ride1Up Roadster V2 is a great balance that finally brings affordable belt-drive e-bikes to the masses.",ebikes
2021/02/16,"Revel may have made its name in pay-by-the-minute electric moped rentals, but now the company is targeting longer-term rentals on smaller electric vehicles: e-bikes.Revel announced today a new monthly subscription service called Coast by Revel that will offer electric bicycles to riders for $99/month.The price includes drop-off and pickup of the e-bike, an included lock and any necessary maintenance or repairs. If maintenance is required, a Revel team member will arrive within 24 hours to repair the e-bike.Riders can rent the e-bikes month-to-month and cancel at any time.The e-bikes can reach up to 20 mph (32 km/h) on pedal assist or throttle, and can cover as much as 45 miles (72 km) on a single charge. If the battery does run out during a ride, the e-bike can still be pedaled just like a standard bicycle.The e-bikes are supplied by WING Bikes, an NYC-based electric bicycle company. We’ve previously reviewed one of the company’s e-bikes and found them to be a cost-effective and slick-looking way to get around town with minimal effort.WING Bikes recently updated its electric bicycle lineup as well, offering new models with more advanced features, yet still keeping prices relatively low at just $1,298.Revel is banking on the fact that many potential e-bike riders don’t actually want to deal with the particulars of owning an e-bike, but still want a dedicated e-bike that isn’t shared with every other rider on the street. It’s a method that has been employed by more premium-level electric scooter companies as well, and has proven popular with a certain segment of riders.Revel will begin operating the service in NYC in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The wait list opens today on Revel’s site and mobile app, and service is expected to begin in early March. There is no word yet about expanding the service, but Revel also began its electric moped sharing service in NYC before expanding to several other cities across the country.As Revel cofounder and CEO Frank Reig explained in a statement provided to Electrek:Revel’s mission is to electrify cities and our e-bike subscription program is the next piece of the puzzle. We’re excited to give more New Yorkers the experience of e-bike ownership without the hassles and to roll out our third product in our hometown.WING Bike’s founder Seth Miller also expanded on the partnership:WING Bikes designs and manufactures e-bikes that are built for city streets and make cycling easy and fun for urban riders. Revel’s new subscription model expands accessibility even further by lowering the barriers to entry for e-bike use, and we are pleased to partner with them to provide e-bikes to New Yorkers on a month-to-month basis. Our shared vision is to transform mobility and bring a low-cost, safe, fun and environmentally friendly way to move around cities.Revel also partnered with helmet maker FEND to offer subscription members a discount on FEND’s folding helmet.I really like these monthly subscription services because I think they fit the needs of many riders better than all of those by-the-minute rental services.Many riders want to know that they have a bike waiting for them each day – not that they have to start hunting around for an available e-bike when they are already running late to work.Riders also want to know that their e-bike is in good condition and not hope that the previous rider didn’t run it into a wall earlier that day.I just hope Revel has a good path to profitability here. I think $99/month is a fair price to rent what is admittedly an expensive machine. But at a certain point, the economics start to favor ownership over rentals – especially when the cost of a year of renting is the same as a year of owning. A major use case that I can foresee is riders beginning to rent these e-bikes in the spring and then riding for six or seven months until it gets cold again before canceling their subscriptions. I’m not sure that half a year is enough for Revel to break even on these e-bikes. But hey, maybe they know something I don’t.I wish them the best of luck, and I think that this is a great opportunity for riders who don’t want to lay out four figures for an e-bike but still want their own private ride.I also think it’s just kind of funny that just a few weeks after e-bike/e-scooter rental company Lime announced it was going to start renting out the same e-mopeds that Revel popularized, here comes Revel announcing they are going to horn in on some of Lime’s e-bike action. Touché!",ebikes
2021/02/12,"Even though Gocycle-founder Richard Thorpe doesn’t work at McLaren anymore, he took his automotive engineering experience with him when he began his own high-end electric bicycle company.That has led to a very sophisticated series of urban-oriented commuter e-bikes under the Gocycle brand.Designed and produced in the United Kingdom, Gocycle’s e-bikes have offered innovative designs with exotic materials. But they aren’t just fancy for fancy’s sake. Advances like the completely enclosed drivetrain to eliminate most maintenance and single-supported quick-release wheels that can support tire changes while still on the bike have made Gocycle’s e-bikes easier to own and use.Now we’re getting a look at the latest innovation in the Gocycle lineup, the Gocycle G4.The company’s fourth-generation model line is said to incorporate an all-new carbon front fork that is built around the brand new G4Drive motor system.So far, we’re only getting a teaser image of the upper part of the fork, which you can see below.Unlike most e-bikes, the Gocycle hides its motor in the front wheel, meaning that the motor is just out of view in the teaser image. Most people don’t even realize the motor is in the wheel as it is cleverly incorporated into the hub in a way that doesn’t look like the other 99.9% of hub motors we see every day.The new fourth-generation Gocycle e-bikes will be available in three variations and will replace the previous GX and GXi models.We previously reviewed the Gocycle GX and found it to be quite effective as a lightweight and high-tech folding e-bike designed for city commuters that are serious about a no-muss, no-fuss e-bike.You can see that review video below, which should give you a taste for the type of e-bikes we’re talking about here.The fourth-generation bikes are actually already in production to prepare for deliveries starting this Spring.We don’t know the tech specs yet, but we do have pricing info.As we mentioned, Gocycle has always been a premium-priced e-bike brand. But having ridden the bikes, I can confirm that you actually get a premium product. Not only do you get nice parts like the internally geared rear hub, hydraulic disc brakes, internal wiring, electronic predictive shifting, sealed drivetrain, injection-formed magnesium frame, innovative folding mechanism that allows the bike to roll like a piece of luggage, hidden bike tool in the saddle, built-in frame lighting and other cool features, but the bikes actually ride really nicely, too. The rear suspension and large air volume tires make the bikes comfortable to use in addition to being slickly built.Designer and founder Richard Thorpe explained a bit more about the upcoming fourth generation bikes:“It’s been more than a decade since we launched the iconic G1 Gocycle in 2009. Every year we see unique and different bicycle and e-bike designs hit the market, but very few stand the test of time and go on to develop year on year. As a pioneer in the e-bike industry, I’m proud to be announcing our 4th generation design – the Gocycle G4! Our generation four Gocycle range not only sets a new standard for Gocycle, but will raise the bar for all of our competitors in the folding electric bike segment. What’s really exciting to me is that G4 has the potential to challenge traditional non-folding e-bikes. When it comes to storage and security, there’s no compromise with a fast e-folder and Gocycle’s acclaimed riding dynamics just got even better with G4!  It’s the most significant step change in development we have ever made and I cannot wait to reveal more details!” ",ebikes
2021/02/11,"FuroSystems has just unveiled the company’s latest urban commuter e-bike, the Aventa.Fresh off a £750,000 funding round, the British electric mobility company FuroSystems is adding the lightweight Aventa to its lineup.At just 16.5 kg (36 lb), the aluminum alloy e-bike is certainly on the lightweight end of the e-bike spectrum. While we’ve seen lighter e-bikes before, it usually takes a carbon frame to get below this level.Three different Aventa models are available with frame-integrated Samsung batteries ranging from 281 Wh up to 504 Wh. In the highest-capacity configuration, FuroSystems claims a maximum range of 80 km (50 miles). The Aventa is a pedal assist-only e-bike, and thus the lack of throttle helps it achieve higher autonomy figures when kept in the lowest pedal assist level.Interestingly, FuroSystems also provided a full-power range of 55 km (34 miles). Very few companies provide range ratings in the highest pedal assist level, so this is a welcome deviation from the norm.The bike is clearly designed for pedaling and sports a 9-speed Shimano transmission. There’s no torque sensor on this budget-priced e-bike, but the extra gears compared to many 7-speed e-bikes may help find favor among riders.Hydraulic disc brakes are another upgrade compared to most other European e-bikes in this price range. The Aventa starts at £1,399 (approximately USD $1,935) and includes a free fender set and rear rack accessory package. FuroSystems compares the Aventa to other European e-bikes from Cowboy and VanMoof competing in a similar market, with the Aventa priced around £400 (USD $550) lower.All three bikes offer sleek urban designs, integrated lighting, hidden cables, and frame-enclosed batteries.And all three are also hamstrung by Europe’s strict e-bike laws, meaning the Aventa tops out at 25 km/h (15.5 mph). The Bafang-manufactured rear hub motor also gets the 250W-sticker treatment, though the company lists the motor as having a peak wattage of 500W. A US-market version will be available later this year with a more powerful motor rating and a higher speed limit of 32 km/h (20 mph).FuroSystems is also known for its carbon-fiber Furo X folding e-bike, which it positions as a cheaper alternative to fancier GoCycle and Brompton e-bikes, and which appears to have replaced the company’s previous eTura folding e-bike (review below).",ebikes
2021/02/09,"Federal legislation was introduced today to create a federal tax incentive for the purchase of electric bicycles in the US.Electric cars and motorcycles already have their own federal tax incentives in the US, and now electric bicycles may be next.That’s thanks to the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act, which has been spearheaded by Representatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Jimmy Panetta (D-CA).The new legislation is designed to make electric bicycles more affordable to average Americans.As Congressman Panetta explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“E-bikes are not just a fad for a select few, they are a legitimate and practical form of transportation that can help reduce our carbon emissions. My legislation will make it easier for more people from all socio-economic levels to own e-bikes and contribute to cutting our carbon output. By incentivizing the use of electric bicycles to replace car trips through a consumer tax credit, we can not only encourage more Americans to transition to greener modes of transportation, but also help fight the climate crisis.”Electric bicycles offer much of the same environmental and societal advantages as typical pedal bicycles, yet are easier for riders to adopt thanks to an electric assist motor providing pedaling support.In the US, they typically reach speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with pedal assist support or 20 mph (32 km/h) with a hand throttle, which doesn’t require pedaling and can allow the e-bike to function as more of an electric moped.If the E-BIKE Act is eventually signed into law, it would offer a 30% tax credit of up to $1,500 for buying an electric bicycle. To qualify, the electric bicycle would have to be priced below $8,000. The vast majority of electric bicycles sold in the US are priced well below that level and thus would qualify for up to a $1,500 tax credit. Only one tax credit can be applied during a three-year period, but couples filing jointly could apply for two tax credits in three years to cover two e-bike purchases.Electric bicycle sales skyrocketed in the US last year. With prices usually in the several thousand dollar range, though, many Americans who could benefit from e-bikes as sustainable transportation alternatives are otherwise unable to afford them.As PeopleForBikes CEO Jenn Dice explained:“Incentivizing electric bicycles makes them a competitive transportation option for more Americans and supports a national effort to lower carbon emissions. The E-BIKE Act rightfully positions electric bicycles as a critical part of a larger solution to climate change and equitable mobility. We’re grateful to Congressman Panetta for leading the charge in Congress.”This is incredible news. While this legislation has a long way to go and likely faces a steep uphill battle, the benefits for Americans and for the environment could be so vast that they are hard to even imagine.A new wave of low-cost electric bicycles such as the popular $899 Lectric XP and the $1,099 Rad Power Bikes RadMission have already helped fuel increased e-bike adoption. More expensive yet more capable e-bikes like the $2,499 Juiced HyperScorpion have given Americans a taste of how higher-powered e-bikes can become fully-fledged commuting machines. And hybrid fitness/transport e-bikes like the $3,350 Specialized Turbo Vado SL and high-tech e-bikes like the $3,329 GoCycle GX have helped bring high-end e-bikes into the range of affordability for more riders. Now imagine knocking 30% off of all of these prices. It is within the realm of possibility!The main sticking point for this legislation is likely the cost, though it may not be as expensive as it seems. It is estimated that the US imported around 600,000 electric bicycles last year. With some back of the envelope math assuming an average price of $1,500 per e-bike, a 30% tax credit would cost around $270 million. That’s barely two F-35 jets. Who would miss two jets?!Or I’ve got an idea. We could tax the rich to make up for it. Now wait, hear me out… You see, here’s the thing: They have a lot of money. Basically, there’s so much upside to this, and the lost tax revenue would be easy to find elsewhere. I say, let’s do it!",ebikes
2021/02/09,"Portland-based PXCycle’s E-XC series of urban electric mountain bikes was already popular with its rider base. But now the bike shop is launching a new version of the e-bike that takes it another step further.With a new mid-drive motor and the same rugged utility-oriented design, this is an e-bike you’ll definitely want to check out.There are multiple models of the PXCycle E-XC+. Below are the specs for the version I tested.A new version of the E-XC+ in several different configurations will debut on March 2nd via Indiegogo [Update, it has launched here]. While we often think of Indiegogo campaigns as belonging in the “brand-new startup” category, many established e-bike brands turn to the platform to build a buzz for new launches. PXCycle is already a respected brand and a trusted Portland bike shop, and the company was kind enough to let us test an early version of the bike before the new model goes on sale. The bike we tested was almost the exact configuration that we’ll see at launch, with the exception of PXCycle upgrading to a newer mid-drive unit. And while I didn’t get to try the bike with the new motor, I have tried that motor on another e-bike and can attest to its power and performance.In my opinion, urban electric bicycles can be divided into two main groups: Easy-going bike lane e-bikes and full-on urban assault e-bikes. The PXCycle E-XC+ is the latter. There’s nothing wrong with a nice metro e-bike built for efficient city pedaling. I actually own a couple in my personal e-bike quiver. But when you need to get a bit more… freestyle with your city riding, that’s where an urban mountain bike comes in. They borrow from the mountain bike world with similar components and frame geometries, yet are optimized for the concrete jungle.Instead of weaving around trees, they’re built for weaving around parking meters and phone poles. Instead of hopping over roots, these e-bikes are built for hopping curbs. And instead of ferrying you to the mountain top, these e-bikes are designed to ferry you and your gear to work.That’s exactly the type of ride I got from the PXCycle E-XC+.The bike combines a potent mix of two worlds. The long travel suspension fork absorbs all the abuse you can throw at it, yet you get a nice set of urban fenders tucked underneath it. The Shimano disc brakes bite hard like I’d want on the trails, but are paired with sticky street rubber to bring you to a stop quickly on the asphalt. The forward-riding position gives you aggressive control like a mountain bike, yet the frame still sports both a front and rear rack for ultimate utility.It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Or a mountain e-bike in an urban utility e-bike’s clothing.Then there’s that powerful mid-drive motor. As I mentioned, here I’m testing an early version of the bike that still used the 500W Shenyi mid-drive motor, but I’ve previously ridden an e-bike with the motor used in the new version of the E-XC+. I can personally attest that it is a powerful, torquey motor that can give the European heavyweights a run for their money.Technically it is listed as a 600W motor on the 48V version of the PXCycle E-XC+, but it is running at 20A paired with a 48V battery, meaning you’re pulling a peak power of 960W straight out of the battery. As with all e-bikes, who knows how much power that translates to at the rear wheel? But suffice it to say that the motor feels stronger than you’d expect from a conventional mid-drive setup.The 48V battery is a 528 Wh unit with a real-world range of somewhere between 20-50 miles (32-80 km), depending on whether you’re using pedal assist or throttle. When the new version of the E-XC+ launches on Indiegogo in a few more weeks, there will be an option to upgrade to a larger 816Wh battery for around $125 extra. If you can swing it, having that extra battery is always nice to ensure you’ve got surplus range. And if you’re heavy on the throttle, you’ll definitely enjoy having a bigger battery pack.The built-in torque sensor in the mid-drive motor unit means that pedal assist is quick and responsive, offering natural-feeling assist that you won’t get from a cheaper cadence-based sensor. The 8-speed Shimano Altus transmission also gives you a nice mix of gear range and quality, coming in above the lower-tier derailleurs we often see on affordably priced mid-drive e-bikes. And for those that like having a throttle for extra help at the bottom of a hill or just to give your legs a breather, you’ll be happy to find one waiting for you on the handlebars. I know many people enjoy their pedal assist-only e-bikes, but plenty of others like the confidence boost and safety net of having a throttle at their disposal. Fortunately the E-XC+ offers both.All of this combines to create that complete package of an all-around urban assault electric bike. I was regularly hopping back and forth from bicycle lanes to grassy swales and popping right over raised manhole covers without thinking twice! Like most e-bikes these days, there seems to be a pretty big disparity between the MSRP and the sale price.While the PXCycle has a list price of between $2,995 to $3,395 for various power levels and battery capacities, you’ll find the e-bike on sale when it hits Indiegogo for 50% off of those prices.That. Is. Huge.We’re talking $1,695 for a 600W mid-drive e-bike with over 500Wh of battery and plenty of respectable components that are built to last. There’s also going to be a 36V version of the bike with a still-respectable 400W of power with a sale price of just $1,495.At these prices, the PXCycle E-XC+ is a no-brainer. That’s a deal that will be incredibly hard to pass up.Be sure to check back on Electrek for the announcement when the Indiegogo begins [Update: It already has!]. The E-XC+ has already proven to be a popular e-bike, and the new version with an upgraded motor and even better sale pricing looks to improve on an already awesome ride.",ebikes
2021/02/04,"Rad Power Bikes has announced a large funding round that will see $150 million added to the industry-leading electric bicycle company’s coffers.Rad Power Bikes is the largest e-bike company in the US. Sales for 2020 are estimated to have topped 100,000 e-bikes and are growing quickly.This time last year we were talking about Rad Power Bikes landing an impressive $25 million investment. But now on the heels of the biggest e-bike boom in history, the company is pulling in its latest funding round at six times the previous figure.The $150 million represents a minority investment from a series of partners including Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Fidelity Management & Research Company, The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform managed by TPG, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Existing investors from Rad Power Bikes’ previous funding round Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital also participated in the most recent round.As founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh explained in a statement provided to Electrek:We are thrilled to be working with this group of prestigious investors who are known for successful, long-term investments, and share our vision for the future of mobility. Demand for our products has outpaced our wildest projections every year, and this partnership is helping us accelerate in-house innovation while creating more of what our customers tell us they love. I can’t wait for everyone to see what we will deliver in 2021 and beyond.Rad Power Bikes is expected to use the new funding to reinvest in maintaining its market dominance through further innovation in new e-bike models as well as by scaling the company’s retail presence and service offerings.While the company mostly operates a direct-to-consumer model that has allowed it to offer industry-leading prices unmatched by typical bike shop e-bikes, Rad Power Bikes has spent the last few years increasing its retail and service footprint.The company’s Rad Mobile service, which uses vans outfitted as nearly full-service bicycle shops, has helped the company assuage service and support worries that typically plague most direct-to-consumer e-bike companies.I had the chance to test out the Rad Mobile service myself and was impressed to see how the company managed to bring a bike shop experience right to my driveway.Rad Power Bikes tells us that the company expects to have retail and service coverage for 75% of its US customers by the end of 2021. A new showroom is expected to open in San Diego this spring.The company has been growing internally as well, increasing to 325 employees in 2020 and is expecting to double that number by the end of 2021.Rad Power Bikes currently offers a wide range of electric bicycles across 11 unique models.I’ve had the pleasure of reviewing most of them, and have always found the e-bikes to offer incredible bang for your buck. Instead of competing in high-performance categories, Rad Power Bikes has always competed on value, offering mid-tier components combined with interesting frame designs and a wide range of comfort/utility accessories.Designs like the RadRunner and RadWagon have opened new doors for riders looking to get into electric cargo and utility e-bikes for as little as $1,199.Rad Power Bikes even broke new ground for affordability when the company unveiled the RadMission last year, a metro e-bike designed for the city and priced at just $1,099. I’m currently using a RadMission e-bike as my main urban runabout/fitness e-bike.Wow, that’s some serious money talking there. With a new $150M funding round, Rad Power Bikes should have no trouble ensuring it has the cash on hand to fulfill the massive demand we’re seeing in the e-bike market. There’s no doubt that moving the number of bikes that Rad Power Bikes does requires some serious buying power.And with the ability to further invest in its growing retail and service expansion, the company is all but guaranteed to maintain its market dominance for the foreseeable future.This level of big money also shows that institutional investors are fully aware of how quickly the e-bike market is growing and that they want a piece of that bright future.I can’t blame them; I want a piece of that action too! If Rad Power Bikes was a public company, I would have invested a long time ago. Unfortunately Rite Aid already snagged the RAD stock ticker, but I’m sure the team in Seattle can put their heads together and come up with something good if there’s ever the IPO that I’m dreaming of!",ebikes
2021/02/02,"The Rad Power Bikes RadMini is the Swiss Army knife of the fat tire e-bike world. It offers all of the diverse riding advantages of fat tire e-bikes while providing surprising portability to take it just about anywhere.Whether on grass, dirt, or asphalt, the RadMini can do just about anything most e-bike riders could ever need.Make sure to check out my video review of the RadMini below to see it action, and then keep reading for my full detailed review.If you’re familiar with Rad’s larger fat tire e-bike, the RadRover, then you can consider the RadMini to be a similar e-bike on a diet.You still get those wide tires, the front suspension, the 7-speed Shimano drivetrain, and pretty much everything else you’d expect on a Rad Power Bike.But it comes wrapped in a more manageable package, especially for people like me who don’t have a lot of extra garage space (or any garage at all).Like most of Rad’s lineup, you’re getting the standard 750 W rear hub motor and 624 Wh battery pack. Together, they offer plenty of power and range for most riders and most terrains. Go easy and you’ll break 40 miles (64 km) on pedal assist. Ride it harder and 30 miles (48 km) is reasonable.The steepest of hills benefit from a bit of pedal help, but throttle-only riding is zippy and powerful.Where the RadMini really shines is its sheer versatility. Not only can it ride just about anywhere, but it folds so you can take it just about anywhere.No, this isn’t a Brompton, so it’s not going to fold down to something the size of a lunch box. But with the typical folding bars and mid-frame hinge, it still becomes a nice compact package.That means it fits great in a car trunk, backseat, or tucked in the corner of an RV. I’ve even heard of pilots keeping one in their light plane to have a convenient e-bike on hand once they land.Folding fat tire bikes solve the only main problem with fat tire bikes, that they tend to be so colossal. But with smaller 20″ wheels and the origami design, it just isn’t an issue on the RadMini.You still get the go-anywhere utility of a fat tire bike, but without the bulk.It may sound surprising, but the RadMini actually makes a potent little commuter e-bike. I’ve written before about why I enjoy using electric mountain bikes as commuter vehicles, and many of the same reasons apply here.Fat tire e-bikes are usually built to be more robust, which is an added benefit for anyone who rides their e-bike like a beater in the city.The wide tires and suspension fork aren’t just great on the trails, they’re great for the urban jungle as well. Potholes and curbs feel like much smaller obstacles than you’d expect on the RadMini. Even speed bumps were manageable at nearly full speed – something I wouldn’t dream about on most city e-bikes.And with a wide range of optional accessories like baskets and racks, not to mention the included accessories like lights, fenders, and the bell, the RadMini can be fully equipped for daily commuter needs.While the RadMini isn’t going to win any awards for best bicycle components of the year, they all feel like wise choices to offer a balance between longevity and affordability.A 7-speed Shimano Altus drivetrain isn’t fancy, but it gets the job done and is reliably adequate. The Tektro mechanical brakes are solid, and I actually really like the bell that is integrated into the left brake lever.The seat is comfortable, the hand grips are comfortable, the whole bike is comfortable and well put together. Nothing is over the top, and that’s precisely what I want in an affordable e-bike like this. A good mix of name-brand parts that may not be top shelf, but still provide me with the quality I’m looking for (and that a box store bike can’t touch). At an MSRP of $1,499, I’m not expecting a fancy space-age European e-bike. But I do want it to last me for a few years with a reasonable maintenance cycle. And having spent a few years on e-bikes from Rad Power Bikes myself, I can confirm that’s exactly what you get.And if you ever need a hand with maintenance down the road, Rad Power Bikes offers their own rolling bike shop service called Rad Mobile. I tested it out, and the guys just roll up to your house in a van that is decked out like a bike shop, ready to help you with whatever your bike needs. They can even assemble your bike for you and deliver it ready to ride. That’s just one more reason to go with a big company like Rad.To tie this review up, I’d say that the RadMini gave me everything I expected out of a typical fat tire e-bike, but then went above and beyond when it came to utility.Being able to fit my fat tire e-bike in a car to head to my favorite riding locales is a huge advantage. Integrating with Rad’s line of accessories to trick the bike out as the ultimate commuter is also an advantage.And while the RadMini lacks some of the fancier features we’re seeing more of these days, such as color displays or hydraulic brakes, the components it gives you are all good enough for daily utility use. Rad Power Bikes has never targeted the performance market; they’ve always stuck with providing a strong value proposition.And that’s what the RadMini is: a folding fat tire e-bike that is small in stature but big on value.",ebikes
2021/02/01,"Texas-based Zooz has made a wildly fun and stunning electric bike in a unique space uncovered by bike companies. If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if you made an electric bike ride like a BMX and a Buick, then you’re not alone. Zooz has done that and much more with the gorgeous Zooz 750 reviewed here. While it’s loads of fun and can be useful sometimes, it doesn’t fit into traditional e-bike categories, except for one, sort of.Check out the review video below where we spend a day in the life of the Zooz bike.The way I used it, the Zooz is a cruiser, above all else. The long seat and the tall handlebars give it a very comfortable riding position. Since the bike has just one speed, and the seat is large and static, any other use for the bike seems secondary. As a cruiser, the Zooz is fantastic. The long seat gives you some options for how to sit and even enables two adults to ride the bike. The short, wide tires provide great comfort to the bike without being obnoxiously large. The hydraulic disc brakes were nice for carrying two people or trying tricks at the park, but for lightweight cruising, it was simply a welcome bonus. Good brakes never get in the way, FYI.Riding the Zooz is an experience in itself since the general public has yet to be exposed to a bike this unique and good looking. Normally when I’m reviewing a bike, people only stop me to chat if I’m parked and fiddling with a camera. On the Zooz, I was stopped mid-motion being asked, “What is that?” “What’s that bike called?” and “Where did you get that?” I think the unique aspect puts some urgency into their requests. If I ride by too fast, they won’t get a chance again, and they’re probably right. It wasn’t until I got my daughter on the bike that people offered us a bit more space.I’ve been on some bikes that I consider good looking and others that I consider hideous, but the Zooz is one of few bikes that everyone agrees is gorgeous. Some of that appeal is undoubtedly wrapped in the cruiser feel combined with the care-free emotion that a BMX bike can illicit. The Zooz looks non-threatening and simple, two things that other bikes don’t have at all. Over the course of the video shoot, I went to the skate park a few days. Late one day, I went alone and saw a man leaning against the fence. He was roughly 30 years old, about 250lbs, wearing a camo coat, contoured sunglasses, a long beard, and a gun on his hip. On my first pass around the skatepark, he said, “Nice bike!” “Thanks.” I said. On my second pass around:“Where did you get it?” he asked.“Do you want to ride it?” I asked. He jumped at the chance. I’m glad I offered because that man (I don’t know his name) was great! He went horizontal on the bowl a few times, made some big jumps, skid all over, and tip-toed on the front wheel like he was a BMX Michael Jackson. Later, he told me that he was a BMX enthusiast who used to ride on one wheel for about 3 miles at a time. After having kids he hadn’t had the spare time to ride like he used to some years ago. After the added weight of the bike (and the added weight between teenager and  30 something), he was astounded that he could perform at the level he did. Since the man rode in a more free manner, making use of the whole park at a time, and going for flow/speed, the Zooz kept up and kept pumping. With the throttle in hand, the rider is more free to use both extra speed and extra attention to plan a route and execute fully.If you have a good eye, you may have noticed that two people were riding the Zooz during the skate park portion of the video. The camo sleeves belong to the stranger, but Mason has a similar story. Mason was a hobbyist BMX rider some 10 years ago and has enjoyed riding electric bikes for fun and commuting ever since. Mason’s penchant was more in the vert category, where the Zooz somewhat fell short on account of weight. Opening up to the whole park, Mason likewise felt freer to explore the space. Even in our 30’s, father time slowly invades the parts of our life that are claimed for the young. For myself, Mason, and the BMX stranger, the Zooz allows a small part of that territory back.The Zooz bike can be a commuter, or daily driver, if you’re committed to it. There are universal fenders that fit the front fork, that’s pretty simple. However, there are no provisions for integrated lights (as of yet), and I don’t think a rear rack is compatible at all. Chances are no one will notice your backpack or spare lights, since they will be looking at the bike. The range on the bike is decent, on account of the better-than-average battery size, but if you’re like me, it will be hampered by the urge to use full throttle. You’ll still see around 20 miles of range this way, which fits me in the Salt Lake valley just fine.Right now, Zooz has three models, all based on motor size: the 250w, 750w, and 1000w. More than likely the 250w is made for European countries, the 750w for places that pretend to enforce E-Bike laws, and the 1000w is for places that don’t pretend. In my opinion, the 750w and 1000w bikes would benefit from a torque based pedal assist. Since the 250w bike is made for Europe, the cadence pedal assist acts like a throttle and gives a laid-back cruise to our friends in the old-world. That’s great. In less-restrictive countries, we already have a throttle, and the addition of a torque sensor would make the single speed pedaling much more useful. As it stands, I would start the bike using the throttle, and just settle in. The pedals became a quaint out-of-date fashion piece, like a rotary phone or a gas car. I had a blast on the $2k 750w bike. I think it was great for the cruising focus the bike has. If I planned on hitting the park a bit more or tackling big hills on the regular, I would opt for the 1000w. Once the vaccine starts reaching my demographic, I would definitely choose the Zooz bike as my fly ride to pull up at a gathering. No other bike is as inviting, alluring or care-free as the Zooz. The Zooz is like a “dress up” pair of Jordans, Chucks, Superstars, or Vans.",ebikes
2021/01/31,"While the electric bicycle industry has been showing impressive growth for the last several years, 2020 witnessed rapid gains in the industry, unlike anything we’d seen before. But what does the e-bike industry have in stock for us in 2021? Here are my top five predictions for this year.Mid-drive e-bikes, which have a centrally-mounted motor that powers the e-bike through its bicycle gears, have long been dominated by industry heavyweights like Bosch.Popular mid-drive e-bikes have offered high-quality drivetrains and mid to top-shelf components to match. But that has traditionally kept the prices high, often in the $4,000+ range.However, 2021 is likely to see a new wave of affordably priced mid-drive electric bikes. There are plenty of Asian mid-drive suppliers that are growing their market share and helping drive down prices.We’re actually already starting to see this trend play out with new entries from companies like Ride1Up, who just unveiled the Ride1Up Prodigy electric bike. It is likely the most affordable Brose-powered mid-drive e-bike on the market at just $2,195. (And for the record, I made this prediction weeks ago before the bike was unveiled). I expect to see more e-bikes like this unveiled in 2021, and the inclusion of non-EU motors will only intensify this trend. There are already a few interesting low-cost mid-drive e-bikes on the market now, but I expect 2021 to see a new wave.I think 2021 will be the year that smaller diameter fat tires really catch on.This trend began largely with the electric moped wave of 2020, where small diameter fat tires became a popular way to provide motorbike-style handling and design.Other e-bikes like the popular $899 Lectric XP have adopted these small diameter fat tires in the company’s folding bikes, forgoing expensive suspension in favor of cheaper air cushions in the form of fat tires.Even one of the most famous value-oriented e-cargo bikes, the RadWagon, recently shifted to smaller diameter, wider tires.Not only do fat tires provide extra cushion for the ride, but the small diameter 20″ versions minimize the extra bulk that comes with fat tires.They prevent the e-bike from growing too heavy and unwieldy. They also help designers reduce the standover height, making the e-bikes more accessible to a wider range of riders.Apartment dwellers and anyone with a crowded garage will also enjoy the advantage of a more compact e-bike. Small diameter fat tires won’t replace traditional 26″ and 700c tires found on many e-bikes. But for anyone not worried about extreme efficiency, their advantages are too numerous to ignore. That means e-bike manufacturers are going to find a growing demand for this style of e-bike.This will be the year that e-bike batteries drop 50% in price while doubling their capacity.Just kidding.Nothing new will happen to e-bike batteries in 2021. Nothing major, at least.I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news here, but you can pretty much take this prediction to the bank.Other than small incremental increases in capacity, there will be no major breakthroughs in e-bike batteries in 2021. And the incremental increases in capacity won’t be due to any technological advances – they’ll simply be the result of manufacturers of battery packs shoving in a few more cells.The most popular format of battery cell for e-bike batteries, the 18650, hasn’t seen a meaningful capacity increase beyond 3.5Ah in years. Some e-bikes use the slightly larger 20700 and 21700 format cells, but these are much rarer and don’t offer much advantage for packing in more capacity.The biggest innovations in e-bike batteries actually came years ago and were thanks to other industries. Popular 18650 cells like the Panasonic 18650b were developed to cram more capacity in battery packs like those used in electric cars, and then the cells found their way into e-bike batteries as well.High power 18650s such as the Sony V-series were largely developed for cordless power tools and then began finding their way into battery packs designed for high power e-bikes.But without any major battery advancements in the last few years, there’s currently nothing for the e-bike industry to inherit from other industries.That doesn’t mean we won’t be zooming around e-bikes sporting solid-state batteries in the next 5-10 years, but it won’t happen in 2021. Sorry.This is another bad news prediction. Unfortunately, you can expect to wait a while for new electric bikes in 2021, especially the first half.The COVID-19 pandemic positively wrecked e-bike supply chains, most of which start in Asian countries like China and Taiwan that saw devastating lockdowns in 2020. While those countries got back to work sooner than much of the west, they were smacked with unprecedented spikes in demand as soon as their factories reopened.Supply chains are slowly starting to catch up, but the imperative word there is “slowly.”Many e-bike manufacturers are still being quoted lead times of a year or more on components such as brakes and handlebars. Popular e-bike companies have struggled to keep e-bikes in stock, leading to the second half of 2020 becoming the year of the e-bike backorder.While that will improve in 2021, it will take many months if not most of the year. So while some companies will be able to maintain some semblance of stock in their warehouses, you should still expect many e-bike manufacturers to continue working on a pre-sale or back-ordered basis.And unfortunately, you’re just going to have to live with that. I know it’s tough to pay for something in full and then wait several months for it to arrive. It’s even tougher when you’re talking about a several thousand dollar e-bike. But if you wait for the bikes to be in-stock, you could be waiting most of the year while each container of e-bikes is sold before it ever arrives in port.I think 2021 is likely to see a boom in new e-bike startups, especially from Asia.I’m not talking giant manufacturers. I’m thinking more like random Indiegogo campaigns and “let’s see if this venture works” type of startups.That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Some very interesting e-bikes have come out of these types of ventures. And need I remind you that some of the most successful e-bike companies out there, such as Rad Power Bikes, got their start on Kickstarter? But we’ll likely see a lot of weak-sauce attempts too.I believe the massive increase in demand for e-bikes will be the largest driver behind a wave of new e-bike startups. It will be hard for many entrepreneurs to see the market demand and not think to themselves, “Maybe I should start an e-bike brand.”There will likely be some interesting entries, but also likely a number of regurgitated designs that have been white-labeled from the same giant e-bike factories in China.Overall, 2021 should be an interesting year for e-bikes.We may not see any massive battery advancements, but prices should continue their slow crawl downwards, and we should have plenty of interesting new additions to the market.Do you have your eye on a new electric bicycle this year?

2021/01/29,"Bafang is making a new play in its battle for European e-bike market share, introducing a Dealer Direct Service concept.Unlike the US e-bike market, which is dominated by affordably priced direct-to-consumer e-bike companies such as Rad Power Bikes and Juiced Bikes, the EU e-bike market sees conventional e-bike dealers holding onto a much larger role.Higher-priced e-bikes featuring complete drive systems from companies like Bosch and Brose are much more common in Europe.Chinese competitor Bafang has made inroads in the European market in the last several years as a lower-cost alternative to pricey European e-bike drive systems.Many riders have found that Bafang’s e-bike drive systems, while often not as polished as European alternatives, can provide excellent performance at lower costs. And by addressing a truly international market, Bafang has the freedom to innovate with higher power and more features than are typically found in European e-bikes.We had the opportunity to tour the company’s factory and get a behind-the-scenes look at how they build electric bicycle motors. Check out the video below for more.Despite Bafang’s unique advantages, the company has always lagged behind when it comes to service.Now Bafang has announced its new Dealer Direct Service concept, which is designed to help improve e-bike service for European dealers.The service will launch in phases next month as a trial in the Netherlands, according to BikeEU.The initial launch will cover select brands of electric bicycles using complete Bafang drive systems, meaning the e-bikes sport both the Bafang motor system as well as the battery, controller, and other related parts.The support and service department will feature trained service engineers in a dedicated service center, a dealer online portal, and other necessary service components that will be made available.Bafang has also been expanding its after-sale support team with experienced industry insiders, attempting to improve the technical competence of the team.The new online service portal designed for dealers will centralize service information and will streamline procedures for guarantees and warranty conditions. Technical manuals, troubleshooting guides, and dealer training will also be included in the dealer portal. The current concept is designed only for dealers. It is not intended as a resource for the expansive DIY community that has heavily favored Bafang’s wide selection of electric bicycle components that can be employed by at-home e-bike builders. Between the new Dealer Direct Service program and increased investment in European facilities, Bafang has demonstrated a continued interest in growing its EU marketshare. Will it pay off? Can Bafang compete against the European heavyweights? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/01/26,"Electric mountain bike maker FREY has long championed high-power and high-spec electric mountain bikes. But the company’s newest model, the FREY Beast, is in a league entirely of its own.We were intrigued by the teasers for the FREY Beast earlier this month, but weren’t sure exactly what to expect.FREY already makes several 1.5 kW peak-rated electric bikes featuring the powerful Bafang Ultra motor and high-end mountain bike components.But the Jinhua-based company has now outdone itself with the FREY Beast, introducing its first 60V e-bike.FREY cofounder Ivy Wang described the Beast to me as an enduro eMTB that features the power of a motorbike combined with the performance and ride style of an electric mountain bike. In fact, she described the bike as having more power than they expected, and said that they won’t advise it for riders who haven’t had previous experience on high-powered electric bikes or motorbikes. Or to put it in a way that we all probably expected, this is not a beginner’s e-bike.Check out the video below to see the bike in action, as well as my absolutely captivating analysis (or you could just watch for the cool riding scenes, I won’t be offended).The higher voltage used for the Beast required FREY to develop a custom version of the Bafang Ultra motor and controller. The increased voltage allows the bike to run at higher power levels without increasing the current. That helps to reduce heat buildup while increasing efficiency.FREY also had to develop their own 60V battery to power the massive system. And instead of opting for a typical 15-20 Ah battery, which would already be one of the largest in the industry, FREY went all in with a 24.5 Ah battery. That adds up to 1.47 kWh of capacity and may be the single largest electric bicycle battery in a production e-bike (if you don’t count truly motorcycle-style e-bikes).The battery is physically quite large, and it required a new downtube design for the bike. We’ve seen plenty of 1 kWh batteries before, and they usually get mounted on top of the frame or become semi-integrated. But the FREY Beast manages to engulf the entire high-capacity battery in the frame, resulting in a bloated yet still fairly streamlined downtube.The bike features high-performance suspension with a RockShox 29″ Lyrik fork and RockShox Super-Deluxe coil rear shock, both with 160 mm of travel.The wheelset is mismatched with a 29″ tire up front for better attack angle and traction, and a 27.5″ tire in the rear for better acceleration and torque.I wish I could tell you more info about pricing and production, but Ivy and the FREY team won’t be releasing those details until March. As it stands, she tells me that the Beast is expected to be something of a halo product, not likely to see as large-scale production as the rest of their line, but still demonstrating the company’s ability to push the envelope when it comes to electric bike design.What do you think of the FREY Beast? Let us know in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/01/23,"Peugeot has just launched its latest electric bicycle model, known as the Peugeot eC01 Crossover.The company has made impressive strides in the electric bicycle market lately, with a half dozen crossover-style models launched late last year.Now the Peugeot eC01 Crossover adds a new Bosch-powered step-through frame to the list.Designed and manufactured in France, the bike features a classic upright seating position to give riders a lofty vantage point of the road ahead.The 57 mm (2.25″) wide Schwalbe Hurricane tires help the bike clear obstacles better than the narrow tires typically found on dedicated urban-only e-bikes.A front suspension fork ensures that the bike can tackle tougher riding than typical urban e-bikes, while the inclusion of fenders and a rear rack provide the utility that most e-bike commuters require.The Peugeot eC01 Crossover sports a Bosch Performance CX mid-drive motor paired with a removable 500 Wh battery hidden within the frame. The company claims that the battery is sufficient for up to 120 km (75 mi) of range, when used in the lowest assist level.The mid-drive motor is rated for 63 Nm of torque, and Peugeot paired a 10-speed Shimano Deore transmission to ensure riders have a wide range of gears to apply that torque to the ground on various inclines.Shimano MT201 hydraulic disc brakes come standard to increase stopping power while also reducing maintenance.The Peugeot eC01 Crossover e-bike is available now for a price of €3,199 incl. VAT, or approximately US$3,900).I’m actually pretty interested in Peugeot’s e-bike lineup. I first stumbled upon the company’s e-bikes at the Paris Motor Show, where they were a side exhibit tucked away behind Peugeot’s “real” vehicles.For European-built electric bicycles, the prices seem more than fair. It costs much more to build these e-bikes in the EU than in Taiwan, though the price difference is normally larger than this.The specs aren’t at the level of some other high-end e-bikes, but that’s ok for most riders just looking for a dependable city e-bike built tough enough for the occasional curb hop or “whoops I didn’t realize there were a couple stairs here” situations.Next time I’m in Paris I’m going to need to find a way to get on one of these e-bikes.Until then, let’s hear what you think of Peugeot’s latest model.

2021/01/21,"Electric bicycles already make up the largest growth sector in the bicycle market (and in some places, the only growth sector in the bicycle market). Now new figures indicate that the rapid growth in e-bikes could see them eventually outsell cars in Europe.Electric bicycles have already been rising in popularity for years.But the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated their spread as commuters search for economic and efficient alternatives to public transportation and socially distant escapes from lockdowns.Many European e-bike companies such as VanMoof saw double- or triple-digit growth in 2020.Nearly 1 million electric bicycles were sold in Germany alone during the first half of 2019. That was roughly equal to the country’s entire 2018 e-bike sales, and it included several months that saw reduced spending during the early days of the pandemic.Now experts are weighing in with projections for the growth of the European e-bike market over the next few years.The Confederation of the European Bicycle Industry (CONEBI) expects the size of the European e-bike market to grow to around 7 million units by 2025.Other experts have even loftier predictions, projecting around 10 million e-bike sales per year by 2025, according to Bike Europe.To put that in perspective, car registrations in Europe in 2019 totaled around 15.5 million. But car sales are increasing at a much slower rate. In 2018, new registrations numbered 15.1 million. Many European countries are seeing yearly e-bike growth in the 30% to 40% range, compared to the low single-digit growth of car sales. That means e-bike sales could easily overtake car sales later this decade in Europe.This is exactly how it should be. Roads aren’t getting any larger, but urban populations are growing every day. There simply isn’t any more room for more cars in our cities. A large shift toward smaller single-occupant vehicles is the best solution to crowded roads, not to mention the incredible environmental benefits we stand to reap.Obviously Europe is years ahead of North America in this respect. Blame it on culture, blame it on a stark difference in cycling infrastructure. Blame it on whatever you’d like. But at the end of the day, Europe is leading by example when it comes to embracing the many benefits of electric bicycles as primary or secondary vehicles.It’s about time we followed their lead in the US. While it seems to be harder for Americans to accept the reality that electric bicycles can serve as fully functional commuter vehicles for many people, perhaps a new wave of affordable electric motorcycles could help.With companies like SONDORS planning to roll out affordable electric motorcycles capable of both urban and highway riding, maybe the US can find its way toward embracing a mix of smaller, more efficient single-occupant EVs.Maybe.",ebikes
2021/01/20,"Italian bicycle manufacturer Bianchi has just unveiled a new series of electric bicycles as part of its E-Omnia family. The new e-bikes cover a wide range of riding styles including both on- and off-road adventures.The diversity of the new line is evident right from the name, as Bianchi CEO Fabrizio Scalzotto explained in a statement provided to Electrek:The “Omnia” in its name – it means “everything” in Latin – mirrors the ambition of Bianchi Lif-e Electric Intelligence program’s latest platform: to be your perfect e-bike, the bike for every kind of rider.The three new e-bike lines comprise a total of eight new models. The new model lines in the E-Omnia family include:The E-Omnia family follows the previous E-SUV line, including the flagship Bianchi E-SUV full-carbon electric mountain bike that we saw at the last Eurobike trade show.Along with the new e-bike family, Bianchi is also announcing a new 3D online configurator.The new configurator tool allows riders to customize the build of their new e-bike, including choosing among options such as belt or chain drive, ABS braking and utility options such as kickstands and carriers, in addition to various colorways.As Bianchi marketing manager Claudio Masnata explained:With a rider-first approach, placing the user closer to Bianchi’s development process than ever before, Bianchi has created the most advanced 3D online bike configurator in the world, with 8,500 possible combinations of colors, features, and specifications.The E-Omnia family is powered by the Bosch Performance CX motor, which puts out 85 Nm of torque and provides up to 340% rider assist.Riders can choose between a 500Wh or 625Wh battery pack, or can even opt for dual batteries to double their range. For safety, built-in 40 lux lighting can provide a visibility range up to 100 meters (330 feet) and remains visible to others from up to 500 meters (1,640 feet), according to Bianchi.The E-Omnia C-Type is the urban optimized line and offers both a built-in rear rack and step-through frame for ultimate utility. The C-Type starts at €3,320 (approximately US$4,025).The E-Omnia T-Type is a full-suspension touring bike designed to blur the line between street and trail riding. The T-Type starts at €3,370 (approximately US$4,085).The E-Omnia FT-Type adds rear suspension to the touring model while retaining an integrated rear rack, an option we rarely see on full-suspension electric bicycles. The rear suspension on the FT-Type adds to the price significantly though, with this model starting at €4,900 (approximately US$5,940).The E-Omnia X-Type AND FX-Type represent the hard tail and full-suspension electric mountain bikes in the line, respectively. Mudguards are integrated into the head tube, fork’s crown, under the downtube, and on the back of the seat. The FX-Type also offers an assymetrical swingarm to avoid chainstay damage or noise. The X-Type and FX-Type start at €3,450 (approximately US$4,185) and €4,800 (approximately US$5,820), respectively.All models are now available via the company’s online configurator tool.",ebikes
2021/01/19,"Evelo, a Seattle based e-bike company, has combined business and adventure with the Delta X. We’ve reviewed plenty of commuter bikes in the past, ranging from bargain legends, stealth beauties, and some strange brews that only justify their existence by calling itself a commuter. But the Evelo has made something more practical, and even more fun.The Delta X is actually a great mix of commuting goodness and durable utility. If you’re looking for a higher-end commuter that will last a long time, you’re in the right place. The comfort, agility, and power make commuting something to look forward to. The robust and easy-to-use components make for an straightforward bike to learn.And this innocent looking bike has a wild side to it.Let’s talk about the powertrain first. The 750W mid-drive motor has been around for a while, earning a reputation as being durable and reliable. Being a cadence-based system, it’s very easy to use and understand. It’s good because paired with it is a mechanical Enviolo internal geared hub. This system smoothly changes the gearing on the bike without any clunking or indexing between gears. You can change it at a dead stop, or in motion, which is nice, but it also doesn’t require nearly as much maintenance as a traditional derailleur. Combined with the extremely durable motor, you’ve got a long-lasting propulsion system here. We’ve got a 48V 11.6ah battery, and I would guess it might get about 15 miles at full blast, and probably over 40 miles if you use the battery  gingerly. The extra frame shroud mostly integrates the battery into the bike aesthetic, and makes the battery super easy to get on and off. Personally, I’m fine with blatant batteries, and I think Evelo is, too, since it has announced that a dual battery option for the Delta X is coming soon.To look behind the curtain a bit, Evelo put all their fancy stuff on the Aurora Limited and Galaxy bikes, and this Delta-X is a bit more priced to sell. Rather than springing for the belt drive and the electronic automatic enviolo, the Delta X is a bit more conservative, rocking a normal chain and cable drawn enviolo hub. Considering this bike has an MSRP of $3,699, there’s not a lot to complain about. I mentioned the motor being a bit old school, but it performs extremely well and there’s a good reason it’s still in use today. Instead of comfort points like handlebars, grips, and a seat, Evelo chose to get a little action-oriented. But actually, with a bit of DIY, the Delta-X can convert to a comfort bike just by changing those three things.All the pieces are here for commuting: full coverage fenders, integrated lights, and a standard rack for cargo bags of various sizes. This is the functional side of the bike. But after you get a few rounds in, it starts to show its true colors. The bike has a more forward and aggressive riding position, and combined with the wide handlebars, gives you a lot of fine control over tight turns and even small jumps. I went up stairs, up and down hills, even a small amphitheater. The Delta X is made to challenge the urban jungle.After my time with the bike, I enjoyed it most as an adventure commuter. Taking new ways to work, cutting through parks, alleys, and sidewalks trying to beat the clock or beat boredom. The business side of the bike won’t disappoint. It’s obviously made to get you around town very reliably. But when you’re ready to throw down, the Delta X is ready, too.",ebikes
2021/01/18,"Electric bicycle riders are often seen as responsible, eco-minded do-gooders making the selfless sacrifice of bike commuting to replace cars on the road and benefit us all, while motorcyclists are more commonly derided as organ-donating daredevils whose mere act of riding a motorcycle is considered an unnecessary risk.But could things be backward? Could electric bikes actually be more dangerous than motorcycles?That’s the argument made by FortNine, one of the most popular motorcycle education channels on YouTube.And as an avid rider of both electric bicycles and electric motorcycles, the answer is quite important to me. FortNine’s videos are always as highly researched as they are highly polished. And while presenter Ryan Kluftinger does take a few leaps in the new video (below), he presents several important points regarding the comparative safety of electric bikes and motorcycles.The biggest issue though is that many of these supposed dangers that are inherent to electric bikes are more accurately described as riding styles and choices associated with e-bikes. These are things that e-bike riders can and should know to avoid.So while I don’t agree with the premise that e-bikes are more dangerous than motorcycles, I think the points presented each have some validity that should be discussed. Doing so might just make us all safer riders and ultimately save lives.Granted, this seems incredibly counterintuitive. Which sounds more dangerous to you: a motorcycle at 50 mph or an electric bicycle at 15 mph?Well, it depends.Ryan’s point is that slow-moving e-bikes traveling on the side of a road with faster moving traffic is an inherent danger. And on this point, he and I actually agree.A motorcycle moving steadily with traffic is less likely to get rear-ended than an e-bike being passed hundreds of times each trip.While I’d rather crash at 15 mph on an e-bike than 50 mph on a motorcycle, the slower e-bike is likely to get repeatedly passed by cars, or as Ryan so eloquently puts it, “whizzed more often than a public urinal.”I’ve been that slow e-bike on the side of the road getting whizzed my entire commute, and it’s not fun.Of course that’s all the more reason for cities to invest in protected cycling lanes, but that’s playing the long game. In the short term, the type of e-bike we ride can make a big difference here.The slow speed limit associated with European e-bikes is the single largest reason I hate riding them in commuting scenarios – they feel dangerously slow when I need to keep up with traffic.I’ve long promoted the safety of faster e-bikes for their ability to keep pace with traffic and allow riders to take the lane (more) safely.When it comes to choosing a commuter e-bike, you’ll almost always find me on a Class 3 e-bike for that reason. I’d much rather be doing 28 mph in the city where car traffic rarely gets that much higher.Again, this is actually a fair point. But it speaks almost entirely to rider culture than to the vehicles themselves.When I ride faster and higher-power electric motorcycles, I’m covered head-to-toe in safety gear. I’ve got a carbon fiber full-face helmet that has passed a litany of crash and drop tests, a motorcycle jacket with built-in armor, armored gloves to keep my knuckles and palm skin in their current location, motorcycle jeans with kevlar lining, and armored crush-proof boots. As they say, “dress for the slide, not for the ride.”But when I ride my e-bikes, it’s usually a skateboarding helmet and a pair of Levi’s. That’s it. I’ll occasionally throw on a full-face helmet and elbow/knee pads if I’m doing serious downhill mountain-biking where there’s a real risk of wrapping myself around a tree. But for typical e-bike commuting, I’m remarkably cavalier about safety equipment.And I’m not the only one. Unlike the ATGATT ethos (“All the gear, all the time”) of the motorcycling community and the surprisingly militant emphasis on full-face helmet use in the electric skateboarding community, e-bike riders don’t seem to hold abundant use of safety gear in high esteem, at least not in a communal sort of way. It’s great to see individual riders taking safety seriously, but it hasn’t been ingrained in the e-biking culture the way it has in other alternative transport communities.And that’s on us, because it should be. Asphalt doesn’t care what you’re riding when you go down. You’ll cheese grater off your skin just as easily on an e-bike as a motorcycle. That doesn’t make one any more inherently dangerous than the other in this regard – but the lack of proper safety gear being seen as a priority in the e-biking community does.I’ve been riding e-bikes for well over a decade now, and over the last few years I’ve made small but conscious efforts to improve my safety gear. I used to casually hop on 30 mph e-bikes in sandals, something I try to avoid these days.But I still don’t do enough, nor do many other e-bike riders, to dress appropriately for all foreseeable outcomes. It’s something I need to work on, and something that many of the rest of us should too. In this respect, e-bikes aren’t any more dangerous than motorcycles. But our laissez-faire attitudes about safety when casually hopping on fast electric bicycles can be the real danger.While I’ll yield some ground to the first two arguments, I’m not sure I subscribe to this one.Ryan argues that E-bikes are less visible on the road than motorcycles.I’d argue the two are equally invisible.When I ride motorcycles, I pretty much assume cars have no idea that I’m there. And since I almost exclusively ride electric motorcycles, I’m often correct.When I ride e-bikes, its the same thing. I never think, “He sees me, I’ll just go.” It’s not that car drivers are malicious (usually), but rather they just aren’t looking for what they aren’t expecting. Roads are for cars, in their minds, and thus they’re looking for cars. And that makes two-wheelers pretty much equally invisible. My motorcycles may outweigh my electric bicycles 10:1, but they take up basically the same footprint.The only difference is at night, where automotive-level motorcycle headlights and tail lights put me on nearly equal footing with cars, while dinky built-in e-bike lights are left in the dust. For that reason I often try to throw on something reflective when riding at night.But during the day, when most riding happens, all two-wheel riders should know to ride more than just defensively; they should ride as if they were invisible. Ryan argues that e-bikes are more dangerous than motorcycles due to less sophisticated components.Many motorcycles have rider aides like ABS brakes and traction control. All motorcycles in the US use DOT-regulated parts like tires, mirrors, lighting packages including turn signals, etc.While I get Ryan’s point, I’m not sure I agree.Rider aides are nice, but they also mean riders don’t always need to understand the fundamentals to the same degree. I know exactly how the brakes on my e-bikes respond, and I know how I need to brake to avoid locking them up. I know my e-bikes don’t have traction control, and thus I don’t push them as hard in slippery riding conditions.I could make the argument that motorcycles’ rider aides could lull riders into a false sense of security, which is dangerous in and of itself.Could e-bikes benefit from some regulations regarding the quality (and inclusion) of components such as lights, mirrors, tires, etc? Perhaps. Though even without regulation, many e-bike specific tires designed for speeds higher than any of us will normally see are already finding their way onto e-bikes. Mirrors and motorcycle-style lights are becoming more common too.We can debate the above four arguments all day. I think Ryan makes some decent points, but also whiffs a few as well.The biggest safety factor of all for two-wheeled vehicles, and the one that both e-bikes and motorcycles actually share, is rider skill.Skills are something that are developed. They are learned and practiced. But they usually start with some fundamental instruction or level of education. And this is one area where I will admit that motorcycles have a leg up.Motorcycles nearly universally require a specific motorcycle license, which usually entails practical instruction and testing. It’s not extensive – my own MSF course involved two evenings of classroom instruction followed by a weekend of parking lot maneuvers and testing. Two hundred bucks later, I had a head full of practical knowledge and a motorcycle license. Years of practice have helped hone those skills, though I wouldn’t say I’m any better than most riders.The difference is that I never would have learned many of the things I know about two-wheelers if I hadn’t taken a motorcycle course to get my motorcycle license. And believe it or not, I use much of what I learned each time I hop on my electric bicycles.This is why I’ve long advocated for electric bicycle riders, even those with no motorcycle interest, to take a motorcycle education course. The knowledge and skills you’ll gain are invaluable.It is hard for me to recommend that something like this be mandatory for e-bike riders, as that would remove one of the biggest advantages of e-bikes: that they are almost entirely free of cumbersome regulation. But I still highly recommend that e-bike riders take such classes. A fun weekend of riding imparts important skills that you’ll have for life.Motorcycle riders like to consider themselves experts of risk mitigation. As a motorcycle rider myself, I’m not sure “expert” is the right term. But it is something we practice every time we throw our leg over a motorcycle. We all make choices based on the risks we are comfortable taking.The reality though is that e-bike riders are in the exact same scenario, whether they realize it or not.The biggest impact regarding the safety of two-wheeled vehicles are the decisions made by the rider. We can decide how fast to ride and where on the road we ride. We decide what gear to wear. We decide how to navigate around cars. We decide what type of vehicles to buy/ride with an understanding of the components we use. And we decide how much to educate ourselves.Ultimately, motorcyclists and e-bike riders are more alike than we may realize. And because we share many of the same risks, we have to approach safety in much the same way.It’s less about the vehicle. It’s more about us.",ebikes
2021/01/17,"A recent patent reveals an interesting and novel type of of electric motorbike that could become Fuell’s next big EV.Two-wheeled EV company Fuell was founded in 2019 by Erik Buell and his team to develop both electric bicycles and electric motorcycles. The company began by prioritizing the Fuell Flluid electric bicycle ahead of the more costly and complicated Fuell Fllow electric motorcycle.Fuell then experimented with some moped-style electric vehicle design concepts last July. One of the concepts, known as the Flluid_2, appears to actually be making progress based on its inclusion in a recent patent.The patent, uncovered by CycleWorld, appears to show an electric motorbike that is convertible from a lightweight motorcycle or scooter into a pedal-augmented moped.The patent drawings indicate a swappable hybrid drivetrain that can replace the foot platforms with functional pedals. In the scooter form, the device would apparently be more of a moped or light motorcycle-class vehicle. But adding the pedals (and presumably limiting the power and/or speed) could sneak the vehicle into electric bicycle classes that would help riders avoid legal requirements such as licensing and registration.The vehicle appears to share similar magnesium monocoque construction with the Fllow, though it likely sports significantly less battery capacity and motor power.The rear hub motor appears to be much smaller than the powerful 11 kW or 35 kW options previously floated for the Fllow.The patent also reveals long, thin battery packs that sit vertically in the forward section of the body and would be removable via a flip-up hatch at the top of the battery compartment.Multiple battery options are shown in the patent including options for single or dual batteries of different sizes.Various seat options are also shown, including a more traditional bicycle saddle and a longer moped-style seat that may be able to accomodate more than one rider.Just because Fuell has patented the vehicle doesn’t mean it is necessarily headed for production. But the company’s continued R&D is a good sign that we’ll eventually see more than just an electric bicycle from Fuell.Lightweight electric motorcycles like the 11kW Fuell Fllow are an underserved market in the electric motorcycle industry. Established companies have been hesitant to enter the space, leaving room for startups to fill the void. Newcomers to the market such as the SONDORS Metacycle are beginning to create offerings in the category, which could help encourage other companies such as Fuell to jump in.What do you think of Fuell’s convertible electric motorbike/scooter/moped/bicycle hybrid?Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below!",ebikes
2021/01/16,"San Diego-based electric bicycle company Ride1Up has long been a value leader in the US e-bike industry. Now with the new Ride1Up Prodigy’s unveiling, the company is bringing the same value-oriented design to its first ever mid-drive electric bicycle.Popular models like the $995 Roadster V2 and $1,095 Core-5 have underscored Ride1Up’s commitment to value-packed e-bikes.But while hub motor-based e-bikes have been low-hanging fruit for many budget-oriented e-bike manufacturers, mid-drive electric bicycles have eluded affordability for years.The centrally-mounted drive units often produced by proprietary German manufacturers have typically kept prices lofty – often in the $3k-$5k range. However, the new Ride1Up Prodigy seems to have cracked the code to affordability.Featuring a Brose TF Sprinter mid-drive motor with internal belt reduction, the Ride1Up Prodigy offers Class 3 speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) with an entry-level price of $2,295.The team has been designing the bike for quite some time now, with the new model previously expected to be ready early this year. However, long parts delays from many of their suppliers have pushed back delivery times considerably – a problem encountered by nearly every electric bicycle manufacturer. The delays are so serious that Ride1Up isn’t ready to guarantee delivery times. Instead of taking pre-orders with an unclear timeline (which is an unfortunately common practice in the e-bike industry), Ride1Up is announcing the bike today and will begin taking pre-orders once the production timeline is more solid.As the company’s co-founder Kevin Dugger explained to me via email:“The manufacturers of the components we want for this model are so far behind sadly. We will likely take pre-orders this summer with an earlier shipping date likely. Interestingly, it’s a lot easier to get low end components right now than high-end components.”While we wait for pre-orders to open, we can still enjoy ogling the lowest priced Brose-powered mid-drive electric bicycle yet.The Ride1Up Prodigy sports impressive specs for its price, including not just that Brose motor with included torque sensor but also dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, a 9-speed Shimano Alivio transmission and included rear rack and fender set.Buchel LED lights in the front and rear and Schwalbe G-One tires keep riders safe and stuck to the road, at least on the pavement-oriented XR and ST frames that offer a step-over and step-through geometry, respectively. Both include a hydroformed aluminum fork to match the frame.There’s also a MTB version that upgrades to a suspension fork and Maxxis Forekaster tires, but looses the fenders and rear rack. You likely won’t miss those commuter-spec components when you’re screaming down the trails anyways though.The 504 Wh battery hides away nicely in the bike’s downtube and should provide plenty of range on these pedal assisted e-bikes. Ride1Up claims a range of between 30-50 miles (50-80 km) depending on ride style and terrain.We previously gushed over the Ride1Up LMT’D and its combination of high-spec parts at a reasonable price (check out the video below). So to follow up with an even more premium e-bike seems to be the natural next step for Ride1Up.For now, Ride1Up is estimating availability in August, 2021. We’ll be sure to update when pre-orders open.I respect Ride1Up’s strategy here. I know they’ve been working on this bike for a while and they’re super bummed that they can’t get it out to riders sooner due to the bicycle industry’s severely stretched supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.But with the bike essentially finished as far as design goes, they still wanted to share the news and let riders know what they have coming, even if they don’t feel right taking orders yet without a solid delivery timeline.Just the fact that we’ve got a nearly $2k Brose-powered mid-drive electric bike on the way is music to my ears.The two street variants look awesome as Class 3 e-bikes that are quick and nimble. While some will complain about that lack of suspension on the XR and ST models, these aren’t mountain bikes. You’re looking at commuter bikes that are designed for efficient riding and dependable design. And there’s nothing more dependable than a rigid fork.If you want that nicer suspension, the MTB version seems to have you covered, and is a cool way to offer both on- and off-road experiences using the same e-bike platform.And lastly, check out that price of $2.3k! Sure, we’ve seen less expensive mid-drive e-bikes, but only with off-brand mid-drives and much cheaper bicycle components. This is the most affordable Brose-powered e-bike I’ve seen that still offers high quality components designed to last for years of daily riding.That’s pretty sweet!",ebikes
2021/01/12,"When cycling legend and three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond announced he was releasing a pair of new electric bicycle models last year, we knew these weren’t going to be any ordinary e-bikes.With deliveries set to begin next month, LeMond Cycles is releasing the first official photos of one of the new e-bikes.The new model, known as the LeMond Prolog, is produced entirely from carbon fiber – not just in the frame but also in the fork, fenders, stem and handlebars. That helps the bike achieve its super-light weight of just 26 lb (11.7 kg).Despite Greg LeMond’s elite-level athletic background, the LeMond Prolog is designed as an everyday e-bike designed for both fitness riding and urban transportation.The new photos from photographer Alonso Tal show off the bike’s ultra-clean design. And if pink isn’t your thing, it also comes in white and black.The bike features a hidden internal battery, minimalist rear hub motor, seamlessly integrated LED lighting, and hidden cabling.In fact, it takes a trained eye to even spot that these are electric bicycles.But once you spot the Mahle X35+ Smart Ebike System, the jig is up. That’s a 20 mph (32 km/h) assist system that adds 250W of power and provides 40 Nm of torque. The 36V integrated battery isn’t overly large at just 250 Wh. That’s less than half of the average battery capacity found on most of today’s throttle-enabled e-bikes. But as a lightweight and efficient pedal-assist e-bike, the LeMond Prolog is still capable of a claimed 45 miles (72 km) of range in the lowest assist setting.There’s also an external battery option (sold separately) that can add 70% more range. A range that high is is likely more than any casual cyclist will need, but may be enticing for anyone setting out on an extra-long ride.The fancy spec sheet includes quality components like a Shimano GRX Hydraulic 1×11 drivetrain and a tubeless-compatible aluminum wheelset. There’s even an included Spurcycle bell – a part that can retail for $50 or more on its own! The LeMond Prolog isn’t cheap at its starting price of $4,500. But that’s not unreasonable for a carbon fiber e-bike like this and falls in line with similarly spec’d carbon e-bikes. Plus, that price is practically a song compared to some of the even more premium electric bicycles we’ve seen.Could you imagine yourself on one of the many new carbon fiber e-bikes in this new wave of interesting fitness/transport e-bikes we’re seeing lately? Let us know in the comment section below!",ebikes
2021/01/06,"Buy one; get one deals aren’t the norm in the e-bike industry. But Nox’s new package that offers one and a half e-bikes might be on its way to changing that.The German-based Nox Cycles is no stranger to electric bikes, already offering electric mountain bikes for the better part of a decade.Now the company is trying to entice its riders into hitting both the mountain slopes and the tarmac by offering its new 2021 Metropolis line of rugged city/trail e-bikes that share a single motor and battery.The ability to split a motor and battery between two e-bikes is possible thanks to the Fazua e-bike drive.The German mid-drive houses both the motor and battery in a removable sleeve hidden within the bike’s downtube. When the motor and battery are removed, the bike returns to the functionality and weight of a typical pedal bike.Nox’s new Metropolis line uses the same Fazua mid-drive system as its Helium electric mountain bike line, making the part-sharing setup possible.Unlike the heavier duty full-suspension Helium e-bikes, the new Metropolis model is designed for city riding with occasional trail excursions. The package, known as the “Take 2 E-Ride 1” bundle, includes one of each bike and a single Fazua motor and battery combo.Theoretically this offers riders two e-bikes without the full cost of two e-bikes, though of course only one e-bike can be powered at a time. The second would remain functional as a pedal bike, if the owner wanted to bring along a friend with a (hopefully) powerful pair of legs to keep up.While the goal of the package is to help riders who would be interested in both bikes save money, don’t expect this to be a low cost offering. Nox only deals in high-end e-bikes and so the total cost of the bundle still starts at a whopping €8,699 (approximately US$10,730). But for comparison, purchasing the Helium 7.1 Enduro Expert Granit and Metropolis Hacker separately would be an even taller order at €9,798 (approximately US$12,000).So while the deal could save you four figures, there’s still a lot of dough to shell out for these high-spec electric bicycles.Call me when I can buy one and a half e-bikes for us mere mortals.via: NewAtlas",ebikes
2021/01/05,"While most electric bicycle conversion kits generally look fairly monotonous, the Clip offers an entirely new aesthetic. Inside the novel unicorn horn–lookin’ e-bike kit though is a cleverly concealed and decades-old electric bicycle drive mechanism.The Clip kit uses a friction drive on the front tire of a typical pedal bike to provide powered assist to the rider.The entire unit mounts onto the front fork and straddles the wheel.A small roller presses against the tire and spins the wheel, propelling the bike.It’s not a new technology – a friend of mine in college had an EV Warrior e-bike with a friction drive from way back in 1995. But it certainly is simple and effective, resulting in minimal parts and complexity.It’s a solution that we’ve seen applied with varying degrees of elegance before. This time Clip seems to have taken the old idea and updated it into a sleek albeit somewhat comical-looking design.Like an e-bike knight jousting down the road, the Clip kit’s elongated frame and shell jut out past the front of the bike. However, the entire kit is also removable so that riders can easily stow it in a bag or carry the device inside for charging.The internal battery is rated at 144 Wh, which is rather small compared to the 500-700 Wh e-bike batteries commonly seen today. But with the lack of a throttle, the manufacturer claims that its pedal assist functionality still offers decent range of 10-15 miles (16-25 km), or enough for around a 45-minute commute. And with a claimed recharge time of just 40 minutes, even a quick stop at the coffee shop should replenish a decent amount of your battery charge.The Clip kit allows the e-bike to fit into Class 1 designation in the US, meaning it cuts assist after reaching 15 mph (25 km/h). It also features a 450W power rating, so it should feel a bit more lively than typical European-legal e-bikes with 250W power limits.Clip is pre-selling its kits for $399 and has already sold out the first round, meaning anyone else getting in line will have to wait for delivery this summer.I have a love/hate relationship with friction drive kits. They’ll always hold an interesting place in my heart as one of the earliest e-bike drive technologies. But their often loud motors/rollers and their propensity for chewing up tires doesn’t always leave a good taste in my mouth.That being said, I’ve got a Rubbee friction drive kit that I saw at Eurobike on my desk right now that I’m preparing to toss on an e-bike, so I’m always willing to give the old tech a new try, especially when it’s been repackaged in a way that incorporates novel features or designs.Maybe old is new again. My wife insists that 90s jeans are back, so perhaps 90s e-bike drives are coming with them.via: Fast Company",ebikes
2021/01/01,"FREY Bike ushered in the new year with the announcement of what appears to be two new high-power electric mountain bike models. The pair were revealed just hours ago in a tantalizingly short video teaser.Unlike most electric mountain bikes built by major European manufacturers, Jinhua-based FREY Bike has opted for higher-power designs.The company’s entry-level models start with power and torque specs of 750W and 120NM, but climb up to 1,500 peak watts and 160NM of torque at the top end.Now the company appears to be putting that powerful Bafang Ultra motor in two new models known as the Beast and Monster.Technically FREY only announced that a single new model is coming, but the video clearly shows two new model names.As the company explained on their Facebook page:Happy new year to all! 2021 FREY bike new model is coming! New Product Launch will be held between 20-30 January, 2021. Follow us to get latest news update in time!The bikes are briefly visible in the teaser video below, where we catch glimpses as they soar over jumps and are obscured by trees and snow mounds.To be honest, it’s difficult to glean too much detailed information from the video, which is of course the point of a teaser.But it looks to me like the bikes are still rocking the most powerful motor in FREY’s lineup, yet now we see a thicker downtube. That implies more battery capacity, which would be a welcome addition to that battery-guzzling motor.I’ve put a number of miles on the dual battery version of the flagship FREY EX Pro and can attest to the benefit of having extra watt hours on these powerful e-bikes.The suspension setup on at least one of the bikes seems to imply downhill, though FREY is also known for putting better suspension components than you’d expect on these bikes, so it’s hard to say for sure. Their CC model puts full-suspension high-end RockShox components on a commuter e-bike, if that gives you any indication of how overbuilt these bikes are.As FREY continues to up its game and compete with the major European electric mountain bike manufacturers, we could see new tech make its way into these bikes. Perhaps more connectivity? New frame materials? Suspension geometry? It’s hard to say from the limited info we have so far.I tried to pull out the best screen shots I could get (above), but there’s about a hundred cuts in a 15-second video and so this was the best I could do. Check it out yourself and then join me in the comment section to let me know what you think FREY’s plans are with these two bikes.",ebikes
2020/12/31,"The year 2020 wasn’t horrible for everyone. For the companies that make electric bikes, a convenient, inexpensive, and fun way to avoid public transportation, business was so good that supply chain shortages made their products hard to find. Many companies we spoke with had record years. It’s the move of ebikes into micromobility that has been the bigger trend for 2020, and our ebike of the year winner has highlighted this trend. Congratulations to the Juiced HyperScorpion, a 33mph (53km/h) emoped that can be ridden as a class 1/2/3 ebike on bike trails or ridden like a moped on 35mph speed limit roads with traffic. It can even be pedaled like a traditional bike. It can be a cargo bike or a delivery bike. It’s a fun joy ride or it’s a great commuter and can provide fun exercise. It’s a little of everything.After all, micromobility doesn’t have to mean kick scooters and electric mopeds. Good, old-fashioned pedal bikes work quite well, as they have for decades. The Scorpion is such a great eMobility bike that last mile  startup Bird is rolling out a variant to its base of kickscooter riders.  So there’s some backstory here…San Diego-based Juiced has been making powerful ebikes since 2009 but only recently pivoted more toward eMopeds with not only Scorpions but also Scramblers that now dominate its lineup. They still make traditional traditional CrossCurrent and RipCurrent ebikes (which are superb btw) but all the hype is around their new, powerful eMoped style ebikes. For good reason. In September 2019 we got our first peak at the Juiced Scorpion, an ebike that takes its design cues from 1970s mopeds but replaces the downtube gas tank with a more modern equivalent 52V battery. Juiced CEO Tora Harris and I rode some early prototypes all around Manhattan and Brooklyn last year.At what felt like every stop, people walked up to us and asked us what it was we were riding and how much they cost. One guy even pulled out his wallet and asked if he could buy the prototype out from under Tora. Afterward, I asked Tora if he thought he had a hit on his hands. I got just a big smile from the outspoken CEO of one of the hottest ebike companies in the US. We all knew the Scorpion line was going to be super popular.I’m not immune from the hype. I’m offered ebikes to review all the time and have a literal stable full of them. Yet, I still put my own pre-order price of $1,299 down the second the Scorpion Indigogo launched. I got my electric blue Scorpion in the first shipment out from China. And just like Micah Toll in his review, I was immediately smitten with everything about it… except for one small thing.I agreed with the one downside: the 750W nominal/1000W peak motor that barely gets it up to 25mph with a bit of pedalling/breeze/downhill. This is what other similar “emopeds” or “mini bikes” from Super73/Rad/Lectric/etc have in the power department, so it is by no means underpowered. But the Scorpion is built so well with that soft suspension, fat sticky mag wheels, and substantial frame that you know it can handle a lot more speed. The bike is practically begging to go faster. Tora Harris was already ahead of us here with the HyperScorpion. Juiced “Hypers” a bike model by tricking it out with more battery, more power and more accessories. Not only are you looking at double the power with the HyperScorpion, but you also get a much bigger 1kWh battery, a turn signal light and rearview mirror package, and horn with optional alarm system. All of this turns the Scorpion into more of a moped than an ebike even though it’s built on the exact same frame as the regular Scorpion. The package also pushes the weight of the bike over 100lbs, which shows you how substantial this vehicle is. Yet I am still able to pedal it fairly easily unless I’m going uphill. As usual, Micah was on the same page.More recently, Juiced released an upgrade to its more “moto form factor than moped” Scrambler line called the HyperScrambler 2 that has this same motor package. But it adds the option of a second 1kWh battery giving it a range of 100 miles(!!). In my experience, however, the need for a second, plugged-in battery was overkill — 100 miles is more range than many electric cars.  If you do want an extra battery, Juiced will of course sell you one, and both the 13Ah and 19.2Ah batteries work in the HyperScorpion. It only takes a few seconds to swap batteries if you want to keep one charging in the apartment. Part of being an emobility utility bike is the ability to work as a delivery vehicle. The Hyperscorpion is a fantastic vehicle for that. Juiced has some delivery accessories but also has an “Express package” of the HyperScorpion in yellow at a $100 price premium. It comes with an extra-wide modular rear rack to carry all types of cargo. It’s tempting just for the yellow color alone!  At $2,499, the HyperScorpion is expensive. But think about what you are getting here. For less than the price of just about any Bosch 250W ebike, you are getting a borderline motorcycle with all of the fixings and ability to go 30mph without touching the pedals. It looks incredibly cool — you already know that — and the build quality is stellar. Components-wise, there were some compromises (think Shimano Altus Derailleur, two piston brakes, etc.) but overall, this thing is built to last. It also can be kitted out with all kinds of accessories. If you absolutely can’t spend $1,600 for a regular Scorpion, some less expensive but still solid options are the $1,200 RadRunner or a $900 Lectric. Besides the $2,500 price point, there are some other downsides to this amazing ebike. The aforementioned  Shimano Altus Derailleur, two piston brakes aren’t a big bother to me. In fact, my biggest hesitation when considering this bike is that I probably won’t be getting much exercise on it. I’m a fan of actually pedaling, and with almost 2kW of power available from the thumb throttle compared to the fraction of that coming out of leg power, the throttle is almost always going to win. However, of all the emopeds I’ve ridden, the Scorpions are the easiest to pedal. So there’s that.There are tons of ebike and acoustic bike options available for pedalers. In fact, there has been for years.This year we wanted to focus on bikes that changed the game. A lot of people who would normally be riding crowded buses, subways, or carpooling needed to find a new way to get around this year. For them, an ebike that can do it all whether being pedaled or by throttle was necessary. The Juiced HyperScorpion is going to be pulling people out of cars and other crowded commuter options, and we felt that for 2020, that was the big winner.",ebikes
2020/12/29,"The Macwheel Wrangler 600 is an electric bike from an up-and-coming budget brand found on Amazon. Today we’re going to find out if you can get a decent ride out of a budget electric mountain bike.Watch my short video review below to see the MacWheel Wrangler 600 in action!This is technically an electric mountain bike, but in practice its more of an “urban” electric mountain bike.That means it’s not really designed for tearing up and down mountain trails. Could it do it? Probably. Would it be the best choice for that type of riding. Absolutely not.This e-bike is for all intents and purposes a commuter bike, and so that’s how I’m going to judge it.While the bottom-end Shimano 7-speed drivetrain probably wouldn’t cut it getting bashed against rocks all day, it’s plenty for commuter work. The same goes for the typical Tektro mechanical disc brakes. They aren’t fancy all the way down there at the bottom end of Tektro’s hierarchy, but they’re name brand and they work just fine. The Kenda tires are fine, the included LED light is fine, the suspension is fine for basic road riding, it’s all pretty much fine. Not fancy, but it gets the job done without being bargain basement, no-name el-cheapo parts. It’s all decent and nothing more, which is exactly what we found on the last Macwheel e-bike we tested. It’s consistently decent.There are a few niceties in the design such as internally routed wiring and the integrated battery. Both are generally reserved for mid-tier bikes, not budget level bikes.Hell, Rad Power Bikes still isn’t doing integrated batteries. But while the Macwheel Wrangler 600 has an edge there, it’s one of the only areas where it edges out some objectively better e-bikes.The takeaway message in terms of components and build is this: the bike is decently made and won’t fall apart in a few months, but it’s not a tribute to high design either.While I’m lukewarm about the components, I’m actually pretty pleased with the performance.I expected the bike to peter out as it approached 32 km/h (20 mph) like a typical Class 2 e-bike, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the speed keep climbing to nearly 36 km/h (22.5 mph). It’s not a huge difference, but every little bit past 20 mph helps to make an e-bike psychologically more comfortable on faster roads so you spend less time getting passed by traffic.The power is certainly stronger than the last 350W Macwheel e-bike I tried, which makes sense considering the 500W motor and 48V system on this bike.The pedal assist isn’t the smoothest I’ve tried, but it works just fine and keeps me honest when I choose to forgo the throttle and get some exercise.The 480Wh battery doesn’t net me the full range they promised me on throttle-only, but it gets about two-thirds of the way there at quite close to 34 km (21 miles). With pedal assist, the range bumps up closer to the 48 km (30 miles) that the company claims.The mountain bike-style geometry has you in a fairly sporty ride position and the bike feels quite nimble, especially for the larger 27.5″ wheels. I would love to see a set of fenders or a rear rack included to give more urban utility, but those are accessories that can be added later.Anyone looking for a laid back cruiser should check out Macwheels’ other models since this one is designed for riders who like a more traditional mountain bike stance. I may be giving the Macwheel Wrangler 600 a bit of a hard time here, but that’s because I’m used to comparing e-bikes that easily cost twice as much as this budget offering.When I remind myself that the Wrangler is priced for the e-bike equivalent of a song, the picture starts to look rosier.Ultimately, it’s a fast and modestly powerful e-bike that offers a traditional biking feel. And that’s perhaps its most important feature.When people ask me for the best budget-level e-bike and want to stick to 3-digit prices, I usually recommend something like the $899 Lectric XP. The only problem is that some riders don’t want a folding e-bike or a fat-tire bike or small-ish 20″ wheels.The Macwheel Wrangler 600 solves that problem by offering a more familiar mountain bike-style ride while hitting a similar price point.It’s not the best mountain or commuter e-bike I’ve ridden – at least not on an absolute scale. But it ranks quite nicely on the value scale thanks to its sensible pricing and decent-level components. It’s an upgrade over something like an even-more-budget-level Ancheer, yet won’t do too much more damage to the wallet.What do you think of the Macwheel Wrangler 600?

2020/12/23,"Take one look at the Fiido Q1S seated electric scooter from Voro Motors and it doesn’t seem too strange. But then look again when a rider sits down and suddenly the proportions appear all out of whack.Despite the odd-sizing, the scooter is actually more comfortable to ride than you’d expect. And its combination of power, torque, full-suspension, and utility make it a potent little urban runabout.This electric scooter is both fun to ride and a bit funny to look at. That means you’ll want to watch my short video review below to get a sense of how this electric scooter rides. And you don’t want to miss my failed attempt at performing a stoppie in the middle!Alright, yes – the scooter is small. It’s a small format with small wheels.But do you know what? It’s not actually that small. Think about it. Most standing scooters are rolling around with 8-inch wheels, or maaaaaybe 10-inch wheels if you’re lucky. But the Fiido Q1S gives you 12-inch tires, which makes hitting bumps much safer.Plus there’s that front and rear suspension. And the fact that you’ve got footpegs instead of pedals, meaning the actual sizing of the scooter isn’t as critical since you’re not trying to optimize your pedaling stroke.So you’re basically looking at a small bicycle-format vehicle with the advantages of a scooter (lower weight, fewer parts, less maintenance, etc).I felt right at home on it with my 5’7″ (170 cm) frame, and despite my 6′ (183 cm) brother-in-law giving it the side-eye, he had no trouble riding the Fiido Q1S either.When it comes to performance, the Fiido Q1S actually gets great marks. The 500W peak motor is peppy and the torque is much more than you’d expect thanks to the small-diameter wheels.The range is also quite good at around 20 miles (32 km).The braking is insanely strong and I almost ate pavement trying to perform a stoppie. That’s how good the disc brakes are. Some scooters struggle to lock up the brakes. But with Fiido outfitting the Q1S with large diameter rotors and good calipers, these things can bite hard and help you leave rubber on just about any surface you’d like.The only downside to the performance is the limited top speed of 15 mph (25 km/h), which is also partially responsible for the higher range.That slow speed means you’re definitely limited to bike lanes or other slow-speed surfaces. I wouldn’t feel comfortable riding this thing on roads with high-speed traffic.But for typical urban or suburban riding, it gives the performance you need with plenty of range and the ability to climb medium hills. So it’s as excellent for city riding as it is terrible for highway riding.Where the Fiido Q1S really excels though is in utility. This tiny thing doesn’t look like a cargo e-bike, but it sure does act like one!It features a super rare in-frame storage setup with a split top tube. The provided cargo bag fills that empty space and allows you to throw loose items in there. That makes it so much more useful than just a big rear rack since you don’t have to worry about strapping things down. You could practically wheel the Fiido Q1S around the market and fill it up as you go.And if you run out of room in the spacious center cargo area, Voro Motors includes a front basket that also has a surprising amount of space in there.There’s even a child seat attachment that can fit on top of the center cargo area and let you carry a smaller ride right in front of you. Though the lack of spare footpegs means you’ll either be sharing or they’ll be putting their toes in the bottom of the cargo area (which is what my nephew opted for).And since you might not want to do your entire ride on a scooter, instead opting to use it for last-mile trips, the Fiido Q1S folds at the handlebars to easily slip into a trunk or back seat of a car. Then you can whip it out like an electric dinghy to extend your reach in the city on a much smaller and more efficient vehicle.At its price of $899, that utility is going to be a big part of the sale equation. You can of course get recreational e-bikes or e-scooters for less, but most won’t have the combination of cargo capacity and utility of the Fiido Q1S.And many full-suspension electric scooters start at this price anyway, and they don’t offer nearly the utility that this minivan-of-a-scooter does!While I’m a big fan of the Fiido Q1S, I can definitely say that it is not for everyone.I’m used to riding all sorts of weird things and have learned to adapt to just about any frame size or shape.The Fiido Q1S doesn’t even feel that odd to me, though I might prefer the footpegs to be a bit further forward.The advantages are certainly numerous here. The scooter is ultra nimble, peppy, stops quickly, and has huge utility for carrying all sorts of cargo.But on the other hand, it’s a weird new vehicle for many people who are either used to standing while scooting or sitting while pedaling. The Fiido Q1S combines those two in a new way that can take some getting used to.It’s also hamstrung a bit by its restricted top speed of just 15 mph (25 km/h). That’s going to limit the types of roads you can ride it on. If you have fast roads on your commute, this little guy is probably out. But if you live in a city, this thing feels comfortable on any road I’d take a typical pedal bicycle on.So while it has some drawbacks, it also has a lot going for it. And for $899, it has a pretty decent value proposition in my opinion.But enough about my thoughts. Let’s hear what you think of the Fiido Q1S in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/12/23,"The Xone electric bicycle developed under new brand Exxite by the Barcelona-based e-bike company Rayvolt was one of the most futuristic and innovative electric bicycles unveiled last year. But its announcement and crowdfunding campaign couldn’t have come at a worse time, just months before the COVID-19 pandemic began.Many new e-bike announcements and crowdfunding campaigns we’ve seen over the years look more like rebadged imports with the same old technology. But the Xone was a stark departure from that tired strategy.Instead, the Xone was a ground-up custom design that promised interesting new technology like photosensitive embedded lights that turn with the bike and gesture-activated embedded turn signals, touchscreen interface, facial recognition bike unlocking, and proportional regenerative braking that could be activated and modulated by pedaling backwards.The frame was also a novel design using sweeping hydroformed aluminum paired with a carbon fiber fork and beautiful Catalonian leatherwork in the saddle and handlebars — a staple of Rayvolt’s previous leather-clad bikes. Even the pedals were a custom in-house design instead of just another model number from the Wellgo pedal catalog.Multiple throttle and pedal-assist models were planned including slower 250W EU-legal models and faster 28 mph (45 km/h) 750W US-legal models.Delivery was expected this past summer — or at least that was the plan before the world and the electric bicycle industry in particular were turned upside down.As we’ve previously reported, e-bike popularity absolutely exploded as the pandemic grew. E-bike retailers couldn’t stock bikes fast enough, and component manufacturers started quoting lead times of more than a year for parts like handlebars and brakes.The problem was twofold: Factories around the world were shuttered during lockdowns while millions of soon-to-be new e-bike riders suddenly had time on their hands for recreational riding or the need to commute in a socially distant fashion.The Xone’s original timeframe was completely thrown out the window and the team was forced to rethink everything. Much of Europe went through three months of lockdowns. The Barcelona-based team took advantage of the lockdown to double down on their R&D while they waited for factories and parts suppliers to come back online.Rayvolt CEO Mat Razier explained in an interview with Electrek that the team used the period to meet a series of milestones, taking advantage of the lockdown to remain hyper-focused on R&D.The first milestone was reached just before the pandemic, when the Xone raised over $500,000 via Indiegogo, pre-selling the bikes for discounts at around $2,300 to fund their development and production. The next milestone was reached during the lockdown when the team developed the custom software to run the bike. Unlike most e-bikes that use standard controller programming, Rayvolt has their own e-bike operating system. However, that system had to be reworked to incorporate the vast array of sensors that gave the Xone its unique features, a responsibility that fell largely on Rayvolt CTO Jaime Pla. I met Jaime in Barcelona last year before the pandemic, and the guy is an absolute genius at combining software and hardware to innovate e-bikes in ways no one else is doing.Together Jaime and his team integrated their newly designed controller with their motor to allow proportional regenerative braking from backpedaling. A slight backward push gives limited regenerative braking, while a harder push provides more intense braking — all without touching the brake levers on the handlebars. “It works like a dream,” Mat Razier tells me.The majority of the R&D team worked from home in constant video calls, though Mat admits that he and Jaime would sneak into the office during lockdown, always sure to maintain appropriate distance from each other.With the software/hardware integration complete, the team turned to production planning. It turned out that hydroforming the complex aluminum shapes was harder than they had expected. It took the team several iterations of mold design to ultimately achieve the wrinkle-free surface they needed. With production coming back online and factories ramping back up, the team has now been able to produce their first production samples. The last hold-up is full production, which is still delayed. The team is planning an initial 1,000-unit run, but doesn’t expect to begin shipping completed Xone e-bikes until March of 2021. As Mat explained:We are now in the final stretch with most parts are being shipped to Europe for assembling now. The more problematic parts which experienced the most delays are shipping at the end of January. Once we have everything in hand we can assemble everything in 20 days, so we plan to ship in March.Despite its delays, the Xone will soon become the flagship model for Rayvolt’s new eXXite brand. Rayvolt’s existing e-bike line combines a vintage and sometimes even steampunk-ish aesthetic, and so the eXXite brand will help differentiate the more futuristic-looking e-bikes in the lineup while helping Rayvolt stick to its core of highly stylized brass and leather-adorned e-bikes.Mat plans to maintain a separate team to work on the eXXite line while still maintaining a bridge between the two brands to share technology resources. While the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench or two in the plans of e-bike manufacturers hoping to develop new, innovative electric bicycles, it didn’t totally derail them.Through creative teamwork and effort, those dedicated to bringing new advances to the e-bike industry have found that when there is a will, there is a way.We’re working on getting out to Barcelona as soon as it is safe to do so to bring you the first test of a production prototype Xone electric bicycle.Until then, let’s hear your thoughts on the novel design in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/12/22,"As 2020 draws to a close, those of us in the electric bicycle industry look back at the year with mixed emotions. While 2020 brought suffering and economic hardship upon the world in a way many of us had never seen, it also shook up the outdated status quo for urban transportation in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. That made 2020 a huge year for electric bicycles, and now we’re looking back at the five biggest stories of the year. Our readers and viewers voted with their clicks and their eyes, and here are the results.This wasn’t just one of the biggest e-bike stories of the year, it was one of the biggest electric vehicle stories of the year, period.It rivaled Tesla news and other heavyweights in the industry as millions of you tuned in to read about and watch our coverage of the rollout of Harley-Davidson’s highly anticipated electric bicycles.In October, we first broke the news of Harley-Davidson deciding to spin off an entire new startup, Serial 1 Cycle Company, to manufacturer and market the e-bikes.Then in November we became the first media outlet to get an early first ride on the bikes.That’s when we revealed the pricing starting at just $3,399, which shocked many who had feared a Harley-badged electric bike might command a much higher price.But with a high-end Brose mid-drive motor, Gates belt drive system, four piston hydraulic disc brakes, novel frame design with integrated lighting, and even a built-in glove box, the Serial 1 e-bikes actually stood their own as a competitive new option in the market, rivaling other premium brands in both components and pricing.Now time will tell just how many people are ready to put a Serial 1 e-bike in their garage.Technically Jeep had two stories in the top five, both when they unveiled the e-bike during the Super Bowl as well as when the Jeep e-bike began shipping. Apparently readers really wanted to know what the heck Jeep was doing building an electric bicycle.Through a partnership with the overlanding e-bike company QuietKat, Jeep launched its new off-road full-suspension electric bicycle in March for a whopping $5,899.For comparison, one of the most popular fat tire e-bikes that we’ve covered, the Rad Power Bikes RadRover, is priced at a mere $1,599.So what makes the Jeep bike so special (and so pricey)?Believe it or not, it isn’t just the sticker, though that doesn’t help. The bike is a powerhouse of an e-bike with a massive 1,500 W motor known as the Bafang Ultra, though QuietKat told us that they put special emphasis on controlling the power of the motor and making the ride manageable. That’s a good idea, since the motor is capable of putting out as much as 160 Nm of torque and has been known to shred bike chains when unlimited and under certain circumstances.I personally turned a bicycle chain into a work of modern art with that motor on a different model of e-bike when testing it out at the 2019 Eurobike show, much to the dismay of the dejected-looking Bafang rep when I wheeled it back in.But I digress; back to Jeep’s crazy e-bike. Together with QuietKat, they outfitted the bike with massive tires, high-end RockShox suspension, and a 9-speed Shimano transmission.And even if you thought $6,000 was too much for an e-bike, plenty of others have disagreed. I have it from a source very close to QuietKat’s ordering department that the company is pumping out thousands of the Jeep e-bikes. So it’s not just popular on the internet; the bike is making real sales, too.Not all of the biggest e-bike news of 2020 surrounded new product launches.In this story, we looked at a new problem being caused by the massive uptick in e-bike sales this year: customer service.With e-bike companies often doubling and tripling their sales in a matter of weeks or months, customer service became a huge issue quickly.VanMoof was one of many electric bicycle companies that saw its sales skyrocket. The unveiling and commencement of its new S3 and X3 e-bikes further boosted sales, but also laid the groundwork for an uphill customer service battle.The Holland-based company originally expected to field service requests or calls regarding around 1% of the bikes, but later found the number to be closer to 10%, requiring a huge increase in resources.Lectric Ebikes, a US-based e-bike distributor that exploded in popularity this year thanks to their highly regarded $899 folding fat-tire electric bikes, also felt the crunch in their customer service department. They began hiring quickly and set new, lofty goals for themselves, such as having 97% of phone calls being answered in under one minute and emails being treated more like a customer chat with quick responses.Rad Power Bikes, the largest e-bike company in the US, also went on a hiring spree to ensure the company was prepared to service its vastly growing customer base.Founder Mike Radenbaugh explained in a call with Electrek during the early days of the pandemic:We’re already hiring like crazy, our customer support team is up to about 40 or 50 right now, I’m not even sure. It’s hard to keep track. We should be up to around 70 in the next month or so.That was followed by Rad Power Bike’s unveiling of its first ever sub-$1,000 e-bike when the RadMission was launched at $999. Now up to its standard price of $1,099, the bike is still adding to Rad’s market dominance and the company’s need to quickly respond to an ever-growing community of riders.While Yamaha isn’t a newcomer to the electric bicycle industry (the company is actually responsible for the first-ever production electric bicycle in the early 1990s), the Yamaha YDX MORO was announced earlier this year as the brand’s first fulls-suspension electric mountain bike.The e-bike used a novel and patent-pending frame design known as a dual-twin design, which gave it a striking appearance.Both the top tube and down tube are actually split into two tubes each, with the lower portion of the frame cradling the battery while the upper frame provides deeper travel for the rear shock.The bike also uses Yamaha’s latest motor design, the PW-X2.The PW-X2 mid-drive motor system uses a unique quad-sensor setup that detects pedal speed, pedal torque, bike speed, and incline angle to more precisely calculate the required pedal assist output. The new motor also used helical gears to help reduce the noise of the motor, which is especially welcome in electric mountain bikes that operate far away from city noises that mask the sound of commuter e-bike motors.The intelligent motor can even operate in Automatic Mode where it auto-shifts between pedal assist modes, depending on how hard the rider needs to work to overcome various terrain.When I set out on my own personal quest to buy a cheap electric bicycle directly from China, I never imagined it would become one of the most popular e-bike stories of the year.But with so much of the e-bike industry’s manufacturing centered in China, apparently I wasn’t the only one interested in trying out one of these ultra-cheap electric bicycles.Xiaomi’s crowdfunding platform hosted the launch of the Himo V1 electric bicycle and I had a friend in China buy one for me for $261. I wired him the money and a bit extra to mail it back to me in the US, and then I got to experience the full effect of a Cheap chinese e-bike unboxing. You can see my unboxing and test ride video here.The small bike is certainly not designed for a typical American-sized rider. Fortunately I’m on the smaller end of the American size spectrum, and thus I fit on the bike pretty well. It’s only powered by a cute little 250W motor and is capped at the Chinese legal limit of 15.5 mph (25 km/h), but the tiny e-bike was still super fun to ride. It’s so small that you can toss it in the back of a car one-handed and barely even think about it.While there’s nothing high quality about it, it still surprised me with what I got for $261. Full LED lights, horn, an onboard charger, fenders, and even a rear rack (that was about the size of my fist) all made it onto the bike.While it’s not going to rival my favorite e-bikes anytime soon, the value was through the roof when you consider the price. It’s just too bad they aren’t available in the US!There you have it, the top five e-bike stories of 2021! I found the variety interesting, with the top stories including everything from new product launches, industry trends, and even e-bike testing. I’m excited to see what you value most in 2021, so keep checking back here on Electrek and join the millions of others finding our industry-leading electric vehicle and green energy reporting all in one place.",ebikes
2020/12/21,"Tern’s HSD electric cargo/utility e-bike is well-regarded as one of the company’s best values in high-quality electric bikes. And now the Tern HSD is getting a significant performance boost with the introduction of a Class 3 version HSD S11 capable of up to 28 mph (45 km/h) in the US.Tern’s GSD and HSD e-bikes are some of the nicest small format yet large capacity electric cargo bikes we’ve tested.The unique design has been imitated but is largely unmatched in the industry.Previously, the US version of the HSD has been capped at 20 mph (32 km/h). But now a new version known as the Class 3 HSD S11 is pushing Tern’s envelope.That higher speed is possible thanks to the adoption of the Bosch Performance Line Sport motor. It’s a motor that doesn’t get as much attention as the more common 20 mph (32 km/h) options in Bosch’s lineup, but does open the door to faster e-bikes in the US and speed pedelecs in Europe.As explained by Steve Boyd, General Manager of Stile, the US distributor for Tern: “The e-bike market is booming, but what’s most exciting is that a lot of this growth is from new riders discovering how great it is to get around by bike. Cycling is clean, green, and socially distanced. And with Bosch’s powerful new motor, the HSD S11 just might become the fastest way to get around dense urban neighborhoods.”The launch of Tern’s new HSD S11 with higher speed limit comes at a time when e-bike use for utility-oriented riding is at an all-time high. As e-bike adoption continues to grow in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of riders are using cargo and utility e-bikes for everything from child transport to cargo-carrying and delivery services.The HSD is one of the more visible e-bikes in the space, offering high-end components but without the sky-high price of some of the traditional premium e-bikes such as those from Riese & Müller.The bike is rated for up to 374 lb (170 kg) of payload via the first-ever cargo e-bike safety rating standard, fits a variety of kid-carriers and cargo attachments, and includes a suite of high-quality components such as high-end Magura hydraulic disc brakes, built-in Abus Amsterdam lock, and an 11-speed Shimano Deore XT Shadow+ derailleur – parts obviously not found on standard budget-level e-bikes.Of course, that also pushes the price higher than budget e-bikes, with the Tern HSD S11 carrying an MSRP of $4,199. Still cheaper than the likes of several other premium e-bike brands, but enough to put a lump in the throat of most casual e-bike shoppers.For those willing to pony up the cash for a high-end (and now high-speed) e-bike, US dealers should have the new HSD S11 in stock by January.I’ve been a big fan of the HSD (and its larger brother the GSD) for years now. I first got a taste of how utility-oriented the GSD truly was when Tern founder Josh Hon drove me around on the back of one at Interbike. We cruised up and down hills without the bike breaking a sweat or even once making me think I’d get dumped off a little bike carrying two grown adults. A year later I had the chance to test out the HSD that improved upon the GSD’s value proposition and I came away similarly impressed. I’ve always felt that Class 3 e-bikes were a powerful commuting tool, though it is important to make sure riders are well educated in their proper use and always ride them responsibly.High speeds on electric bikes are no joke. When you’re flying at 28 mph (45 km/h) with a heavy bike, things happen quickly. The Magura hydraulic brakes on the HSD certainly help slow things down, but I still think that people need to look at Class 3 e-bikes differently and consider when and where to use that extra speed. Open bike lanes? Go for it! Crowded mixed-use areas? Perhaps slow it down a bit.But when used responsibly, Class 3 e-bikes make excellent car replacements in many urban areas. And since the HSD was already practically a mini SUV on two wheels, the new higher speed should make it even more capable.",ebikes
2020/12/20,"If you thought you knew all of the mid-drive motors in the e-bike world, think again. The French company Valeo has just unveiled a radical new type of mid-drive electric motor that adds a built-in automatic transmission.Automatic transmissions alone aren’t unique in the e-bike space.We’ve tested several models that feature mid-drive motors paired with automatic transmissions.They’re fancy, but they’re ultimately just a combination of parts. Take Serial 1’s Brose S Mag mid-drive motor paired with automatic CVT from Enviolo built into the rear hub. Awesome, yes. But not a technological advancement in its own right.Paris-based manufacturer Valeo, on the other hand, worked with transmission maker Effigear to actually build an automatic transmission directly into the mid-drive motor and create a single unit.The result is known as the Valeo Smart e-Bike System and can be integrated into OEM e-bikes similarly to typical mid-drive motors like those from Bosch or Yamaha.It features seven gear ratios and is designed to operate on 48V, with Valeo offering a downtube-mounted battery as part of the system.The motor is capable of outputing up to 130 Nm of torque, though a power rating isn’t immediately available. The company claims that the Valeo drive is “up to 60% more powerful than competitors,” without giving specific wattage numbers. No matter the true power rating though, the Valeo’s EU location means it is likely to receive a 250W sticker.Since the Valeo Smart e-Bike System completely does away with the need for a derailleur, a belt drive setup can be used. That provides a number of unique benefits over chain drives, such as quieter operation, longer lasting components, and cleaner operation without the need for oiling.Another advantage of moving the transmission from the rear wheel to the center of the bike is the improved mass centralization.Onboard pedal cadence and torque sensors keep track of the user’s pedal input and use that information to engage the motor power as well as determine when to shift gears. There’s apparently a reverse function as well that will be available for use on cargo e-bikes, but I’m not sure how that will work with a freewheel in the system.For anti-theft, the system can also lock up the gears on command. Realistically that wouldn’t stop a thief from throwing the bike in a van, but it would at least prevent a pedal-powered getaway.While Valeo has produced a few prototype bikes to show the drive in action (see video below), the company doesn’t plan to produce their own e-bikes the way that some mid-drive manufacturers like Yamaha have done. Instead, they’ll follow the more common method employed by companies like Bosch and Brose to license the technology for use by OEMs to produce e-bikes built on the Valeo platform.What do you think of Valeo’s system? Let us know in the comment section below!via: Bikerumor",ebikes
2020/12/17,"The Ride1Up LMT’D electric bicycle is a great example of a recent trend we’re seeing in the e-bike industry. Companies are starting to outfit their e-bikes with higher-spec parts while keeping prices reasonable. And that makes the Ride1Up LMT’D an easy e-bike to recommend.In my testing of the bike I found it to be an excellent candidate for anyone that needs a comfortable, well-built e-bike for urban riding, and who wants a bike with slightly better and more rugged components than a typical value e-bike. Watch my brief but action-packed video review of the Ride1Up LMT’D below before reading on for all of the details!The Ride1Up LMT’D e-bike is a hybrid-style commuter e-bike that is nicely outfitted without pushing the price too high.For just $1,695 you’re getting a fast, 28 mph (45 km/h) Class 3 e-bike with a powerful 1 kW peak motor, torque sensor bottom bracket, slickly integrated removable 672 Wh battery, an RST Asteria adjustable air-suspension fork, crisp Auriga hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm rotors, a mid-shelf Shimano Alivio-based 8-speed drivetrain, and Schwalbe Super Moto X tires.That’s a lot of nice parts for barely over the industry standard $1,500 for a typical decent-level commuter e-bike.And that spec sheet isn’t just for show; these components actually contribute to a better ride and a nicer ownership experience.The fast top speed means that you can keep up with traffic instead of being stuck on the side of the road. (And as an e-bike commuter, not getting passed by cars is a big part of safer riding.)The powerful 1,000W peak motor with 100 Nm of torque can shred hills that weaker 350W or 500W would wimp out on.The torque sensor in the bottom bracket means that pedal assist is smoother than cadence-based systems and also initiates quicker when you engage the pedals. There’s a noticeable difference between the two systems, and I much prefer a torque sensor like this when I’m pedaling an e-bike for sport or fitness.The integrated battery makes the e-bike stealthier and doesn’t immediately scream “Hey, I’m on an electric bicycle!” Plus it is quite large for an integrated battery at 672 Wh. Most integrated batteries are closer to 500 Wh. But with the Ride1Up LMT’D, you can actually get well over 30 miles (50 km) of range with reasonable pedal assist, and approach it with throttle operation.The Tektro Auriga hydraulic disc brakes are responsive and powerful, giving you crisp braking that also happens to be essentially zero maintenance. There’s no adjustments to be made until you eventually wear out your brake pads, which can usually be a once-a-year swap for many riders.The RST Asteria air-suspension fork isn’t your typical cheap springer fork you’ll find on a basic commuter e-bike. It actually allows you to adjust the air pressure to dial in your suspension for your weight and riding style.And those Schwalbe Super Moto X tires… *chef’s kiss* They’re just awesome tires. If you’ve ever done a round on them, you know. If you haven’t, you’re in for a treat. I just love taking corners confidently while wearing those Super Moto X tires!The Ride1Up LMT’D combines all of those nice parts with a comfortable frame geometry that has you in a hybrid seating position somewhere between a forward lean and and upright ride. It’s not too over the bars and also not too cruiser. It’s just right for sporty yet comfy riding that fits nicely into a typical commuter scenario. If you want to be wrapped up in a tuck on your way to work as if you’re leading the peloton, there are other bikes for you. But for us mere mortals, this is a great design for the masses.Of course the Ride1Up LMT’D isn’t perfect, and I can always find a few areas to complain.For one, there are no lights on the bike. That just feels like a silly oversight. A bike this nice needs some integrated lighting running off the main battery. Next, you don’t get any racks or fenders as standard equipment. You can add a rack as separate accessory, but I’d rather see these parts included since this isn’t a mountain bike or fat tire e-bike that is expected to remain off-road for much of its life.But other than those two nitpicks, the Ride1Up LMT’D is a really nicely outfitted e-bike at a more than reasonable price. And considering that you get free shipping AND a 30-day trial period with a no-questions-asked return and refund policy if you don’t like the bike, it’s really an awesome deal.At a price of $1,695, you are shelling out a bit more than some other competitors in the urban/commuter e-bike space.But I think that the price is very fair for what you get. These are nice components on a bike with excellent performance. For a fast e-bike with a big battery that is slickly integrated into the frame, you can’t go wrong on a Ride1Up LMT’D.You maybe be looking elsewhere for some lights or a fender set, but the bones are good on this e-bike and that’s what’s critical.

2020/12/15,"The Cyrusher XF800 electric bicycle is big. It is bold. It is crushing. Err, make that Cyrushing.Basically, this fat tire e-bike is a lot of things and we’re going to talk about all them.Cyrusher is an Asian import e-bike brand, and to answer your first question: The name is apparently a portmanteau of “cycling” and “rusher”.Hey, I didn’t choose the name. I’m just reviewing the thing.Odd name aside, this e-bike has a lot to love, especially if you’re a fan of the larger things in life.It’s an all-terrain e-bike that unlike most fat tire electric bicycles, places an interesting emphasis on urban riding. You’re going to want to check out my video review below. Then read on for all of my thoughts on this interesting (and massive) addition to the e-bike space.So here’s the skinny: the Cyrusher XF800 is designed to bring full-suspension electric fat tire biking to the masses at an affordable price.We’ve reviewed other full-suspension fat tire e-bikes before that can push the price close to $3k or more.Currently on sale for $2,150, the Cyrusher XF800 helps lower the floor for full-suspension electric fat tire bikes.At the same time, it’s not the highest quality full-suspension fat tire bike I’ve ever ridden. And that tracks, because you’re going to have to make some compromises to get the price down to this level.In this case, the major compromises include areas such as the average-sized battery, simple Shimano Tourney derailleur, and cheap plastic fenders.But if you can get past those compromises, you still get a lot here. We’re talking a 1,500 W peak-rated Bafang motor that will have you lurching forward whenever you want to dump full power. We’re talking front and rear suspension combined with 26″x4″ fat tires for all-terrain riding. We’re talking hydraulic disc brakes to bring this careening mass of an e-bike to a stop.You even get a headlight, though mine unfortunately arrived cracked during shipping. I wish better luck upon you, dear reader.So while there are a few cheap parts here, overall the bike is pretty well equipped. But what is it equipped for? That’s coming up next!When most people think “fat tire e-bike” they usually conjure up images of root-strewn trails, sandy beach riding, or even snowbank assailing. And while the Cyrusher XF800 can do all of those things, it is interestingly outfitted for a different purpose: urban riding.And that makes sense. Look, this is certainly a full-suspension e-bike. But this isn’t amazing, premium damping suspension we’re talking about there. This is “oh that pothole wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be” suspension.I’ve ridden e-bikes with amazing trail suspension before. This ain’t it.But what this fork and rear shock are good for, if not the nuances of hugging a rocky banked turn, is absorbing the dangers of the urban jungle.Speed bumps, curbs, potholes, a random two-by-four that fell off a truck for some reason – the Cyrusher XF850 laughs at them all. I wouldn’t bomb a pro downhill mountain bike course on this e-bike, but I would commute the hell out of this bad boy!With the included rear rack, fenders, trunk bag, and lighting, it’s also a pretty good utilitarian commuter as well. I just wish they included better quality fenders since every time I hop off a 6-inch curb, the impact sends the plastic fenders down into the tire and I get that “BBDBBDBBDBBDBBDBBDBBDBBD” noise until I reach down and yank the thing back up.But if you aren’t routinely getting air on your ride, the fenders will probably be fine for you. If you want to put those knobby tires to use though and hit the trails, I’d recommend just disconnecting the fenders until you get home.And while that trunk bag probably doesn’t cost the company much to add, it’s actually a really awesome accessory to see included for free. It’s got a ton of independent pockets, an expansion compartment if you need it to stretch around something bigger, a cargo net on top for strapping in weird shaped things, and even a waterproof slipcover. Do you really need 1.5 kW of power? Probably not.But it sure is fun!That power is what makes this bike a potent hill climber, dirt rider, and all-around-fun e-bike.Plus, we’re surely looking at a 750 W continuous motor anyway, so you’re probably still going to fit into local e-bike laws – at least in the US.But pair that motor with a beefy enough controller and you’ll be pumping enough watts through it to really get those tires roaring. But here again, there’s a downside. With just a 624 Wh battery (48 V 13 Ah), full power riding all the time will drain your pack quickly. When I’m going all out on throttle-only riding, 20 miles (32 km) is a reasonable range estimate. When I switch to pedal-assist I can of course do better on range, but I’m still limited by what is an admittedly average-sized battery.I would have loved to see a larger 800+ Wh battery to feed this hungry motor and inefficient fat tires, though I’m not sure that’s in the cards at this price.So ultimately, I’m left with a lot of advantages and a few small yet important disadvantages. The Cyrusher XF800 is a blast to ride. I can cut across nearly any shortcut in my commute, medians and curbs be darned. I can detour through the park and even hit the trails.The urban-oriented accessories make the bike a utilitarian commuter and the full-suspension soaks up poor-quality roads.The power is great, though the range doesn’t overwhelm me. And at a price of $2,150 (for the holidays), I’d call it a good yet not great deal. No one really needs full-suspension, in my opinion, it’s a luxury. But I still love seeing full-suspension fat tire e-bikes dropping in price like this to the point where they start to become even more attractive to those looking for plush rides.The Cyrusher XF800 isn’t top of the line, but it democratizes full-suspension fun for a pretty decent price. And that’s alright by me.",ebikes
2020/12/14,"TV personality Simon Cowell is apparently considering taking legal action against an electric motorbike (not ebike) manufacturer after suffering serious injuries in a crash.The electric motorbike Cowell was riding is known as a Swind EB-01.Much of the media has misreported the story by describing the Swind EB-01 as an electric bicycle. In fact, the bike’s performance puts it into a very different category.With a top speed of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a motor power of 15 kW (20 hp), the Swind EB-01 is much more of an electric motorcycle that happens to have pedals attached to it instead of foot pegs.The bike takes significant experience and skill to ride safely, as it packs approximately 60x the power of a legal electric bicycle in Cowell’s native UK.The TV personality apparently discovered the bike at a UK motor show in January and created significant buzz with his purchase. He became one of the company’s first customers for the approximately $22,000 electric motorbike. Arrangements were made to ship the Swind EB-01 to Cowell’s California home.However, a new whistleblower report reveals that there was some hesitation from certain employees in the company about whether Cowell would be risking his safety on the highly specialized motorbike. One former Swind employee apparently claimed to the British tabloid the Sun that he worried that Cowell could “break his f***ing neck” on the bike. He indicated that the bike required specialist training and demonstration, saying, “That thing is a death trap and should never have been sold to Simon without him being taught how to use it.”Another anonymous source at the company said, “I said to my boss, ‘Are you showing Simon how to use this?’ He said he was just dropping it off and I said, ‘Are you serious?’”Ultimately, Cowell’s accident, which Electrek‘s Michelle Lewis reported about on August 10, was most likely caused by this inexperience and unfamiliarity with the bike. Cowell has several other true electric bicycles with much lower power levels. But when he tried operating the Swind EB-01 in the driveway of his Malibu mansion in front of his family members, he was reportedly unprepared for the extreme power. The bike entered an immediate wheelie, causing Cowell to fall backwards and break three vertebrae.Controlling a powerful electric motorbike during a wheelie is a highly specialized operation that requires shifting the rider’s weight forward while feathering the rear brake to prevent pitching too far rearward.But these maneuvers are not intuitive, and anyone without experience is unlikely to know to execute them.The former employee continued, explaining:The first thing someone with no training is going to do is squeeze that accelerator and they are going to have an accident. When I heard about the crash, I knew straight away he had been on our bike. I was wracked with guilt and thought I could have said more — but was worried about my job. I said they should change the settings so you can’t go into the highest map until it is going a certain speed — but was just told that was the way it was.Now Cowell is reportedly considering taking legal action against the manufacturer, with a figure as high as £10 million being floated by legal observers to cover pain, suffering and lost income from missing several television appearances.According to a representative for Cowell:Simon is understandably extremely concerned for other peoples’ safety in relation to this bike. We’ve been pressing the manufacturer about this and will continue to press them, including in relation to the claims of the former member of staff.I do feel bad for Cowell and wish him a speedy recovery.And I do think he had no business being on a bike that he wasn’t prepared to handle, probably making an honest mistake after misunderstanding the power of the bike.But I’m not sure where we draw the line between personal and corporate responsibility. While Swind should have demonstrated more responsibility in ensuring that customers like Cowell understand the dangers of the product, at what point does that become their legal requirement? And how do you even check whether a customer is “experienced enough”?This electric motorbike was designed for something entirely different than what Cowell was trying to do. This is an extreme off-road electric motorbike. It is meant to climb big dirt jumps and survive massive drops.Cowell was reportedly riding this thing in his driveway, which is presumably close to a public road (and this is obviously not a street-legal motorbike). Cowell had the bike far out of its element and lacked the experience needed to operate it safely.I have to assume that Cowell made a simple mistake that many honest people would make — he saw pedals and thought this was an electric bicycle. And Cowell has experience on several electric bicycles, so he would have assumed he would be fine. But as we’ve seen, this is anything but an electric bicycle.So the answer here seems to be that we need to find a way to further distance this sport of extreme electric mountain biking from normal electric bicycles so that consumers understand the difference, and companies can further discriminate between casual weekend riders and true motorbike athletes with proper riding skills for this level of vehicle.At the very least (and this is something that could be done immediately) they could attach a warning sticker to the handle bars saying something like “if you twist this throttle, you are going to be on your back”. A better solution would be a smooth acceleration curve by default and then an advanced hack/setting that let the full throttle be uncorked. Also, as Harley has done with its Livewire, we would love to see more wheelie control hardware that cuts off power if the front wheel begins to lift off the ground. But I’m guessing that’s not going to happen. Instead, lawyers will negotiate who owes who money.",ebikes
2020/12/13,"Over the last few years, I’ve had the pleasure of throwing my leg over hundreds of electric bicycles. And with the skyrocketing popularity of e-bikes this year, 2020 saw me doing more electric bicycle reviews than ever before.With so many unique advantages among the many different bikes, I’ve chosen my favorite models from several different categories of e-bikes below.When people think of electric bicycles, this is often the class they imagine first. Commuter-style e-bikes are designed for mostly urban riding and favor a balance between comfort and efficiency.Rad Power Bikes RadCityThe RadCity is a $1,499 e-bike from the largest electric bicycle company in the US, Rad Power Bikes. It offers familiar Class 2 e-bike performance with a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) from its 750W rear hub motor.The RadCity offers a number of accessory-mounting hardpoints that are a bit of a golden handcuffs situation. There are tons of accessory-mounting options, but you’re largely limited to Rad’s vast walled garden of in-house accessories. For me though, the sheer number of accessories that Rad offers makes it well worth it.Plus, the RadCity already comes nicely outfitted with included lights, fenders, and a rear rack, so you’re perfectly set up for commuting right out of the box. See my review of the RadCity here.Aventon LevelThe Aventon Level is a bit pricer at $1,599, but you get the benefits of an integrated (yet still removable) battery, a beautifully welded frame, and hydraulic disc brakes.Oh yeah, and it can take you all the way up to 28 mph (45 km/h) as a Class 3 electric bicycle.As much as I love this bike, I still ding it for not including built-in lights — but since those are easily added, it still makes my favorite list for being such a high quality, well-made electric bike with a fair price. See my full Aventon Level review here.Priority CurrentThe Priority Current is the priciest commuter e-bike on my favorites list at $3,299, but it deserves this spot due to its high-end component suite.Not only does it have strong hydraulic disc brakes, bright built-in lighting, and an integrated battery, but it also sports a powerful mid-drive motor and a choice between two different internally geared rear hubs: a NuVinci Enviolo continuously variable transmission or Shimano 5-speed rear hub. Plus, it adds a Gates belt drive system as the cherry on top.It’s just a beautifully designed and outfitted e-bike at a very fair price. See my full Priority Current review here.Mini-bike and moped-style electric bicycles were perhaps one of the fastest growing e-bike trends of 2020. While designs vary, they generally share a few things in common, including small-diameter wheels with wider tires, bench seats, and pedal-forward geometries.ONYX RCRThe ONYX RCR is the epitome of a classic moped-style e-bike. Despite including pedals, the 60 mph (97 km/h) ONYX RCR fully embraces the “mo” part of moped with its 5.4 kW peak motor.This is not an e-bike for the casual rider, though. It’s an incredibly powerful machine that requires high-speed two-wheeler experience to be ridden safely. And at $4,149, it’s not a impulse purchase either. See my full ONYX RCR review here.Juiced HyperScorpionThe Juiced HyperScorpion brings us back down into borderline electric bicycle territory. It is still plenty powerful with an over 1.5 kW motor and a top speed that nudges into the low 30’s of mph (50+ km/h).But it is also a pedalable electric bicycle that can be easily returned to Class 2 or Class 3 mode for legally operating in bike lanes.With its full suspension, wide tires, bench seat, mirrors, turn signals, and other features, it makes an awesome e-bike for cruising the town in style and comfort. And at its current sale price of $2,199, it is reasonably priced for all that you get. See my full Juiced HyperScorpion review here. And if you ask Electrek’s Seth Weintraub, he’ll tell you that the bike’s HyperScrambler 2 cousin is equally awesome.Ariel Rider D ClassThe Ariel Rider D Class is more mini-bike than moped thanks to its top-tank style frame, but it definitely fits in this category. With a pair of 1.5 kW peak motors, this e-bike is ridiculously powered. I’d even call it over-powered, especially since I can do dual-wheel burnouts on it.The AWD nature of the bike is fun, though you can switch it into front- or rear-wheel drive and limit the power if it’s too much for your riding conditions. The front suspension is nice, but the rigid rear will have you appreciating the plush bench seat as substitute suspension.At $2,199, this is another reasonably priced e-bike considering the high power and high capacity battery you’re getting.See my full Ariel Rider D Class review here.Super73 Z1While the Super73 Z1 doesn’t have the power or battery capacity of these other impressive e-bikes, it made my list for its low cost and swagger. It’s only $1,260 and still gives you that fun, vintage-look that Super73 is known for, yet costs half the price of most other vintage-style e-mopeds.You’re only going to get up to 20 mph with this Class 2 e-bike, but you’re going to look cool as hell while you do it!See my full Super73 Z1 review here.While single-speed e-bikes are certainly a type of commuter e-bike, I gave them their own category due to the rising popularity in 2020 of this style of e-bike.Ride1UP Roadster V2I’m currently putting miles on a Ride1Up Roadster V2, and I’m loving this thing. It looks like an old-school fixie messenger bike, yet still offers good power and 24 mph (38 km/h) top speed.It is pedal assist-only, but the belt drive makes it a pleasure to pedal and oh so quiet!But the cherry on top is definitely the $995 price. You just can’t find another stealthy, belt-drive e-bike like this one for less!Rad Power Bikes RadMissionThe RadMission caused a huge stir when it was announced this Summer, and for good reason.It is Rad’s lowest-priced e-bike yet at just $1,099. It still offers the typical 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed found in other Rad Power Bike models, though the 500 W motor and 500  Wh battery are both a bit smaller than the rest of the company’s line up.Still, at this price, the bike is a no-brainer. You get the peace of mind of a colossal brand and the fun ride of a lightweight, single-speed e-bike! See my full RadMission review here.Full-suspension e-bikes offer a ride unlike anything else. They can smooth out bumpy roads and let you tackle rutted-out trails at speeds you wouldn’t imagine trying on a hardtail e-bike.I don’t really know what I’m doing, but I think I’m getting better. And my FREY EX is definitely helping! 1.5kW! (Though this was on Eco mode with just pedal assist) pic.twitter.com/lvCF6cH5rpFREY EX PROIt’s hard to choose just one FREY bike for this list, especially after I visited the company’s headquarters in China and tested out just about every model they make. But if I had to choose one, it’d be the FREY EX Pro. Not only does it have phenomenal top-shelf RockShox suspension, including a RockShox Lyrik fork that alone costs more than some e-bikes on this list, but it also rocks TWO batteries and a 1.5 kW Bafang Ultra mid-drive motor.This is just a beast of a full-suspension e-bike that can hit speeds of over 35 mph (56 km/h) and fly meters in the air, all in the same ride. It’s not cheap at just over $4,000 depending on the options, but it is an entirely different class of e-bike.See my FREY EX Pro review here.E-cells SuperMonarch AWD Crown 1500E-cells has several models of the Super Monarch AWD line with varying motor power levels, from 700W to 1500W. Of course, my favorite is going to be the 1500W model though!With dual motors, dual suspension, and dual batteries, this massive fat-tire e-bike is a beast that can tackle anything from urban riding to sand dune climbing to forest trails and even Overlanding. The giant e-bike feels like a truck and is not for the meek rider. If you’ve got the need for speed and power, this 30+ mph (50+ km/h) e-bike will get you there.And if the $4,195 price is too steep, check out the slightly lower power (and some would say more reasonably powered) models from E-cells, which are still tons of fun while being more affordable.And be sure to take a look at my full Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 review here.Rad Power Bikes RadWagon 4Rad Power Bikes updated the RadWagon with the RadWagon 4 this year. The motor was changed to a geared motor, the size of the wheels was reduced to 22″, and other smaller changes were made to help make the bike more comfortable and even better handling. Having reviewed the previous model, I can say that the updates made this long-tail cargo bike even better than it already was at hauling both people and gear. The RadWagon features Rad’s standard performance figures of a 750W motor, 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed, and 672 Wh battery.And with that long bench on the back, you can fit just about anything imaginable on this e-bike. For $1,599, this is an incredibly capable cargo e-bike.See my full RadWagon 4 review here.Rad Power Bikes RadRunnerRad Power Bikes actually scored two bikes in my favorite cargo/utility category. The RadRunner can still haul cargo and passengers like its RadWagon big brother. But the RadRunner is a smaller, lighter, and more nimble e-bike. It can wiggle around in tighter places, take up less room in your garage, and more easily fit into a vehicle for transportation. And at just $1,199, the price is outstanding for the value that you get with this utility e-bike. Sure, there’s no front suspension, and the display is a simple model, but who cares? The bike rides great on those big tires, even without suspension, and it is simply a blast to use!See my full RadRunner review here.Tern HSDWhile Rad Power Bikes makes great cargo and utility bikes, they can’t compare to the higher quality (though higher priced at $3,100+) Tern HSD.This e-bike uses a small format design yet still includes a big rear rack for hauling all of your gear. It can even be parked vertically on its tail to save space!And with a Bosch mid-drive motor, you get much more freedom to choose your gearing with motor assist — though you have to give up a throttle, unfortunately.Still, Tern makes phenomenal e-bikes that are designed to last for years and years. They cost more, but they are worth it for anyone who favors the “buy it for life” mentality.See my full Tern HSD review here. And if you want to see the even higher-spec’d GSD, we reviewed that one too.Lectric XPThe Lectric XP folding fat-tire e-bike took the e-bike industry by storm over the past year and a bit.The fast and fun 28 mph (45 km/h) e-bike is priced at an incredible $899, helping it become the first e-bike for thousands of people this year.While it lacks high-end components and also saves money by foregoing any suspension, the bike still works great and is incredibly accessible. The company even launched a step-thru version this year, further opening the door of accessibility.See my full review of the Lectric XP e-bike here.GoCycle GX 2020On the other end of the pricing spectrum is the GoCycle GX. This e-bike may be more expensive at $3,299, but it is a highly-engineered e-bike that is designed for riders seeking the ultimate in hassle-free, long-lasting folding e-bike design.Engineered by a former McLaren designer, the GoCycle GX uses a pair of single-sided proprietary wheels, a fully-enclosed CleanDrive drivetrain, and offers rear suspension from a unique swingarm design. The bike folds quickly and effortlessly in a way that still allows it to roll as it is pushed or pulled like a piece of carry-on luggage. It’s an engineering work of art. The quality and craftsmanship really show you what happens when automotive designers enter the e-bike space, and the result is an awesome folding e-bike.See my full GoCycle GX 2020 review here.Serial 1 MoshI did not expect Harley-Davidson to make this list, but upon testing its first-ever electric bicycle, I knew it had to be here. The Serial 1 Mosh is an incredibly capable bike that had me cruising city streets, weaving through traffic cones, hopping curbs, and bombing downhill dirt trails all in the same afternoon. This is really a do-anything type of e-bike.Powered by a Brose S-Mag mid-drive motor and sporting high-end components, the Serial 1 Mosh is just a blast to ride. It’s not cheap at $3,399, but it’s so much fun to ride and built so well that I definitely think it is worth the price. And did I mention that it has a freakin’ glove box?!See my full Serial 1 test ride here.Ecotric fat tireEcotric’s 500W fat tire bike isn’t fancy. It’s not really that special. It’s just a reasonably-priced fat tire bike that can handle a variety of terrain and is a great way for anyone on a budget to get into the hobby of fat tire e-bike riding. The ride is a bit rougher without any suspension, but like the Lectric XP above, the low price of $869 helps you look past that and simply enjoy the fun of cruising on a 20 mph (32 km/h), fat tire e-bike that didn’t break the bank! So while it isn’t a fancy e-bike, it’s a good e-bike at a great price. And in that way, it actually became one of my favorites for bringing off-road e-biking to the masses at such an affordable price.See my full Ecotric Fat Tire e-bike review here.CSC FT750CSC is actually a motorcycle company, but its first electric bicycle nailed the mark for a fun, nicely-spec’d fat tire bike. At $1,699, you get nice suspension, 750W motors, hydraulic disc brakes, built-in lighting, and great handling.The bike even comes in two different models, a larger format 26″ wheel e-bike and a BMX-style 20″ wheel e-bike. They’re both a blast, with the larger one being a better commuter or cruiser e-bike and the smaller one being better for nimble or trick riding.See my full CSC FT750 review here.Electric Bike Co Model RSpeaking of cruisers, the Electric Bike Company Model R is something of a cruiser meets commuter e-bike. It has a more laid-back riding style, yet has urban-ready tires and front suspension that is perfect as an urban assault e-bike. And that 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed is certainly a big part of the draw as well.Electric Bike Company even builds its e-bikes in California, making the low $2,199 price even more impressive.See my full Model R review here. And if you want to see a behind the scenes view of their Newport Beach, California factory, check that out here.As you can see, there is an amazing amount of variety in the e-bike industry.With so many options, I truly believe there is an e-bike out there for everyone.These are my favorites from the e-bikes I’ve tested lately, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other awesome models waiting for you as well.I’ll continue putting the miles on to bring you more interesting electric bicycles well into 2021 and beyond!",ebikes
2020/12/11,"North Carolina-based Huck Cycles may be less than a year old, but the electric moped company is moving fast!I first stumbled upon the company in April of this year. There was almost no information available, so I called up founder Brett McCoy to figure out what was going on with this obscure little e-moped startup. As it turned out, Huck Cycles was flying under the radar for a reason. The new company was a boutique manufacturer, creating impressive retro-inspired yet high-performance electric mopeds at a rate of less than 10 per month. The company was veteran-owned and operated, which I appreciated as a vet myself, and their bikes had that classic old-school feel combined with the latest light EV tech. Despite their low-volume production, they had a wide range of models and options ranging from 750W electric bicycles up to 3,000W and 60 mph (97 km/h) electric mopeds. And all of the bikes were built locally, starting right down from the frame welding. I knew I had to write about them and share Brett’s story. So I did.That was less than 8 months ago, and boy have things changed. I just caught up with Brett to hear how they’ve handled the onslaught of press and attention that followed.What had originally been a 2-man operation has grown into 10+ employees and counting. The team went from single digits of bikes per month to 50. They’ve now produced several hundred electric mopeds and sent them to customers across the US and Canada. They’ve even sent bikes around the world, with Huck models currently on the streets in Europe and as far away as South Korea.Each bike is designed by the customer together with the Huck team during the ordering process, meaning no two bikes have ever been the same.The company has now moved into a larger 5,000 sq ft (464 square meter) shop to increase its production capacity.They’ve also expanded their features, adding VINs over the summer to allow owners to register the electric mopeds correctly and thus ride legally as a moped or motorcycle.They introduced new battery options up to 72V 30Ah (2.16kWh) and 72V 50Ah (3.6kWh), which Brett tells me is the largest battery available in the electric moped space. In fact, it’s so large that it is the starting battery size for a base-level Zero FX electric motorcycle.The 2,000W Rebel and 3,000W Stinger models have received major overhauls since the last time we covered them, and Brett is preparing for the release of two new models, the Huck Rhino and Huck Fury.The Huck Rhino will debut as a dual motor electric work bike capable of all-wheel-drive (watch out, UBCO!)The Huck Fury will be a 5,000 W and 65 mph (105 km/h) mid-size vintage-style electric motorcycle with a centrally-mounted motor and belt drive. It should be ready in spring 2021. Huck will also be launching a new display around that time with more complete vehicle data and Bluetooth connectivity.As if vastly expanding production and preparing to roll out two new electric motorcycles wasn’t enough, Brett explained that Huck Cycles is also readying its European expansion:We are in the process of securing a production facility and sales operations in the UK to service the EU market. We hope to have our bikes tested and approved for road use this spring and operations up and running by early-to-mid summer. And most importantly, riders in the market by the end of summer.The 2,000 W and 45-50 mph (70-80 km/h) Huck Rebel is currently priced at $4,250, while the 3,000W and 60 mph (97 km/h) Huck Stinger is priced at $4,900. That price includes the VIN registered with the NHTSA.If you want to get your own electric moped from Huck Cycles, you’ll have to be patient. Crushing demand has now pushed wait times to as long as 12 weeks.But we’ve got some solace for you at least in the form of a $300 off coupon that Brett generously offered to our readers.

2020/12/10,"Ducati’s range of electric bicycles has been big news in Europe over the last couple of years since the company’s big e-bike debut. But today Ducati is announcing that the motorcycle brand will finally bring its e-bikes to the US.The first models to become available in the US at Ducati’s motorcycle dealerships will be the Ducati E-Scrambler and MIG-S models.Both models will be available later this month.The Ducati E-Scrambler is an urban trekking electric bike that was announced in July of this year and is powered by a Shimano STEPS E7000 motor.That motor puts out a nominal 250 watts (though real world power output is higher) and an actual 60 Nm of torque, all from the lightweight 2.8 kg (6 lb) mid-drive unit.The motor is powered by a 504 Wh Shimano battery that gets mounted below the downtube to lower the bike’s center of gravity.The E-Scrambler hasn’t been cheap, priced at around US$4,200 in Europe, though the US price will be lower at US$3,999.The MIG-S, on the other hand, is built purely for off-road riding. This electric mountain bike uses the Shimano STEPS E8000 motor. The geometry of the frame has also been updated, with the frame slightly stretched compared to the previous model and a new seat tube angle.The MIG-S will carry an MSRP of $5,295, thanks in large part to a more robust suite of components.Ducati’s most recently unveiled TK-01RR electric mountain bike model won’t be arriving in the US until February.The TK-01RR features the recently released Shimano EP-08 mid-drive motor, weighing just 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) while producing an impressive 85 Nm of torque. The e-bike provides up to 400% assist in its highest pedal assist mode.The TK-01RR frame uses a more vertically oriented downtube that also supports an underslung 630 Wh Shimano battery.Ducati had previously announced plans to enter the US before the COVID-19 pandemic, but like many e-bike companies making plans in an uncertain market, they didn’t quite pan out on the company’s original timeframe.Electric bicycles will be the first electric two-wheelers to enter Ducati’s dealerships, but they may not be the last. Ducati’s CEO has previously confirmed that Ducati will produce an electric motorcycle, though we’ve seen no evidence of progress on an electric motorcycle from the brand.Ducati isn’t the only motorcycle company hoping to leverage its motorcycle dealerships to sell electric bicycles. Serial 1 Cycle Company was recently founded as an offshoot of Harley-Davidson’s electric bicycle program. The bar-and-shield motorcycle company developed the e-bikes in-house and then decided to create a separate company focusing purely on the e-bikes. While Serial 1 also sells direct-to-consumers via their website, they are leveraging the Harley-Davidson dealer network to sell bikes directly in participating dealerships.Check out our test ride video on the Serial 1 e-bikes below.",ebikes
2020/12/09,"I’ve had the Juiced HyperScrambler 2 for over a month now, and every time I ride, I find out something interesting about the ebike/emoto hybrid. On most of those days someone asks me, “What the heck is that awesome thing you’re riding?!” and “Where I can get one?” The second part is easy — JuicedBikes.com. The first part? Let’s take a look.Like my other two Juiced bikes, the HyperScrambler 2 comes 90% assembled in a normal, albeit heavy, doubled-up bike box. You just need to attach the front wheel, handlebars, pedals, and a few other small things like mirrors and stickers. If you allow for 30 minutes to an hour, you can probably take your time with the assembly, and Juiced conveniently includes all the tools you’ll need. You might want to enlist someone who can deadlift 120 pounds or prepare to cut that double box down the sides. It never hurts to go over the bike, making sure all screws are tightened and everything is solid. All three bikes I’ve got from Juiced have all come without any loose screws or defects, but you’ll be riding this thing at over 30 mph, so safety is important. The HyperScrambler 2 is based on Juiced’s older model, the 750W geared Hub (1,300W Peak) Juiced Camp/City Scrambler ($1,599) which has been around for two years and was Juiced’s answer to the Super73/Mini bike craze. Juiced notably put more power and range in the original Scrambler than most Minibikes. With the standard 52V/13Ah battery, it was able to go an optimistic 45 miles on a charge (plus some pedaling). Where the Scrambler line really stands out from the pack is that it sits way higher than most 20-inch wheeled mini bikes, allowing even relatively tall people to get more leg extension, and together with its tapered long banana seat allows for a much better experience when pedaling. As someone who has ridden a bunch of mini bikes and loves to actually pedal, this is a big deal. Also, that long banana seat makes towing a second rider easy.There was a brief HyperScrambler (and why this bike is called the “2”?) that suffered from some controller issues and wasn’t widely distributed.The HyperScrambler 2 is quite similar in components to the HyperScorpion, which Micah Toll reviewed last month. I can say, because I’ve been riding one alongside the Scrambler, that they have very similar riding characteristics. Here are the HyperScrambler 2 specs, which mostly match up with the HyperScorpion’s:Besides the upgraded drivetrain and specifically the powerful 1.7+kW peak motor and 13 to 19.2Ah battery, you’ll note the rear suspension was added to the HyperScrambler 2. That, along with the front suspension, allows for much better bumpy-road stability at higher speeds. It also gets that halo front light that gives it that retro bike look and really lights up the road ahead. In fact, that light along with the great brakes saved my backside during a recent night ride where, at over 30 mph, a deer jumped out in front of me.Was test riding the amazing Juiced HyperScorpion (https://t.co/03sqqnZKbS) for @ElectrekCo  last night when this deer had me lay 3 skidmarks. pic.twitter.com/mgiaFyUUw7A cheaper bike with mediocre brakes and lighting would have had me over the handle bars (note this was on the similar specced HyperScorpion). Worth the money right there.Both Juiced Hyper bikes toe the line between ebike and emoto, and the biggest difference is that the HyperScrambler has the ability to carry 2(!!) 1 kWh batteries, double the capacity of the HyperScorpion. That means if the HyperScorpion can go 50 miles, the HyperScrambler 2 can go 100. Sadly, however, this doesn’t result in much more power output, it’s just for the long haulers who need the ability to go 100 miles on a charge.Although I still maxed out at around 1.7+kW on the HyperScrambler 2, just like the HyperScorpion, I was able to keep that high-end output power for much longer. Juiced has a load balancer that automatically draws power evenly from the two batteries. Since the two batteries aren’t allowing any more power to be added to the motor, you can simply turn one off if you only want to drain one at a time. That way you only have to charge one at a time. You’ll also notice that the HyperScrambler doesn’t have a rear rack or wheel fenders like the Scorpions. If you need the storage or to ride in the rain, Juiced designed a custom rear rack and fenders for the HyperScrambler 2, and it’s offered as a separate accessory. I didn’t find either necessary, and even on wet pavement, didn’t get much splash from the smooth street tires.You can absolutely go 100 miles with the two-battery HyperScrambler 2. But that will require a healthy amount of pedaling, avoiding huge hills and keeping the speed at or under 20 mph, which would make it a 5+ hour ride. I don’t think that’s what the second battery is for in this case.If you’re gunning it all the time (and real talk: You will be, it is so friggin’ fun) through hills at over 30 mph and use the pedals as pegs, you are going to get about 20-25 miles per battery. That’s still outstanding, especially for a bike this heavy. But I think owning the second battery is to get closer to 50 miles of range when gunning it all the time. At least that’s my experience in a month plus. Alternatively, if you live in an apartment and don’t want to have to charge your batteries every day, you can probably get by with charging these batteries around once a week with a 10-20 mile commute. One can live on the charger while the other is on the bike. The $2,499 HyperScrambler 2 comes with a 52V 19.2Ah or 1kWh battery and can be updated to two for another $500. This is a huge ebike battery and comes in at around 12 lbs each, bringing the total weight of the bike to over 120 lbs. For this reason, I often only ride with one battery while the other is charging unless I’ve got a really long trip ahead of me. The batteries are keyed and relatively easy to remove (with two hands) and can be charged on the bike or off via the 2A charger(s) included via XLR port. You can upgrade to an 8A charger (or buy fast 4A XLR charger online for $50), which will fully charge the battery from empty in about two hours. Otherwise, you’ll want to go overnight (7+ hrs) from empty to full. Putting about 10 miles of range on the batteries takes about an hour.For my purposes, I could get by with one battery, and I think a lot of you reading this are in the same boat, but I have to say the “range anxiety” element disappears right out the window, never to return with two batteries. I have about a 7-mile, extremely hilly commute to my work spot (which I have been mostly avoiding since COVID). On flat surfaces and downhills I can usually hit about 33 mph or more. The steep uphills I drop down to around 20 mph with a little pedaling included.The extra weight of the second battery plays in here and I think slows me down more than the HyperScorpion’s single battery. The Tektro 2-piston hydraulic disc brakes and 180 mm rotors slow this heavy bike down quickly and efficiently. I have full confidence that these will slow the bike down even at 30+ mph speeds, but Juiced could have inspired a little more confidence with a bigger set of brakes. I’ve heard some internet complaints about the 20” x 4-1/4” Innova puncture-resistant street tires, and I really don’t understand it at all. I’ve never slipped once unless I wanted to (see end of video above). The street grip is solid and I don’t skid out, even when putting all 1.7+kW of that Bafang motor into the pavement. The tires are set on standard-size mag wheels, so a lot of other options exist out there. I don’t often take the HyperScrambler 2 off road or out on rainy or icy days, either. If I do, I might hook up with these $33 winter upgrades. As a 47-year-old 6 footer, I have no problem throwing my leg over the banana seat. Even my 12-year-old son who is about 5’1″ and my few inches taller wife don’t have an issue getting on or pedaling. People with longer legs can simply slide back in the seat.The problem comes in when there is a backseat rider. At that point, I’m moved toward the front, and my legs can’t extend far enough to pedal comfortably. This is when the throttle is your friend.The throttle is a twist grip, and it lays all of that power down at once, rocketing the ebike forward fairly quickly. I recommend trying ECO mode first, which keeps it below 750W and 20 mph, also classifying it as a Class 2 ebike. You can work your way up to “R” mode from there, which if we’re being honest with ourselves, is where it will mostly stay.That’s hard for me to say. You certainly can pedal it like a bike without any power at all. You can ride around in a mode that should allow you to ride on class 2 ebike paths as well. And it is certainly useful and fun in those modes.But this thing was built to blur the lines between a motorcycle and a bike. Country roads demand a little more speed, and I actually feel a whole lot safter traveling over 30 mph than I would at 20 mph. The size of this thing with its big wheels and rearview mirrors demands that cars treat you like an equal. You don’t want to ride this like a bike, you want to ride it like a motorcycle. The “vestigial” pedals are more like oddly spaced pegs. I mentioned the rack and the wheel fenders earlier, and those are going to be great for storage and wet weather. One thing that definitely added to the package is the $40 Motowolf phone holder. Normally meant for motorcycles, and heavy duty metal, this can either go on the handle bars or the frame, it comes with a 5V, 1A bypass line that you can put on the USB charger. It’s big enough for even Apple’s biggest, the iPhone 12 Pro Max.As you can see in the video, this ebike is just amazing. It’s great on the open road, it’s a great commuter, and most of all it’s just great fun riding around. I thoroughly and truly enjoy this bike to the point where if we’re going to our friends’ house (socially distanced, of course), I let my family take the car and I follow on the HyperScrambler 2. It makes every journey exciting, memorable, and a ton of fun.Sure, there are some nitpicks. The ignition is in a weird place (which can have benefits — security by obscurity!). The huge batteries are very heavy and therefore so is the bike. But that’s the tradeoff! Probably my biggest issue with these moto-ebikes is a strange one. It’s that I don’t get a great workout on them. With my 250W “European ebike,” most of the work is coming from my legs, and theoretically that keeps me healthy. The HyperScrambler 2 isn’t giving me a workout. I do pedal often and it’s easier with this bike than any other mini ebike. But am I really getting a workout here? Probably not.But that said, this bike and the Juiced lineup of Minibikes is really changing the game in a big way. Imagine a world where people rode these things around cities instead of cars. Where everyone is breathing clean air, appreciating open spaces, and having fun instead of being closed up inside a glass and steel cage. Sign me up for a Juiced utopia!  Grab yours — it makes an amazing holiday gift, and it ships in January for $2,499.",ebikes
2020/12/08,"Fat tire electric bikes open the door to all sorts of adventurous off-road riding. And one of the most fun ways to put them to the test this winter is by plowing over and through a white, snowy landscape.But riding in snow is unlike just about any other type of riding you can do on an e-bike.To help explain the important things to know about riding electric bicycles in the snow, I turned to Canadian resident snow-riding expert and friend Roshan Thomas. Roshan is also the founder of Biktrix, a popular electric bicycle manufacturer with a wide range of powerful snow-ready electric bicycles, as well as models for other types of riding.So he knows a thing or too about getting down and dirty in heaps of snow.When it comes to riding an electric bicycle in the snow, the type of bike can make a lot of difference.Both hub motors (an electric motor in the center of the bike wheel) and mid-drive motors (an electric motor at the pedals) can be used for winter and snow riding. However, mid-drive motors provide more torque than hub motors. You can drop into low gear for extra torque from a mid-drive, but a hub motor can often get bogged down in thick, wet snow.For that reason Roshan usually recommends a mid-drive e-bike for snow riding, at least when the snow gets deep. He also tells people to avoid e-bikes with just a front hub motor. They can lose traction much more easily than rear hub motors.Some mid-drive motors provide modest power, while others including the Bafang Ultra motor can put out over 1,000W of power and really conquer thick snow.Next, fat tires are of course better than typical mountain bike tires, since they tend to ride on top of the snow rather than knifing into the snow. But there’s more nuance to it than that. As Roshan explains, tire pressure has a big impact on how the fat tires handle:A common 26″x4″, or 26″x4.8″ or 27.5″x4″ fat tire works amazing in the snow because you can run these at very low pressures. I find that 5-20 PSI makes the rubber just float on the snow. For riding conditions where there is underlying ice, it’s best to get these tires studded.Many winter tires come with optional studs that can be installed when conditions get icy.While dual motor hub-driven e-bikes might seem like good snow candidates, they can sometimes require more skill to ride in loose conditions. The AWD nature can cause both wheels to break free, and the lack of traction control can require expert handling skills to keep the bike upright while both wheels are slipping.Roshan also recommends a number of accessories that can help make snow e-biking more enjoyable. Pogies or bar mitts help riders keep their hands warm even while wearing thinner gloves, meaning riders have better dexterity to control buttons, shifters and brakes. Heated jackets and gloves can make a big difference in temperatures below -20ºC (-4ºF). And a dropper seat post can help make quick seat adjustments while riding when the terrain suddenly changes. As Roshan explains, “a dropper seat would work especially well in the winter as you can adjust rider seat height on the fly. Even a basic one like a Kindshock dropper seat post would be better than not having one.”There are specific braking safety concerns to watch out for in the winter, and especially in the snow.Stopping distances are longer in the winter, and riders should always take that into account. Mechanical brakes are even more susceptible to winter effects. Water and snowmelt can enter brake housings and freeze, further reducing the braking power.Roshan recommends squirting a few drops of deicer into the housings of mechanical brakes every few weeks, or opting for an e-bike with hydraulic brakes.In addition to typical e-bike maintenance, there are a few extra things to look out for in the winter. After riding, Roshan recommends drying off the bike as much as possible. Using compressed air to blow off the bike is even better, if possible. You just don’t want water — especially salty water from road salt — to sit on the bike and cause corrosion. Wet lubing the chain is also even more important in the winter for the same reason.You might be surprised just how much snow a bike can pick up and carry.The battery should also be removed from the bike and stored indoors. Batteries should not be charged in below-freezing temperatures, and it is best to start a cold ride with a room-temperature battery that has been sitting indoors. As Roshan puts it:Batteries like temperatures that humans like. This means that when it gets too cold or too hot, the internal resistance goes up and the range diminishes. Plan your ride accordingly.Lastly, Roshan left me with a few tips for beginners that are planning to do their first winter and snow riding on an e-bike.He recommends starting slow, taking it one step at a time. Start with short rides and commutes before trying longer marathons. Stick to slower speeds as you get acclimated to the new style of riding. And consider starting out with snow riding by turning off pedal assist. Biktrix bikes have a “Level 0” for pedal assist, which leaves the throttle active but deactivates pedal assist. That can allow riders to blip the throttle to get moving in snow, then practice riding like normal without unexpected assist. The hand throttle can always be used when extra assist is needed. Then once riders feel comfortable handling the e-bike in the snow, they can increase the pedal assist slowly by bumping up the levels.Ultimately, the name of the game is to get out there and have fun this winter. Having fun is what e-bikes are all about, particularly fat tire e-bikes. Ride safe out there and stay warm!",ebikes
2020/12/05,"The new Addmotor M-340 electric trike puts a new spin on the dated electric tricycle design.Addmotor, a direct-to-consumer e-bike company with a wide range of models from electric mopeds to full-size fat tire e-bikes, is back again with an interesting new electric tricycle design.The new Addmotor M-340 uses a standard delta trike configuration with two rear wheels, but swaps those wheels for big ol’ 4-inch fat tires.Up front there’s a larger diameter wheel housing a 750W continuous and 1,000W peak-rated geared hub motor mounted in a spring suspension fork. In the rear are two smaller diameter 20-inch fat tires on either side of a large 48L cargo basket.The saddle is a generously-sized padded seat with included back rest similar to saddles we’ve seen on other comfort-oriented e-bikes in the past.A 48V and 16Ah battery with 768Wh of capacity can be found behind the seat tube.It looks like the bike can be powered by a hand throttle or pedal assist, and there’s a Shimano 7-speed transmission tucked in there for anyone who wants to make ample use of the pedal assist.In terms of performance, Addmotor claims the M-340 can hit a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) and has a maximum range of 50 miles (80 km) when used in the lowest pedal assist mode.If I had to guess, I’d wager you can cut that range by a factor of three if you’re cruising at top speed with throttle-only riding. While trikes can be fun, that extra wheel doesn’t do the battery any favors (and nor do those big ol’ fat tires).If you plan on sticking to throttle-only operation, Adddmotor gives you a cool little wooden platform to rest your feet, or you could use it as extra storage for carrying cargo. Though with the large rear cargo basket and another smaller front basket, the M-340 already appears to offer plenty of storage space.The e-trike sports a maximum payload of 350 lb (158 kg) and can fit riders from 5’2″ to 6’4″ (157 to 193 cm), so it should support a fairly large range of riders.The trike looks fun and decently powered, but the devil is in the details, and the biggest detail we still don’t have is the price.Addmotor will be opening pre-orders for the e-trike in the coming weeks, so we should know then. While it looks like it’d be a trip to toot around on, I can’t really say whether or not the M-340 will be worth it until I know the price.They’ll have to compete against other offerings in the field, such as Pedego’s $3,000 and 250W electric tricycles, though I think it’s fair to say that Addmotor has a serious spec advantage there.In terms of quality, Addmotor is one of those middle-of-the-road companies. No one has ever said Addmotor makes the best bikes. But they also aren’t a cheap e-bike company either. They’ve been around for nearly a decade and so they’re definitely not a startup or a fly-by-night company.We’ve got an M-340 with our name on it though, so we’ll be back to let you know how it rides as soon we can get one in the Electrek garage and put some miles on it.Until then, you can bide your time by checking out our last cargo trike review.",ebikes
2020/12/04,"The Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 electric bicycle from E-Cells is an absolute masterclass in excess.

Then read on for the skinny on this extra fat e-bike.A lot of people’s first question when they see the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 is “What is it?”The next most popular question is probably “Why is it?”This is obviously not your average e-bike. This is what would happen if a dirt bike or motorcycle ate your average e-bike.The ridiculous 2,200 watts of power between two motors are there to give the Crown its incredible pulling power. Not only can it haul huge loads (up to 400 lb or 181 kg, not including the bike!), but it can also climb just about any hill you throw at it.The dual motors might sound ridiculous, but that power is what helps the bike overcome absolutely everything.Next, the dual batteries. A total of 1,638 Wh might seem like overkill, but those massive motors and 45A controller certainly appreciate the extra capacity. Range is a tricky thing to calculate on a bike like this. Baby it on pedal assist and you might get 60 miles (100 km). Ride up sandy hills all afternoon and you could get a third of that. But any way you slice it, those two big batteries are there to feed the hungry motors and make sure your rides don’t come to an untimely end too soon.And what about that dual suspension?On an e-bike this big (95 lb!), that’s a lot of mass to have flying around at 30+ mph. When you hit bumps, the suspension keeps the bike and anything attached to it (i.e. you) from rocketing up into space.While I have done trail riding on the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500, and while the RockShox and RST suspension is certainly more than enough for the trails, I find it is great for urban riding because you can hop curbs and tackle potholes with nearly reckless abandon. So now that we’ve covered the “what?” and the “why?”, let’s get down to brass tacks. This e-bike is all about conquering. Its utility lies in its excess.I can hit a top speed of around 32 mph (51 km/h), which means that in most places in the city I ride like a vehicle on the road, the way nature intended. No longer am I a measly second-class cyclists citizen getting passed dangerously close by careless motorists. Instead, I’m owning my lane and traveling at the speed of traffic. (I should also note that the bike can be limited to 20 or 28 mph to conform to local e-bike laws.)When that traffic grinds to a halt, suddenly I can become a cyclist again, slowing down to reasonable speeds for the bike lane and slipping past cars. The built-in lights, as well as mirrors, add to your road-presence, and I always seem to feel a bit safer on these big e-bikes with more motorcycle-style presence.The 2,200 watts of power is a kick in the pants if you’re not careful. The bike is prepared to drop the hammer all at once too – it’s not one of those easy-on types of e-bikes that tries to regulate power gently for you.That’s a blessing when you just want to simply up-and-go, but new riders will want to be careful with the throttle to not overdo it on their first few rides. Fortunately, you can limit both power and speed, which may be useful for riders still getting acclimated to this level of power.You can also select either front or rear-wheel drive, in addition to the all-wheel-drive standard. That’s another quick way to lower power a bit in a pinch.These speeds and power levels are no joke, and I wouldn’t do this type of riding on just any bike.The Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 has a very nice component sheet with a number of high-spec parts designed to operate at these levels.You can’t go fast without strong brakes, at least not safely. And the pair of four-piston Tektro Dorado hydraulic disc brakes give you the stopping confidence necessary for this fast, heavy e-bike. E-cells didn’t skimp on the rotors either. Not only are they massive 203 mm diameter rotors, but they’re also 2.3 mm thick, making them fatter than normal and able to absorb more heat without warping. Other nice parts include a Shimano Deore 10-speed transmission, high-quality suspension, Vee Bulldozer tires instead of typical cheaper Kenda’s, KMC 10XE chain with stretch-proof treatment, and an adjustable stem. Between that adjustable stem and three different frame sizes, most riders should be able to find the perfect fit.While we’re talking about components, I will take a moment and scold E-cells for not going with a torque sensor over a cadence-based pedal assist sensor. At this price, I would have expected a torque sensor to be standard equipment to give smoother pedal assist. Though at least with 9 levels of pedal assist compared to the typical 3 to 5 levels, you can more finely tune your desired assist.So here’s the rub, it’s not cheap. At all. We’re talking $4,195 – though that’s the sale price (marked down from $5,195).So this is not an e-bike for the casual rider or the budget shopper.But that doesn’t mean you aren’t getting real value here. We’re talking twice the power, twice the motor, twice the battery capacity, and twice the suspension of most e-bikes you’ll find for half the price.If you just want to toot around the park, you don’t need this e-bike. But if you want to absolutely climb anything, jump anything, ride for days, and haul a deer out of the woods all on the same bike, this would do it for you. Speaking of deer, they even offer it in a camo model for hunters and outdoor enthusiasts, though the standard black, red, and blue models might find more favor with average riders.So there we have it: one ridiculous e-bike that gave me more than I asked for and didn’t once protest.I like to say I put a bike through its paces, but the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 is so overbuilt that I probably didn’t even get close to pushing it to its limits.The bike is fast, powerful, well-made, and comfortable for both urban and off-road riding.It can conquer the suburbs and the backcountry in the same day and on the same charge of its dual batteries.It’s more than anyone needs which means it’s the absolute perfect amount for the kind of rider that appreciates the larger things in life.I wouldn’t want to lift this bike into a truck by myself, but I’ll ride the hell out of it any day!",ebikes
2020/12/02,"Toronto-based Daymak is already known for a wide range of light electric vehicles ranging from e-bikes and mobility scooters to light electric motorcycles. But now the company is unveiling a much higher-end product range known as the Avvenire line that will be manufactured locally in Canada.From the new Avvenire line up shot below, you can immediately tell that these are a totally different tier than the standard light electric vehicles we’re used to seeing from Daymak.The blacked-out, sleek looking model line features six new vehicles ranging from electric bikes and covered mobility scooters to a personal flying vehicle.As Daymak founder Aldo Baiocchi explained:At Daymak our goal is to make outstanding clean vehicles that make a positive impact on the environment for today and future generations. We build our vehicles to give freedom of movement that are also a joy to ride.We are excited that we will manufacture our product line here in Canada and create up to 500 new jobs in the Cleantech industry with the launch of Daymak Avvenire. This will redefine what it means to travel using light electric vehicles. The technology we are designing will incorporate solar power to our fully enclosed vehicle line for an efficient, comfortable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional carbon emitting vehicles right at our doorstep.While we don’t yet have detailed tech specs, we can at least take a closer look at what each model has in store for us.The Daymak Terra is an all-terrain electric bicycle with some unique new features we’ve rarely seen before. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the bike is the inclusion of solar panels designed to trickle charge the battery. The bike is rated for a range of 100 km (60 miles).The Daymak Foras is an enclosed recumbent electric bike. The rider lays on his or her back under the canopy and pedals like a traditional bicycle, yet from a reclined position.The single-passenger light electric vehicle has a range of 200 km (120 miles) and features tech normally reserved for larger vehicles, such as a GPS-based anti-theft alarm and a back up camera. The Daymak Tectus is an all-wheel-drive (read: three-wheel-drive since it is a tricycle) mobility e-scooter designed to tackle various surfaces and in all weather conditions. It’s quite a departure from even the most classy mobility scooters we’ve seen from Daymak in the past. Like the Terra e-bike, the Tectus includes built-in solar panels to trickle charge the batteries. It also adds rear storage, a back up camera and sports a range of up to 160 km (100 miles). Daymak even claims that it will include optional autonomous driving features. That sounds great, but a self-driving mobility scooter? I’ll believe it when I see it.The Daymak Aspero is a high-end electric ATV – a market that hasn’t seen an overabundance of entries so far.Daymak claims the Aspero is “adaptable to multiple terrain types and riding conditions, and perfect for camping, hunting, and wilderness exploring.”Like several of the other light electric vehicles in the Avvenire line, the Aspero includes solar trickle charging from built-in solar panels. It also sports rear storage, plow/trailer hitch and a charge time of two hours. With most light electric vehicles charging in between 4-8 hours, that’s a fairly fast charge!The Daymak Spiritus is a two-seater electric car with a tadpole trike format, similar in layout to other three-wheeled EVs such as the Arcimoto FUV and the Electra Meccanica SOLO.Unlike the others though, Daymak claims the Spiritus will be the “fastest three-wheeled car in the world” with a 0-60 time of 1.8 seconds. They conveniently left units off of that figure. I’ll assume it’s 0-60 km/h, since if that was mph it would be Tesla Roadster quick.In another apparent ode to Tesla, Daymak also claims the Spiritus will feature “optional auto-pilot”. Other features include solar trickle-charging, WiFi connection, air conditioning and a full entertainment system.Range is stated as 400 km (250 miles).As if the previous five electric vehicles weren’t interesting enough, Daymak pulled out all the stops with the Skyrider, a personal electric flying device.They don’t tell us much, only that “SKYRIDER is an elegant and high-performance electric vehicle capable of flying. No traffic, no cars, no pollution. The future flies well.”So we’ll have to use our imagination when it comes to specs.All six Avvenire line vehicles are available for pre-order now with a $100 deposit. When will we be flying around in our own Skyriders, though? That remains to be seen.I mean, they’re all pretty cool, and Daymak has a long reputation in the industry dating back to 2002.But it’s easy to make things seem cool when they don’t actually exist.These are all renders. Anyone can slap on solar panels at this point. I can just imagine the design meetings. “Ooh, add auto-pilot! And an entertainment system! Hey, can one of them fly too?!”So yeah, this sounds awesome. I’m all for Canadian manufacturing of some awesome electric vehicles.But let’s also be realistic here. Show me some prototypes at least before you start asking for my deposit. Otherwise we’re putting the flying cart before the horse.",ebikes
2020/12/01,"As if mountain bikes weren’t already versatile enough, a new DIY conversion kit known as the Envo can turn a mountain bike into an electric snowmobile.It’s not like electric snow bikes aren’t already a thing — there are plenty of powerful and well-equipped electric snow bikes out there.But there’s nothing quite like the track of a snowmobile to really tear it up in the snow.Now the Envo kit is bringing that technology to a conventional mountain bike with the Canadian company’s latest conversion kit.The kit consists of a rear snowmobile drive assembly that uses a kevlar/rubber track passing over a 1.2 kW hub motor and tough resin rollers. The assembly replaces the mountain bike’s rear wheel and bolts directly into the bike’s dropouts.The bike’s existing chain still runs to a sprocket in the rear assembly to power the track. However, a crank sensor detects the rider’s pedaling and also applies power from a 48 V and 17.5 Ah battery to help assist the rider power through the snow. The battery is apparently enough for 10 km (6 mi) of riding, which sounds about right, considering how inefficient snow travel can be. The removable battery can likely be swapped with a fresh pack though to extend the rider’s range.The kit also includes a handlebar-mounted thumb throttle that activates the motor without the rider needing to pedal.When riding on hard packed snow, the front mountain bike wheel can be left on the bike. When riding on looser powder that a bicycle tire would have trouble overcoming, the kit includes a snowboard adapter that can replace the front wheel.The hybrid beast then becomes part snowboard, part electric bicycle, part snowmobile.Reaching a top speed of 18 km/h (11 mph), the Envo kit isn’t likely to win any races against real electric snowmobiles such as Taiga’s latest models.The Envo kit will surely be a lot cheaper than a full electric snowmobile though, priced at between CAD$2,789 (approximately US$2,145) to CAD$3,684 (approximately US$2,833). Check it out in the video below. I have to admit that it looks pretty fun in action!via: Newatlas",ebikes
2020/11/28,"Ariel Rider has a wide range of electric bikes from simple folding e-bikes to cargo e-bikes and commuter e-bikes. But some of their most popular models have been their moped-style e-bikes, and now the company has added the new Ariel Rider Grizzly electric moped to its lineup.The Grizzly was just launched as something of an adventure-style electric moped.In many ways it is an improvement over the company’s legendary dual motor Ariel Rider D-Class. I reviewed that epic 33 mph e-moped earlier this year and came away majorly impressed.In the review, I mentioned there was still some room for improvement, such as adding rear suspension, beefing up the front suspension fork, and perhaps offering more battery capacity to feed those two power hungry motors.To my surprise, the company called me up a few months later and said, “Done.”The result was the Ariel Rider Grizzly, which took all of my suggestions and then added a few more I hadn’t even considered.The powerful Grizzly sits on a pair of 20″ fat tires wrapped around 750W continuous motors that each put out 1,500W of peak power. That means you’re looking at a 3 kW peak-rated electric moped here, folks.Those motors are also custom spec’d with Ariel Riders’ own patented metal reinforced gears instead of the typical nylon gears found in most standard geared-motor e-bikes.The metal reinforcement makes the motors a bit louder than others, but also helps them handle the extreme power that Ariel Rider regularly dumps into them.Ariel Rider doesn’t even list the speed of the Grizzly, which might make it one those “If you have to ask…” situations. The Ariel Rider D-Class rocketed me up to 33 mph (53 km/h) though and all indications are that the Grizzly should match if not surpass the D-Class’s performance. Most of Ariel Rider’s e-bikes ship with a 20 mph (32 km/h) factory installed speed limiter, and it is the responsibility of the rider to decide when and where to remove the speed limit.A handlebar-mounted switch lets riders control traction with either front wheel drive, rear wheel drive or AWD.The front fork is an upgraded version of the one on the D-Class and the rear now gets dual coilover shocks.The battery voltage has been bumped from 48V to 52V (which gives around a 7% power/speed boost) and a second battery was added to the frame. Between the 52V 17.5 Ah battery under the seat and the 52V 14Ah battery on the downtube, the bike packs in over 1,600 watt-hours of capacity. That’s enough capacity for up to 60 miles (100 km) of range, according to the company.The saddle received an upgrade to make it more comfortable, and is available in either a short or long version, depending on if you want to bring a friend. If so, there are upgraded fold-up foot pegs to give your pillion a comfortable place to rest his or her feet.The added rear suspension will surely be appreciated by a second rider.Hydraulic disc brakes and knobby fat tires should give plenty of safe grip for hitting trails, which is where the full-suspension design will really come in handy.And the Grizzly even includes a full fender set so you won’t rooster tail mud onto yourself or onto all the chicks you pick up on the trail.The Ariel Rider Grizzly is currently on pre-order with shipping expected in the beginning of February. The $3,299 e-bike is currently marked down to $2,799 as part of a combined early promo and Black Friday sale. In fact, Ariel Rider has a number of Black Friday deals on its other bikes you’ll likely want to check out.We’ve got a Grizzly with our name on it coming for review soon, so be sure to check back to see what we think of this high-powered electric moped once we can test it ourselves. Time will tell if other epic full suspension, dual battery electric mopeds, and minibikes like the Juiced HyperScrambler 2 should be worried or not.And until then, check out my video review of the Ariel Rider D-Class, below. It is nearly as insanely powerful and definitely worth a look.",ebikes
2020/11/26,"Bicycles, and especially e-bikes, are often the quickest way to cut through urban traffic. And so it makes perfect sense to see them being transformed into ambulance e-bikes for first responders.That’s exactly what a team at the tech firm Wunderman Thompson Paris set out to do when they designed their own electric bicycle ambulance.They partnered with the French e-mobility company Ecox Enterprises and with electric bicycle manufacturer Urban Arrow, using advice from the Paris Emergency Services (UMP).An Urban Arrow front-loader electric cargo bike was used as the foundation for the ambulance.Powered by Bosch mid-drive motor, the electric bicycle ambulance uses a pair of 500 Wh batteries to ensure it won’t run out of juice while en route to an emergency. Together, the dual batteries provide up to 160 km (100 miles) of range from the pedal-assisted e-bike system.The narrow bike uses only two wheels instead of a common three-wheeled cargo bike setup we’ve seen much of lately, helping it maintain a nimble ride and the ability to weave between cars. But to fit everything that a first responder paramedic might need in order to deliver critical first-aid at the scene of an emergency, an insulated 150 liter (5.3 cubic feet) cargo box was added to the bike.Other ambulance-specific additions include a 140-decibel horn, blue medical symbols within the wheels, and a blue flashing light to alert motorists to the novel e-bike’s emergency vehicle status.Wunderman Thompson says the emergency e-bikes are currently available for use by emergency services. A local Paris doctor even purchased the first production unit and uses it personally to respond to emergencies, according to Newatlas.While these e-bike ambulances aren’t able to transport injured patients for secondary treatment, they can help paramedics reach accident scenes more quickly to administer critical life-saving aid on-site. That gives them time to stabilize patients while a conventional ambulance is still arriving and have the patient prepped for transport right away.See the ambulance e-bike in more detail in the video below.This is a great idea and further demonstrates the many uses of cargo electric bicycles.Where I live in Tel Aviv, paramedics from Magen David Adom (the local Red Cross division) regularly arrive on scene first with gas scooters, using supplies from a large rear box.Even as an electric bike/motorcycle evangelical, when seconds and minutes count towards saving lives, I’m not too worried about the gasoline being burnt by these ambulance scooters. But if the gas scooters can be complimented by electric bicycles that are even more nimble and able to more easily cut through traffic, then all the better.I’ve even recently seen electric micro-cars used by paramedics here, which give some of the same benefits, though still seem to get stuck in our notoriously rough traffic sometimes. These smaller EV ambulances have their own unique advantages, including the ability to carry a second paramedic as well as larger medical equipment, but ambulance e-bikes can still usually arrive on scene faster to begin initial first-aid.Ambulance e-bikes that can deliver critical first-aid seem like exactly what paramedics need in such densely populated urban areas.",ebikes
2020/11/25,"I used to bemoan the high cost of electric bicycles, but lately we’ve been seeing prices drop while component quality rises. And the Aventon Level electric commuter bike is a great example of fair pricing matched with quality components. And the performance is great to boot!We’ve reviewed Aventon e-bikes before, and they’ve already scored very highly. The company simply knows how to build a quality e-bike that looks as good as it rides.The Aventon Level is no different.You can tell that the company takes pride in the Level’s construction, and was sure to outfit it with good components that matched its excellent build quality.In fact, you’ll definitely want to watch as I put the Aventon Level through its paces. Check out my full video review below, then read on for my detailed written review.So here’s the skinny: The Aventon Level isn’t just a commuter e-bike. It’s a commuter e-bike with really nice performance. It didn’t wind up in our Top Five Commuter E-bikes of 2020 list by chance!It’s a level 3 e-bike in the US, meaning you can get up to 28 mph (45 km/h) if you add some pedal assist, or 20 mph (32 km/h) if you’re feeling tired and just want to use the throttle.With a large 674 Wh battery, you’ve got a minimum of 30 miles (48 km) of range. And Aventon is a straight-up company that gives you honest range ratings for all of its different operating modes, including throttle-only and on each pedal assist level. Check out their chart below.At a price of $1,599, you actually get some nice components here as well. There are dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, a decent spring-suspension fork, thru-axle front wheel (instead of a cheap skewer), an 8-speed Shimano transmission and a beautifully frame-integrated battery.Now are these components top shelf? No, of course not. But I never expected them to be top shelf at this price. For the price though, they’re better than I would expect. Just compare to other $1,500-ish commuter e-bikes that are still rocking cable brakes, cheap wheel skewers, and bolted-on external batteries. The Aventon Level’s Bengal Ares 3 hydraulic disc brakes are powerful, the levers are comfortable in your fingers and the stopping power is exactly what you need for a 28 mph (45 km/h) e-bike. Plus they are essentially zero-maintenance, which is always a big plus in my book.The bike even gives you included fenders and rear rack as standard equipment — no surcharge! I love not getting nickeled and dimed for accessories. That rack is no slouch either. It says it is rated for 55 lb (25 kg), but that’s the rating after the lawyers got done with it, so you know the real breaking limit is of course higher. It even held my weight standing on it. (Obviously I do NOT recommend doing the standing test on a typical cheap rack, or probably any rack. I’m what they call “a professional.”)Another note about quality: Check out the welds on the frame. I always have to hand it to Aventon, whenever I review one of their e-bikes I know I’ll be looking at some of the best frame welding I’ve ever seen. Those welds are so nicely dressed that the frame almost looks like a single molded carbon piece, not a collection of welded-together double-butted aluminum tubes. Props to whoever welded this frame because it is a work of art.Perhaps the only other e-bike I’ve seen with as nice welds everywhere on the bike is the Serial 1 RUSH. But not only does that bike come from 100 years of motorcycle lineage (and thus better have some pretty good welds!), but it also costs 3x the price of the Aventon Level. So suffice it to say that Aventon is batting well above average here.The Aventon Level is comfortable to pedal and smooth to ride — it’s as simple as that. The frame comes in three sizes to give a more custom fit to a wider range of riders, unlike the many one-size-fits-all electric bikes out there.The riding position isn’t upright like a cruiser but it’s also not hunched over like a road bike. The Level finds a happy middle ground that balances comfort and performance.The centrally mounted LED screen is giant and easy to read with a quick glance. You won’t need to spend long time looking down for your battery info or speed; it is practically already visible at the bottom of your field of vision.The 27.5″ x 2.2″ tires are also a happy balance that offers enough rubber to hit a few obstacles, yet are narrow enough to stay light and efficient. The pedal assist uses a cadence sensor and so it is fine, but not great. There’s the telltale lag that nearly all cadence sensors provide. While I would have loved to see a torque sensor added to the pedal assist to give the most accurate pedal assist response, the cadence sensor is still pretty good for pedal assist activation.A torque sensor is the single largest improvement I could have asked for on the bike, but I know that’s not in the cards at this price, especially with all the other components on the bike.The only other area I might have wanted to see a bit more investment in is the lighting (or lack thereof). There’s none to speak of. You’ll have to add your own lights. Which is a bummer, because I love when commuter e-bikes use lights that run off the main battery. It’s one more thing I don’t have to worry about.But those are really my only two complaints here. The torque sensor is forgiveable and that’s just me being spoiled, but the lack of lights seems like an oversight.Despite the lack of lighting, the Aventon Level is a huge win for an electric commuter bike. It features incredible build quality, comes standard with rack and fenders, has a powerful motor paired with a large capacity battery, and even gives you hydraulic disc brakes at a price point that normally sees mechanical disc brakes.The bike also looks very elegant with that integrated battery. No bolt-on batteries here!The value proposition we’re looking at is incredibly high. Other electric commuter bikes in its price range simply don’t offer the advantages of speed, build quality, and components that the Level does.It may not get a perfect score from me, but darn if the Aventon Level doesn’t get really close!",ebikes
2020/11/23,"Ducati is following right behind fellow motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson in rolling out new electric bicycles for the 2021 season.While last week’s announcement from Harley-Davidson saw new urban-oriented e-bikes from the legacy motorcycle manufacturer, Ducati’s e-bikes are designed for the dirt.The latest electric mountain bike to earn the Ducati badge is the new TK-01RR electric enduro bike.The TK-01RR features the recently released Shimano EP-08 mid-drive motor, which weighs a mere 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) yet outputs an impressive 85 Nm of torque.It also offers up to 400% assist in its highest pedal assist mode — the equivalent of having three friends helping you pedal up a steep mountain trail.The TK-01RR frame uses a more vertically oriented downtube that also supports an underslung 630 Wh Shimano battery. Just like the Harley-Davidson powered e-bikes from Serial 1, Ducati has seen the wisdom in positioning the battery below the downtube in order to centralize the mass as much as possible and reduce the center of gravity. It’s not to the same degree that Serial 1 achieved, but Ducati is also limited by not designing their own frames. Instead, they partner with the Italian electric bicycle company Thok.The geometry seen in the TK-01RR is befitting of more extreme electric enduro riding, with a head tube angle of 64.5 degrees and a seat tube angle of 75.5 degrees.The TK-01RR sports Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes and a 12-speed transmission. It also shows off a 180 mm Öhlins RXF 38 fork and 170mm Öhlins TTX rear shock. Rounding out the spec sheet are a pair of the latest Pirelli Scorpion e-MTB S tires. Priced at €6,999, this isn’t an e-bike for the faint of heart or light of wallet.Ducati also updated its current electric mountain bike lineup. The existing MIG-S that we saw last year received the latest Shimano battery and is powered by the Shimano STEPS E8000 mid-drive motor. Ducati also updated the frame by stretching the top tube and increasing the seat post angle to 74.7 degrees.The MIG-S is priced at a slightly more achievable €4,890.Duacti doesn’t only offer dedicated electric mountain bikes, but also recently released a trekking line as well. The Ducati e-Scrambler rocks the Shimano E7000 series mid-drive motor and a smaller 504 Wh battery. While the battery is smaller than the new TK-01RR, the lack of a throttle on these European pedal-assist e-bikes means that the bikes are still likely to achieve long ranges during normal usage.There’s still no word yet on a potential Ducati electric motorcycle, despite Ducati’s CEO teasing a new electric direction for the company early last year.

2020/11/21,"Bunch Bikes just added a new electric cargo bike to its lineup, and this one comes with all of the Dutch stylings you could ask for.The Coupe is the company’s latest e-bike, or technically e-trike, designed to carry the whole family. With kid seats and dog leash tie-downs, Bunch is making sure to include as many two and four-legged family members as well.The tadpole-trike design (featuring two front wheels) uses a front box constructed of expanded polypropylene (EPP) to create a safe and secure seating area for children, complete with a pair of 3-point safety harnesses.Bunch’s Coupe electric cargo bike is powered by a Bafang M400 mid-drive motor with up to 80Nm of torque. The motor is fed by a large 36V 20Ah battery rated for 720Wh of capacity and up to 75 miles (120 km) of range with pedal assist.The Coupe doesn’t just have that Dutch flair to it; each one is actually built in Holland, making them true Dutch e-cargo bikes.Of course that also means they come with a more European-level price at $5,100 (marked down from an MSRP of $5,999).Before you balk though, check out all the fancy features you get, which when combined with that European manufacturing help to bump the price up to five Gs.Stopping power comes from a pair of Tektro Auriga dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes and shifting is provided by a NuVinci Enviolo step-less transmission with automatic shifting. The aluminum frame includes built-in lighting and a drop gate at the front of the cargo box, plus there’s an integrated rear rack (in case that giant box isn’t enough cargo space for you).You also get a Hebie Chainglider to keep the chain completely enclosed and hidden away. Speaking of hidden away, all of the wiring is run internally to the frame and the battery is hidden from view under the cargo box, meaning the Bunch Coupe doesn’t even look electric.The wheels wear Schwalbe Big Apple Plus tires and are actually angled inwards to give more stable turns. They are also covered by fenders and wheel skirts to keep little wandering fingers from getting too close..Bunch expects the Coupe to begin shipping in February of 2021 and is now taking pre-orders, though the promotional price is only available through the end of this month.I do love me a good electric cargo trike, and have been known to rock them before.But the Coupe is definitely a couple steps up in terms of craftsmanship compared to anything like this I’ve ridden before.It isn’t cheap, but you sure do get a lot for your money. Not only does it look like a well-made and attractive design, but features like automatic shifting, integrated lighting and wiring, the mid-drive motor and the large battery are all going to add to the cost – not to mention paying Europeans a real wage to build a quality bike.I personally would have liked to see a 48V system on a bike that is designed to carry such heavy loads, but I’ve used the Bafang M400 motor before on a 36V system and it still has nice pull, even if it is not mind-blowing. All in all, if you’re hoping to replace a second car with a cargo e-bike, the Coupe from Bunch Bikes would be a slick way to do it.",ebikes
2020/11/20,"The RadMission electric bicycle from Rad Power Bikes is one of the company’s most interesting e-bikes to date. While it makes a few modest compromises to hit its impressive $1,099 price point (and is on sale as a bundle for $200 off right now through Black Friday), it scores big wins in most categories, making this an incredibly high bang-for-your-buck e-bike.Click play below to watch my RadMission video review and see the bike in all of its glory. Then keep reading for my full, detailed review!I think the RadMission is one of the coolest e-bikes Rad Power Bikes has made, due in large part to its bang-for-your-buck value.But there’s also a few things to keep in mind here. The bike is great, but some small sacrifices were made to reduce the price from Rad’s standard level of around $1,500 for most of their e-bikes.The main trade-offs are that you lose your gears and your LCD display in favor of a smaller LED display (meaning no odometer or speed readout). You get a bit smaller battery (504 Wh instead of 674 Wh) and a bit smaller motor (500 W instead of 750 W). There are also some slight quality tradeoffs, like plastic pedals instead of metal. And you don’t get some of the accessories included in the price, such as fenders or a kickstand.So yes, there are compromises. But I’m more than willing to look past those initial trade-offs because the bike rides just as well as any Rad Power Bike I’ve ever tested and did I mention the bike only costs $1,099?!The important thing to realize here is that Rad Power Bikes isn’t a “budget e-bike company” like Ancheer or MacWheel or other ultra-cheap brands. Instead, Rad is what I prefer to call a “value e-bike company”. They make good quality e-bikes at reasonable prices to provide high value. They are neither the highest quality nor the lowest quality e-bikes out there. These are the e-bikes that Goldilocks would choose.So to get that level of quality at a price far below Rad’s normal price range is a serious service to the industry. And Rad Power Bikes has knocked it out of the park on this one.The company calls the RadMission a “metro bike”. It’s a city e-bike that is optimized for urban riding. There’s no suspension, which is par for the course for commuter e-bikes. This e-bike isn’t designed to be comfortable off-road; it’s designed to be comfortable on decent roads. I personally found the RadMission to ride great on my roads, but those of you whose streets look like a lunar landing site might want to invest in a seat post shock. I bought this cheap one (you need the 27.2mm size for the RadMission). It hasn’t arrived yet, so I have no idea if its good or not, but I hope it will add a bit more cushion when I do things like ride across grass. I also plan on testing the RadMission as an inexpensive gravel e-bike, so it might be nice there as well.With a single-speed, the RadMission also isn’t designed for the most extreme of hilly terrain, since there isn’t a lower gear to shift into. That being said, the bike is totally fine on moderate hills and can even handle heavy hills as long as you don’t mind pedaling as well to help it. The only time I struggled on a moderate hill was when the battery was nearly empty, and at that point I had been riding for a couple days without charging and the battery just didn’t have enough juice left for full power.The 500 W motor isn’t as strong as the 750 W you get from Rad’s other models, but it’s enough for decent hill climbing with added assist. And even though you can’t downshift, the throttle is basically a helper gear for the short slog from 0 to 10-ish mph. That’s the area where single-speed pedal bikes can be frustrating. But with the added throttle (or pedal assist if you prefer), you spend such a short period of time in that low speed range that the slow pedal cadence isn’t really noticeable.Ultimately, all of this means you’re left with a potent, 20 mph (32 km/h) city e-bike with a range of between 20-45 miles (32-72 km), all for a sweet low price. And you of course have the ability to add a ton of different accessories from Rad’s extensive portfolio to customize the RadMission and turn it into whatever style of e-bike you want. There are big racks and baskets and bags if you need cargo capacity, there are fenders if you need an all-weather commuter, etc. For me, I find the RadMission makes a great urban transport bike. I don’t really use it for hauling lots of cargo (I have a RadRunner for that), but instead I use it as a comfortable way to get around quickly. It’s a lightweight e-bike that I can lift up stairs without struggling and it has a nice open frame that is easy to lock to just about any weird solid object I can find on the street. It has narrow enough tires (1.95″) to make for a nimble and efficient ride, yet large enough that I still get a bit of cushion (unlike annoying thumb-width hipster-spec street tires).I’ve also been doing some nice fitness riding on it. Nothing crazy, but I can leave it in pedal assist level 1 or 2 and get a nice little workout in while still enjoying my ride.All of this is to say that the RadMission is basically your perfectly balanced urban e-bike, offering utility and performance while keeping the price affordable.This is the truest sense of a bang-for-your-buck e-bike. It gives you everything you need and nothing you don’t. Well, it gives you almost everything you need. I still think the lack of a kickstand was a bit of a cheap shot since probably 95% of riders will need to add it. But I guess for anyone who just leans their bike up against things, that saves you a few bucks right there. But I’ve dropped and scratched my e-bikes enough times to want a kickstand.Ultimately, the RadMission seems like a way to finally get a good quality e-bike into the hands of people who would be tempted to save money by getting a cheap Amazon e-bike instead. It’s like Rad is saying, “We know that $800 Amazon e-bike is tempting, but why buy a piece of junk when we can give you something that is actually well made for just a few hundred bucks more?”And I dig it. It’s an awesome all-around city e-bike at a great price. $1,099 for a bike like this is a steal of a deal. I hope it helps open the door for even more people to discover the benefits of e-biking.

2020/11/17,"Out with the old, in with the new! Dutch train stations are getting a makeover that includes replacing their old ashtray posts with new electric bicycle charging posts.Some days the world smiles upon you as you wake up to some wholesome, old-fashioned good news.Today is one of those days.After Holland banned smoking in all of its train stations last month, the public ashtray posts suddenly became obsolete. So now a new plan is seeing them upgraded with a much better purpose: electric bicycle charging posts.Electric bicycle use is incredibly high in The Netherlands, where many people use e-bikes instead of cars for personal transportation. E-bikes can be brought on trains for the longer portion of journeys and used as last-mile solutions to get to and from the train stations.Installing electric bicycle chargers on the platforms help ensure that commuters will be able to top up while waiting for a train.As ProRail representative Willem van Ewijk explained to the Brussels Times:“We want people to travel sustainably from door to door. Not only by train, but for example by bicycle to the station. By converting smoking posts into charging stations, we can ensure that more people take the electric bike.”The new design for the charging poles comes from the Amsterdam company Lightwell. Each pole can charge two electric bicycles simultaneously. Unlike electric car chargers, electric bicycle chargers are usually fairly low power, typically drawing around 100-250 watts of power. That’s around twice as powerful as a laptop charger.Less smoking, more e-bikes — what’s not to like? This is awesome!I’d love to see this occurring in more countries. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a double whammy of replacing ashtrays with e-bike chargers. But just installing more outlets for charging micromobility vehicles would be a huge benefit.Some countries like the US are still seeing a growing number of e-bikes being used for commuting, but e-bikes are a standard commuter vehicle in many other countries and chargers could be a huge benefit.The amount of electricity used to charge an e-bike is tiny. In the US, an average e-bike battery can be charged for around US$0.05. One nickel. And since most people aren’t standing on a train platform long enough to get more than 10-15% of a charge (just enough to carry on their way), we’re talking about a penny a person. I think we can fit that into public funding, don’t you?",ebikes
2020/11/16,"Don’t call them the Harley-Davidson electric bicycles anymore! Despite spending their first two years of development as an H-D project, the e-bikes were spun off into their own company known as Serial 1 last month.Today Serial 1 is releasing the full details and taking pre-orders for their new portfolio of “Powered by Harley-Davidson” e-bikes, including specs and pricing. And as an added treat, I got to take the first-ever test ride of the premium-level Serial 1 e-bikes to share with you below.To be honest, I didn’t know what to expect when I went into this test ride last week and finally got to see the e-bikes in person.I figured that e-bikes originally designed by Harley-Davidson would be pretty decent, though would also cost a pretty penny. Ultimately, Serial 1 surprised me on both counts. In a good way. Not only did these premium e-bikes exceed my expectations in terms of ride quality and performance, but they came in below the sky-high prices that I had feared.Check out my video below showing my test rides on the new Serial 1 e-bikes, then keep reading for the full details on this fascinating story.For two years I’ve called these e-bike prototypes the “Harley-Davidson e-bikes,” for lack of a better term. But suddenly they aren’t Harleys anymore. Or are they?In a nutshell, here’s what happened: Harley-Davidson was gearing up to release the e-bikes as planned for spring/summer of 2020, but then COVID-19 hit. The project fell into limbo as H-D, like most companies, was forced to revisit their five-year plan. As the company tightened its belt, things initially looked dark for the project. But the dedicated team behind the bikes was able to secure their future and worked with H-D to spin off the new operation as a separate company, Serial 1 Cycle Company, with H-D as a large equity holder.Serial 1 is now housed on the H-D campus in Milwaukee, sitting in the same building out back that once served as Harley’s race shop from the 1950s to early 2000s. Serial 1 may be a new startup (and one that the team jokes about now “working in their parent’s garage”), but they still get many of the benefits of having H-D as their “parents” on both the business and engineering fronts.It’s a much longer and more complicated story than that, and one that I hope to tell soon in fascinating detail with all the dramatic twists and turns. But for now, that’s the nutshell.Serial 1 is unveiling their new e-bikes today, consisting of a pair of models: The Serial 1 MOSH/CTY and Serial 1 RUSH/CTY. And the RUSH actually has three variations, so we’re looking at four unique e-bikes here. The “/CTY” designator seems to imply that these urban e-bikes will be joined by non-urban e-bikes in the future, a guess further buoyed by the team’s tightlipped grins when I pushed further on the subject.  The MOSH platform is something of an urban playbike — robustly constructed while offering just a single speed to simplify the drivetrain and keep costs down.The RUSH platform uses the same powertrain but a different frame that is optimized for real-world commuting and leisure. It includes custom-designed racks and fenders, plus an automatic Enviolo NuVinci transmission that is a thing of beauty. Seriously. It’s an awesome transmission.The bikes otherwise share many premium features. They all use a Gates Carbon Drive belt drive system instead of a chain. They are both powered by the latest Brose Drive S Mag mid-drive motor with smooth and ultra-quiet belt reduction. The mid-drive motor features 90 Nm of torque and four pedal assist levels with up to 400% assist in the most powerful level.Technically that’s a “250W continuous” motor, but we all know that European e-bike power ratings are meaningless. They carry “250W” stickers to pass EU power limit laws, but true power output is often closer to 500-800W, depending on the model. I rode the Serial 1 MOSH/CTY single-speed e-bike up some very steep off-road trails and it rocketed me to the top. So, yeah… “250 watts, wink wink.”The e-bikes use lightweight hydroformed aluminum frames designed by Harley-Davidson relying on over a century of frame-building expertise. The four frame sizes are designed with a proper stair-step stack-and-reach geometry that ensures every rider gets the same handling even as the frame size changes. The belt tensioning system, which is normally an eyesore on many frames, has been cleverly hidden in the rear triangle as well to reduce clutter and maintain a sleek appearance. The LED lighting is integrated into the frame with tail lights embedded on both sides of the rear triangle (with brake lights triggered by a built-in accelerometer), a “be-seen” headlight integrated into the head tube, and a bright “seeing” light incorporated into the handlebar mount. The team custom designed all the lights and put special emphasis on designing the powerful headlight’s reflector to ensure strong lighting across the entire vertical range, as opposed to most headlights that only provide their rated lumens in the center of the beam and fade quickly as the beam spreads out.The same team that developed the battery for the Harley-Davidson LiveWire also developed the battery packs for the Serial 1 e-bikes. Both the motor and the battery are mounted as low on the frame as possible, with the team employing the same mass centralization design philosophy used in motorcycle design to give the bikes better handling and cornering characteristics.Two different packs were developed with 529 Wh and 706 Wh capacities, and they can be interchanged between the models.The 20 mph (32 km/h) MOSH/CTY and RUSH/CTY Step-through both come standard with the 529 Wh pack, while the 28 mph (45 km/h) RUSH/CTY Speed and the 20 mph (32 km/h) RUSH/CTY both sport the larger 706 Wh batteries.All models even have a glovebox, or perhaps better described as a bike-lock box. You could put anything in it, but it designed to perfectly fit a high-security ABUS folding lock. The bike is even keyed alike, meaning the battery removal lock, glovebox, and ABUS lock all use the same key. Talk about convenience!That level of attention to detail is obvious throughout the bikes. It shows that Serial 1 and Harley-Davidson before them applied motorcycle-level design discipline to their electric bikes. They even thought of the small things, like custom rubber washers in the racks and fenders to eliminate any possible rattle or noise, as well as a custom rubber battery bumper in the battery receptacle for the same purpose. Even the multi-tool supplied with the bike for final assembly (basically putting the front wheel on and turning the handlebars) is a high-quality tool designed to cover nearly every nut and bolt on the bike, not just a dinky disposable Allen set. Important bolts like on the dual- and four-piston hydraulic disc brake calipers use security check paint marks, just like in automotive manufacturing, to provide a visual check that no critical bolts have loosened (something that has actually happened to me on other bikes’ brakes before).And the frames were tested and proofed on Harley-Davidson’s frame rigs similarly to how their motorcycle frames are torture tested. As Serial 1’s Brand Director Aaron Frank explained, “We benchmarked other brand’s frames using the same testing measures and to be honest it was scary to see how they performed and moved under loading.”Serial 1 even used Harley-Davidson’s tire test track in Arizona for tire testing and selection, ultimately using high quality Schwalbe Super Moto-X 27.5 x 2.4-inch tires.To sum it up: these e-bikes have been through more stringent design and testing than any other e-bike I’ve seen. They’ve taken decades of motorcycle safety, design, and production principles and applied them to the cycling industry.And when you factor all of that in, the pricing is incredibly competitive:Those prices also include free shipping, with pre-orders opening today in the US and Germany (more countries to follow).And when compared to other premium electric bicycles in the space such as those from Specialized and Trek, Serial 1’s prices fall right in line and match those competitors when comparing based on similar component levels, such as the Brose Drive S Mag motors, Gates belt drive, large batteries and Enviolo automatic transmissions. Bikes from other premium manufacturers sporting those parts will cost you just as much.The difference is you also get all of the extra details from Serial 1, such as the beautifully embedded lighting, the better handling through intelligent frame design and mass centralization, the keyed-alike glovebox/battery/optional bike lock, the lightweight yet more rugged frame design, the attention to detail with safety and convenience, etc.I really feared that we’d see prices in the $6-7k range, something to compete with premium e-bike companies like Riese & Muller. So a starting price at $3,399 is more than fair here, relative to the components and rest of the industry.Enough shop talk, let’s hear how these e-bikes ride.Over the course of an afternoon I was able to cover some diverse terrain from city blocks to dirt trails. I climbed hills and skidded across bridges. I asked a lot of the bikes, and they obliged happily.I have to hand it to Serial 1 and H-D before them; these are excellent riding e-bikes!They absolutely love to corner. That extra-low center of gravity and the confidence of Schwalbe Super Moto X tires make you want to corner hard, and the bikes simply beg you to do it. The words “nimble” or “agile” just don’t quite do the bikes justice. They’re more than nimble — they almost seem to anticipate your moves. I’m not a frame designer so I can’t claim to understand all of the intricacies that go into creating that feeling, but suffice it to say that Serial 1 knew what they were doing when creating an e-bike that melds effortlessly into the rider.The single-speed MOSH/CTY is geared appropriately so that it is easy to get rolling (especially with that Brose Drive S Mag motor) yet doesn’t cause you to spin your legs like a food processor at its 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed. And the single-speed setup keeps the weight down at just 48 lb (21.8 kg).I even blasted through off-road nature trails — something I didn’t expect to feel so good on a bike that Serial 1 describes as an “urban playbike.” But the MOSH loved it! That powerful motor, strong hydraulic disc brakes on giant 203 mm rotors and balanced frame design helped me hug bends in the trail at high speed, holding lines that I didn’t even think I was capable of.But the real beauty is that automatic transmission on the RUSH models. You can select the cadence that feels right to you, and the transmission constantly adjusts to keep you in the proper gear for your favorite pedaling speed. No shifting, no thinking. It just does it all for you.The bikes just feel right. They don’t feel like a collection of parts; they feel like a properly designed e-bike that disappears beneath you leaving you with nothing to think about but the ride itself.Look, we all heard the jokes when Harley-Davidson first began working on e-bikes. “But how will they make it leak oil in your garage?” “Does it come with a leather jacket and a gray pony tail?” and “If it’s a Harley then will it still cost more than a car?”Ha. Ha.But let’s get real. It’s not a Harley. Not anymore. And Serial 1 did a great job with these e-bikes.Laugh about Harley maintenance all you want, but this ain’t a Harley. Those juice brakes, belt drive, and single-speed or automatic transmissions mean essentially zero maintenance. Check your tire pressure and ride.And these aren’t chromed-out cruisers. They’re urban e-bikes that both look good and are actually designed to be functional. Their dual racks, fenders and locking glovebox are sweet. These are legit commuter e-bikes.And they aren’t charging an arm and a leg to get an e-bike with a brand label on it. If anything, the bikes cost the same as the competition yet arguably provide more value.I think VP of product development Ben Lund said it best when showing me the bikes’ features. “We’re not just badge-slapping here,” he said. “We really mean businesses.”And he’s right. These aren’t Harley-Davidson e-bikes. They’re well-made Serial 1 e-bikes that happen to have a Harley origin story. They’ve benefitted from Harley-Davidson’s expertise and resources, but are now charting their own path.And I love it.",ebikes
2020/11/14,"Canadian e-bike distributor Biktrix has never shied away from high power e-bikes. And that means the company’s newest electric bicycle, the Biktrix Juggernaut Duo, is true to form with up to 1,500W of power and blistering fast speeds.The Juggernaut Duo is the latest evolution of Biktrix’s high-power Juggernaut line of e-bikes.The bikes feature large tires, powerful motor options, front suspension, integrated lighting options and the ability to add a second battery for super-long-range riding. The longest range version has a range rating of as much as 160 miles (257 km) from a combined 2,000 Wh of battery. That’s going to require some significant pedal assist, but even the throttle-only range should be pretty impressive with that much battery.And the bikes aren’t even that expensive when considering their specs. The line consists of a number of options ranging from $1,399 up to $2,899.All three models sport both a throttle and pedal assist, dual piston hydraulic disc brakes with adjustable reach levers, a downtube-integrated battery and offer the option of a second auxiliary battery of 14, 17.5 or 21Ah.On the lower end of the model line is the Juggernaut Duo, which offers a 750W rear hub motor, a top speed of 24 mph (38 km/h), and an 840 Wh battery.The next step up is the Juggernaut Duo + Motor Upgrade, which swaps in a 750W Bafang BBS02 mid-drive motor that boosts torque from 80 to 120 Nm, though the top speed remains the same.The next upgrade brings you to the Juggernaut HD Duo, which swaps out the 750W Bafang BBS02 for a 1,000W Bafang BBSHD mid-drive motor with a crushing 160 Nm of torque. That also boosts the speed up to 35 mph (55 km/h).And finally, one more upgrade brings you to the flagship model, the Juggernaut HD Duo + Torque Upgrade, which includes the same features and specs, yet adds a torque sensor for even more responsive pedal assist.The bikes come standard with 4.8″ fat tires but also offer a more nimble 3″ mountain bike tire as well. The 200 lumen integrated headlight can also be upgraded to a 2,000 lumen off-road ready headlight.The bikes are available in multiple frame sizes to fit various riders and also come in both a step-over and step-through frame.While Biktrix is launching the new model line on Indiegogo, the company is well established with a good reputation after delivering thousands of e-bikes to customers already.In the last few years we’ve seen an industry shift with Indiegogo not just being used by e-bike startups, but also well-established brands looking to make a splash with their new releases.Biktrix expects to begin shipping the new models in December of this year with delivery to the US and Canada, so you should be prepared to start shredding the snow this winter and then the trails next spring.What do you think of the the new Bixtrix Juggernaut Duo line of e-bikes?

2020/11/13,"The EUNORAU G20 is a compact cargo bike on a reasonable budget. This little guy can carry kids, cargo, and yourself for a healthy distance. If that sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Clearly the bike, and also the very name G20, is inspired by the GSD from Tern Bicycles.Since EUNORAU has no qualms with comparing their bike to Tern, I will follow their lead. Recently reviewed here on Electrek, I deemed the Tern GSD a top contender for the best cargo bike, and King of the Kill when it comes to compact cargo bikes. So if the Tern GSD is the king, what’s the G20?Duke of the Hill? Baron? Regent?Let’s start with a couple points in which the G20 rocks. The G20 includes a throttle, which is amazing. Using a throttle to get going on a loaded cargo bike is fantastic, and a wonderful feature you don’t want to lose. The Tern GSD has a Bosch cargo motor that doesn’t have a throttle option. The price is definitely the biggest selling point: $2,000 for the G20. That’s half of the base model GSD.Before we get to the comparisons, let’s talk about how it rides. I primarily rode the bike with my daughter, Sweet Pea; going to school, the grocery store, and random errands. In these conditions, it was great! The rear deck is the perfect size and fits with an existing pad from Xtracycle. I like the wheel skirts to protect passenger feet or clothes from getting caught, and the kid railing is quite simple to work with. The kickstand is super strong, I have no question about it under load, but it’s strangely high. I actually saw a different G20 with a different kickstand, so they may be experimenting on this part.The reflective 24” tires have a lot of grip to them. I really like this tire size for a combination of somewhat-low weight, and being able to overcome obstacles. Tiny wheels get stuck everywhere, and tall wheels put all the cargo weight high, and makes it difficult to steer. The G20 seems quite strong, with a lot of extra metal on the frame and options for attaching and mounting stuff, but I never did attempt to find the capacity. I found it to be more useful for carrying kids on account of the small footboards.Since cargo bikes carry a wildly variable amount of weight, estimating the range would be like throwing darts at a broom handle in the dark. I can tell you that on a few freezing mornings, I’ve pedaled my daughter to school up a 10-mile hill (and back home again) with about 20% battery left.To get back to comparisons again, pretty much every part of the EUNORAU G20 is using lower shelf components, but I’m assuming you could guess that. The brakes, derailleur, fenders, tires, front fork, handlebars, grips, kid rails, seat, seat-post, kickstand, gears, motor, stem, basket; all have a noticeable contrast in quality, durability, and especially price.One of the more surprising features of the Tern GSD is the ability to store upright. After folding the handlebars and seat, the Tern GSD offers excellent storage options for folks who live in dense urban areas (where square footage is at a premium). This feature is kind of muddled on the G20. The handlebars and seat fold up just fine, but the G20 frame lacks extra metal on the rear and cannot hold upright at all. This limits the G20 storage to being under a countertop, or just using the folding aspects to change drivers quickly, that still works.The G20 has a 48v battery that sounds like an advantage over the 36v Bosch system. If the throttle is taken out of the equation, I can say with full confidence that the Bosch system is better in every way. The G20 mid-drive motor is capable, don’t get me wrong. I’ve seen it used very well on other bikes with great results. The one issue I have with the bike is the G20’s choice in mechanical gearing. The G20 is forced to interface with a paltry freewheel in the back offering range of just 14-28 teeth. This means that the bike is mechanically limited both in terms of top speed, and low end torque. Low-end torque is a must have for cargo bikes that perform heavy lifting.Therein lies the heart of the issue. I wouldn’t call the G20 a beast of burden, but I will say that for light-duty efforts, it’s perfectly fine. I mean, hey, its half price and it can do quite a bit. It can still carry a couple small kids, it can still jaunt around town and even surprise you with amazing carrying capacity at times. It might not flip on its tail, or stop especially fast, but hey, it’s got a throttle.Aside from the comparisons that its name implies, all on its own, the G20 is very useful. If you’re new to the wonderful world of cargo biking, you’d probably like it. It’s got all the necessary accessories to get you going, and you’ll love the money you’ll save with the lower price. Either at a hard stop or because I want to relax, I really like the throttle option, and I think you would too. For light-duty use, the EUNORAU G20 is a great choice. It might surprise you with how useful it can be. And if you change out the freewheel, you’ve got a real winner on your hands.",ebikes
2020/11/11,"As Rad Power Bikes has grown to become the largest electric bicycle company in North America, it has invested in broadening its reach beyond just a direct-to-consumer e-bike company.It began with a push towards more retail locations, something akin to the traditional bicycle shop model.But that wasn’t enough for the Seattle-based company, which does the majority of its vast sales via its website.No, Rad Power Bikes wanted to bring the physical experience of a bike shop even closer to its customers. The company wanted to show up at its customers’ doors.And thus Rad Mobile was born.The service is essentially a bike shop in a van that can reach customers for one-on-one service.That includes everything from providing test rides to personal delivery to at-home bike repair. And fortunately for me, I was able to experience two of those services recently.I already had a RadWagon cargo e-bike on hand that I was reviewing and was preparing to review the brand new $1,099 single-speed RadMission metro bike. And as it just so happens, when it came time for delivery of the RadMission, the RadWagon also needed some servicing (it was one of the first runs of the bike and needed some updating).So far, Rad Mobile is only available in a handful of cities, including Seattle, Austin, Portland, Sacramento, Miami, Phoenix, Orange County and Vancouver, B.C.With e-biking on the rise and Rad Power Bikes seeing the largest sales by far, Rad Mobile can be pretty busy in the cities they service. But I was able to schedule an appointment, and about a week later, the Rad Mobile van was pulling into my driveway.Out popped two of Rad Power Bikes’ smiling technicians (I assume they were smiling under those masks). With them was one beautiful reddish/orange RadMission electric bike that they had already assembled for me and tuned into perfect riding shape. I’ve assembled a pile of e-bikes from Rad Power Bikes by now, and to be honest, they aren’t that bad to put together. With the included tools and 30-45 minutes of snipping zip ties and tightening bolts, you’re pretty much there.But boy, oh boy, is it nice to have a professional do it for you! And for anyone who hasn’t assembled several hundred e-bikes over the years like me, the peace of mind of knowing a pro put it together is surely very nice to have.With the RadMission already good to go, the guys wheeled the RadWagon into the back of the van and up onto the stand. I should also note that they were also super respectful of being masked the entire time and also observed social distancing. And with the bike in the stand, the technicians went to work like a pair of skilled surgeons. In seemingly no time, the RagWagon was rolling back out of the van as good as the day it showed up. Or perhaps even better, since the day it showed up, I had to assemble it myself — like an animal.While I’ve long been a fan of direct-to-consumer e-bike companies, they’ve always had one glaring flaw. Shopping on the internet can never give you the same personal experience as walking into a bicycle shop. Or at least it never could before. But as Rad Power Bikes expands its Rad Mobile service into more cities, riders may realize this is exactly the breakthrough the industry needs.Customers can shop from the convenience (and viral safety) of their computer chair. Then experienced Rad Power Bikes technicians can show up for a test ride, handle the assembly or perform maintenance/repairs whenever necessary. While the professional assembly and at-home servicing options understandably come with a charge ($79-$129 depending on location), the test riding service is actually free!And, of course, Rad Mobile isn’t the only name in the game here. I’ve used the Velofix service before (which Rad Power Bikes also works with) and had a similarly positive experience. But no one knows a Rad Power Bike e-bike like a company man, so having a dedicated service with trained e-bike mechanics that specialize in only these bikes is a distinct advantage.If anything, now I worry the service is too convenient. I’m going to have to find a way to explain to my wife why I keep ordering more e-bikes to show up in the driveway. “No, it’s OK, baby. You see, this new RadMini is for you!”",ebikes
2020/11/10,"If you thought two versions of the popular Juiced Scorpion electric moped were enough, then think again. San Diego-based Juiced Bikes just unveiled a new addition to the family known as the HyperScorpion Express.The bright yellow paint job of the HyperScorpion Express isn’t the only thing that separates it from the rest of the line.The new model is actually designed for extreme utility, and is the latest in a growing crop of cargo or utility-oriented e-bikes.With a wide-format modular rear rack, the HyperScorpion Express is purpose-built for hauling cargo.In fact, this might be the best delivery e-bike model we’ve seen yet from a US-based electric bicycle company.You know those big food backpacks that delivery companies like UberEats and DoorDash use? They fit perfectly in the back of the new HyperScorpion Express. And the bright yellow color will surely help keep delivery riders safer while they prowl the streets all day.The rest of the HyperScorpion Express is largely unchanged compared to the standard HyperScorpion — not that there is much standard about the bike.A top speed that exceeds 30 mph (48 km/h) and a giant 52V 19.2Ah battery combine to give the HyperScorpion Express some serious performance. That 1 kWh battery is rated for a maximum range of 70 miles (112 km) in pedal assist mode, though our own testing of the HyperScorpion found that the throttle-only range could be half as much at reasonable speeds.Still, with twice as much battery as many common e-bikes, the HyperScorpion Express seems sure to go the distance. And the removable and swappable batteries mean that delivery riders could swap in a fresh battery if they truly need to ride all day.The bike sports front and rear suspension as well as a step-through frame similar to classic mopeds. The suspension and frame design are both advantages for delivery riders — just imagine throwing your leg over that giant insulated delivery bag!The $3,099 HyperScorpion Express is priced at a small premium over the $2,999 HyperScorpion, thanks to its giant modular rack. And for riders that want the fun of riding a Scorpion but don’t need the same incredibly high power and long range, the base version of the Scorpion is priced at just $1,799.While we haven’t tested the Express version, we have reviewed the Juiced HyperScorpion and found it to be an incredibly powerful and capable electric moped, and we’ve founded its standard Scorpion little brother to also be a fun ride, even if it doesn’t have the same over-the-top speed and power.Check out our review video below!",ebikes
2020/11/09,"The Priority Current is a commuter-oriented electric bike that delivers a seriously nice all-around package at a more than reasonable price. Frankly, it’s refreshing.I’ve ridden and reviewed plenty of nice e-bikes. I’m not talking about just pretty good but still budget-minded e-bikes, I’m talking about e-bikes with all the bells and whistles, all the fancy features, but with a $4-6k price that gets stuck in your throat.And that’s why I was so intrigued by the Priority Current electric commuter bike when it was debuted last month, and why I made sure to have a review unit in my driveway not even a week later. I mean, c’mon guys. It was a belt-drive e-bike with a mid-drive motor, industry-leading torque, plenty of range, slick frame with integrated battery, and that came loaded with high-end components like an Enviolo NuVinci continuously variable transmission.All of that for a debut price of $2,699 (which has since increased to $2,999, though we have a discount code for you at the end of this article to get the price back down to $2,699).While that may still sound like a lot of cash, it’s actually a great deal for what you get with this e-bike. Make sure you watch my short review video below to see the bike in all its moving glory. Then continue reading for my full thoughts as well as the $300 discount code below.The Priority Current is definitely built for the street. With bright automatic lighting, built-in fenders and the ability to add all sorts of commuting accessories in the front and rear, this is what an ultimate commuter or urban transport e-bike looks like. And I’ve even been doing some nice fitness riding on it as well.The bike is comfortable to ride even without suspension, thanks largely to the adjustable stem, comfort saddle, and well-executed geometry that have you comfortably mounted.  Unlike one-size-fits-all e-bikes, the Priority Current is available in three frame sizes to give riders a more accurate fit.The bike also feels much more premium than a lot of the e-bikes I generally review. A big part of that is due to the high-end components that we’ll touch on next.  But the sleek design also adds to the premium feel of the bike. As a friend in my apartment building remarked when he saw the bike, “That’s a bike you keep waxed and parked in your living room, not in the bike room!”With a 500 Wh battery, I’ve been regularly getting a range of around 35-40 miles per charge (56-64 km) on my mixed-use rides. Higher range is possible if you keep it in the lowest pedal assist setting, but sometimes I like a little extra help!I’m a big fan of belt-drive on e-bikes. It’s a huge upgrade in many ways.That smooth belt-drive on the Priority Current is incredibly low-maintenance, which again is perfect for the busy commuter. There’s no chain to oil and no derailleur to fiddle with.And while we’re on the low-maintenance kick, the bike also has no brake cables to tune (or retune every few weeks or months).The hydraulic disc brakes and Gates belt-drive system remove the most common hassles for cyclists, making the bike pretty much a hands-off affair when it comes to maintenance. And the whisper quiet operation of the belt-drive combined with its smooth pedal feel only adds to the joy of ownership.The version of the bike I tested sports an Enviolo NuVinci stepless transmission. It’s a type of internally geared hub that is essentially a continuously variable transmission (CVT). You don’t have a set number of gears; instead you have an infinite number of gear ratios within a wide 380% range.For my personal taste it is geared a tiny bit low, which is great for hill climbing but means that the cadence is a bit fast at the bike’s top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). But I don’t ride that fast so often, and when I do I find I can still keep up, even if I’m pedaling a tad bit faster than I’d like.Speaking of hills, with 140 Nm of torque, the Priority Current can destroy just about any hill you throw at it. For comparison, that’s twice as much torque as Bosch’s most powerful mid-drive e-bike motors.  When you put the bike in pedal assist level 5 (there’s no throttle, but instead 5 levels of pedal assist), the bike pulls like a tractor.If the tires were sticky enough, I’m half convinced I could ride it up a wall.For me, I spend most of my time pedaling in level 1 or 2 while doing a fitness ride or bumping up to level 3 when I just need to get somewhere and don’t want to work too hard.When I’m really in a hurry, I’ll opt for level 4 or 5 and just fly down the road at 28 mph (45 km/h), but that’s fairly rare. The bike is just so much fun to pedal that you don’t feel the need to use the highest assist levels too often. You actually enjoy being part of the process and adding your own support.The one area I would like to tweak a bit is how quickly the power comes on. You feel it the instant you apply pressure to the pedals (yay for torque sensors!), but it seems to take a few seconds to really ramp up the power. That’s fairly common in e-bikes and is usually programmed into the speed controller since it is more efficient for the battery and helps improve the long-life qualities of the drive components. But sometimes you still just want to stomp on it and fly off!When it comes to speed, I mentioned that I can hit 28 mph (45 km/h) fairly easily. But the bike actually ships in Class 1 mode with a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). If you want to go faster (and your local e-bike laws allow it) you can simply enter the settings menu and bump the speed up to match your preference. If you’re more of a 25 mph (40 km/h) guy or gal, you can do that too.I lasted two miles before derestricting the bike, but you might have more self-control than I do.When I compare the specs and components on the Priority Current to other e-bikes in its class, this is a no-brainer. The Priority Current simply offers better value.The MSRP of $2,999 is a great deal for all you get, and I honestly feel like it is even underpriced compared to the competition. But with the discount code ELECTREK you can make the deal even sweeter at $2,699!  But don’t dawdle, that discount is only good for the next week.For reference, a typical budget-oriented e-bike from the major direct-to-consumer brands will run you around $1,500 these days. So for barely more than a cool G, you’re adding a long list of high-end parts and getting higher-quality manufacturing to boot.For a Class 3 e-bike with nearly the torquiest motor in the industry, it blows away all of those $3k-$5k Bosch-powered e-bikes.And on top of that you get premium features like Gates belt drive, automatic front and rear lights, dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, quick release thru-axle instead of cheap quick release skewers, classy fenders, stepless shifting from an internally geared hub, 5-year frame warranty and two-year component warranty including the battery (compared to one-year warranties from many companies).The bike is simply such a pleasure to ride that I didn’t even want to give it back. When I finished the review and it came time to send back my review unit, I just couldn’t. I called up the company and convinced them to let me buy it (c’mon guys, it’s a “used” bike now!) and ever since I’ve been having a blast making it my new daily rider. In fact, I had a beautiful 20 mile (32 km) ride this morning and didn’t even use half the battery.So I guess that’s the ultimate endorsement after all. I liked it enough to make it my own. And I’d recommend it to anyone who wants a comfortable, powerful, and low-maintenance urban e-bike built to last.",ebikes
2020/11/08,"FREY’s electric mountain bikes powered by the industry-leading Bafang Ultra mid-drive motor have expanded their reputation in the sport of electric mountain biking considerably over the past year.And now they are putting their powerful motors and high-end suspension to the test by taking on the world of enduro racing.Enduro mountain bike racing consists of rigorous mountain bike trails with both fast downhill sections and slower uphill slogs.In enduro racing, only the downhill sections of the courses are timed for competition. Riders have a time limit within which they must complete the uphill sections, but their time is not scored or competitive.In an interesting experiment, FREY recently participated in the HIBP Enduro Series at HIBP Bike Park in Shuangdai Village, Muchen She Nationality Township, Zhejiang Province of China. Shuangdai Village is located in an area known as the “Bamboo Sea of ​​Western Zhejiang,” an ecological tourism locale.The rich bamboo resources provide a livelihood for the villagers and support a local tourism industry. The extremely hilly topography also makes it a perfect location for a bike park.FREY’s participation helped create a new class for the competition. To keep races fair, instead of competing against standard pedal mountain bikes, a new division was created where riders all used the powerful FREY electric mountain bikes. Not only were the bikes useful for climbing the uphill sections of the track between downhill timed runs, but riders found that the quick acceleration during flat and slightly uphill portions of the timed downhill runs increased the racing tension and excitement.See an example of some of the riding in the video clip below.While many old school enduro racers still consider electric bikes to be “cheating,” the creation of a special class for powerful electric mountain bikes leveled the playing field and added an interesting element to the races.I’ve personally tested several of FREY’s electric mountain bikes and even rode trails at a similar bike park in China known as the Brave Peak Bike Park. You can see some of my own riding there last year in the video below.Despite FREY’s headquarters being based in China, the company serves an almost exclusively Western audience. Their e-bikes have become quite popular in Europe and North America, but have yet to catch on in China due to the tiny size of the Chinese mountain biking market.While commuter e-bikes sell in the tens of millions, very few Chinese riders have found their way into the sport of mountain biking. But FREY has been trying to change that and promote the sport locally as well.In addition to partnering with the few major racing events in the country, the team has volunteered to help build new bike parks in local mountains to help more riders discover the sport.Could electric mountain bikes help create a new element in the sport of enduro mountain bike racing?

2020/11/03,"From nearly the instant that Phoenix-based electric bicycle startup Lectric Bikes first unveiled the Lectric XP last year, the affordable little folding e-bike rocketed to the forefront of the budget e-bike market. And now that the company has added the Lectric XP Step-Thru as the second model in the lineup, even more riders are discovering the joy of an e-bike that offers big thrills for a small price.After spending time riding the $899 Lectric XP Step-Thru for this review, I think it might be my new favorite model from Lectric Bikes since it’s even more comfortable to use than the original Lectric XP.Let’s start with the tech specs so you can get an idea of what you’ll find in this e-bike. If you’re already familiar with the standard frame Lectric XP, you’ll likely notice that the Step-Thru version shares essentially identical specs. It simply offers a new step-through frame for increased accessibility and more comfortable mounts/dismounts.Seeing is believing, right? So watch my review video below to see the Lectric XP Step-Thru in action. Then keep reading for my complete thoughts on this awesome little deal-of-an-e-bike!Look, I’m going to lay out the main point of this bike here fairly simply: The Lectric XP Step-Thru (and the standard Lectric XP, for that matter) isn’t designed to be a top-of-the-line e-bike. There is exactly nothing about the bike that would be considered premium.And yet the bike is still an amazingly fun ride with its thrilling performance. So what gives?Essentially, the Lectric XP Step-Thru is an e-bike with all the right compromises. It offers a powerful 800W peak-rated motor and a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) when you add a bit of pedal power, or a lower top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle only.And with those fat tires, it’s fun for riding on both pavement and off-road trails — or just cutting right across the park.But it does make smart compromises, like with a somewhat smaller battery. At 500 Wh, the battery capacity is around average or even a bit below average compared to much of the industry.For most recreational riders, that’s still plenty of capacity. I find that I can get around 20 miles (32 km) of range when pushing it hard, or more than that when I ride easier or add in some pedal assist.Next, there’s no suspension. So don’t expect to do any impressive jumps. Or ride comfortably on rutted-out trails.That doesn’t mean you can’t leave the manicured streets behind, though. I’ve done plenty of riding on grass and gravel trails, but I also make a point of lifting out of the saddle a bit when I see the trail is about to get extra bumpy. So while I know going in that I’m not getting suspension, the reminder that this e-bike only costs $899 soothes my concerns. And extra air volume in those fat tires soothes my behind.Lastly, none of the components are super nice. You get simple Tektro brakes, simple Shimano 6-speed transmission, and a simple Shimano SIS shifter. This is all lower-tier stuff, but it all works perfectly fine. If I was a competition rider, I’d need to upgrade. But if I just want to have an enjoyable ride on an e-bike with “good enough” quality parts, this is the ticket right here.So while compromises were made, they all seem to have been made in the right places to preserve enough quality, comfort, and value to make this a seriously awesome e-bike.It’s fast and powerful, it can ride on varied terrain with those wide tires, and it folds for easy stowage in a trunk, RV, boat, or wherever else you need to stuff a bike.You even get an included rear rack, full metal fenders, and a pair of front and rear LED lights — all parts that can often cost extra on other budget e-bikes!And for those worried about legality issues, if 28 mph (45 km/h) speeds aren’t allowed in your area, you can easily limit the bike back down to Class 2 speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h). In fact, it comes programmed in Class 2 mode, and it is up to the rider to unlock the Class 3 top speed if he or she chooses.The bottom line is this: I don’t know how anyone can beat the Lectric XP Step-Thru at this price. It brings all of the same value of the original Lectric XP, yet drops the frame even lower to make it easier and more comfortable to mount.There’s still a place out there for premium electric bicycles. I own one and I love it. It gives me features and components I don’t have on the Lectric XP. But at three times the price, it’s not for everyone.The Lectric XP, on the other hand, is a great entry into the world of electric bikes for anyone that wants a high-performance e-bike without a high price tag.",ebikes
2020/11/01,"Believe it or not, a cash-for-clunkers plan helped get old and polluting cars off the road, replacing them with efficient and traffic-reducing personal electric vehicles like e-bikes and e-scooters.Shocking, right?Perhaps it’s not so shocking for Lithuanians, who jumped at the opportunity to swap their old cars for new e-bikes.The program was developed by Lithuania‘s Environmental Project Management Agency (APVA), part of the country’s Ministry of Environment.The program began this summer with a budget of €8 million. To qualify, citizens can apply for and then receive a subsidy of up to €1,000 (nearly US$1,200) for the purchase of a new electric bicycle, bicycle, e-scooter, e-moped, e-motorcycle or even public transportation credits, after exchanging their old vehicle, according to LRT.In fact, many of the older cars being traded in are worth less than €1,000, meaning their owners are already coming out ahead on the deal even before factoring in the additional savings on everything from car insurance to gasoline and parking permits.Approximately US$1,200 can go a long way towards buying a brand new e-bike. In fact, we’ve reviewed several popular models of e-bikes in the US that can be purchased for that price or less. E-bikes such as the $1,199 RadRunner electric utility bike and the $899 Lectric XP folding e-bike have proven that you don’t have to spend a lot of money to get a legitimate car-replacing electric bicycle. So far the Lithuanian program has spent around 95% of its budget, but has already received an additional €3 million to keep the popular program running.As spokeswoman for the APVA Austėja Jonaitytė explained:“The initiative received a lot of attention from the population. The number of applications exceeded all expectations. For this reason, the Environment Ministry has allocated an additional 3 million euros from the Climate Change Program.”I love it. I think it’s an amazing program that could and should be replicated elsewhere.Obviously, this comes down to a country’s priorities. But I firmly believe, as I’ve written about before, that removing cars from the road in favor of personal electric vehicles is a huge step towards reworking our cities into nicer and more sustainable places to live.Budgeting is always a touchy subject and everyone seems to have a better idea about where dollars should be spent, but putting money towards programs like these helps solve many problems at once. Old and polluting cars are removed from cities, improving air quality for everyone. Traffic is reduced by shifting commuters to smaller and more space-efficient vehicles. And electric bicycle companies and other personal electric vehicle companies receive a boost in business that helps them further invest in bringing more models and more accessibility to the market.That’s a win-win-win.",ebikes
2020/10/29,"The number of electric bicycles with belt drives has been increasing seemingly overnight. What was once a rarity for just the “super nice e-bikes” is now finding its way onto a wider range of e-bike styles than ever before.Belt drives are generally considered to be an upgrade over chains when it comes to bicycle drivetrains. Instead of greasy, archaic metal chains using several-hundred-year-old technology, belt drives use modern day, carbon fiber-reinforced rubber to transfer power to the rear wheel.And sure, we’d expect such niceties as belt drives from $5,000+ Riese & Müller electric bikes.But now that we’re seeing them pop up on much more affordable e-bikes like the $2,699 Priority Current and even the $995 Ride1Up Roadster V2, it’s time we take a deeper look at belt drives for e-bikes.As e-bikes featuring this tech are now becoming more accessible, we’re breaking down the advantages and disadvantages of the systems, and whether or not you need a belt drive setup on your e-bike.Firstly, belt drives are incredibly low maintenance. Unlike chains that require frequent oiling and cleaning, belts can largely be ignored. If you ride through thick mud, it’s probably a good idea to knock the dried wads out. But other than that, you’re pretty much good to go with some good old-fashioned neglect. Next, the presence of a belt drive usually means you’re going to get some kind of neat-o internally geared hub. Since you can’t use a standard derailleur like on a chain drive, you don’t have to worry about adjusting your deraileur and messing with finicky gears. Instead you’ll likely have some cool hub like an Enviolo CVT or maybe even a Rohloff if you bought a really nice bike.Some belt drive e-bikes, especially the more affordable ones, stick with a single-speed setup. That’s how the Ride1Up Roadster V2 keeps the price below $1,000, by the way. So you’re out of luck with those if you were hoping for an internally geared hub.Even without maintenance, good belts simply last. Gates Carbon Drive, maker of some of the best e-bike belt drives out there, has systems that can last for 50,000 miles (80,000 km), believe it or not!Belt drives are also cleaner, which is great for commuters. You’ll never get a grease mark on your nice slacks or ankle.They’re smoother and quieter too – an important factor for e-bike riders that enjoy the quiet nature of cycling at speed with barely the whirr of a motor in the wind.While belt-drives are lighter weight than chain drives, those benefits don’t really matter much to e-bikers, since our e-bikes are already fairly heavy. Saving a quarter pound on a 55 lb e-bike doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of things.As much as I love belt drives on my e-bikes, they aren’t totally without fault. There are a few downsides.First of all, there are fewer options for components. For chain drivetrains, there are tons of options for types of chains, sprockets, cassettes, chainrings, derailleurs, etc. But with fewer belt drive manufacturers and most systems being proprietary, you’re more limited when it comes to custom modifications or upgrades.Next, frame compatibility can be an issue. Because most belts can’t be broken in the middle like a chain to feed through the frame, instead the frame needs to open. This means a frame needs to have a bolted connection somewhere, or it has to have a funky chainstay design that lifts up and over the belt. The new Harley-Davidson Serial 1 e-bike prototype we saw earlier this week used that funky chainstay design, if you want to see it in practice. Smaller e-bike frames, like the one seen in the Riese & Müller Tinker Vario above can sometimes pull this off in a less obvious way.Full-suspension e-bikes can also have a tricky time with belt drives, since there is no derailleur to add tension. There are ways around this and some full-suspension belt e-bikes exist, but they are more rare.Belts are also technically less efficient, meaning you have to add a tiny bit more pedal force compared to chains. However, with the assist of an electric motor, that downside doesn’t affect us e-bike riders as much.Lastly, and arguably most importantly for riders of already-fairly-pricey e-bikes, belt drives are simply more expensive. Though prices are coming down, the technology is still fairly new and the materials aren’t as cheap as chain drive systems. That’s why we don’t see belt-drives on $500 e-bikes.But perhaps that day isn’t far off, as prices continue to drop and companies continue to innovate. Belt drives and their numerous advantages could soon find their way into your garage on a new e-bike. They already have in mine!",ebikes
2020/10/28,"The electric bicycle boom in the United States is bigger than we thought, and it’s only getting bigger.When the US economy began feeling the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic this past February and March, many in the e-bike industry feared the worst.At least until we witnessed an unexpected twist of fate. E-bikes, much like toilet paper for some reason, were the pandemic’s surprising winners that no one saw coming.Nearly every electric bicycle company saw sales skyrocket as Americans began to exit lockdowns this past April. Sales continued to climb into the summer, and they haven’t slowed since.According to Ed Benjamin of the Light Electric Vehicle Association, the US imported around 270,000 electric bicycles in 2019. That was peanuts compared to the millions of e-bikes sold in Europe but represented impressive growth for the US market.But now the US is expected to more than double that figure to as many as 600,000 e-bikes this year.And that’s not even enough to fulfill the demand.With many Chinese factories still working through backlogs of orders after shutting down operations during lockdowns earlier this year, several e-bike companies in the US are still struggling to import enough e-bikes. Even shortages of simple parts like pedals and handlebars from overloaded factories have held up the further flow of e-bikes into the country as Americans demand more electric two-wheelers.The largest e-bike company in the US, Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes, has even seen an interesting demographic shift in its rider base.With over 100,000 electric bikes from Rad Power Bikes put onto the road since the company’s start in 2015, (and with the company likely closing in on an annual sales figure of 100,000 e-bikes if trends continue), Rad knows the e-bike market inside and out.Most of the company’s customers were initially baby boomers who were using e-bikes to get back into cycling, Rad Power Bike’s CEO Mike Radenbaugh explained to Bloomberg.But now the company is seeing a large shift towards younger customers living in cities who are using electric bicycles as alternative forms of transportation.The ability to socially distance on an e-bike (compared to packing into public transit and getting COVID dusted) is likely partially responsible for the uptick in sales. But equally effective could be a trend towards more affordable electric bicycles that still pack in high performance and sought-after features.Rad Power Bikes has long led the value-oriented e-bike market. The company released two new low-cost models in the last year alone, the $1,199 RadRunner utility e-bike and the $1,099 RadMission city e-bike. But other companies are also competing for customers in this sought after space, and they’re bringing their A games too.Lectric Bikes is barely more than a year old, but it’s already coming after Rad Power Bikes with an impressively priced $899 Lectric XP folding fat-tire e-bike. We’ve reviewed the little 28 mph (45 km/h) powerhouse, and it is an awesome e-bike for that price!Lectric Bikes even released a step-thru version of the bike recently which has also proven to be quite popular.And So-Cal startup Ride1Up has also gotten into the low-cost e-bike game by relaunching one of its original e-bike models as an updated belt drive e-bike, the $995 Roadster V2. The stealthy e-bike offers most of the utility that daily riders are looking for and is an example of the increased accessibility we’re seeing in the e-bike market.As more riders awaken to the benefits of electric bicycles and major companies keep innovating to bring down prices, the sky is the limit for e-bike sales in the US.Now let’s hear your thoughts. Do you own an e-bike or are you interested in purchasing one? Let us know in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/10/27,"This is it. Harley-Davidson has been teasing us with the prospect of their own in-house electric bicycles for over two years. And today the bar-and-shield motorcycle manufacturer has finally announced its new dedicated electric bicycle brand known as Serial 1 Cycle Company.The brand’s name is an homage to the very first motorcycle ever built by Harley-Davidson in 1903, named “Serial Number One.”Back then, motorcycles were essentially just bicycles with a small engine placed in front of the pedals.And so it is fitting that the company’s first electric bicycle is a nod to that very first H-D motorcycle. Check out both in the video below to see how well they nailed the tribute.As Serial 1 Cycle Company’s brand director Aaron Frank explained in a statement provided to Electrek:When Harley-Davidson first put power to two wheels in 1903, it changed how the world moved, forever. Inspired by the entrepreneurial vision of Harley-Davidson’s founders, we hope to once again change how cyclists and the cycling-curious move around their world with a Serial 1 eBicycle.The new e-bike brand from H-D actually began life as a skunkworks project in Harley-Davidson’s Product Development Center. As the company explained, they began with “a small group of passionate motorcycle and bicycle enthusiasts working with a single focus to design and develop an eBicycle worthy of the Harley-Davidson name.”Ultimately, they decided along with H-D to spin off the brand into a dedicated electric bicycle company that could focus purely on delivering a premium e-bike product and experience.In addition to Aaron Frank, other major players from H-D’s in-house e-bike program that made the jump to Serial 1 Cycle Company include Jason Huntsman, president; Ben Lund, vice president; and Hannah Altenburg, lead brand marketing specialist.Serial 1 will officially debut its first electric bicycle models for consumers in March 2021. For now, the company is showing off its first prototype model, which the brand describes as “a styling exercise, not necessarily intended for mass production.”This prototype has been styled after that original 1903 Serial Number One motorcycle from Harley-Davidson. But interestingly, we can see that it shares the same frame as one of the original three electric bicycle prototypes that I spied last year at the 2019 EICMA Milan Motorcycle Show.That means that while this specific styling likely won’t see showroom floors, the bike it is based on very well may be here this spring.As we’ve previously seen, the design includes a mid-drive motor, a belt drive system that looks very much like a Gates Carbon Drive setup (which would make sense, as Harley-Davidson’s other belt-driven motorcycles including the all-electric LiveWire also uses belt drive systems from Gates), frame-integrated headlights and taillights, thru-axle wheel hubs, what appear to be Tektro dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes on 203 mm rotors, a Brooks leather saddle, and beautifully wrapped leather handgrips. I’m still left with many questions. Will these parts make it onto Serial 1 Cycle Company’s production models? What power level is the motor? What is the battery capacity? How much will the e-bikes cost?For these questions and more, we still have no answers. But at least now we have a better idea of when to expect answers, and who we will be receiving them from. Stay tuned, because as soon as Serial 1 has more details for us, we’ll be back to share them with you.",ebikes
2020/10/26,"When Pedego, one of the largest e-bike companies in the US, debuted their most affordable e-bike ever last month, I knew I had to test it out. A few days later I was in the saddle of the new Pedego Element, cruising the streets, parks, and beaches to put the new e-bike to the test.And here’s my story.As a bit of background, the reason the Pedego Element had me so excited was that it was finally a Pedego e-bike that the masses could afford.Pedego has 20-something e-bikes in their lineup, which is great. Except that they range from $2k to $5.5k. That price range can still be reasonable when you factor in Pedego’s 100+ dealer network, local service/support, and a list of other factors that we’ll discuss, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t still price out much of the market that can’t afford to spend several thousand dollars on an e-bike.So to see Pedego launch the Element at a mere $1,495, it was obvious that the company was trying to become more accessible to a wider range of customers. And since I’m all about getting more people on e-bikes, that jibes well with me!Make sure to watch the video below to see me putting the Pedego Element through its paces. Then continue reading for my full, detailed review!In order for Pedego to reach their lowest price point ever, they had to make a few compromises on the Element.For starters, there’s no suspension other than those voluptuous tires. The fork and frame are both rigid.Next, you don’t get any extra features or components. It’s a perfectly functional e-bike, but there are no built-in lights, no rack, no fenders, no horn, no app, etc. And you definitely don’t get premium parts like hydraulic brakes or a mid-drive motor.But what you DO get is perfectly adequate for (and I’m just spitballing here) probably 90% of purely recreational and leisure e-bike riders. You get a powerful motor rated for 500W continuous and 1,000W peak, a sufficiently large 480Wh battery (though Pedego’s other more expensive e-bikes of course get larger batteries) and you get both throttle and pedal assist support up to 20 mph (32 km/h).So while there are no bells and whistles (ok, there’s actually a bell), the Pedego Element has all the right stuff you need for e-biking fun.And boy, is it fun!To me, the Pedego Element’s simplicity is part of its charm.This is an e-bike that is purely built for riding. And I rode it hard.From beach sand to curb hops and even a few nicely manicured roads for a change, I powered the Pedego Element across everything. I climbed over fallen branches and slung sand into the air with the same bike that I could comfortably cruise a boardwalk with.With a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), I couldn’t get into too much trouble of course, but the power was sufficient to hit that top speed fairly quickly.The pedal assist is perfectly fine, though nothing fancy. It is cadence-based and thus works well on flat ground but probably wouldn’t be my pedal assist method of choice on hills, which is where a torque sensor-based pedal-assist system really shines for me. And it will never be as smooth as torque-based pedal-assist systems, but what can you do. Pedego is aiming for budget territory here with the Element.But with 500W (and 1,000W peak) of power at my disposal, I found myself just grabbing a bit of throttle anytime I wanted the pedal-assist to come on just a hair quicker.With 480Wh of battery, I found that throttle-only riding at high speeds extrapolated out to a range approximately in the low 20’s of miles. That fits decently well with most e-bikes of this size and power level. And for anyone with more self-control than me to not touch the throttle and only use pedal assist, doubling the throttle-only range is pretty standard in low to medium pedal assist modes.While I give the Pedego Element high marks on performance and value, the areas where it does suffer a bit are in ride quality and a short feature list.The ride isn’t bad, please don’t get me wrong. It’s fine. If anything, it actually rides more comfortably than I expected for a non-suspension e-bike. And it sure is nimble with its short wheelbase.But when you leave the smooth bike lanes or boardwalks and head onto trails or cobblestones, you’ll notice the bumps a lot more. When riding sand and trails, I spent a lot of the time rising out of the saddle and using soft knees to keep the ride nice and comfortable.This won’t be much of an issue for riders that stick to nicer streets and sidewalks exclusively. But just know that if you want to take those fat tires off-road, be prepared to feel the contours of the earth.Next, feature scarcity. The bike rides nicely enough, but it’s missing a few small things. Fenders would be a great addition for rainy areas, and I’d love to see an included rack to turn this bike into more of a utility e-bike. And built-in lights that run off the battery are always appreciated. The last thing I want to be doing is recharging a separate head and tail light or juggling a fistful of AAA batteries.I must say that I LOVE the fat 20″ tire format — it gives wide tires that aren’t too tall and thus don’t take up as much of the bike’s space. And they leave room for a lower rear rack and a more stable cargo role. So I’d also love to slap a rack on the Pedego Element and see it fulfills yet another role as a little pack mule. It’s a shame it doesn’t come with one, but alas, that’s another accessory one can add.And I’m sure you could customize this e-bike into exactly what you want. There are mounting points for racks and fenders. And you could buy a couple of cheap lights to outfit the bike. There’s room for additions and that even gives you more control over your component selection. But I still prefer to see an e-bike company include these types of components in the price so you don’t have to start shopping around to fully outfit a bike. But at this point, I’m pretty much just searching for anything to complain about so this doesn’t look like a paid review (as a reminder, we don’t do paid reviews here at Electrek). Ultimately, I really do love the Pedego Element and I see it as a high-value e-bike that could make a great first e-bike for newcomers to the sport.“Value” is a good way to put it. The Pedego Element provides good value. Not just in the bike itself, but also in the support you get with it.If you scroll down to the comment section below, you’ll surely find plenty of readers telling me there are better values out there. I’ll eat my hat if there aren’t at least 2-3 comments in the first few hours about the $899 Lectric XP e-bike, which shares many physical characteristics with the Pedego Element.But with the Element, you don’t just get some pretty decent components like Microshift transmission, 1,000W peak motor and “premium” battery cells (whatever those are), you also get Pedego’s vast national dealer network. Unlike direct to consumer e-bike companies, you can actually find a Pedego dealer nearby and test the bike yourself. Or you could just take my word and order one online. The options are there.And if you ever have an issue, you don’t have to wait weeks to send a bike back to a company and receive it in return or be stuck doing a repair yourself when they mail you a replacement part. Pedego shops have their own in-house service centers, which is so much nicer than waiting for repairs from across the country.So while the Pedego Element certainly makes compromises, you still get a lot of value for this $1,495 e-bike.Not bad at all!",ebikes
2020/10/23,"New York-based Wing Bikes has launched the Freedom X, an update to the company’s e-bike lineup that offers fancy e-bike styling at non-fancy prices.Starting at $1,248 (with the promo code TAKE200), the new Wing Freedom X e-bike retains a similar frame style to the previous generation with an over-length top tube that extends fore and aft of the main triangle.The top tube embeds the head and tail light directly into the frame. Something that is becoming a trend. In addition to the interesting frame design, the 20 mph (32 km/h) bike now comes with extra features like an integrated torque sensor to provide smoother pedal assist as well as a display built right into the handle bar stem.The battery has also been swapped from a frame-mounted to a frame-integrated battery, hiding away the bulky power pack. Between the integrated battery and display, the Wing Freedom X almost looks like a standard bicycle instead of an e-bike. The only major clue to the bike’s assisted nature is the 550W Bafang hub motor in the rear wheel.A throttle is an optional accessory, converting the bike from a Class 1 to a Class 2 e-bike in the US.If you’re thinking this frame design looks familiar, you’re right. We’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that Wing’s bikes are something of a bike-alike to VanMoof’s pricier European e-bikes.And while Wing likely can’t compete with VanMoof’s quality or components, they still offer some decent specs, and at a much lower price.The Wing Freedom X include a built-in security system to keep someone from walking away with the relatively lightweight 39 lb (17.7 kg e-bike).They also offer three different battery capacities that allow users to choose how much range they need. Options include a 317 Wh, 375 Wh, and 504 Wh battery with range estimates of 35, 45, and 60 miles (56, 72, and 96 km) on pedal assist, or closer to half those numbers using the bike’s “turbo boost” throttle.While Wing Bikes offers direct-to-consumer sales via their website, they also have a brick-and-mortar store in NYC where they offer test rides, and they have established relationships with third-party service providers around the US for riders in need. In addition to the $1,248 Wing Freedom X, Wing also offers the Freedom 2 that starts at a lower $998 with the TAKE200 promo. It uses a similar frame but lacks the torque sensor and embedded stem display.For shorter riders, Wing offers the Freedom S2 as well as the Freedom Fatty 2 — a fat tire version of the Freedom S2.We reviewed the previous version of the Wing Freedom last year and enjoyed our time on the bike.

2020/10/21,"Gazelle is one of the major players in the Dutch e-bike market, building comfortable city bikes with electric assist. Now the company is adding two new models to its Ultimate line for the North American market, the Gazelle Ultimate C8 and Ultimate C380.Gazelle’s bikes aren’t just Dutch-style, they’re actually Dutch bikes, as in they’re built in the company’s factory in Dieren, the Netherlands.And with a 10-year frame warranty and an excellent reputation for quality, Gazelle has earned its street cred for building bomber electric Dutch bikes, even if they come with prices fairly north of today’s leading budget brands.The first new model introduced by Gazelle to the North American market is the Ultimate C8. The bike features a step-through Dutch-style frame that offers a comfortable, upright seating position. The fork has built-in headset suspension. Gazelle calls the bike “full-suspension,” though I’m not sure if the inclusion of seat post suspension necessarily fulfills that designation. Either way, the hardtail frame won’t transfer the entirety of the road’s surface through the saddle and into the rider, thanks to that suspended seat post.The Ultimate C8 also marks Gazelle’s first belt drive offering in this market. The Ultimate C8 features a Gates belt drive system that feeds a Shimano Nexus 8-speed internally geared rear hub.As Gazelle North America General Manager Ewoud van Leeuwen explained in a statement provided to Electrek:We are thrilled to introduce our first belt drive models to the North American market; from the ease of shifting to the low-maintenance benefits of this system, we know our customers will be delighted. Combined with outstanding feature sets on the award-winning Ultimate frame design, these bikes are exceptional additions to our lineup and set the stage to continue building on our 2020 brand and sales successes.Powering that belt drive is a Bosch Active Line Plus mid-drive motor with 50 Nm of torque and a Bosch Powertube 500 Wh battery pack. As a Class 1 e-bike in the US, the Ultimate C8 doesn’t feature a throttle but can reach top speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) under pedal assist. Higher speeds are possible, but require the rider to provide 100% of the effort once the motor cuts out at its speed limit.Gazelle offers a maximum range rating of 70 miles (112 km) for the Ultimate C8 in Eco mode, though says that Turbo mode is likely to offer closer to 30 miles (48 km) of range.Other components include two-piston hydraulic disc brakes, Schwalbe Energizer Plus tires, included rack and fenders, handlebar mounted front and rear LED lights and an Amsterdam lock on the rear wheel.The Gazelle Ultimate C8 is available in three frame sizes and two colors, and the largest two sizes have compatibility for a dual battery setup. The bike’s MSRP starts at S$3,499.The second model introduced to the North American market today is the Ultimate C380.It is built on the same frame as the Ultimate C8 but swaps that Shimano 8-speed rear hub for an Enviolo continuously variable transmission with stepless gear range of 380%. I currently run this hub with a similar Gates belt drive setup on my own Priority Current e-bike, and it is an absolute pleasure to use. I can always choose the exact gear ratio I need and can easily shift at stops, which is great since I’m always forgetting to downshift.The Ultimate C380 also upgrades the motor to the Bosch Performance Line with 65 Nm of torque. That will give better hill climbing power, but drops the range slightly in Turbo mode from 30 miles to 25 miles (48 km to 40 km). Eco mode will still net you the same 70 miles (112 km) of range, according to Gazelle.That nicer hub and more powerful motor will cost you though, increasing the starting MSRP to $3,999.Gazelle expects the new models to begin shipping to North American dealers next month.What do you think of the upcoming Gazelle Ultimate C8 and Ultimate C380?

2020/10/20,"The London-based electric bicycle company Gocycle is famous for its highly engineered folding electric bicycles. And now the futuristic brand is showing off its latest high-tech folder, the Gocycle G3+.Like Gocycle’s other folding e-bikes, the Gocycle G3+ uses its own uniquely designed magnesium folding frame with custom single-side supported carbon fiber wheels.The eye-catching frame helps reduce the weight of the G3+ to just 15.5 kg (34 lb) and also allows the bike to provide rear suspension via the rear swingarm.A new 375 Wh battery increases the G3+’s range to 50 miles (80 km), which works out to an efficiency of 7.5 Wh/mi (4.7 Wh/km). That’s doable, but requires the rider to perform a pretty hefty amount of the pedaling him or herself, relying on lower assist from the motor. Riders who use the bike’s higher power assist levels will likely achieve somewhat lower range figures.We tested the company’s latest Gocycle GX e-bike recently and found the bike to be highly efficient, meaning its range estimates are quite close to reality.The bike’s 500W motor (250W in the EU) is nearly invisible, hidden away in the front wheel’s hub. That motor powers the bike up to 20 mph (32 km/h).The Gocycle G3+ also takes a number of cues from automotive design, as the company explained:The G3+ comes with a bespoke cockpit on the handlebar, presenting all the information a rider needs on a streamlined, F1 inspired LED dash that displays battery level, driving mode, speed and gear position. It also features Gocycle’s predictive electronic gear shift which automatically downshifts through the gears when slowing down ensuring that the rider is never in the wrong gear, especially when the lights go green.Another automotive-inspired feature is Gocycle’s patented Daytime Running Light (DRL). The DRL employs Gocycle’s unique proprietary light pipe design and technology which enhances the safety of riders by ensuring you can be seen from further away.Using a clever design, the proprietary PitStopWheels are quickly detachable, further reducing the weight of the bike and making it possible to do odd things like carrying the frame over your shoulder, as seen below.The bike also feature’s Gocycle’s patented Cleandrive system that completely seals away the drivetrain including roller chain, sprocket, and chainring. That removes any chance of getting oil or grease on your nice white sailing pants.The limited edition Gocycle G3+ will be available in all new colors including red, green, and yellow, in addition to the company’s standard white, black and gunmetal gray.And when Gocycle calls the G3+ “limited,” they mean it. Only 300 of the bikes will be sold worldwide.Gocycle’s founder and designer Richard Thorpe explained in a statement provided to Electrek:The G3+ is a truly unique proposition that celebrates the best of Gocycle’s no compromises design ethos and rider-focused technologies. Owners will get the iconic, clean, Gocycle look but with more versatility than ever, owing to the inclusion of our award-winning fast-folding handlebar and pedals. The ultra-lightweight carbon variant of our world speed record PitstopWheels® ensures the G3+ has industry-leading dynamics, promising an exhilarating and engaging ride for owners.Included in that promise of no-compromises is a no-compromise price of £3,999/€4,499/US$4,999. Pricey for an e-bike, but then again Gocycle has always operated in its own price class.With a unique design, patented systems, and high quality components, the Gocycle G3+ is not aiming for mass market adoption like the $995 e-bikes from value-oriented e-bike companies. Instead, Gocycle has always focused on the higher end of the spectrum, targeting customers looking for high-tech and high-quality folding e-bikes that are designed to last for years and years with little to no maintenance. It’s a different category, but it certainly seems to be working for the company, which has seen its sales skyrocket this year along with much of the e-bike industry.What do you think of the new Gocycle G3+ electric bike? Let us know in the comment section below! And before you go, check out our review video below from last month when we tested the G3+’s sister bike, the Gocycle GX.",ebikes
2020/10/19,"I recently had the chance to put some miles on a Himiway Cruiser electric bicycle. With front suspension, big tires, a 750W motor, and battery for days, the bike turned out to be quite a ride and performed better than I expected!As someone whose job is pretty much to ride e-bikes, I’ve gotten quite good at guessing what question I’m about to get when someone rolls down their window or shouts to me from the curb.Nine out of ten times it’s either going to be “How fast does that thing go?”, “How far does it go?”, or “How much?”And usually in that order.Usually, I can impress my admirer with the first two answers, though the third is often like letting the air out of a balloon. With the Himiway Cruiser electric bicycle though, this bike seems to nail all three quite nicely. A 28 mph (45 km/h) e-bike that can get 35-60 miles (55-96 km) of range for just $1,399 — not bad!Check out my video review of the Himiway Cruiser electric bicycle below!Let’s start with the good.First of all, the bike has great specs. Even though it comes with a top speed of around 22 or 23 mph (36 km/h) out of the box, you can go into the settings and increase the speed limit.That allowed me to get it up to around 28 mph (45 km/h) with a full battery, though the top speed drops lower when the battery is at a lower charge. That’s pretty standard for electric bicycles in unlimited mode, as an electric motor’s speed is voltage-dependent.The bike also has quite a long range. With a 48 V and 17.5 Ah battery comprising 840 Wh, the 35-60 miles (55-96 km) range rating is actually realistic. At 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle only, the lower end of that range window is absolutely achievable. And with moderate pedal assist, 60 miles (96 km) from an 840 Wh battery is also quite reasonable. Of course, if you modify the speed limit and ride at top speed all the time, don’t expect to get the same range. I also like the rear rack, which I believe is bamboo. It straight up looks like my Ikea cutting board, in a good way. The wood deck of the rack means you don’t get that nice spring clip that some e-bikes carry, but you do get a couple of rails under the deck that you could conceivably connect a pair of $5 bungee cords to and be all set.You also get fenders, which for the bike’s $1,399 price isn’t always a given. Plenty of e-bikes above this price still charge extra for fenders.Ok, so what about the bad?For starters, this isn’t really a cruiser. It’s a fat tire bike. It’s basically a RadRover knock-off. So don’t expect it to ride like a cruiser. It’s still somewhat upright, but this ain’t no beach cruiser.Next, while there’s front suspension, there’s no rear suspension and thus the off-road ride quality totally depends on your air pressure. I like to let some air out of those big tires when I’m riding on grass or trails, which gives me a nicer ride. But then when I get back on the street, my handling suffers and I feel sluggish and unresponsive in the turns with lower air pressure. There’s a happy balance in there somewhere perhaps, if you can find it.Also, I was never really sure if I mounted the tail light correctly. It doesn’t come connected, so you have to snake the wire back there and screw it in yourself. There were more holes than screws and no instructions, so I just screwed away and the light seemed to stay there, so that was a good sign. But then there’s a good 12 inches of extra wire that you don’t need, and which could dangle down onto the rear fender, so I just wrapped it around itself and applied a liberal amount of zip ties to hide the ugly little rat’s nest.It was fine in the end, but it didn’t feel like as nice of a solution as I would expect. It felt more like I was assembling one of my DIY e-bikes, not spending a good number of Benjamins on a retail e-bike that should have things like wire lengths figured out. Or that should even do me a solid and screw on the tail light for me like every other e-bike. I get that headlights are normally a DIY job since they sit further forward and don’t have the front wheel installed to protect them in the shipping box. But the tail light? C’mon, guys.While I still have my nitpicks about the Himiway Cruiser, ultimately it feels like a solid deal to me.It’s a fast and fun e-bike. It’s got that nice big battery. It doesn’t break the bank at $1,399 (Update: has since changed to $1,599, but the price seems to be in flux). It has decent level components like Tektro disc brakes and Shimano 7-speed transmission. You even get full metal pedals instead of dinky plastic pedals, which sometimes come at this price point. And the bike generally feels well put together.I don’t expect to get the same level of support as going with a giant company like Rad Power Bikes but that’s part of why you can save money on an e-bike like this while getting more speed and power than the competition.Everything in life is a series of tradeoffs. And the Himiway Cruiser is no exception. But the tradeoffs seem reasonable in exchange for the performance boost and pretty-darn-good feel of the bike. So I chalk it up in the win category.",ebikes
2020/10/18,"Want to charge your electric bicycle or e-scooter for free, using solar power? The startup Swiftmile is making that happen with hundreds of new charging stations in the US and Europe.But the idea for these free charging stations didn’t happen overnight. Swiftmile’s founder Colin Roche first got into electric bikes after winning a free Pedego e-bike in a raffle several years ago.The new e-bike helped Roche return to cycling after a knee injury had sidelined him years before, as he explained to Bicycle Retailer:“I considered myself a cyclist up until I was about 35, which is when I developed severe arthritis in my knee due to years of playing soccer. That is why this was such a fortuitous event for me; it literally got me back into biking with the aid of a pedal-assist bike and opened my eyes to what a game-changer they can be to getting back into biking.”After discovering the joys of e-biking, he began thinking about charging needs and the lack of public charging infrastructure for e-bikes. That led Roche down a rabbit hole that eventually culminated in him founding Swiftmile.Swiftmile builds solar-powered charging stations that riders can use for free to charge their electric bicycles and scooters. The charging stations are also built locally in the US.The startup uses a few different business models to make the concept work.Public charging stations are open to all users, free of charge, with the company earning revenue from digital advertising billboards on the station. Cities can have them installed for free and only need to provide the infrastructure access; Swiftmile handles the rest. US cities currently operating Swiftmile’s charging stations include Austin, Phoenix, San Francisco, Tampa, and Washington D.C.E-bike or scooter companies can also purchase charging stations, and then those stations would charge only that company’s models of vehicles.The goal was to make sustainable charging a win-win, as Roche explained:“Our program with cities does not require them to pay anything. We just need access to a power source and a good location for us to place the system with our digital screen. That was a key piece to making this a win, win, win for everyone. The cities get it for free, the ads pay for the system, and riders get to use it for free.”In July, Swiftmile raised US$5M from investors, which added to the company’s previous US$6M in funding.That funding will help the company grow, adding to the 200 charging stations already operated by Swiftmile. As Roche expanded:“It’s really to execute on our pipeline and scale our mobility hubs around the world. We are at the beginning stages of a revolution in e-bikes, scooters, trikes, etc. We hope to become the gas station of the future to help build an ecosystem for these to flourish.”What do you think? Can Swiftmile become the gas station model for e-bike and e-scooter charging? Will delivery riders and commuters be stopping off for a quick charge on their way?

2020/10/15,"World-renowned mountain bike builder Tony Ellsworth, of Ellsworth Bikes fame, is back with a brand new electric bicycle brand known as The Ride Bikes. And its first model eye-catching model, the Radiant Carbon, just launched today.The Radiant Carbon is a commuting and cruising-oriented e-bike that comes with a slew of fancy features on top of an out-of-the-box carbon fiber frame design.Tony has spent decades building high-end mountain bikes for top riders. He recently set his sights on building an electric bike brand based on top-shelf local manufacturing and high-end components.As Tony explained:“I have a real desire to pack all of the quality and all of the features that I personally would want, that would deliver to my expectations in every bike I design. And after doing it for 30 years I’m pretty in touch with the quality pieces and all of the quality features that could go into a bike model.”The Radiant Carbon features a unique carbon fiber frame design with a single support fork and a single asymmetric chain stay and seat stay at the rear. But you won’t find an old-fashioned chain cranking past that chain stay. Instead, the Radiant Carbon uses a Gates Carbon Drive belt system rated for an incredible 50,000 miles (80,000 km) of use.The belt-drive links a 500 W and 60 Nm Shimano mid-drive motor to a NuVinci optimized Enviolo continuously variable transmission in the rear hub. The use of an internally geared hub means no hanging derailleur and no noise, which also compliments the silent belt-drive. As a Class 1 e-bike system, that Shimano drive will power the bike up to 20 mph (32 km/h) on pedal assist, but does not have a throttle.Powering the motor is a 630 Wh battery that is entirely hidden in the frame and achieves a claimed 100 miles (160 km) of range.I tested a similar Shimano setup and found that with moderate pedal assist, such ranges were achievable, though required self-discipline to not rely too heavily on the pedal assist. Other high-end components include four-piston Magura hydraulic disc brakes, front and rear LED lighting integrated directly into the bike’s frame, Schwalbe Super Moto 27.5 tires, and Bluetooth connectivity.Only 360 of the bikes will be produced, which of course doesn’t do the price tag any favors. To get your own Radiant Carbon, you’ll need to fork over $4,995. While that fits with other carbon fiber e-bike prices we’ve seen recently, it still doesn’t take the sting out of it. But Tony wasn’t trying to build an affordable bike, he was trying to build a top-of-the-line bike, as he explained:“Any time you get in a space where there’s a lot of product flooding that space because of the popularity of it, you get a lowest cost offering to get more people to adopt it. Which is great, because more people adopting e-bikes is wonderful in a million different ways and we could have a wonderful dinner conversation about it. The problem is that in that space, it becomes a little bit of a race to the bottom, of ‘How cheap can we make it?’ And while I agree that it’s nice to be able to have people get in at a lower cost, there’s no substitute for quality in any space where there are products, when you look around at automobiles, at cameras, at cell phones, there’s always a premium product in the space. And the Radiant Carbon from The Ride Bikes, my new e-bike brand, is the top of that space.”What do you think? Could you see yourself riding a Radiant Carbon along the beach in your town? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/10/14,"If you’re an electric moped fan, there’s never been a better time to be alive. Not only have we seen 2020 turn into the year of the electric moped, but today we’re adding one more interesting model to the list. Monday Motorbikes has just unveiled their new Presidio electric moped.Monday Motorbikes has been in the electric moped scene longer than just about any other company.Since 2015, they’ve been building electric mopeds that combine retro styling with 21st-century technology.Now their latest creation, the Monday Motorbikes Presidio, is ready to roll out.The electric moped is named after Presidio Park in San Francisco, where the company ran their first demos and received their first-ever customer feedback.As cofounder Josh Rasmussen explained:Presidio Park is commonly referred to as ‘The Presidio’ and is where we met most of our early adopters testing our bikes on the gnarly hills of the area. Similar to Anza, we wanted to pay respect to our early fans that we met. We were still in the garage at the time just doing demo rides in the park. We have come a long way since then but we would not have been able to get to the level we are today without meeting those first customers at The Presidio.The Presidio’s specs are similar to those of the Anza electric moped, which was also revealed by Monday Motorbikes early last month.The Presidio is available in either a 500W or a 750W format. The lower power model can reach speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h), making it a Class 2 e-bike. The higher power model can hit speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h), which are Class 3 e-bike speeds.Both models include pedal assist as well as throttle operation, with a maximum range of up to 40 miles (64 km).Unlike the Monday Motorbikes Anza, which followed the lines of traditional “top tank” mopeds of the 1970s and ’80s, the Presidio features a step-through frame similar to a number of famous mopeds of the same era.The bike features dual rear coilover shocks and a dual crown fork.The frame is also an interesting wishbone design, which is more commonly seen on motorcycles and rarely makes its way onto electric bicycles.The Presidio also sports mechanical disc brakes, built-in LED lighting, and a bench seat that looks long enough for two riders.Pricing starts at $1,999, which makes the Presidio one of the more affordable electric mopeds out there.Other companies with retro-styled electric bikes have offered impressive full-suspension models but at much higher price points.Other electric mopeds have pushed speeds up to 60 mph (100 km/h), again pushing the prices relatively high.But the Monday Motorbikes Presidio seems to strike a balance in performance and price. The components seem defiintely middle of the road, which helps prevent the price from creeping up too high.And with multiple models ranging from $1,499 to $4,500, Monday Motorbikes has now expanded their lineup to offer electric mopeds for a wide range of riders and budgets.",ebikes
2020/10/14,"Tern specializes in folding bicycles, both electric and non-electric, but they fancy themself a transportation company. For those of you undergoing car replacement therapy, the GSD is one of, if not the best, compact cargo bikes on the market today. Every inch of the bike is covered in useful features, coming together in a dense product that continues to impress with each mile.The GSD is designed for dense urban use, where storage space is a bit tight, and Tern has designed a brilliantly simple solution to this problem. In my case, I used the GSD primarily in the suburbs, where I was able to flex the battery range a bit more. I had a blast taking the kids around, running extra errands, and lowing my environmental impact, and saving some money along the way. I even took it off-road for a bit.Attempting to maneuver around tight cornering was quite entertaining. The rear of the bike is intentionally made to hoist up on its rear to allow for access in elevators, and to store neatly upright in an apartment or office. It makes for compelling pictures too:A couple of years ago, Tern came out with the mighty GSD. This bike was so influential that several bike companies blatantly copied them, enough that it could be said that the GSD started its own genre. I rode the original one some time ago, and I was impressed by the build, but left waiting for accessories that took a bit of time to be released. This time around, the bike-specific gear is totally worth it for cargo capacity, and I’m really glad to see Tern taking the bike into the next decade with improved strength, additional features, and the latest and greatest Bosch motor.One of the most exclusive improvements, is that the Tern GSD (and HSD model) are the first electric bikes to pass the new strength standard established in Germany. The tests are designed to push bikes past their load ratings in a number of ways to ensure that they can withstand peak loads beyond their rated maximums. And, they passed with flying colors.The GSD now uses the new generation of Bosch motors, specifically the Cargo line. This motor is a dream, it provides even and stable power whether under a heavy load or riding all alone. Like all Bosch motors, the pedal assist is smooth and gutsy, all the way to 20mph. The bike comes equipped with hardware to house two batteries, but you’ve got to buy that upgrade on your own. The display doesn’t give you a lot of detail, but the main functions are nice and tight in a small package. If you’re comparing this to other cargo bikes, you should know that since the GSD is using a Bosch motor, you’re trading name-brand durability, in-store support and continuous software updates, in exchange for not having a throttle.The GSD rides very comfortably, despite the odd shape. It kind of looks like the rider is on stilts, but it keeps the center of gravity low which makes a big difference cornering and with overall balance. Speaking of balance, this bike is awesome for towing kids! I’ve been using the bike with the clubhouse rails, which has been really fun and exciting for the kids, and leaves me not worrying. Depending on your needs, these can accessories can add a ton of value to your quality of life on the bike.The starting S10 Model has a $4,599 MSRP, and the options can take you up to the 1000W R14 model, which is $8,399. The exact model in this video is the GSD S10LX, with just the 500Wh battery, kid rails, and a set of tow bags to boot. As it stands, the equipment in this review costs $5,489. Oh, and I used an Ikea box to fit in the rails.My family and I really enjoyed our time using the bike instead of a car. Rather than being stuck in traffic, we had quality time together; which made all the difference in the rest of our day. The extra capacity was quite invigorating since we didn’t have to fear a surprise pick-up or Costco run. For the admittedly high price, you can get a lot of use out of the GSD. If this bike was in your garage, I’m confident it would be your daily driver.The GSD is another interesting and intensely practical look at what an electric bike can accomplish. The days of using bikes exclusively for recreation are over. The advent of electric bikes has opened a wide variety of uses, and the GSD is the king of the hill. Unless you’re looking for a special use bike like a pedal taxi or something, within the typical cargo bike space, the GSD is the flag runner. Directly pragmatic features, packed into a Swiss Army Knife frame, and customizable for your needs, with quality always top-notch. This is the cargo bike to beat.",ebikes
2020/10/12,"As electric bicycles become increasingly prevalent, innovation in the industry has led to a slew of new designs and tech. Interestingly, much of that technology has been co-opted into new forms of personal electric vehicles that are e-bike-like but not quite electric bicycles.Here are some of the most interesting examples we’ve seen this year.The A-Ride is produced from scratch by the British Columbia, Canada-based company Alpine Riding.It may look like an electric bicycle from some angles, but it’s actually a scooter due to its lack of pedals.This isn’t your grandkid’s scooter, though. It is designed for mountain-bike style riding thanks to its dual suspension frame and fat tires. Together, those features allow it to tackle terrain that no other scooter could dream of.The 1,000 W motor means it can absolutely rip across trails at speeds of up to 35 mph (56 km). And the large 1,000 Wh battery gives it an impressive range of 50 miles (80 km). Not too shabby!Technically speaking, the Segway C80 electric moped is an e-bike. At least it can be legally classified as one since it travels at Class 2 e-bike speeds (20 mph or 32 km/h) and has functional pedals.But it actually features a moped-style frame and even has floorboards so the rider doesn’t have to rest his or her feet on the pedals.Another advantage it has over electric bicycles is that it is filled with high-tech features like built-in GPS tracking for anti-theft, keyless operation with two included NFC cards and proximity unlocking via your smartphone. It also has a seat sensor that can engage the rear wheel lock a few seconds after you dismount, further reducing the chance of theft.At $1,899, it is one of the more expensive options on the list. But it also offers a lot of features that you won’t find on most other personal electric vehicles.What happens when you combine a powerful electric bicycle motor with a tractor-style yoke? Apparently you get the Veelo, which is a clever way to electrify your inline skating adventures.This one kind of blew my mind when it first popped into my inbox.The company claims the device can pull you up to 20 mph (32 km/h) and even has the potential to be unlocked to go even faster on private roads.It sounds fairly easy to learn to use as well, as inventor Dr. Brice Jamieson explained in an email to Electrek:“We’ve been testing with a range of wheeled equipment and riders, and so far nobody’s taken more than about 30 seconds to pick it up and get comfortable.”The JackRabbit 2.0 was released earlier this year. Despite its debatably odd appearance, it seems to have some interesting advantages.It combines many aspects of e-bikes with the pedal-less format of a scooter. The large wheels help it easily roll over bumps and pot holes, while the short wheelbase keeps it nice and nimble.Plus, the JackRabbit 2.0 only weighs 23 lb (10.4 kg), which is pretty impressive considering it can keep up with normal e-bikes at speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h).The JackRabbit 2.0 debuted at an impressive $499, though the eventual MSRP is $999.One of the most common complaints about typical electric scooters is that the wheels look dangerously small. In practice, they usually work just fine on decently smooth roads.However, Razor decided to go the extra mile and add big wheels to help ease any concerns. And it just so happens that the big wheels can help improve the ride quality as well.The Razor EcoSmart SUP electric scooter features 16″ wheels and an electric bicycle style motor in the rear wheel mounted in a mag-style rim.The tires are even inflatable, which hasn’t always been a given on electric scooters in the past.With a top speed of 15.5 mph (25 km/h), the Razor EcoSmart SUP electric scooters aren’t as fast as most US e-bikes, but they still bridge the gap nicely by incorporating more e-bike parts than traditional electric scooters.Believe it or not, this adult electric go-kart actually hails from the world of micromobility as well. It is powered by a Ninebot self-balancing electric scooter that is cleverly hidden in the rear of the go-kart.It features two motors with a combined 4.8 kW of power and can hit speeds of up to 23 mph (37 km/h). That might not feel too fast on your local roads, but it is plenty fast for drifting around twisty karting tracks. And Ninebot claims that those powerful motors get up to speed quickly, resulting in a forward acceleration of over 1g.With a rider height range of 4’5″ to 6’3″ (134 cm to 190.5 cm), this is finally a ride that kids (or teenagers) and adults can both enjoy.The price of $1,499 might sound steep at first, but keep in mind that you’re also getting a self-balancing scooter as well, if you want to disconnect it from the go-kart.This one might be the farthest on the list from “normal” micromobility devices, but it was a pretty impressive demonstration of personal electric vehicle engineering. And so we’ll include it on the list anyways.Developed by a team of engineering students at Duke University, the wheel is known as the EV360.It is powered by a motor rated for 11 kW (14.75 hp) continuous and 23 kW (31 hp) peak. With more power than many light electric motorcycles, the EV360 is designed to hit speeds over 70 mph (112 km/h).The team is hoping that will be fast enough to set a new world record for fastest monowheel.Because the EV360 was built for speed and for distance, it sports a rather small 72V 22Ah lithium polymer battery with 1.58 kWh of capacity. The team estimates that the battery should be sufficient for around 9 miles (14.5 km) of range when riding at 20 mph (32 km/h).But the goal is to go fast and not far, and that’s what the team is attempting to do — as soon as they can work out how to control the wheel.Check out the video below, where you’ll see that steering the wheel is a lot harder than it sounds.",ebikes
2020/10/09,"The Screecher is the latest four-wheeled electric bike car to reach production. But unlike the others, this one comes with some interesting features we haven’t seen before.Developed by the Portsmouth, New Hampshire-based startup SUNOX, the Screecher is a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) with a few twists.It combines e-bike technology with pedal car construction. The Screecher is powered by a pair of e-bike motors in the rear wheels. Each is rated for 350W of continuous power or 500W peak. But it also has standard bicycle pedals connected to a very non-standard front-wheel-drive system. A belt drive transfers pedal power to the dual front wheels, giving the Screecher the ability to operate in all-wheel-drive mode. That also simplifies power delivery by removing a long chain running to the rear of the Screecher. It also means the hydraulic disc brakes can be used in the front, while regenerative braking can be employed in the rear.There’s apparently also some form of “unique central suspension under the rider’s seat that enables lateral stability while lending a soft ride.” And the removable battery is sufficient for up to 20 miles (32 km) of throttle-only range, or closer to 35 miles (56 km) with pedal assist.If you’re worried about working up a sweat while pedaling this thing, consider that you’ve not only got a sun canopy above your head, but the canopy is also a solar panel used to trickle charge the battery. A second solar panel can be added over the rear cargo trunk to increase charging speed.SUNOX says the pedal car can recharge in four hours from a wall plug or six hours from a solar charge. That sounds rather fast to us, but it may be helped by the fact that the 618 Wh battery isn’t actually that large.Either way you slice it, filling up your electric pedal car with photons is surely cheaper than filling your gas tank, not to mention the obvious environmental benefits, as SUNOX chief operating officer Michele M. Schnitzel explained:We believe the Screecher solves the global need for carbon-neutral solutions, specifically an environmentally friendly transportation vehicle, that not only puts the buyer at the forefront of renewable energy transportation technology, but saves them money too.The top speed of 15 mph (25 km/h) isn’t fast, but I imagine you don’t want to corner this thing at 25 mph, either. And this obviously isn’t a middle-of-the-lane type of vehicle, at least not on standard suburban roads.When it comes to utility, the Screecher offers a tow hook for pulling a trailer, and is even foldable for transporting within another vehicle.SUNOX has started low-volume production of the Screecher and has already shipped units to customers around the world. Priced at $4,495, it comes in at around half of what other popular electric pedal-cars cost.Here’s what I like about the Screecher: It doesn’t try to be something its not. It doesn’t opt for fancy body panels or try to be the Ferrari of electric pedal cars.Rather, it looks like something my friends and I would have built in engineering school. Which I love. They don’t try to make it look too polished; they just make it work.And the biggest benefit is that it doesn’t send the price sky-high by trying to do too much. Other electric pedal cars like the PEBL have prices approaching five figures, which puts them far out of reach of ordinary Americans.But for the price of a nice electric bicycle, the Screecher could actually be a fun and utilitarian vehicle for many communities. This is obviously very location-dependent, but I can see many locales that would be perfect for a Screecher. Everything from picking up the kids from school to grabbing a load of groceries would certainly be more fun like this!",ebikes
2020/10/08,"The Juiced HyperScorpion is an electric bicycle… errr, electric moped, that completely embraces the growing trend of high powered electric bikes that blur the line with electric motorbikes.Yes, it’s still an electric bicycle. It’s got two wheels, pedals, a chain, and can be pedaled all day to your heart’s content.But it also offers a whole other level of fun and utility as an electric moped that actually deserves its place on the road with every other vehicle.And therein lies the interesting duality of the Juiced HyperScorpion. It’s an electric bicycle and an electric motorbike all in one.And that, my friends, is what makes it such a potent little EV for everyone from thrill riders to daily commuters.What really sets the Juiced HyperScorpion apart is just how extra the bike is. Everything is just so much more than you’d get on any typical e-bike. The battery is gigantic at 1kWh and offers more range than most people need (up to 70 miles or 112 km under “ideal” conditions). The motor is incredibly powerful, with a 1,000W continuous rating and likely north of 1,500 peak watts. You get over 30 mph (48 km/h) of speed. You get turn signals and mirrors and those super grippy street tires.Everything about the HyperScorpion just puts it in a different class, a moped class. There’s even a lighted license plate holder, meaning you could presumably go down the route of trying to register it as a moped (which opens up a quagmire of varying state laws and regulations, so we’ll let you tackle that on your own. If you are curious, there is no VIN number but there is a frame number).But the fact that you can limit the bike down to Class 2 and Class 3 speeds means that it is ultimately still an e-bike at heart and by design, thus making it more approachable to more people. It is when you unleash the power of this beast that it comes alive and gives you all those extra watts and bursts of speed.The Juiced HyperScorpion actually feels quite lighter and nimbler than its 102 lb (46 kg) curb weight might imply.With front and rear suspension, sticky street tires, and a bench seat that actually feels comfortable to both sit on and pedal on, the bike is obviously well designed for proper riding — not just for looking badass. Which it also does.It even features a true torque sensor to enable comfortable and tuned pedal assist that isn’t jerky or over the top.The only time things get jerky is when you delimit the Juiced HyperScorpion by putting it in Race Mode. At that point, you’ve got so much power on tap that you need to be careful with the throttle. That power does not ease on — it dumps all at once if you ask for it. That makes your wrist the limiter (as it should be) and also means new riders might want to practice a bit in the lower modes before exploring Race Mode and learning to feather the throttle.The light package and mirrors on the HyperScorpion do two things. First of all, they give me a better sense of the road and my surroundings. Secondly, they let other drivers know I’m not just a toy bike on the side of the road — I’m a vehicle.The Juiced HyperScorpion gives off a very different vibe, from what I’ve noticed so far. On a typical bike, drivers pay me no heed and fly by me with reckless abandon as if I’m encroaching upon “their” roads.But with the Juiced HyperScorpion, it has enough of a presence that cars seem to give me more respect and space.Maybe it’s the bunny ear mirrors. Maybe it’s the fact that I can keep up with the speed of traffic in most places. Maybe it’s a combination of factors. Either way, all I know is I feel safer when cars see me as a legitimate road user and not a “cyclist” that gets in their way (their hypothetical words, not mine).Plus, when I’m traveling at the higher end of the Juiced HyperScorpion’s speed range, having a bright headlight and mirrors for situational awareness are key safety features that most bicycles simply lack. I don’t always want to have to turn my head to check my six. And I want to see if there’s an obstacle coming up on me at night before it’s right under my tires. The Juiced HyperScorpion does that for me, plain and simple.Yes, as you can tell I’m a big fan of the HyperScorpion. But as usual, no e-bike is perfect, and the HyperScorpion does some slight sinning as well.While the heavy weight of the bike isn’t as noticeable while riding, it’s still a behemoth. Don’t expect to lift it into a truck bed or onto a rear auto rack by yourself, unless you’re regularly snatching several plates at the gym. Rolling it around in the garage is fine, but this ain’t an easy lifter, that’s for sure!And the brakes are good but not blow-you-away good. Maybe I’m just spoiled by my Magura MT5E four-piston hydraulic disc brakes on other e-bikes of this power level. The Tektro’s are still good quality two-piston hydraulic disc brakes, but the higher weight of the bike means it might have benefitted from an extra pair of pistons, at least up front where more braking force is actuated.Lastly, depending on where you ride could mean you’re in a bit of a legal grey area. Juiced Bikes is careful about indicating that Race Mode isn’t for public streets. And they’re right since most areas don’t allow e-bikes over Class 3 speeds (28 mph or 45 km/h). But let’s be real, you know you’re going to want to pop it into R mode and let ‘er rip from time to (all the)  time. Just make sure you’re being both safe and responsible about the way you ride the bike at higher speeds. Don’t fly past riders in the bike lane or otherwise put people in jeopardy. The Juiced HyperScorpion offers a level of power and capabilities that most e-bike riders will have never experienced before. Go easy with them.While I’m still able to nitpick here and there about a few parts that I would like to see upgraded, the Juiced HyperScorpion is essentially a win in all areas.It has the speed and power for serious fun, the handling and suspension for a comfortable ride, the battery capacity to ride all day, and is priced within the reasonable reach of riders looking for this type of performance.At its current sale price of $2,799, the bike is by no means cheap. But it isn’t a $4,000 carbon fiber e-bike either. The price feels reasonable to me when you consider what you’re getting here.I’m downright impressed with what Juiced Bikes was able to do with the HyperScorpion, and it’s a testament to just how serious e-bikes have become. This is a true motor vehicle worthy of its place on the road.",ebikes
2020/10/07,"While the COVID-19 pandemic shook the world and the e-bike industry with it, the pandemic also led to a huge surge in electric bicycle sales.Nearly every company that offered electric bicycles soon found themselves with empty shelves and warehouses.Between people being at home with more time on their hands, riders exiting lockdowns and itching to spend more time outdoors, and commuters looking for socially distant ways to get to work while avoiding public transportation, e-bike sales have never been higher.But now that’s created a new problem in the industry: supporting all of those customers.Large e-bike companies who count their customer base in the thousands and tens of thousands were already tasked with managing a carefully orchestrated customer service balance. But now those systems have been pushed past the breaking point as countless new riders receive bike boxes at their doorstep, a small portion of which inevitably come with hidden problems.VanMoof, one of the more visible e-bike companies lately thanks to a large marketing campaign around its recently released S3 and X3 e-bikes, has acutely experienced this phenomenon.VanMoof’s flashy ads across various social media platforms are often followed by a litany of public comments complaining about customer support, or a distinct lack thereof. And while this surely represents just a small portion of its customer base, VanMoof saw sales more than double nearly overnight, meaning even a small number of complaints were bound to increase as well.As co-founder Ties Carlier explained to The Verge,“There’s a lot of frustration, I know. Even if it’s only a few percent of buyers that’s still way too much. We calculated in about 1% – 1 out of 100 bikes within the first week or so would have something important enough for a customer to give us a call. But that turns out to be closer to 10%.Our next frontier is to transform our business by building a full support ecosystem around every rider.”And VanMoof isn’t alone, of course. Everyone has been forced to up their game.Rad Power Bikes, the largest electric bicycle company in the US, began increasing the size of its customer support team once the e-bike buying boom began.Founder Mike Radenbaugh explained in a call with Electrek several months ago in the early days of the pandemic:“We’re already hiring like crazy, our customer support team is up to about 40 or 50 right now, I’m not even sure. It’s hard to keep track. We should be up to around 70 in the next month or so.”The increase in customer service at Rad Power Bikes came at a key time, as the company capitalized on the e-bike boom by launching a popular new $1,099 model known as the RadMission.Other electric bicycle companies found themselves in a similar boat.Lectric Ebikes launched the $899 Lectric XP just over a year ago, which became one of the biggest runaway successes of 2019. During the e-bike buying spree of 2020, Lectric Ebikes released a followup in the form of the Lectric XP Step-Thru.Anticipating the huge increase in customer support needed during the one-two punch of COVID-based buying frenzy and a new product launch, Lectric Bikes began increasing its customer service team. The startup also hired a Director of Operations to bring in outside expertise and experience, helping further improve the company and customer support system in the midst of a massive run on e-bikes across the country.As Co-founder Levi Conlow explained in a call with Electrek:Bringing in our new director of operations has been a huge benefit. She obsesses over performance and details. We first told her about our competitors and how they can have wait times of days for emails and wait times of hours for calls, and how we thought we were doing alright since we had phone wait times of around 20 minutes and maybe up to a day for emails. But she came in and said ‘Nope, that’s not fine by me.’ She wanted those numbers brought down to 97% of phone calls being answered in under one minute and emails being treated more like a customer chat with quick responses. She wanted to make us become the most available electric bike company. And someone with that type of vision, it inspired all of us to get behind it. And now I’m confident in saying we have one of the best if not THE best customer support in the industry now.While direct-to-consumer e-bike companies are hugely popular in the US, ordering an e-bike over the internet isn’t for everyone. Companies with retail presences may have an advantage when it comes to service. Pedego operates a vast network of over 120 retail locations where customers can not only test ride and buy a bike, but return for service as well.In fact, I was just in the Pedego shop in Fort Myers, Florida (below) earlier today test riding the new $1,499 Pedego Element e-bike for an upcoming review, and saw their service center first hand. The ability to service e-bikes on site instead of requiring customers to wait for phone or email support, and then wait longer for a replacement part to be mailed out and replaced by the end user may be attractive enough to win over many new riders.Needless to say, the electric bicycle industry has been put under huge pressure by the skyrocketing demand for e-bikes.It is unavoidable that some customers will unfortunately experience problems, but the industry as a whole appears to be well on its way to improving service across the board.And you can be sure that any company that doesn’t pick up the slack will quickly find themselves shamed in countless social media comments and threads.Now we want to hear from you! Have you had any experiences lately, good or bad, with e-bike company customer service? Let us know in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/10/06,"When I visit China, or really anywhere in Eastern Asia, I’m always amazed at just how prevalent electric bicycles are. E-bike adoption may be on the rise in the US, but it’s simply the standard way to get around in much of Asia. And so I wanted to test how a typical Asian e-bike could perform when taken out of its element and dropped in the West. To do so, I hopped on the newly released F-wheel A5 e-bike.The F-wheel A5 electric bike has all the hallmarks of an e-bike common to eastern Asia. It sports small wheels, a small frame, a giant battery, seating for adults and kids, and is easy to maneuver in and store tight spaces.And while you’re likely to see tons of these types of e-bikes zipping around just about any city in China, it’s a fairly out-of-the-ordinary e-bike in the US. But since F-wheel just launched sales of the bike to the US (and with free shipping, no less!), I figured this was a great time to give the bike a real test.To see the F-wheel A5 e-bike in action, watch my video review below. Then keep reading for all my musings on this electric bike.I should probably clear this up right at the start so that we’re on the same page.Yes, almost every electric bicycle sold in the US is an Asian e-bike. There are VERY few US-built e-bikes, and of course there are a growing number of European-built e-bikes, but the vast majority are built in Asia.When I call the F-wheel A5 an Asian e-bike, what I mean is that it uses the common design of e-bikes I’ve seen across much of East Asia. And yes, technically speaking, e-bikes like those from Rad Power Bikes, Juiced Bikes and others are Asian e-bikes in the sense that they are built there. But those are obviously designed for American riders in an American market, and so that’s not really what we’re talking about.The F-wheel A5 looks almost nothing like the kind of e-bikes we usually see in the US. Its small 14-inch wheels and minimalist frame make the bike fairly light at just 49 lb (22.5 kg). Sure, that’s heavy relative to a pedal bike, but consider that popular US folding e-bikes like the RadRunner weigh 30% more, while big boys like the Juiced Scorpion weigh twice as much, and you’ve got a relatively lightweight e-bike here.The small wheels also help the small bike fit easily up staircases, into small elevators, and tucked into the corner of small apartments.They give a fine ride on smooth streets, but potholes, cobblestones, and even pavers can be a nightmare for small wheels. To give you back a bit of hope on less-than-perfect terrain, the F-wheel A5 includes both front suspension and seat post suspension. Neither is high quality, but both actually work decently well. The seat post suspension is surprisingly effective.Of course the little passenger on the rear rack doesn’t get any benefit from the seat post suspension. Instead, there’s just a thin pad offering their rear end any respite. But hey, kids are tough. Right?There’s also a distinct lack of footpegs back there, which seems like a major oversight. My nephew just put his feet on the ends of the rear wheel axle, but that feels like a solution that wouldn’t fly as well in the US as it does elsewhere. So I’d recommend F-wheel include either a set of footpegs or a pair of kid-sized roller skates with the bike.There are two models of the bike with two different batteries: a 360Wh model and a giant 1kWh model. The battery cases are the same and they look identical, but one adds a couple more pounds and nearly 200% more range.The smaller battery is rated for 25 miles (40 km) while the bigger battery is rated for 68 miles (110 km). That’s not bad at all!While the bike may look small, it isn’t puny in the power department. It runs a 48V system, which if you aren’t familiar with e-bike voltage levels, is a pretty powerful system. Many larger European e-bikes use a 36V system, so you’re getting around a third more power here than you get with a lot of big bikes. The bike had good acceleration even with a passenger, so that tells me we’ve got more than standard cheap e-bike power.Technically the bike claims a 350W rear motor, but the acceleration is quite powerful and so I’m guessing we’re looking at something that’s more like 500W continuous and even 750W peak — though I wouldn’t want to demand a sustained 750W from the motor. With an electronically limited speed of 15 mph (25 km/h), the bike feels like it is neutered too low. But then again, it’s designed for dense urban living and 15 mph in a bike line seems perfectly reasonable. I wouldn’t want to do that on the side of a busy road though.You might have also noticed that the rear wheel motor is in a mag wheel, as is the front wheel. There are no spokes here, meaning nothing to fall out of tune or break. There’s also no derailleur or gears of any kind. Again, there’s nothing to tune, adjust, or break. It’s a single-speed e-bike that just keeps working. While I initially put the single-speed nature of the bike in my mental “cons” category, it started to grow on me. The small wheels mean the bike is already geared very low, so you don’t need to downshift for hills. And with such small wheels anyways, your derailleur would be hanging millimeters off the ground. Better to just do away with it altogether and remove one more hassle/expense from the bike.When it comes to standard maintenance, the only area that will eventually require some mechanical attention are the disc brakes. Of course, we’re not going to get hydraulic disc brakes at this price, so we’ll have to settle for these cheap mechanical brakes that will eventually require some adjusting to keep them in tip-top shape.But all in all, the bike is designed to be as no muss, no fuss as possible. It even comes with a few extra features that I didn’t expect, such as a full lights including functional brake light, horn, fender set, and a pedestrian noisemaker.That last one I could do without. Like, seriously. The noisemaker is terribly annoying (watch my video above to hear it). Perhaps there’s some new law in China that says e-bikes above 12 mph (20 km/h) need a noisemaker. Because the thing beeps as soon as you get going that fast. It’s awful. I hate that part. I want to cut the wire to the noisemaker and I just might do that, though I imagine I’ll lose the horn operation. That’s a worthy sacrifice if I’ve ever seen one.Ultimately, I find the bike to be pretty decent for urban use, as long as you can put up with the limitations. The 15 mph (25 km/h) top speed is annoying and the noisemaker above 12 mph (20 km/h) is beyond annoying. But the bike actually works and it works well. Personally, I fit on the bike fine, but I’m only 5’7″ (170 cm) and 155 lb (70 kg). I could see it working for me still if I had another 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) of height. But once you get close to 6 feet (182 cm), you’re going to start to look like a clown car situation and steering with your knees. If you’re searching for a recreational e-bike for trails or a fast e-bike for cruising, this puppy ain’t it. But if you’re looking for a small, light, and peppy utility e-bike that can carry a kid or a cargo box in a densely populated urban environment, this might be the ticket. For just $700 (for the 360Wh model) or $955 (for the 1kWh model), you get a low maintenance two-seater e-bike that fits a city lifestyle and fits into a city apartment.Just make sure you don’t fit the front wheel right down into a pothole.",ebikes
2020/10/05,"In case you thought you’d seen all the Super73-style electric bikes and mopeds out there, think again. Electric bicycle manufacturer SONDORS has just unveiled its own line of new electric mopeds known as the SONDORS MadMods. And you can now get $50 off one of the new e-mopeds (or any e-bike from SONDORS, for that matter) by getting a personalized coupon code.The announcement, which follows on the heels of a slew of other new SONDORS e-bikes, was made quietly this morning in a message to SONDORS’ email list.The company announced the new Sondors MadMods lineup and revealed the early specifications for the electric mopeds.Sporting mini-bike and scrambler styling reminiscent of many 1980s mopeds, the SONDORS MadMod e-bikes will feature full suspension frames with a telescopic fork up front and dual rear coilover shocks in the rear. The style is somewhat reminiscent of the Super73 R-Series electric bikes unveiled earlier this year, albeit with two rear shocks instead of one. Oh yeah, and for half the price of those bikes. The SONDORS MadMod lineup will apparently start at just $1,499, of which a $299 deposit will hold your place in line for the estimated March 2021 release. That fits with SONDORS‘ past launches, which have usually come with incredible prices. The MadMods will feature 750W rear hub motors and 4″ fat tires, which again fits the general electric moped/mini-bike trend we’re currently witnessing. However, SONDORS seems to be going with an interesting size of 24″ diameter wheels. Most electric mopeds have opted for smaller 4″x20″ wheels, leaving larger 4″x26″ wheels for plus-size fat-tire e-bikes. SONDORS seems to be splitting the difference with a less common 24″ wheel diameter.Another interest addition to the SONDORS MadMods is a high capacity 48V and 21Ah battery pack. Very few electric bicycles offer battery packs this large. Sondors hasn’t released a range estimate yet, but that large 1 kWh battery pack is sure to result in extended riding times.SONDORS will also be adding a number of customization options as well, as the company described in a message to its followers:SONDORS MadMods is a premium moped style e-bike defined by customization. Motorcycle-inspired, with fully customizable configurations, boasting 750 watts of raw power paired with our largest battery to date.The motorcycle-style seat and large front headlight certainly give the bike that old-school moped feel, and the $1,499 price is sure to help the SONDORS MadMods compete against similarly styled Scrambler e-bikes.But for now all we have are computer renders and an estimated shipping date next year. Let’s see if SONDORS can deliver on these promises.If so, more established electric minibikes, such as the Juiced HyperScrambler 2 below, may have something to worry about.",ebikes
2020/10/03,"The United States National Parks Service (NPS) has just updated their regulations to codify electric bicycles up to 750W as legal in all national parks where bicycles are already permitted.The new regulations, posted yesterday on the National Parks Service website, move to support the decree issued by the US Secretary of the Interior last year, stating that all e-bikes should be allowed in all US national parks.However, the new NPS regulations do provide some limitations, some of which are seemingly contradictory.For example, the regulations list the three classes of electric bicycles in the US, consisting of Class 1 e-bikes with pedal-assist only up to 20 mph (32 km/h), Class 2 e-bikes with throttle control up to 20 mph (32 km/h), and Class 3 e-bikes with pedal-assist up to 28 mph (45 km/h). All three classes may include motors up to 750W of power. The regulations state that National Park “Superintendents may authorize the use of e-bikes that fall within any of these classes.”However, the regulations later go on to state that “Superintendents may manage particular classes of e-bikes differently. For example, a superintendent may open a particular road or trail to Class-1 e-bikes only, or may allow Class 1 and Class 2 e-bikes but not Class 3.”The regulations then further state, “The intent of the regulations is to allow visitors to use e-bikes for transportation and recreation in a manner similar to traditional bicycles. As a result, the regulations prohibit operators of Class 2 e-bikes from using the motor to propel the e-bike for an extended period of time without pedaling, except in locations that are open to public motor vehicle use.”So it sounds like the individual park superintendents may make individual decisions about which classes of electric bicycles are allowed in which parks and that Class 2 e-bikes may be prohibited from using their throttles. Most Class 2 e-bikes also offer pedal-assist control, though this is not required for an e-bike to qualify as a Class 2 e-bike in the US.Electric bicycles have become increasingly popular sites on recreational and mountain bike trails. Electric bicycle sales have been increasing for years, even while traditional bicycle sales have declined. Sales were already increasing rapidly in late 2019 and early 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting free time available due to many people working at home has led to skyrocketing sales of e-bikes.Additionally, multiple studies have shown that fitness on an electric bicycle can provide nearly as much physical exercise as a traditional bike and, in many cases, has been shown to result in more exercise than a traditional bike when riders end up spending more time riding due to the increased enjoyment.Many budget-oriented electric bicycles have launched in the past few months to capitalize on the boom in e-bike sales. The largest e-bike company in the United States, Rad Power Bikes, recently launched the $999 RadMission electric bike. Another large electric bicycle company, Pedego, last week debuted its lowest priced e-bike ever, the $1,499 Pedego Element.And new electric bicycle startup Lectric Ebikes has reportedly raked in over US$20M in revenue in just over a year from their $899 fat tire e-bike, the Lectric XP. The company recently launched a new version of the popular e-bike with a step-thru frame.",ebikes
2020/10/02,"Priority Bicycles has just launched their latest electric bicycle, the Priority Current. The Current packs in a number of high-quality and low-maintenance parts for a killer price.The Priority Current is powered by a nominally 500W mid-drive motor. However, the company lists the motor at an insane 140 Nm (103 lb-ft) of torque, which makes me think that 500W number could be coyly low. It is anyone’s guess what the real power is, but suffice it to say that 140 Nm of torque means this bike should have some serious pull, offering fast acceleration and flattening even the toughest of hills.The pedal-assist bike comes with a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), but offers users the option to unlock it to reach speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h). That would turn it from a Class 1 e-bike into a Class 3 e-bike in the US.And in a move that belt-drive fans will rejoice over, Priority equipped the Current with a Gates belt drive system. The use of belt drive means there’s no greasy chain, no transmission noise, and virtually no maintenance. Instead of an old-fashioned derailleur, the Priority Current uses an Enviolo internally geared hub with a massive 380% gear range.And with a 500 Wh frame-integrated battery, the Priority Current gets a range rating of 30-60 miles (50-100 km) depending on the pedal assist level and riding style.Other components on the bike include Tektro dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes, included composite fenders, automatic front and rear LED lights, adjustable height stem, USB charger, and a digital display. The bike is available in three frame sizes (S, M & L) and two colors (White or Charcoal).When Priority sent me the news and I saw the bike’s design and specs, I was immediately worried about what the price would be. The last Priority e-bike I tested out, the Priority Embark, was priced at just shy of $4,000.But I was pleasantly surprised — perhaps even amazed — to see that the Priority Current has an MSRP of $2,999 and is actually on sale now with a promotional price of just $2,699!A price tag of $2,699 is seriously impressive, and I think the Priority Current is still a deal at $2,999.A powerful mid-drive with 140 Nm of torque isn’t cheap. Neither is a Gates belt drive system, an Enivolo internally geared hub transmission, dual-piston disc brakes, or many of the other nice components featured on the bike.There are other great budget e-bike options out there for half the price. But they don’t have the speed, quality, longevity, and low-maintenance of an e-bike like this.I’m not sure which model of motor that is (can any eagle-eyed readers spot the model?) but the move away from an expensive and proprietary Bosch system like we saw on Priority’s last e-bike unveiling surely helped bring the price down. In my opinion, that was a great move on the part of Priority. Sure, Bosch systems are attractive to bike manufacturers as the company is a one-stop shop for all of the e-bike components and comes with excellent brand recognition. But now there are so many good options out there that companies like Priority Bicycles can offer high-quality e-bikes with nice component loadouts without charging the extreme prices of a Bosch-powered system.The one downside I can see for some riders will be the lack of suspension. But considering that the Priority Current is designed as a commuter e-bike for riders that are already cyclists and are used to this type of frame, I don’t see that dinging the company too hard. In fact, the rigid fork and frame add to the maintenance-free mentality of the bike, which of course has its own draw.What do you think of the new Priority Current?Let us know in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/10/01,"While we’re often wooed by budget e-bikes, it’s fun to examine what you can get if you climb a rung or two up the price and quality ladder. The newly updated 2020 GoCycle GX folding electric bicycle is a great example of the kind of innovation and quality that can be found for those willing to invest in it.Relatively speaking, the 2020 GoCycle GX’s MSRP of $3,299 isn’t really that expensive, especially considering that we’ve spun the pedals on e-bikes that cost upwards of $10,000.But compared to industry standard value e-bikes at half the cost, GoCycle has to really show us something that can prove their bikes are worth the cost.And let me tell you right off the bat, this e-bike is worth every penny.If you want to see the bike in action, check out my review video below. Then keep reading for all of the details on this innovative and high-quality electric folding bike.GoCycle updated their GX for the 2020 with several modifications to improve the ride and experience.We previously reviewed the 2019 GoCycle GX, which we had already found to be a great commuter e-bike. But the new improvements really polish up the bike to an even nicer commuter solution.For starters, the 2020 GoCycle GX received a new front fork, courtesy of the company’s flagship model, the pricer $4,800 GoCycle GXi e-bike. The bike has had its cabling refined as well, leaving just a single exterior cable. Commuters who are navigating tight areas and walking through crowds will surely appreciate the removal of every grab hazard.Internal wiring has been updated as well, which helped improve the clever folding mechanism employed by the updated 2020 GoCycle GX. It also makes the battery removal process more streamlined.All together, the updates helped reduce the already low weight of the bike, dropping it down to just 38.4 lb (17.8 kg).We see a lot of similar-looking e-bikes around here offering similar features. The GoCycle GX goes its own way with a host of innovative design solutions and creative new features.First of all, the bike is a quick-folder that can be easily wheeled around in its folded position. The single side-supported wheels don’t just look cool, they make the bike fold up smaller and lower the total weight.Next, check out the drivetrain. Is it a chain drive? A belt drive? You don’t know! You can’t even see the drivetrain, it’s all hidden inside what the company calls the CleanDrive. That’s an injection molded magnesium concealment that keeps the drive chain sealed off from the elements (and from gumming up your pant leg or ankle). It’s also great when maneuvering the folded bike, since that’s when a lot of people end up accidentally rubbing up against a dirty chain. I’ve heard anecdotally of GoCycle owners opening their CleanDrive after several thousand miles to check it out, and it still looks nearly factory fresh in there.For transmission, you get a Shimano Nexus 3-speed internally geared hub. Again, nothing external, no derailleur, no muss, no fuss.Plus there’s that built-in rear suspension (the front fork boot looks like it covers suspension, and fooled me at first, but there’s not actually suspension up front).I should also point out that those custom hydraulic disc brakes are some seriously nice stoppers.And we haven’t even gotten to the electric components yet! The front motor is rated for 500W of continuous power, which is plenty for most commuters. The battery is a bit small at 300 Wh, but the bike is so efficient (and designed to be used mostly in pedal assist mode), which means you still get great range of at least 30 miles (50 km). GoCycle claims you can get even higher range, but that’s only if you’re really pedaling hard.There’s also a hidden boost button on the underside of the handlebars that can be conveniently engaged with your thumb. In Europe it’s apparently a true “boost” button, as in you press it to get a little extra “oomph” if you’re climbing a hill or otherwise need a stronger push. But in the US you can configure it like a throttle, which is always nice for when you get a bit tired, or just want to throttle up to speed after a stop and then continue pedaling on your own.And speaking of pedal assist, the 2020 GoCycle GX has a true torque sensor, which means you’re getting accurate pedal assist that adjusts to how hard you’re pressing on the pedals — not just a cadence sensor that gives less accurate speed-based pedal assist support.Honestly, this feels like an amazing commuter e-bike to me. The folding is elegant, and the ride quality is much better than those little wheels might imply, thanks to the interesting rear suspension and swingarm setup. And the smartphone app makes a great data-filled display.If you choose not to mount your smartphone on the handlebars, you’ll have to make do with a small LED dot display that simply tells you your approximate battery capacity. It’s not much info, but it’s all you need when it comes to bare necessities. I recommend taking advantage of the app, though, which makes a nice display and also offers lots of interesting off-bike features for after your ride is over.The whole time I was testing the updated 2020 GoCycle GX, I kept thinking to myself, “OK, why would someone buy this bike over a budget option?”And after thinking about it, I can see the logic. Yes, for half the price you can get a folding e-bike with the same 20 mph (32 km/h) top speed, the same range estimate, and that folds nearly as quickly.But if you have the cash, the upgrades on this bike are quite nice to have.The torque sensor makes pedaling so much nicer, especially on startup and when you encounter hills. The CleanDrive is a godsend for commuters that struggle to keep their bike and their clothes clean. The internally geared hub is an elegant solution to dragging around a derailleur that eventually needs to be tuned and cleaned.The light weight of the bike means you can actually lift and carry it when its folded, but the rolling nature of the bike means wheeling it in folded position is even easier than most bikes. The hydraulic disc brakes add to the list of low or zero-maintenance components on the bike.Basically, everything about the bike is just nicer. It’s all higher quality, works better, will likely last longer, and will ultimately make for a nicer riding e-bike that causes less of a headache down the road.It might not be in the budget for everyone, but I feel like it’s actually a fair price for what you get. It’s a highly engineered e-bike that simply offers a new level of riding compared to value-oriented folding e-bikes.What do you think of the new 2020 GoCycle GX?

2020/09/30,"Pedego’s most popular electric bicycle models usually fall in the $3,000+ range, but the company’s newest e-bike is priced at just half of those figures. Rolling into bike shops today, the Pedego Element is a shot across the bow of the major value-oriented e-bike companies.The Pedego Element is listed at just $1,495, which is pricing territory currently dominated by rival Rad Power Bikes.But Pedego is hoping that its network of over 120 retail locations in the US will give it a leg up in this new market.That advantage could be important, especially since the specs don’t necessarily place the Pedego Element above and beyond other offerings in the field.As a Class 2 e-bike, the Pedego Element includes both a hand throttle and pedal assist, with both offering a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h).The 500W rear hub motor is powered by a 500 Wh lithium battery. The battery is removable and mounted on the downtube.The Pedego Element features large 4-inch-wide fat tires on 20-inch rims, giving the bike a compact stance yet still allowing it to operate on less forgiving terrain such as sand and snow.As Pedego CEO Don DiCostanzo explained in a statement provided to Electrek: The purpose of the Element is to deliver the premium quality and local service that Pedego is known for, at a price that more people can afford.The launch comes as a spot of good news following a large safety recall just announced by Pedego. Some of the companies’ most popular models including the Pedego Interceptor, City Commuter, Boomerang, Ridge Rider,  Trail Tracker, and Stretch sold between January 2018 and August 2020 were recalled due to “a potential fall hazard.” It’s great to see Pedego launching a bike in the $1,500 range, since they’ve previously only dipped as low as $2k, and even then the company’s most popular bikes often cost considerably more.And I’m actually a fan of the 20″x4″ fat tire format. It provides a fun, all-around e-bike without being a giant behemoth of a machine like some fat bikes I’ve tested.I would have loved to seen some better specs on the bike, though, including a bit more power. With the option to go up to 750W in the US, it seems like a shame not to offer that power, especially on a fat tire bike that benefits from more power to ride in more exotic locations.Lastly, I would have loved to see nicer integration of the battery, though this has never been Pedego’s strong suit (Hey Pedego, 2014 called. They want their rack batteries back!). Even Amazon sellers are doing sleek integrated batteries now on sub-$800 e-bikes.But the saving grace here is likely the support and dealer presence that Pedego can offer. While direct-to-consumer e-bikes can sometimes leave you stuck with problems down the road, depending how serious the company is about helping customers, Pedego’s expansive dealer and servicing network mean that riders can get great shopping advice and after-sale support. There aren’t many e-bike companies that can offer anything close to Pedego in that regard.",ebikes
2020/09/29,"Segway has been on a roll, launching new personal electric vehicles seemingly monthly lately. After recently opening sales for the company’s new adult-sized electric go-kart, now Segway is unveiling and taking orders in the US and Canada for the company’s popular C80 electric moped. Segway’s electric moped line first launched late last year in China, but has been reworked with more power and a higher top speed for the US and Canadian markets.The updated model is known as the Segway C80 electric moped and has just launched for pre-orders with delivery set for November of this year — just in time for the holidays. And with a price of just $1,899 including free shipping, it undercuts many other electric mopeds while offering significantly more embedded technology and smart features.The Segway C80 features a bright, rounded design reminiscent of the NIU U-series electric mopeds. It sports a rear 750 W motor and a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h).There’s also a removable 1,152 Wh battery rated for approximately 53 miles (85 km) of range.The Segway C80 electric moped includes functional pedals that qualify it as a Class 2 electric bicycle in the US, meaning it should be street legal on just about any public road that bicycles are allowed and will even be permitted in bicycle lanes. And unlike many faster mopeds, the C80 requires no license or registration since it is technically still a bicycle.But unlike a traditional e-bike, the Segway C80 electric moped offers floorboard space for the rider’s feet (and the pedals even appear to be easily removable if riders don’t want them dangling off the sides).That step-through design with a floorboard combines with the rear rack to offer a number of options for transporting cargo and bulkier items that are difficult to carry on a conventional electric bicycle. While the idea may be foreign in the US, it is quite common in Europe and Asia for riders to operate a scooter or moped while carrying cargo between their feet.In addition to the distinctly moped-style design, the Segway C80 also offers a number of high-tech features that most electric bicycles don’t offer.Most of the embedded tech is related to locking and securing the electric moped against theft. That includes built-in GPS tracking for anti-theft protection, though a number of features mean that theft is much less likely than a typical (i.e. not-smart) e-bike.The C80 uses keyless operation with two included NFC cards and also offers the option to use proximity unlocking via your smartphone, which unlocks the bike as soon as the rider approaches. There is also a smart seat sensor that enables auto-locking to engage the wheel lock and vibration alarm after the rider parks and rises from the seat to walk away.Other interesting features include color-coded rings on the handlebars that give the rider an immediate indication of the Segway C80’s status.Orange = powered on, green = ready to ride, blue = cruise control activated, red = error report, green & red flashing = Anti-theft alarm.The C80 includes a large, easy-to-read LED display and the headlight has an ambient light sensor to adjust brightness so it doesn’t always have to be blindingly bright when not needed. It even defaults to low light when first switched on then increases in brightness over a couple of seconds, “so as not to overwhelm the user when it’s first switched on.”The handlebars are nicely uncluttered, largely thanks to a clever design that left just a single multi-function button on the right bar. One push turns the Segway C80 electric moped on or off, pushing while riding engages cruise control, and pushing while holding the brake lever pops the seat.There’s even regenerative braking via the rear hub motor to compliment the front hydraulic disc brake and rear drum brake.Mass production of the Segway C80 begins next month with shipments to the company’s US warehouse set for late October to ensure the mopeds can begin deliveries in November. The $2,199 price has been marked down to $1,899 for pre-orders, and Segway is even including free shipping (which is often a hidden cost in these pre-order situations).Pre-orders are being collected via Indiegogo, which may give pause to some but has been a tried-and-true method for new releases in the world of micromobility over the last few years.Plus, Segway (which is now owned by micromobility giant Ninebot) isn’t some fly-by-night startup company, so it’s all but guaranteed that they’ll deliver.Could you see yourself scooting around your city on the Segway C80 electric moped?

2020/09/29,"Fiido launched its innovative D11 folding electric bicycle with a massive Indiegogo campaign earlier this summer, raising over US$1 million. While the initial backers had to wait through the pre-order period, now Fiido has launched retail sales after producing thousands of the new Fiido D11 folding e-bikes.Fiido has apparently produced the first 3,000 units of the bikes, which are currently working their way through European customs en route to the first pre-order backers.Following the pre-order period with reduced pricing, Fiido is ready to begin standard retail sales that shift the D11 from a crowdfunding novelty to (hopefully) a steadily delivering e-bike.The Fiido D11 sports an unconventional frame design with a single long strut.The bike looks like it is missing a battery, but that’s because it is actually mounted in the seat post.Without a frame-mounted battery, the Fiido design team was left with plenty of options to get creative with the lightweight folding frame design.At barely 12 kg (26 lb) with the battery removed, the Fiido D11 is both lightweight and eye-catching.And the bike actually works quite well too, as we discovered in our review earlier this summer (video below).The Fiido D11 features fairly standard specs for an Asian or European imported e-bike, with a top speed of 15.5 mph (25 km/h) and a range of 25-31 miles (40-50 km) from its 418 Wh battery.While those performance specs won’t blow anyone away, they work just fine for commuting in urban environments, which is exactly what the bike was designed to do. And they also keep the Fiido D11 reasonably priced.The best deal was during the Indiegogo pre-order campaign when the bike was available for just $799.The MSRP of the Fiido D11 is now $1,299 but you can use the coupon code D11BIKE to take $300 off the price, bringing it down to just $999.At that level, it competes with other popular commuter e-bikes like the $999 RadMission from industry-leading Rad Power Bikes and the $995 Ride1Up Roadster V2, though both of those bikes are non-folding single-speeds. The Fiido D11 is both a folder and includes a 7-speed Shimano transmission, which may make it better suited for some commutes.Fiido has a history of producing popular urban-oriented electric bicycles, such as Fiido L2 that we also reviewed last year. That bike proved to be so popular that Amazon struggled to keep it in stock. Miraculously, it’s actually in stock right now, though don’t expect that to be the case for too long.When it comes to the Fiido D11, this may be the last chance to get it for a discount price before it returns to its full MSRP.But there’s still something of a caveat emptor here, as many of the pre-order holders from this summer are still waiting for the bikes to work their way through customs.",ebikes
2020/09/28,"With Jeep’s new high-powered electric bicycles now being delivered to the first customers, we caught up with the guys behind the bikes to learn more about these two-wheeled powerhouses.If you haven’t already seen the Jeep e-bike, it’s something to behold.Powered by the strongest and torquiest retail e-bike motor in the business, the Jeep e-bike can put out up to 1,500W of power in its unlimited format.The bike rides on extra-wide fat tires and sports full-suspension, meaning it can handle just about any terrain. And that’s precisely the type of e-bike Jeep was looking to create. Which is why they teamed up with the electric bicycle company QuietKat.If you aren’t familiar with QuietKat, then here’s some quick background. The company was founded by Jake Roach, who grew up loving the great outdoors and looking for a way to turn his passion into his occupation. Jake started QuietKat as a way to offer overlanding vehicles – basically anything that could cover rough terrain when the road ends and the open expanse of wilderness begins. After getting started in 2014 with their first products that more closely resembled golf carts, QuietKat launched their first electric bike in 2016. The company quickly expanded in the high-powered e-bike niche, with all of their models sporting at least 750W of power.These aren’t your typical 750W e-bikes for standard recreational riding, like the value-style we often see from companies like Rad Power Bikes. Rather, QuietKat is all about extra power, extra torque and extra, well, everything. The bikes are meant to go far past the end of the road and truly blaze their own trails.It was around this time that Jeep first took notice.Like many automotive companies looking to expand into the rapidly growing electric two-wheeler market, Jeep, or more precisely Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), wanted to add a rugged off-road e-bike to their lineup that could embrace the Jeep brand identity. Jeep representatives discovered QuietKat at the Outdoor Retailer show, the largest outdoor sports expo. There the FCA team saw what they were looking for in QuietKat. As Jake explained to Electrek, “right away they were like, ‘yea you guys really synergize with what we’re about.'”FCA invited QuietKat and other companies out to their headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan to pitch new product ideas that could fit into FCA’s expanded vision. QuietKat came prepared, having developed a new full-suspension fat tire e-bike with a powerful mid-drive motor and integrated battery that they felt would best fit what Jeep was looking for. As Jake explained to Electrek, FCA’s Chief Marketing Officer Olivier François loved the e-bike so much that he bought the prototype on the spot, taking it home with him after the pitch meeting.From there, it was full steam ahead. Jeep wanted the new e-bikes in their Super Bowl commercial on short notice, but QuietKat didn’t have enough time to build and then ship them out. Instead, they rushed to get the bikes finished and then personally drove them out through a blizzard to make it in time for filming. Fast-forward to today and now QuietKat and Jeep are finally fulfilling orders after opening pre-sales earlier this year. The Jeep e-bike certainly isn’t cheap, starting at $5,899. But considering the top-shelf components, large battery, ridiculously powerful motor and other unique aspects that make the bike a one-of-a-kind model, this is one of those cases where you’ll just have to pay to play. And if you aren’t quite ready to shell out that much money, QuietKat has a number of other fun and powerful e-bikes starting at less than half of that price.For those looking specifically for the Jeep e-bike, FCA has over 2400 dealers, though not all dealers will carry the Jeep e-bike. Jacob explained that the e-bike will be limited to the more outdoor and overlanding-oriented dealerships. QuietKat also has their own large dealer network including over 100 Bass Pro Shop locations and other outdoor sporting goods stores. Plus they also offer the bike for sale direct-to-consumer on their website with free shipping.Just make sure you get yourself a good helmet – this is not an e-bike for the timid.",ebikes
2020/09/27,"Could electric cargo bicycles replace industrial trucks? It turns out they already are.Look, sometimes you absolutely need a truck. But let’s be honest, most of the time you don’t.How many times have you seen a pickup truck driving around with an empty bed or a box van carrying a tiny load? It happens all the time, and it’s a ridiculous waste of space and energy.It’s also exactly the case where cargo electric bicycles truly shine.Technically these are mostly cargo electric tricycles that we’re talking about here due to their three-wheeled nature, but the concept is the same. They’re similar to pedal bikes (or trikes) with large cargo boxes, yet are actually pedal-able for long distances and even up hills thanks to electric assist from a small electric motor and not-so-small battery.A number of city workers in Madison, Wisconsin recently participated in a program to test out a Saris e-cargo bike as a replacement for the city-owned pickup trucks used by departments such as the Madison Parks Division.The electric cargo bins feature a large front storage area that can haul 660 lb (300 kg) of cargo and are powered by Bosch’s latest 1,000W cargo-specific mid-drive motor and a pair of Bosch batteries.There’s no hand throttle like a motorcycle — the motor only kicks in when the rider applies force to the pedals. That means the e-cargo bike still operates like a standard bicycle, yet is easy enough for nearly anyone to pedal and use effectively.Maddie Dumas was one of the city employees who tested the vehicle out during her normal routine, using it to haul off bags of weeds and piles of brush as the city did maintenance along local bike paths.Not only has that helped the city reduce its carbon footprint and provide more exercise for its workers, but it has also helped remove Parks Division trucks from the paths. As Maddie explained to the Wisconsin State Journal, “You always feel like a bit of a jerk driving a big vehicle on the path.”Electric cargo bikes have also found use not just for municipal work but also to replace large delivery vehicles in crowded urban centers.Amazon, UPS, and DHL have all been testing out electric cargo bikes for parcel delivery in the US. A new program began late last year to use the vehicles in NYC, though it ran into a snag recently when new e-bike laws in the state legalized e-bikes yet set their width limits at a maximum of 36 inches (91 cm). Legislation is currently pending to increase the width limit in New York to allow wider cargo bikes like those used by parcel delivery companies.In addition to commercial applications, electric cargo bikes are also being used for humanitarian missions as well.Those same electric cargo bikes from above that Saris tested out with the City of Madison were also used to help distribute much-needed food relief to families hit hard from the economic impacts of COVID19-related shutdowns earlier this year.We’ve even tested our own commercial-level electric cargo bikes before here at Electrek, such as the German-made XCYC e-bike/pickup truck. Such e-bikes use much higher-grade bicycle parts to support the heavy weights associated with cargo usage and even feature parts not found on most e-bikes, such as parking brakes.Electric cargo bikes for consumers are also becoming increasingly popular, thanks in large part to lower prices combined with quality construction.Companies like Rad Power Bikes offer multiple affordable cargo and utility e-bikes such as the $1,199 RadRunner and the $1,599 RadWagon e-bikes. We’ve reviewed both models recently, finding the RadRunner great for all-around use thanks to its small size yet high utility, and the RadWagon better for more dedicated cargo jobs that require even more cargo space.Suffice it to say that electric cargo bikes aren’t just becoming more popular across the board, they are also becoming more accessible to a wider range of users and for a wider range of use cases.Do you think e-cargo bikes could help replace a number of trucks in your community?

2020/09/24,"The Vektron electric bike has been Tern’s key folding e-bike for the last three years. And now the bike is getting several new upgrades to improve the model while still keeping the price nearly unchanged.Unlike some companies with nearly a dozen different e-bike models, Tern has only a few electric bikes in its lineup.But that means that there’s nothing to distract them from getting each and every detail just right, as evidenced by their industry-leading quality and safety standards.And the Tern Vektron has certainly benefited from the company’s attention to detail.As Tern described the Vektron:The award-winning Vektron is among the world’s best-selling Bosch folding bikes. It folds in 10 seconds to go on trains, in cars, and under desks. Yet it delivers all the ride quality of a large-wheeled e-bike. Originally launched in 2017 after a successful Kickstarter campaign, the Vektron has since evolved into one of the most solid and reliable Bosch-equipped folding e-bikes in the market.The latest updates to the Vektron line include new Bosch drivetrains. The top-of-the-line Vektron S10 features a Bosch Performance Line motor with up to 65 Nm of torque and pedal assist up to 300%. The more affordably-priced Vektron Q9 has been upgraded to a Bosch Active Line Plus motor. Both motors are designed to be quieter, lighter, and more robust.Those motors propel the bikes to a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) in the US, and they get an estimated range as high as 100 km (62 mi) with a 500 Wh Bosch PowerPack battery.The Vektron frame has also been upgraded with a stiffer design that now passes the strict European safety standard EN15194 by EFBE Prüftechni for pedal-assist e-bikes.The stiffer frame comes with a gross vehicle weight of 275 lb (124 kg), meaning riders can make use of that large frame-integrated rear rack for carrying kids up to 60 lb (27 kg) or other heavy cargo. And the rear rack also allows the bike to be parked vertically, taking up even less space.The stiffer frame has also been updated to allow easier access to the battery, should riders wish to charge the battery separately.Tern managed to maintain similar price points for the Vektron line, with the Vektron Q9 starting at $3,199 and the Vektron S10 starting at $3,699. As Tern team leader Josh Hon explained:A big upgrade to motor, frame, and components normally translates into higher prices. But we’re getting some economies of scale and we’re happy to pass these along to our customers.While those price points certainly land the bikes above other popular folding e-bikes, the component choice is also a few levels above average. The bikes include high-quality hydraulic disc brakes (Shimano on the Q9 and Magura MT4s on the S10), Andros patented adjustable stems, folding mechanisms featuring interlocking joints that are precision-machined down to 50 microns, high-end Shimano Deore transmission on the S10, etc. Having tested the Vektron lineup before, we can say these bikes are the real deal, and designed for e-bike riders who are seeking the highest level of manufacturing and reliability.

2020/09/23,"Earlier this month San Diego-based Juiced Bikes wowed the e-bike industry with the unveiling of one of its highest power and longest range electric bikes yet, the HyperScrambler 2.Now with the Juiced HyperScrambler 2 opening for orders today, we caught up with Juiced Bikes’ founder Tora Harris to get a behind-the-scenes look at the HyperScrambler 2’s journey from paper to awesome reality.Tora spoke to us by phone from the Juiced Bikes factory in Shanghai. In the past, he would visit the factory frequently to maintain oversight on production quality. But this time he’s actually been staying there for the last six months to avoid being unable to re-enter China due to current COVID19-related border closures. He slipped in days before the border closed in March and has been there ever since.That’s upped Juiced’s already-high level of production quality oversight to new levels. As Tora explained the importance of his regular visits to their Shanghai factory:“For us it is absolutely critical. One thing is getting the product produced with the quality we need, and the other thing is development of new products. We are very focused on trying to develop a number of new products that push the boundaries on what can be done. It’s very, very hard to do that remotely when everything is manufactured here. We have our own factory now with our own R&D so we can do all of the R&D right there on the spot and prepare for production. Being here is absolutely critical for that. You really just have to be here.”For the unaware, Tora gave a bit of a hint there about what Juiced Bikes is known for, which is essentially pushing the envelope with high power electric bicycles. All of their bikes operate at Class 3 levels (28 mph or 45 km/h top speed) or higher.In the case of the company’s Hyper range of e-bikes, the operative word there is “higher.” The nearly 2,000 W peak and 30+ mph (48+ km/h) HyperScrambler 2 certainly pushes the envelope.Tora explained that Juiced has been working on the HyperScrambler 2 since pretty much right when their current Scrambler line of e-bikes launched in the summer of 2018. But development really accelerated in conjunction with the HyperScorpion last year, a bike that shares with the HyperScorpion 2 the new RetroBlade motor developed as a partnership between Juiced and Bafang.When pushed to the limit, that motor can output nearly 2,000 W of power. That’s how much power the HyperScrambler 2 offers in its highest performance mode. But the Juiced team also discovered that running such a powerful motor does no favor to your range on a charge. Even with Juiced’s industry-leading 1,000 Wh battery packs, that motor always wants more energy when operated in its highest power mode.As Tora elaborated:“This thing really gobbles up a lot of energy from the battery pack. Of course you can ride it in a way to get a lot of range, but if you really want to get after it, it’s going to eat into your range. And our battery packs are already one of the biggest battery packs you can get, right at 1 kWh.”Since Juiced has made a point of standardizing around a single battery format, the team decided to offer the HyperScrambler 2 with an option for two of the gigantic battery packs. That results in around 2 kWh of capacity on the HyperScrambler 2, or enough for around 100 miles (160 km) of range under ideal conditions.And that fits perfectly with Juiced’s ethos, as Tora explained:“Juiced has always been about having the biggest battery pack that we can squeeze on the bike, giving you more performance.”Another critical aspect of the HyperScrambler 2 was the inclusion of full suspension.On Juiced’s past Scrambler e-bikes, rear suspension was noticeably absent. At lower speeds that isn’t much of an issue, especially when you’re running big tires like those on the Scrambler e-bikes.But at higher speeds, every bump is magnified, making full suspension a necessity.“The suspension system in the Scorpion was very important. One of the big complaints when bikes get faster and heavier is the bumps, and so we knew we needed to bring in suspension and so the Scorpion helped us develop that moped-style suspension that we could then further incorporate into the HyperScrambler 2.”That suspension helps make the HyperScrambler safer and more comfortable to ride by improving its handling and ride quality.While the HyperScrambler 2 definitely pushes the boundaries for what is possible with an electric bike, Tora is adamant about the important safety considerations that go along with such high power e-bikes, which in the case of the HyperScrambler 2, include features such as motorcycle-level lighting, turn signals, and mirrors. When discussing the safety and utility of Class 3 level e-bikes, Tora explained how higher speeds can actually make the bikes safer for commuters:“In my opinion it’s actually a bit safer when you can keep up with the traffic versus riding at a slower speed. Imagine if you were walking on the side of the road, how dangerous that is, versus even just riding a bike. And now if you have an e-bike in traffic, especially in a city, it’s a perfect match.”Today marks the first day of sales of the new HyperScrambler 2 e-bikes. The single and dual battery models carry MSRPs of US$2,999 and US$3,499, respectively. But they are now on sale during the pre-order period for US$2,499 and US$2,999.The first 200 e-bikes will be delivered to pre-order holders in November, with additional deliveries following afterward.",ebikes
2020/09/22,"Greg LeMond is best known for his three-decade cycling career, countless contributions to cycling innovation, and of course his three Tour de France victories. But now he’s adding a new line to his résumé , launching LeMond Bicycles and its first two models, the Dutch and the Daily electric bicycles.Both the LeMond Dutch and Daily e-bikes are built entirely from carbon fiber, including carbon fiber frame, fork, barstem, seat post, and even carbon fiber fenders. The minimalist designs use integrated batteries and small rear hub motors to hide away all of the electronics that traditionally clutter up standard electric bicycles. Even the lighting has been fully integrated into the carbon fiber frame, resulting in a sleek appearance for both bikes. Check out those beautiful chainstay-integrated tail lights!Weighing just 27.2 lb (12.3 kg), these are some of the lightest weight e-bikes on the market.With nearly identical components, the only major difference between the Dutch and Daily e-bikes are their geometries. The Daily uses a more conventional triangle frame, while the Dutch takes inspiration from European e-bikes with a step-through frame design.The bikes are available in either a base model or with upgrades, though even the base models sport high end components worthy of LeMond’s legacy. The Dutch and Daily come standard with Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and a Shimano GRX 812 hydraulic shifter with 11-speed drivetrain. They also feature G23 tubeless-ready alloy rims, Selle Royal saddle and Panaracer GravelKing Slick+ tires. The base models start at $4,500, but anyone who wants an upgrade can choose to swap in a LeMond carbon fiber wheelset, Shimano Di2 electronic-shifting drivetrain, and Brooks England saddle.While that price might be somewhat higher than other affordable carbon fiber electric bicycles we’ve seen lately, it seems par for the course when it comes to high quality and nicely spec’d e-bikes like these.On the electrical side, the bikes appear to sport an X35 e-bike system from a company known as Ebikemotion. That system uses a small 250W hub motor rated for 40 Nm of torque and a 250 Wh battery. There is also an additional auxiliary battery that can be added for extra range. The bikes can reach a top assisted speed of 15.5 mph or 25 km/h. After that speed is reached, electrical assist cuts out and the rider is on their own.The release of the new e-bike line has been in the works for years, as Greg LeMond explained in a statement provided to Electrek:To say we are excited is an understatement, as we’ve been working behind the scenes for many years to meld our knowledge of bikes and the bike market with our carbon fiber technology. A novelty just a few years back, today e-bikes are a rapidly growing market segment, changing how we live, commute, recreate, and enjoy our surroundings. The Daily and The Dutch are cutting edge in every way, from the integrated technology and modern design to being incredibly lightweight. Cycling has always been my passion and I’m excited to see more people out riding, and e-bikes are making that happen.What do you think of the new LeMond Dutch and LeMond Daily electric bicycles?Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/09/21,"I’ve always been a fan of electric bicycle conversion kits that combine my passion for electric bicycles with my love of anything DIY. And as cool as the usual suspects are, the new Bimotal Elevate electric bicycle conversion kit adds a new twist to garage e-bike conversions.The recently announced Bimotal Elevate, which is intended mostly for mountain bike conversions, takes a new approach to DIY electric bicycle conversion projects.Unlike most kits that use a hub motor wheel in place of the existing bike wheel, the Bimotal Elevate kit leaves your existing bike wheels in place. Instead of a hub motor, it adds a cleverly designed motor unit to the disc brake mount.I know that sounds strange, especially considering that brakes are normally known more for their stopping power than their propulsion.But check out the image below and I think you’ll start to understand how the Bimotal Elevate e-bike kit works.The kit includes a large gear that is mounted directly to the disc brake rotor on either the front or rear wheel of the bike. That rotor and gear combo replaces your existing brake rotor on your wheel. The motor unit is then mounted to the frame or fork using the disc brake’s caliper mounts. That allows a drive gear on the motor to spin the wheel-mounted gear, propelling the bike.The unit isn’t compatible with all bikes, but should fit those with external disc brake mounts and ISO/post mounts. The San Francisco-based startup Bimotal has a page on their site with compatibility info, if you want to verify whether or not it will fit your bike.The battery looks almost like a water bottle and is conveniently held in a water bottle mount on the bike frame. The battery is only 250 Wh, which isn’t a ton of capacity, but also helps keep the weight down to just 3.3 lb (1.5 kg). Bimotal estimates range at between 15-30 miles (25-50 km), depending on riding style.For now the kit is designed to work with a throttle, though a pedal assist system may be available in the future.Thanks to the novel design, the Bimotal Elevate kit has a number of advantages, including that the large drive unit can be removed using a simple quick release. That allows the weight of the motor to be removed (as well as the battery), quickly returning the bike to nearly the same state it was in before the e-bike conversion. For someone who likes to use their electric assist only occasionally as a training tool, this could be a useful feature.The kit is also quite light and compact, with the 750W motor unit weighing just 2 lb (0.9 kg). Good luck finding a 750W hub motor that comes even close to that weight.And with 50Nm of nominal torque and 100Nm of peak torque, the drive should be plenty punchy. It will even power riders up to 28 mph (45 km/h). Not too shabby.Don’t expect this to be one of the more affordably priced e-bike conversion kits, though. Innovation isn’t cheap, and neither is the Bimotal Elevate kit. It’s priced at $1,950, though you can put down just $100 to reserve a kit ahead of deliveries next year.What do you think? Will your bike be sporting a Bimotal Elevate e-bike conversion kit anytime soon? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comment section below!via: Newatlas",ebikes
2020/09/19,"The carbon fiber Morfuns Éole folding electric bicycle has just been launched for pre-order. And the bike comes in at one of the lowest price points we’ve ever seen for a carbon fiber e-bike.There are actually two versions of the bike known as the Éole C and Éole S.The former is priced at just $999, while the the latter comes with higher-spec components and starts at $1,259.That’s pretty darn cheap, especially considering other carbon fiber e-bikes we’ve seen can cost as much as four times those prices.Both of the models are folding e-bikes with 20″ wheels, and both employ a seat post battery like we’ve seen in other recently launched folding e-bikes. Unlike those other companies, Morfuns claims to be one of the first to have developed a folding e-bike with a seat post battery, with their first version dating back as far as 2016.The latest models, the Éole C and S, use an updated design with a hidden plug under the battery that can be quickly disconnected.At just 252 Wh, it’s not a particularly large battery, but then again this isn’t a long distance e-bike either. It is designed as an ultralight folding e-bike for urban travel — something you can easily stash in the trunk or carry up stairs. The Éole S weighs just 12.8 kg (28 lb) while the Éole C is a bit heftier at 15.8 kg (34.8 lb).Morefuns claims that pedal assist can push the range up to as high as 50 km (31 miles). They also have an auxiliary battery option that mounts like a water bottle to the frame and doubles the bike’s capacity and range.Both of the bike’s models get powered by a 250W hub motor, though the Éole S features a more advanced and lighter weight motor, not to mention a nicer 9-speed Shimano SORA transmission compared to the lower tier 7-speed Shimano Tourney transmission on the Éole C.The S model also gets fancier hydraulic disc brakes, which should be a nice upgrade over the basic mechanical disc brakes found on the C model.The Éole S has other small upgrades such as Schwable tires instead of Kenda tires, a nicer Selle Royal saddle instead of a Velo saddle, a nicer LCD display with built-in USB charger and a carbon fiber stem and handlebar. But the single biggest advantage of the S model is likely the inclusion of a torque sensor-based pedal assist system instead of the more primitive cadence sensor-based system on the C model.When it comes to purchasing, you better prepare yourself. Yes you guessed it, this is a crowdfunding campaign.As usual, we rarely cover crowdfunding campaigns unless we’ve been able to test the product ourselves first or the company already has a reputable history (fly-by-night startups need not apply). In this case,  Morfuns has a 5 year history as an OEM supplier, meaning they know their way around e-bike production.They claim shipments should begin in December for the first batch of bikes. While that’d be great, I wouldn’t be surprised to see that timeline get pushed back a month or two, which is often the case in crowdfunding campaigns.The company seems pretty confident, though, as they explained:Based on years of sales, we have developed not only a wide distribution network, but also a mature overseas warehouse system located in the United States, Germany and Netherlands so as to help us cover deliveries to most of our major markets.There are some unfortunate omissions such as safety lighting or fenders. After-market options for the former are likely more plentiful than the latter, but I’m sure creative solutions are aplenty. For this price point, I can deal with adding a few accessories on my own.I think it is quite impressive to see carbon fiber folding e-bikes entering sub-$1k territory. Of course that’s a bit of a risky $1k purchase as we mentioned above, since the bike is being offered as part of a crowdfunding campaign, but we try not to write off crowdfunding on its own. For example, industry leaders such as Rad Power Bikes have gotten their big breaks on crowdfunding sites like Indiegogo, so there’s certainly merit. In this case, the price difference is so small between the two models that I’d probably opt for the lower weight and better components of the Éole S. But I already spent my crowdfunding budget for this riding season, so I’ll probably be passing this one up.I’d still love to hear what you think of the bike, though.

2020/09/18,"There are two things that FREY doesn’t mess around with: quality and power. The Jinhua, China-based electric bicycle manufacturer lays into both, heavily. And nowhere is that more evident than in the FREY EX Pro electric mountain bike.To see this crazy electric bike in action, check out my video review below!I almost don’t know where to begin with this bike. The suspension is phenomenal. On the street, you can hit curbs and feel like you’re riding around on your own private cloud. On the dirt you can take on logs and rock stairs with damping that feels like you’re using a cheat code.And then there’s the power. Oh, goodness… the power! The muscle found in the FREY EX Pro is incredible. Having 1.5 kW of power and 160 Nm of torque at your fingertips will send chills down your spine. The bike is so powerful that I actually rarely open it up all the way. For most technical riding and trails, I actually keep it in Eco mode instead of Sport mode and use mostly pedal assist, which works great with the built-in torque sensor in the Bafang Ultra motor. But when I want to go fast, especially when I’m on the street, I’ll put it in Sport mode and lay into that throttle. Doing so can rocket me up to around 36 or 37 mph (nearly 60 km/h) in a jiffy.Obviously that’s faster than normal e-bikes, and you have to be aware of what your local regulations are. And I don’t ride that fast often. But there are 40 mph (64 km/h) roads between me and my local trails, and so having the ability to ride fast on the road and take the lane instead of pedaling a big, slow mountain bike on the shoulder is a big safety factor for me.Then there’s the dual battery system on the FREY EX Pro, which is really a thing of beauty. Riding around fast and laying into that 1.5 kW motor would drain a typical e-bike battery quickly. But the FREY EX Pro has room for two batteries — one in the down tube and the other riding piggyback on top of the first. That allows me to use a bunch of power on the way to my favorite riding locations, get a whole afternoon of riding in, and still have juice left for the ride home.While the FREY EX Pro works great on the street (and feels like a light electric motorcycle), the bike is most at home in the dirt. FREY builds competition-level electric mountain bikes. I know because I’ve visited their factory and tested nearly all of their bikes. I’ve seen riders take these bikes 10 feet (3 meters) in the air repeatedly and safely. These aren’t department store e-bikes, these are true, high-quality electric mountain bikes. Mind you, I’m not the one doing 10-foot jumps. Admittedly most of my e-bike riding is on the pavement and not the dirt. But the FREY EX has helped me improve my off-road and mountain biking skills tremendously. A major part of that has been the confidence provided by the build quality and top-shelf components. Those Magura MT5e four-piston hydraulic disc brakes are the crème de la crème of e-bike brakes right now. And that suspension fork costs as much as one of my favorite e-bikes on its own, not to mention the FREY EX Pro’s high-end rear shock and proprietary rear suspension linkage designed in-house by FREY.I don’t really know what I’m doing, but I think I’m getting better. And my FREY EX is definitely helping! 1.5kW! (Though this was on Eco mode with just pedal assist) pic.twitter.com/lvCF6cH5rpDuring off-road riding, I’m usually in one of the medium pedal assist modes, and I use throttle sparingly. The powerful motor allows me to overcome obstacles with ease, yet isn’t overpowering when I still want to get in a good workout. In fact, wearing a heart rate monitor showed me that I could get a surprisingly thorough workout on the FREY EX, even in spite of its high power motor.Ultimately, it’s all about how you use the bike. And moderation is key.I want to get real with you guys here for a moment. Listen, the FREY EX Pro has a lot of power. Like, almost too much power. That’s great when you’re climbing 45-degree mountain slopes, but it’s also a great way to get yourself or someone else hurt.When you have this much power, you absolutely MUST use it responsibly. That means not flying around blind turns on shared trails or coming up quickly on other cyclists that aren’t anticipating your speed.Ultimately, this can mostly be summed up with “Be a good person” and you’ll probably be fine.E-bike responsibility at these levels also means riding carefully on the street, whether regarding obeying local e-bike regulations or just not being a jerk with cars. Just because you have the power and speed to cut someone off doesn’t mean you should. The FREY EX Pro has light motorcycle-level performance and you need to be aware of that. In fact, if you’ll be using the bike for street riding, especially at high speed, getting some motorbike education like the two-day MSF motorcycle course would be a great idea.As much as I’ve enjoyed riding the FREY EX Pro, it’s not perfect. There are basically two main complaints I have about the bike.The first is that there is no cover for the second battery holder, which is external. If you want to ride with one battery in the bike and the upper battery removed, you could end up getting mud or dirt on the battery holder and its electrical contacts.From what I’ve heard, FREY is working on a custom cover for the battery mount, but I don’t know if there’s an option available yet to purchase. In the meantime, I’ve just always ridden with two batteries installed.The second issue is that the Bafang Ultra motor is almost too powerful, or at least too powerful for today’s e-bike components. It has a habit of breaking chains prematurely, especially when not used correctly. A word to the wise: Don’t ride around in the smallest (i.e., fastest) gear all the time, and don’t try to apply power while shifting. Those are the two best ways to put undue stress on the transmission. I reserve the smallest cogs for the few times I want to hit high speed on the road. And when I shift while under power, I try to blip the brake lever just enough to engage the electrical cutout. Otherwise, I just let off power for a second while shifting so the chain is not loaded while jumping cogs. I know the last one isn’t really FREY’s fault, it’s more that the bike component industry isn’t quite ready for such high power motors. But it still applies, since it is a weakness that you could experience. It’s not a bad idea to put a spare chain in your saddle bag, FYI.This is absolutely not a beginner e-bike and it’s not for the faint of heart, either.It’s also not cheap. At $4,010, it’s a pricey bike compared to more budget-friendly electric mountain bikes.But it’s also competing in a different class. The bike’s specs and build quality put it up against $6-8k high-end electric mountain bikes, not the many $2-4k entry and mid-level electric mountain bikes.And you do have to order through a long email process or Alibaba, which can be new or strange to some people, but the company is the real deal and so you don’t have to worry about their integrity. Like I said, I’ve been there in person and met the entire team.If you have the cash and want a higher power, faster, more rugged, and higher spec’d e-bike, the FREY EX Pro is a great way to get there.

2020/09/17,"The Teleport Mobility swappable battery system, a newly designed open source standard, hopes to create some order in the Wild West of e-bike and e-scooter battery packs.Electric bikes and e-scooters are great, hands down. But what about their batteries? With each company operating their own proprietary batteries, these packs are often the weak links. Replacements are annoying to find and the packs themselves often die sooner than the vehicles, especially in the shared e-mobility markets. In those shared mobility markets, charging is a constant problem that is often solved by an army of independent contractors or dedicated charging teams who carry scooters around in gas-guzzling vans.Swedish startup Teleport Mobility’s battery system makes sense as a way to solve the issue of dozens of different batteries and finding ways to charge them. The team has more than 100 years of experience combined working in the transportation/mobility sector and is preparing to solve one of the biggest problems in the industry.As Teleport Mobility’s CEO Simon Fellin explained in a statement provided to Electrek:The harsh treatment that shared e-scooter and e-bike batteries receive is the cause of more than half of life-cycle emissions of the industry. Battery pack production accounts for about one-third, or approximately 60 kg CO2-eq of the total production emissions of a shared vehicle. However, since batteries are sensitive to both temperature and impact, they do not last nearly as long as the frame of the shared vehicle. Driving back and forth to central warehouses, often in a diesel truck, to swap batteries, also accounts for the majority of the operational emissions and almost half of the cost of the mobility operators.That’s an issue that Teleport Mobility thinks it can solve with its new battery standard. The packs are undergoing testing and verification now, and will be made available as an open source reference design once testing is completed. Companies could either lease the packs directly from Teleport Mobility, or they could design and build their own, pending rigorous safety verification that the packs are built to the technical standard.To help get the batteries out into the public, Teleport Mobility wants to create a network of battery swapping stations (think Gogoro’s giant battery swapping network, but maybe not quite as sexy).Teleport’s patent-pending stations would also allow operation as battery banks and power stations, where operators such as businesses and hotels could use them for energy storage to save on electricity bills, similar to a Tesla Powerwall. They could also be used for emergency backup power.Teleport explained that mobility operators who incorporate the batteries into their shared vehicles could offer discounts to riders who swap a charged battery at a station, thereby eliminating the need for a dedicated charging workforce. And businesses that install Teleport’s battery stations on site could benefit from increased visitors. Come for the battery swap, stay for the slushee. Or something like that.Teleport will be launching battery swapping pilot programs in northern Europe with select partners next month, with a more extended launch planned for the 2021 season.The batteries themselves are 14S packs, roughly equivalent to 52V nominal voltage, which is common in many electric bicycles on the market. The packs use 21700-size cylindrical cells from Teleport’s development partner Northvolt to create a 666 Wh pack, which is slightly more than the current average size for most e-bike and e-scooter batteries.The open source nature of these batteries is designed to help remove one of the largest downsides of micro-mobility vehicles.As Simon explained further:We believe that making this battery available as an open source project raises the bar of what is acceptable in the industry. Without quality batteries built into electric bikes and scooters, shared micromobility will be unable to live up to its true potential as an environmentally and infection-safe way to travel. Now that we have shown that several operators and suppliers are able to agree on a common form factor, we will be able to industrialize the reuse and recycling of battery packs in a way that has not been possible in micromobility before.I’m caught somewhere between starry-eyed optimism and worrying that this is all just wishful thinking.Don’t get me wrong, I would LOVE to see one battery standard become common across e-bikes and/or e-scooters. Even if the design constraints of a single battery standard meant that it wasn’t universally adopted, just a large portion of the market sharing a standard would be a huge improvement.This is definitely geared more toward the sharing market, but I wish it could work in the retail e-bike and e-scooter industry as well, where many companies enjoy the monopoly of selling replacement batteries that fit only their bikes.While the retail market is not likely to jump at this opportunity, I could see this being a big boon to shared operators who could benefit from outsourcing battery design and management. Incentivizing riders to swap and charge the batteries as part of the existing rent-ride-return model would help remove the need to operate a network of quasi-legal gig-economy chargers battling it out to charge a half-dozen scooters in their living rooms at night.I definitely wish the Teleport Mobility team luck, and hope that their vision becomes a reality.

Both of REI’s new electric bicycles actually share a lot in common.The Co-op Cycles CTY e2.1 and CTY e2.2 both feature the same geometry with matching frames and 75mm travel Suntour suspension forks. The frame design is best classified as a mid-step since the top tube is angled lower to make for easier mounts and dismounts. The bikes come in Small, Medium, and Large frame sizes, with the Small size offering a more pronounced step-through design for short-legged riders.The bikes are designed for hybrid-style city and light trail usage, and feature built-in racks integrated into the rear of the frames for increased utility. Hydraulic disc brakes add lower-maintenance stopping power and Shimano mid-drive motors and batteries offer well-respected e-bike credentials. In fact, the Shimano motors and battery systems are the main difference between the two models. The Co-op Cycles CTY e2.1 sports a Shimano E5000 motor and 418 Wh battery, while the CTY e2.2 is rocking a Shimano E6100 motor and larger 504 Wh battery. Both of those motors help the bikes top out at 20 mph (32 km/h), but the e2.1 only outputs 40 Nm of torque while the e2.2 has a more sprightly 60 Nm of torque.The Co-op Cycles e2.1 is priced at US$1,799 while the e2.2’s higher torque and larger battery commands a higher price of US$2,199. The e2.2 also nets you included front and rear fenders, which can be worth their weight in gold for commuters in rainy areas.While US$1,799 isn’t the most affordable mid-drive e-bike we’ve seen yet, it’s pretty darn close. And with the Co-op CTY e2.1 and e2.2, you also get several components that you won’t find on budget-level e-bikes.Also included on both models are a center kickstand for increased stability, 27.5×1.95 Schwalbe tires, adjustable stem, front and rear LED lighting, and a memory foam saddle.As divisional vice president REI Co-op Brands strategy and design Isabelle Portilla explained:Co-op Cycles bikes are designed with input from REI members, and the line continues to resonate with the co-op community as the line evolves. In a year where bicycle sales have nearly doubled for the co-op, we’re thrilled to bring these brand-new styles to our customers just in time for fall fun and freedom on two wheels. E-bikes are here to stay, and they are so much fun. We know e-bikes are helping people get outside quickly, more often and closer to home. They are great as a recovery option post-injury or a fun and accessible way to start riding for the first time and they are a planet-friendly transportation alternative.As Class 1 e-bikes, meaning the electric assist cuts out above 20 mph (32 km/h) and the e-bikes lack a hand throttle, these models should be legal just about anywhere standard bicycles can ride. And with increased trail access across the US for e-bikes, hybrid-style bikes like these could make great dual-purpose commuter and recreational e-bikes.Let us know what you think of REI’s first electric bicycles in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/09/14,"The Cyrusher Everest XF900, which was just launched today, claims to be a motorcycle-inspired e-bike that combines the best of both worlds. It offers high-speed riding, full suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, and other premium features, not to mention a price set conspicuously below its competitors.Shenzhen-based Cyrusher isn’t new to e-bikes — they’ve been around the block several times.But the company’s latest electric bike pushes the manufacturer into new territory with nicer components and at a better price point than the company has previously hit for such a bike.The new Cyrusher Everest XF900 is being positioned as a dual purpose trail or city bike, as the company further explained:The Everest XF900 was designed to tackle any mountain in your path. Whether you’re riding through literal mountains, or just navigating an urban jungle, the Everest XF900 is capable of going wherever your adventures take you. We started with our beloved motorcycle-style design and worked our way up from there.Immediately apparent is the motorcycle-style double-crown front suspension fork, which is much more robust than a typical bicycle suspension fork and hints at the rugged riding for which the Cyrusher Everest XF900 is designed. Less eye-catching is the muted rear shock filling out the full-suspension nature of the bike. Stopping power comes from a pair of Tektro hydraulic disc brakes biting onto 180 mm rotors.For power, the Cyrusher Everest XF900 is propelled by a 750W continuous rear hub motor made by e-bike motor giant Bafang. Like most e-bikes with 750W continuous ratings, that motor is almost certainly pushing out a bit over 1,000W peak, which likely helps the bike reach its advertised top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).There are multiple 48V Samsung battery options including a 13Ah (624 Wh) battery and a 17Ah (816 Wh) battery. Choosing the former nets you a sale price of US$1,999 while the latter ups the cost to US$2,499. With the higher-priced model you also get an upgrade from a 7-speed Shimano transmission to a 21-speed unit, plus you also get an included rack, fenders, and a rear LED tail light. Those accessories are optional on the lower-priced model.Accessories included on both models include a 250 lumen headlight, LCD display, and anti-puncture tire liners in those 4″ fat Kenda Juggernaut tires.Cyrusher is opening orders to customers living the USA, EU, UK, Canada, and Japan.There aren’t a lot of full-suspension fat tire e-bikes out there to compare to, but we can still do a little comparison shopping here. The US$1,899 Juiced RipCurrent is probably the king of value-priced high-speed Class 3 fat tire e-bikes, at least in the US. For just $100 less than the Cyrusher Everest XF900 here, it offers similar components and specs, yet it lacks the XF900’s full suspension. $100 to add full suspension sounds good to me!We’ve tested other full-suspension fat tire e-bikes such as the $3,499 Super Monarch, though that bike also offered two batteries and dual wheel drive, so perhaps it’s not really the best comparison. Value-priced full-suspension fat tire e-bikes is something of an underserved category right now.If you want to grab your own Cyrusher Everest XF900, the company is currently taking pre-orders via Indiegogo. As always, we advise caution when backing Indiegogo campaigns. Unlike what some would have you believe, they aren’t necessarily scams (did you know Rad Power Bikes got their start on Indiegogo?!). But there are also crowdfunding horror stories out there of companies that sprung up overnight, took people’s money, and then never delivered. On the optimistic side, Cyrusher isn’t a startup and they’ve delivered thousands of e-bikes all over the world. But with the current state of the e-bike industry amid surging demand, I wouldn’t be surprised if their December shipping date gets pushed back a bit.I’ve only tested a single Cyrusher e-bike so far, the Cyrusher XF650 (review video below), but it was a fun if not slightly ridiculous fat tire e-bike. Cyrusher makes big, over-the-top electric bikes and they do it for decent prices. They aren’t at the quality level of nicer European e-bikes, but they seem on par with most of the big US brands in terms of components.I wish I had more full-suspension fat tire bikes to use for a good price comparison, but most of the ones we’ve seen around here are either ridiculously powerful or are MUCH more expensive.Maaaaaybe the $1,799 X-Treme Rocky Road 500W would make a decent comparison, but it has a smaller battery, smaller motor, and lower top speed.Then there’s the $2,799 Eunorau Fat-HS electric mountain bike, but that’s a bit higher power and also more expensive. You see, there just aren’t a lot of similar e-bikes on the market yet.But that kind of makes Cyrusher’s point for them. While there are a ton of fat tire e-bikes out there, this is one of the few full-suspension fat tire e-bikes that is actually priced to start under $2k. And that’s pretty impressive, especially when you clock the fast speed and good-albeit-not-great components included on the bike.As much as I would have liked to see some more recognized brand names on the suspension, I might just be spoiled by some of the high-end Asian imports we’ve seen recently with pro-level suspension. But considering those cost twice the price, I can see why Cyrusher went with generic shocks.We’ll be checking out one of the first bikes off the line once Cyrusher starts production, so check back here on Electrek in the future for that. Until then, let us know what you think of the Cyrusher Everest XF900 in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/09/14,"Not everyone has a few thousand bucks to drop on an electric bike so today I wanted to take a look at two of the least expensive, full-sized ebikes from Ancheer in both mountain bike and foldable formats. At around  $600+ at Amazon, what compromises were needed to get to this price, and are they still a good fit? Ancheer has been around for at least a few years, we’ve reviewed both of these bikes‘ predecessors around 2+ years ago, so I think they’ve escaped fly-by-night status.We enjoyed both of the previous bikes calling them fun and surprising. The updated versions of those bike are more of the same. The fixed frame bike gets a more powerful 350W motor and bigger battery which brings it up to speed with the Rattan we reviewed last year. The foldable gets an updated geometry and spoked wheels as well as a lower price point.But they are still Chinese bargain bikes sold thru Amazon so the expectations have to be tempered on component quality.Since these are somewhat similar bikes, I’ll start with what’s the same.Ancheer does offer some service and repairs but reviews of these have been mixed so you are rolling the dice a bit here. For what it is worth, in my experience Ancheer bikes have worked well out of the box and have aged as expected.So, I’m not going to blanket recommend these bikes for everyone. Because of the compromises to get them down to the $600 price range, they are a more niche product. Should you go mountain biking with these? No. I’d stick to the roads, bike paths, and maybe a small gravel path or short expanses of dirt roads.I would also avoid going up or down big hills extraordinarily fast. The brakes are adequate but I just wouldn’t trust these bombing down a hill at high speeds. Likewise, I was doing a lot more work than I wanted to, especially on the foldable, going up big hills. The Sunshine bike “shined” here with its 350W of power. But if steep hills are a big part of your life, you might want to opt for more torque/power…and name brand brakes. So who are these Ancheer bikes for?If you don’t go hard on your bike and can do a little maintenance like tightening some bolts, these make great bikes for around town. A quick shopping run, a stop at a friend’s house, or even a sunny day commute are all in the Ancheer wheelhouse. If your aging knees or small hills are getting in the way of biking, this is also a great solution. However, if you plan on using your bike a lot, and/or rely on it for hardcore situations, you might want to opt for a more expensive bike or a used/kit ebike. Alternatives. If you can spend $400+ more, I think you will get a lot more peace of mind and a better experience from a Juiced or Rad Power ebike. They will likely last longer, require less maintenance, and be more pleasurable to ride.",ebikes
2020/09/10,"While the COVID-19 pandemic decimated parts of the global economy, it also created unique economic drivers in others. One of the “winners” in the new world we live in has been electric two-wheelers like e-bikes and e-motorcycles, which commuters have turned to in huge numbers.Most electric bicycle and electric motorcycle companies are fairly tight-lipped about their sales numbers.But with the huge demand spawned by consumers switching to two-wheeled EVs lately, several major manufacturers have opened up their books and revealed just how much they’ve grown over the past year.Major Italian electric motorcycle manufacturer Energica recently shared that the first eight months of 2020 have seen an order volume of over 200% of its entire 2019 sales, with over €4.3M in revenue so far this year.That puts Energica currently on track to triple its 2019 sales by the end of this year.The largest electric bicycle manufacturer in the US, Rad Power Bikes, is also on track to more than triple its 2019 sales this year. That puts Rad Power Bikes at a projected $250 million in revenue for 2020, no doubt buoyed by successful launches of budget-minded e-bikes like the $1,199 RadRunner and $999 RadMission electric bikes, in addition to their longtime favorites such as the $1,499 RadRover electric fat tire bike.A major driving force behind this steep spike in sales has been the shift toward personal electric mobility driven by commuters seeking to avoid crowded public transportation. And Rad Power Bikes’ CEO Mike Radenbaugh recently explained to NPR that he doesn’t see this as a temporary spike, but rather as the new normal:We think a switch was flipped and light has been shed on e-bikes as a tool for the masses. So now it’s not just about keeping up with this demand that has spiked after COVID-19 from people working from home, shopping from home, looking for socially distant ways to get around, but this is a switch that was flipped on and it’s not turning off for years to come, and so the work we are doing now is all about planning for future demand. It’s not about planning for next summer’s orders, it’s about planning for orders 10 years from now.In fact, Rad Power Bikes has grown so large that Mike estimates the company’s US market share at a whopping 25%, with the other 75% spread across at least 100 other companies. Or to put it another way, everyone else is merely fighting for second place.But Rad Power Bikes isn’t the only e-bike company showing impressive growth. Lectric E-Bikes doesn’t have the many years of operations to build on like Rad Power Bikes, but the electric bicycle startup has still shown explosive growth after beginning sales last summer.In barely more than a year, the success of the company’s $899 Lectric XP e-bike has rocketed the manufacturer from a garage startup to around $25M in revenue, making them a major player in the electric bicycle industry.Lectric E-Bikes even recently unveiled their second $899 e-bike model in barely a year, further demonstrating how quickly the company has grown.And these are just the manufacturers that have agreed to share their sales figures with us. Considering the hundreds of companies all vying for a piece of the pie, the actual growth of the industry is hard to definitively quantify. But any which way you slice it, the trend is clear: electric two-wheeler adoption is growing rapidly and shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.If you want to get in while the action is hot, check out our article on choosing your first electric bicycle, or see our list of the top electric bicycles for budget shoppers.",ebikes
2020/09/09,"California-based Juiced Bikes has just announced the company’s latest electric bicycle: the HyperScrambler 2. The bike features high-speed performance that blurs the e-bike/e-moped line. And we haven’t even touched on the ridiculous amount of battery range yet!While the Juiced HyperScrambler 2 e-bike may be brand-new, the concept is famously straight out of Juiced’s playbook.The company is already known for making high-speed and high-power e-bikes. In the past, when Juiced wanted to outdo themselves, they released “Hyper” versions of their already high performance bikes, such as the recently released HyperScorpion.The HyperScrambler 2 takes the same concept and ratchets up the insanity, as Juiced Bikes founder Tora Harris explained in a statement provided to Electrek:In the e-bike market, we’re all very focused on pushing the performance envelope. With the success of other Hyper models, we knew we had to take our best-selling Scrambler and make it even more powerful, with a truly insane e-bike riding range. Gone are the days of underpowered pedaling and range anxiety. With the new HyperScrambler 2, we are delivering something very special — more distance, speed, and power, but also an e-bike with incredible versatility and style. It’s really the perfect mobility solution for a broad range of riders.And he isn’t kidding. While the previous Juiced Scramblers have all been impressive bikes, the HyperScrambler 2 fully embraces Tora’s “truly insane” vision.With a top speed of “30+ mph” (we saw Tora hitting 32.7 mph or 52.6 km/h in a testing video) as well as a 1,000W continuous and 2,000W peak custom Retroblade motor, the HyperScrambler 2 isn’t messing around.It also has a jaw-dropping 100+ mile (160+ km) range rating, thanks to a pair of 52V 19.2 Ah batteries. Those dual batteries add up to 2,000 Wh of capacity, or 3-4x the average e-bike’s capacity. Hell, that’s more battery capacity than an electric motorcycle I had and more range than a lot of compliance electric cars! There’s even a built-in intelligent battery balancer that allows both packs to be used proportionally, including when they aren’t at the same charge level. A pair of optional fast chargers can fill the batteries from 0-80% in just two hours.But the HyperScrambler isn’t just rocking a powerful motor and big batteries. It also has the components necessary to push it past mere bicycle-level performance and into the realm of electric mopeds and motorcycles.That means a dual crown front suspension fork and dual rear suspension. It also means a full light package with integrated brake light, powerful headlight, and full turn signals. Plus there are loads of other important features for an electric bike of this caliber, such as the dual side mirrors, hydraulic disc brakes, security alarm, dual torque/cadence pedal assist sensors, and a massive 60T chain ring for pedaling at higher speeds.The Juiced HyperScrambler 2 will be available for pre-order beginning on September 23, with the first 200 bikes being delivered in November. While the single and dual battery versions of the bike are priced at US$2,999 and US$3,499, respectively, they’ll be on sale during the pre-order period for US$2,499 and US$2,999.The HyperScrambler 2 will initially be available in black or brushed aluminum finishes, with additional finishes becoming available later in the year.In addition to the HyperScrambler 2, Juiced Bikes offers its more affordably priced $1,799 standard Scrambler models, as well as the commuter-oriented CrossCurrent line and the adventure-ready RipCurrent line, not to mention the well-known Juiced Scorpion electric moped, which we had the pleasure of reviewing earlier this summer. Make sure you check our review video of the Juiced Scorpion below.",ebikes
2020/09/09,"Remember your childhood, ripping around the neighborhood on a bare-bones BMX bike? Zooz Bikes certainly does, which is why they’ve tried to recapture that nostalgia in a lineup of three new electric bikes unlike anything we’ve seen before.Zooz Bikes has just announced the launch of its new electric bike model known as The Urban Ultralight.The bikes are available in three versions: The Zooz Urban Ultralight 250, Urban Ultralight 750, and Urban Ultralight 1100.As you probably guessed, those figures relate to the wattage of the bikes’ motors. While the three different models are differentiated by motor power and battery capacity, all three share many similarities.The bikes are not heavy on technology like some other e-bikes we’ve seen lately. Instead, Zooz is adopting “a less-is-more approach, focusing on quality components, design, and the ride ​instead of gadgets and racks and gimmicks,” explained cofounder Chris Zahner. He continued, “Urban dwellers are looking for exploration and excitement ​on top of ​simple mobility as social distancing measures not only affect your commute but also minimize our daily dose of excitement. Zooz offers thrill-on-demand.”All of Zooz’s e-bikes feature minimalistic, chromed-out 4130 Chromoly steel frames, long bench seats for two riders, and hydraulic disc brakes. While they certainly have a BMX-meets-minibike appearance, they aren’t actually sporting typical BMX wheels. Instead, you get an option of either 24″ or 26″ wheels (only 26″ on the higher power models), as well as an option for low or high handlebars on all Zooz models.. The Urban Ultralight 250 (or UU 250, as Zooz calls it for short) has a rear geared hubmotor rated for 250W continuous or 500W peak. Its 36V 17.5Ah battery packs in 630 Wh for a “minimum range” of 25 miles (40 km). The 44.1 lb (20 kg) bike can support riders up to 200 lb (90 kg) and rider heights of 5’0″ to 6’5″ (152-195 cm). The top speed is only 16 mph (25 km/h), but this is the base model after all.The next step up to the Zooz UU 750 boosts the speed up to 20 mph (32 km/h) thanks to a higher power 575W continuous and 960W peak rear-geared hub motor. The UU 750 gets upgraded to a 48V system with a 17.5Ah battery with 840Wh of capacity. The higher speed means the larger capacity battery still offers the same range estimate as the UU250 above, at 25 miles (40 km). The bike is built for larger riders, though, with a weight rating up to 230 lb or 104 kg. The UU 750 itself weighs 55.7 lb (25.3 kg).The highest-performance model in the lineup upgrades just about everything. The Zooz UU 1100 has a rear direct drive hub motor rated at 728W continuous and 1092W peak. The bike reaches a top speed of 27 mph (43 km/h) and has a better minimum range of 33 miles (53 km), thanks to a larger 52V 21Ah battery with 1,092 Wh of capacity. It gets higher-spec hydraulic disc brakes compared to its lower-power brothers, and also sports the heaviest weight rating of them all at 300 lb (136 kg). The UU 1100 weighs 62.6 lb (28.4 kg), with that weight no doubt buoyed by the large motor and battery combo.All three e-bikes offer five levels of pedal assist. The UU 750 and UU 1100 include a throttle pre-installed, while the UU 250 includes an optional throttle in the box that can be added if the user desires.The three bikes fit into the three different US e-bike classes of Class 1, 2 and 3, respectively. All three bikes ship to the US and UAE, while the UU 250 also offers shipping to the EU, UK, Australia, and Canada.All three bikes are now available for pre-order with delivery by April of next year. The Zooz UU250 is on sale for $1,500 (regularly $2,000), the UU 750 is on sale for $2,000 (regularly $2,600), and the UU 1100 is on sale for $2,500 (regularly $3,200).You know what? I like it. It’s different and I appreciate that.There are so few minimalist e-bikes out there, and the few that exist seems to be minimalist in the bad way, as in, they just tried to cut costs.These Zooz bikes are eye-catching and look like a lot of fun.I would have been a bit concerned about the lack of suspension, but then again, these are modeled after BMX bikes and as long as they’re well-built, I think getting air time shouldn’t be a problem. These bikes are designed to get you up on your feet if you’re going to do be doing any wild riding. And when you’re just cruising around, they’ve got that minibike seat for comfort. At least I hope it’s comfortable.As far as pricing goes, there are definitely more cost-effective ways to get these ranges or these speeds. An $899 Lectric XP can go just as fast for a third of the price. But I don’t think someone who buys a Zooz bike is only looking for a deal. They’re most likely sold on the design, and cost is a secondary consideration. I’ll hopefully be back with more thoughts on the bikes as soon as I can test one out. Until then, let’s hear your opinions in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/09/08,"There’s just something about fat tire electric bikes that make them so much fun to ride. But it’s not every day that you find a fat tire e-bike that is as elegantly crafted as the Aventon Sinch.This e-bike offers the unbridled joy of cruising around on ridiculously oversized tires yet without sacrificing any build quality. That makes it a top value e-bike for anyone looking for lots of bang for your buck.Alright, buckle up folks. I’ve got a lot to say about this e-bike, but first I need to start with the big picture.The Aventon Sinch is a folding fat tire electric bike. That means you can ride it just about anywhere including sand, dirt, snow, etc. But it’s also a rather small form-factor bike due to its folding nature.With 20″ diameter wheels and a folding frame/handlebars, the bike can easily fit in just about any car trunk, allowing you to take it on trips or ride in areas further from home.It has your standard US Class 2 e-bike specs, meaning it can hit speeds up to 20 mph (32 km/h) and peaks at 750 Watts of power. (There’s also the option to remove the speed limit on private property to hit around 24 mph). The Aventon Sinch also has a large 672 Wh battery that is conveniently hidden inside the frame to maintain the nice look of the bike.Here’s where things start to differ from other fat tire e-bikes, as well as from other e-bike companies as a whole.First of all, Aventon is straight up and honest about the range of its battery. They not only tell you the range on throttle versus pedal assist, but also tell you the range for every pedal assist level. Check out their graphic below, which I ripped off from their website.Almost no other e-bike companies do this. Most companies tell you “ideal range”. If Aventon did that, they’d tell you the Sinch’s range was 71 miles. But they don’t do that. They straight up tell you that the average range is 40 miles, and the true range can vary from 30 miles on throttle-only to 71 miles on low pedal assist level 1. Instead of putting their best (misleading) foot forward, they’re honest right out of the gate.Respect.Next, very few fat tire folding e-bikes have internal batteries. The fat tires mean you need high power to get them rolling, which generally means you need a big battery. Big batteries don’t like to squeeze into small frames. And yet somehow Aventon has managed to do it. The Sinch’s battery locks inside the frame and out of sight, making the bike’s profile look better than pretty much any other folding fat tire electric bike I’ve seen. Sure, some other e-bikes have managed to achieve this, such as the Lectric XP. But in that case, the Lectric XP has both a smaller battery and also a much more industrial (i.e. less sexy) design. So props to Aventon for getting the styling right.Lastly, and I don’t know why I saved this one for last since it is quite important and kind of a defining Aventon signature, the bike’s frame is so beautifully welded that it almost doesn’t look welded at all. It almost looks like a carbon fiber e-bike with zero mating lines or other manufacturing marks.The welding has been finished so beautifully that it looks like the bike’s frame is just one solid formed piece. Which of course isn’t true, because it is made of welded double-butted 6061 aluminum tubes, but it just looks so perfect in every joint that you’d almost never know. You’ve got to appreciate that craftsmanship. Again, respect.Like any e-bike, there’s a combination of advantages and disadvantages here. I’ve already talked about what a straightforward company Aventon is and how well they’ve built their bikes.I also really love how well the bike rides, how much fun it is to ride on both the street and trails/sand, and how much range I get out of it.But if there’s one thing that bugged me constantly about the Aventon Sinch, it was the lack of throttle operation from rest. What I mean by that is when you want to get rolling, you need to get around half a pedal revolution in before the throttle can be activated. If you just push the throttle while the bike isn’t moving, nothing will happen.The reason this annoys me is 1) I’m admittedly lazy, and 2) there are actual cases where I like to use throttle on startup. Those are usually when I get rolling in sand or other loose terrain, or when I start at the bottom of a hill.Now, how big of a deal was this no-throttle-from-rest thing? Admittedly, not so much of a big deal. In sand, I just made sure I was in a fairly low gear and stood on a pedal to get rolling. With hills, it was basically the same thing where I just remembered to be in a low gear to get rolling. Plus I didn’t have huge hills to conquer anyways.But one of the advantages of e-bikes has always been that they are more forgiving of being in the wrong gear since you can compensate with the throttle.There is one other workaround that I did find, which is that you can use the “walk” feature of the Aventon Sinch to get rolling from rest, then switch to throttle. The walk feature activates when you hold the down button and gets the bike rolling at a few miles per hour. So if you have a leg condition and really need help getting rolling, that’s a nice throttle workaround.And while I’m being nit-picky, it’d be nice if it came with included fenders and rear rack, though Aventon has those options as accessories that can be added.Ultimately, the Aventon Sinch has been a wonderful e-bike that I can highly recommend.On the performance side, it offers good speed, great range, nice power and a comfortable ride.On the quality side, the bike is amazingly well built and comes from a reputable, honest company that is a pleasure to work with.On the value side, it is priced at $1,499, which feels well placed in the market. There are other fat tire folding e-bikes out there for similar prices, but that don’t offer the level of fit and finish that the Aventon Sinch does.Ultimately, there are a lot of choices out there. But you absolutely can not go wrong with the Aventon Sinch. It’s a beautiful e-bike that works well and should last the test of time.",ebikes
2020/09/05,"Considering current events, this Labor Day likely won’t be celebrated quite like last year, with big picnics and group outings. Instead of packed crowds this year, you could be using your day off to explore the great outdoors on a fast and fun electric bicycle.What’s that? You don’t have an electric bicycle yet? Well if you want to join the millions of people experiencing the benefits of e-bikes then you might still be in luck this Labor Day by taking advantage of some big sales!Interestingly, we’re seeing fewer big sales for electric bicycles this Labor Day than we did last year. That’s not likely because e-bikes are less popular — in fact, it’s the exact opposite.Ever since people starting wandering out of nationwide lockdowns from COVID-19, electric bicycles saves have positively skyrocketed.Many electric bicycle companies have had trouble keeping e-bikes in stock, with some popular models still sold out until at least November. But popular California-based electric bicycle company Juiced Bikes has announced that not only do they have a wide selection of in-stock e-bikes, but they are having a huge Labor Day sale with prices up to $700 off! And the sale has already begun, meaning you can start saving big right away.Juiced Bikes began delivering the Scorpion and HyperScorpion e-bikes earlier this year. Designed with inspiration from retro mopeds, the Scorpion and HyperScorpion offer bench seats, drop frames, large headlights, full suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, and other moped-level components that make for a great ride.The standard Scorpion has a top speed of up to 28 MPH (though I usually peaked around 25-26 MPH in my testing), a 750W motor, and a 676 Wh battery. The Juiced Scorpion normally retails for $2,199 but is on sale for $1,799 now.And if you want to ratchet up the power, check out the HyperScorpion. It can hit speeds of over 30 MPH (48 km/h), has a 1,000 W continuous motor (that puts out even more peak power), a nearly 1 kWh battery, and a number of automotive-level components like mirrors and turn signal package. The Juiced HyperScorpion is marked down $700 from its MSRP of $3,499 to just $2,799.The Juiced CityScrambler and CampScrambler e-bikes take on more of a 1980’s mini-bike vibe. They offer step-over frames instead of drop frames, but also have that long bench seat that just begs to meet your significant other’s rear end as you ferry her (or him!) around in style.The bikes are quite similar, with the CityScrambler offering slicker tires and mag wheels while the CampScrambler features knobby tires and more conventional spoked wheels.Otherwise, they both share a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), ranges of up to 45 miles (72 km) thanks to that 676 Wh battery, front suspension, and hydraulic disc brakes.The Scramblers are normally priced at $1,799 but are now on sale for $1,699.The CrossCurrent is Juiced’s standard commuter e-bike and is available in two formats: the CrossCurrent S2 and CrossCurrent X.The CrossCurrent S2 gets you a great commuter e-bike with hydraulic front suspension, a 1,050-lumen headlight, Tektro hydraulic disc brakes, a combined torque/cadence-based pedal-assist system, a 676 Wh battery good for well over 50 miles (80 km) of range, and a top speed of up to 28 mph (45 km/h).The CrossCurrent S2 is normally priced at $1,899 but is now on sale for $1,799.For anyone looking for a bit of an upgrade, the Juiced CrossCurrent X adds a larger 1 kWh battery and includes racks and fenders, which are an important addition for many commuters. The CrossCurrent X is normally priced at $2,499 but is now on sale for $2,299.If you’re looking for more of a “go anywhere, do anything” type of e-bike, a fat tire bike like the Juiced RipCurrent might be right for you.Like the CrossCurrent, the RipCurrent is available in two different formats: the RipCurrent and the RipCurrent S.And like the CrossCurrent line, the RipCurrent e-bikes offer a lot of the same parts. You get Tektro hydraulic disc brakes, spring suspension forks, top speeds of 28 mph (45 km/h), 1,050-lumen headlight, etc.The RipCurrent is normally priced at $1,899 but is on sale for $1,799. The RipCurrent S adds the larger 1 kWh battery and the rack/fenders package, with the sale price dropping from the MSRP of $2,499 down to $2,299.Last year there were significantly more Labor Day e-bike sales, but these are the ones I’ve been able to find so far this year. If you’ve seen any that I’ve missed, let me know in the comments down below so I can add them!And to make sure we’re not playing favorites, there are of course still some other great deals for e-bikes going on out there, even if they aren’t Labor Day-specific sales.The industry-darling RadRunner e-bike from Rad Power Bikes is still at its lowered sale price of $1,199 and the Lectric XP is back at its lowered sale price of $899, with both models proving incredibly popular at those prices.If you are looking for an electric kick scooter deal, it is going to be hard to beat the $399 Segway Ninebot ES2 at Amazon. That’s about $100 lower than we’ve ever seen it and $190 off of list. This is a great all around  lightweight foldable 300W scooter with dual suspension,  a 15.5 mph top speed and 15.5 mile range",ebikes
2020/09/03,"Bicycle manufacturer Kona has just broadened its lineup of electric bicycles with a series of new announcements for additional electric models.The newly announced Kona Remote 160 DL electric mountain bike features the Shimano EP8 electric mid-drive system. That new e-bike motor and drive unit was only announced at the beginning of the week, making the Remote 160 DL one of the first e-bike models to sport the new drive unit.The Shimano EP8 motor gets paired with a 504 Wh battery integrated seamlessly into the bike’s down tube. Suspension includes 160 mm of travel front and rear with a RockShox Zeb Select+ Charger RC 2.1 DebonAir fork and RockShox Super Deluxe Select rear suspension. The bike rides on 29er Maxxis Assegai EXO+ tires and includes a Trans-X dropper seat post.For brakes, the Kona Remote 160 DL receives SRAM’s Code R hydraulic calipers and 200mm discs.Pricing for the Remote 160 DL is set at $6,999.For a slightly more affordable $5,999, the new Remote 130 electric mountain bike offers the older Shimano STEPS E8000 electric motor and drive unit, though it gets a similar 504 Wh battery.The bike offers 130 mm of travel in the rear from Fox Float Performance suspension and 140 mm of travel up front from a Fox Rhythm 34 Float suspension fork.The Kona Remote 130 features a 12-speed Shimano Deore transmission as well as Shimano Deore hydraulic disc brakes.Kona’s leisure bikes also now get the electric treatment with the introduction of the Kona Ecoco and Ecoco DL.Both bikes receive power from the Shimano STEPS E6100 motor drive system and 504 Wh batteries. However, the Ecoco DL gets an integrated down tube battery while the Ecoco’s battery sits on top of the down tube.The pair of bikes roll on 650x47c tires and start at $3,599.Another new addition to Kona’s line of commuter-oriented electric bikes is the just-announced Dew-E DL.The Kona Dew-E DL sports an aluminum step-over frame with a carbon fiber fork. The bike features a Shimano STEPS E6100 mid-drive motor with a 504 Wh integrated battery.The bike includes Shimano’s 10-speed Deore drivetrain and rolls on 650x47c WTB Horizon TCS tires. It starts at $3,699.Last but not least is the new Kona Libre EL electric gravel bike. Electric gravel bikes have become a quickly growing market, and Kona certainly isn’t looking to be left behind.The Kona Libre EL sports an aluminum step-over frame, a carbon fiber fork, and a set of drop bars in true gravel bike fashion.The bike is powered by a Shimano STEPS E7000 mid-drive motor system and a 504 Wh integrated battery. The brakes and transmission come from Shimano’s GRX gravel bike component line. And while I’d love to tell you the price, Kona hasn’t announced it yet, so we’ll have to wait just a bit longer to see how much this new electric gravel bike will set us back.via: Cyclevolta",ebikes
2020/09/02,"Southern California-based Monday Motorbikes has just launched the company’s latest electric moped known as the Anza.The new electric moped is named after Anza Street in San Francisco, California, where Monday Motorbikes began testing their first models in 2015.The Anza electric moped is actually available in two formats, a 500W version and a 750W version.The 500W model has a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) while the 750W model can reach higher speeds of up to 35 mph (56 km/h), according to Monday Motorbikes.Their respective prices of $1,499 and $2,499 are actually marked down to just $1,200 and $1,999 during Monday’s pre-sale period ahead of deliveries in November.Both versions of the Anza offer an aluminum frame, rear Bafang hub motor, color LCD display, hydraulic disc brakes in front, mechanical disc brake in the rear and a bench seat for up to two riders. I don’t see any rear pillion pegs, though, so that second rider might be doing a bit of foot dangling.The battery is hidden in the faux tank, with the 500W model receiving a capacity of 557 Wh for up to 25 miles (40 km) of range. The 750W model gets a larger 672 Wh battery for a maximum range of 35 miles (56 km).The bikes are also available in three colors: Midnight Black, Storm Trooper White, and Hunter Green.Monday Motorbikes says the lower and higher power models conform to Class 2 and Class 3 e-bike specifications, thus negating any special motorcycle license or insurance in most areas. However, if the 750W model can truly reach the 35 mph (56 km/h) top speed claimed on Monday’s site, then that would put it in excess of the 28 mph (45 km/h) limit for Class 3 e-bikes in most of the US.Many electric mopeds offer unlimited speed modes that are intended for “off-road use only,” which may be Monday’s way to get around such speed limits.So far, 2020 has been the year of the electric moped, with a number of new competing models launched by several of the largest electric bicycle companies.Rad Power Bikes followed up the popular $1,199 RadRunner electric utility bike with the higher-spec RadRunner Plus.Juiced Bikes launched the well-known Juiced Scorpion electric moped, only to be followed up by the impressive Juiced HyperScorpion, designed to offer more power and speed.And industry heavyweight Super73, who was there right at the beginning of the electric moped and minibike craze, released the Super73-S2 and then followed it up with the Super73 R-Series full-suspension electric minibikes.Can Monday Motorbike’s Anza compete with the impressive range of electric mopeds already in the market?

2020/09/01,"It’s lighter, it’s stronger, it’s better… It’s the new Shimano EP8 mid-drive motor system for electric mountain bikes.The bicycle component giant has just released its latest electric bicycle drive unit with a number of performance upgrades.The new Shimano EP8 mid-drive motor unit packs even more torque than Shimano’s previous drive units, up to 85 Nm. While increasing the drive’s torque, Shimano was also able to simultaneously reduce the weight of the unit to just 2.6 kg (5.7 lb).As the company explained:EP8 delivers up to 85Nm of torque, a 21% increase (in Trail and Boost modes) over the STEPS E8000 motor platform (Shimano’s previous top-end eMTB drive system). The new magnesium drive unit casing design delivers a 300-gram (0.66-pound) weight loss (5.7-pound total weight) in a 10% smaller form factor. With 85 Nm of torque, Shimano is competing head-to-head with Bosch’s most powerful mid-drive motor. But for any riders who don’t want such high torque on tap, Shimano’s E-Tube Project app allows riders to adjust the maximum torque anywhere in the range from 20-85 Nm.The Shimano EP8 drive unit also features a new gear design that reduces gear drag by 36%. That should help it feel more similar to pedaling a traditional bicycle. The reduced motor noise will also help riders forget that they’re pedaling an electric bike instead of an acoustic bike.As the company continued:Thanks to a new seal structure and gear design, drag is reduced by 36%, getting much closer to the normal pedaling feeling of a traditional bike. Riders will feel a smoother cutoff as they reach the maximum assist speed and then benefit from lighter pedaling without assistance.The new Shimano EP8 motor unit is designed to integrate with Shimano’s larger-capacity batteries that were announced earlier this spring.A major part of the new motor’s programming includes an emphasis on smoother power delivery.A new algorithm was developed to more accurately calculate and apply the proper amount of power based on the rider’s pedaling, which also results in a slight range increase as well due to less energy being wasted when it isn’t needed.The new algorithm also helps improve a unique quirk of previous Shimano mid-drive motors that saw e-bikes fitted with the motors sometimes lurch forward when used in the highest pedal assist mode.As Shimano elaborated:The new algorithm constantly calculates the ideal assist ratio for the situation. This simple concept improves the ride quality in all situations, eliminating the lurch forward and wasted energy as the bike accelerates while also continuing to provide additional assistance when the trail gets tougher and the rider works harder.The release of the EP8 sees Shimano holding steady with other industry leaders such as Bosch and Brose, which each released their own new motors recently.New electric bicycles featuring the Shimano EP8 drive system are expected to debut later this year.",ebikes
2020/09/01,"German manufacturer Canyon, one of the world’s leading direct-to-consumer bicycle companies, has just unveiled a pair of high-end electric bicycles as well as a fascinating electric pedal car concept.The introduction of the two new electric bicycles in Canyon’s :ON line follows on the heels of the company’s previous unveiling of its Grail:ON electric gravel bike just last month.Now Canyon is unveiling the new Commuter:ON and Precede:ON e-bikes, both designed for more urban-oriented riders.The Commuter:ON uses a Fazua e-bike drive system, which allows both the motor and the battery to be completely removed from the bike, thus transforming it back into a purely pedal bicycle and reducing its overall weight by 3 kg (6.6 lb). The motor is nominally a 250W system, though it puts out more peak power and also offers 50 Nm of torque for powerful hill climbing assist.The system includes a 252 Wh battery that Canyon claims will be sufficient for 75 km (46.6 mi) of range. Like most European electric bicycles, these are pedal assist-only e-bikes with a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph).The 17 kg (37 lb) bike includes fenders, a discrete rear rack, integrated lights, a built-in display, 12-speed Shimano XT drivetrain, and Shimano hydraulic disc brakes.The Commuter:ON uses an aluminum frame that comes in two styles, a step-over and mid-step frame. Both options start at €3,299 (US$3,900).The new Canyon Precede:ON mixes things up a bit, swapping the aluminum frame for carbon fiber, the chain drive for a Gates belt drive, the Fazua mid-drive for a Bosch mid-drive, and the 12-speed Shimano transmission for an automatic Enviolo continuously variable transmission.The Precede:ON claims to have no visible cables or wires, partially thanks to the Bosch Kiox display and specially integrated brake levers that create a single unified handlebar setup. However, that light button that activates the ultra-bright Supernova Mini 2 Pro looks rather wire-bound to me.The drive unit is a Bosch Performance Line CX that puts out a whopping 85 Nm of torque and is sure to tackle just about anything an urban rider can throw at it. The motor gets paired with a 500 Wh Bosch PowerTube battery that comes with a 65 km (40 mi) range rating.The Precede:ON is available in two frame styles, a step-over and a step-through, with both priced at €4,999 (US$5,950).Both the Canyon Precede:ON and the Commuter:ON will be available for deliveries in spring 2021.While Canyon’s new electric bicycles are definitely headed to market, the company’s new concept vehicle doesn’t have nearly as certain of a future. Designed to demonstrate Canyon’s vision for the future of mobility, the electric pedal car is still an interesting look at how electric bikes and their components can continue to morph into solutions that fit the widest range of commuters.The design follows the concept of a laidback recumbent e-bike, yet offers four wheels like a quadricycle. The 95 kg (209 lb) Canyon capsule concept electric pedal-car uses a fully sealed design to protect riders from the weather. As the company explains:How do you bring total weather protection to an e-bike? This is the question our designers and engineers had to answer with the Future Mobility Concept. The solution is a totally-sealable passenger compartment surrounded by an innovative, panoramic capsule that strikes the perfect blend of form and function. When not sealed to protect against the elements, the capsule can be slid forward along two rails to open the cockpit up. This ‘open mode’ is great when the weather is hot or if the rider wants that fresh-breeze feeling that comes with driving a convertible. The capsule even has enough space behind the rider to seat a child, load luggage or pack up groceries for the ride home. The capsule can then be slid even further forward for easy entry and exit of the vehicle.The unique vehicle uses side-stick steering, similar to a recumbent tricycle, and has a turning radius of 7 meters (23 feet). It even has an optional rear seat for carrying a tandem passenger, though the seat can also be replaced by cargo.The concept includes a large 2,000 Wh battery rated for 150 km (93 miles), though Canyon says that the range can be doubled with a second battery. And if you’ll be spending much time at the podcar’s top speed of 60 km/h (37 mph), then that second battery might be a good idea.In response to whether or not we’ll actually see a concept like this being produced by Canyon, the company provided this convenient non-answer:At Canyon, we firmly believe that the future of our cities lies with new, clean forms of mobility: and we’re committed to contributing to their development. Currently, we are re-orienting ourselves in the area of City & Trekking bikes, and we will focus strongly on urban mobility in a broader sense in the future. In the coming years we will launch more urban bicycle solutions, but the implementation of other concepts like this will also be intensified. The concept gives us a vision that we want to work toward — quickly.In order words, that’s a strong maaaaybe.",ebikes
2020/08/30,"When I say I enjoy a laid back e-bike lifestyle, this isn’t exactly what I had in mind. But I can see the appeal in Catrike’s latest eCAT electric bike line featuring the company’s favorite easy-going recumbent tricycles.For the uninitiated, recumbent bikes are what you’d get if you mashed up a beach lounge chair and a pedal bicycle.Instead of riding in a seated position on a bicycle saddle, recumbents offer more of a lawnchair-style seat that is tilted back, leaving the rider nearly horizontal.And as you might have guessed, an electric recumbent is simply a recumbent bicycle with added power assist from an electric motor and battery. And yes, technically Catrike’s are e-trikes instead of e-bikes since they have a pair of front wheels and single rear wheel in a classic tadpole trike setup.In the case of Catrike’s eCAT e-bikes, the electric recumbents have been gifted a Bosch e-bike drive unit consisting of a Bosch Active Line Plus electric motor and a 400 Wh Bosch PowerPack battery. There’s also a Bosch Purion LCD display mounted on the left handlebar.The Bosch Active Line Plus drive unit sports 50 Nm of torque and can power the eCAT electric recumbent bike up to a max speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). Riders can pedal past that speed, but they’ll be on their own as the motor won’t provide any additional assist beyond its top speed.Under 20 mph (32 km/h) though, the motor can offer a maximum of 270% assist. In other words, for every watt of power you put in, the motor can add around another 2.7 watts.The motor is technically known as a mid-drive, though the geometry of a recumbent means that it is far from the middle of the bike. Instead, it sticks way out in front of the boom. The battery required a novel mounting solution as well, with Catrike creating a unique battery mount under the seat to support the lockable and removable Bosch battery.Catrike says that the 400 Wh battery should be good for 62 miles (100 km) of range. Between the lack of a throttle (Bosch e-bike systems are pedal-assist only) and the lower wind resistance of a recumbent e-bike, that range is likely fairly realistic. When it comes to pricing, I hope you’re laying down for this (heh, get it?!).The eCAT line starts at $4,750 and goes as high as $6,750, depending on which model you fancy. Though considering recumbent tricycles are already fairly expensive and the Bosch drive is one of the pricier mid-drive units out there, the pricing isn’t exactly a shocker in this niche market.What do you think? Are you ready to lay back, kick your feet up, and hit the road? Let us know in the comments below if you could see yourself on a Catrike eCAT electric recumbent.",ebikes
2020/08/27,"Bicycles are perhaps one of the best all-around alternatives to car transport, especially in urban environments. And now a new study has shown that cyclists who switch to an e-bike can end up quadrupling their daily riding distance.The new study, which was published in the latest edition of the journal Transportation Research, studied two groups of people to determine their cycling habits. The first group of cyclists who had recently purchased an e-bike was compared to a second group of pedal bicycle riders who were interested in an e-bike but had not yet made the purchase. A travel diary was used to study the cyclists’ riding behavior and the study was conducted over a six-month period.The researchers found that the new electric bike riders increased their average daily cycling from 2.1 km (1.3 miles) to 9.2 km (5.7 miles), or an increase of around 340%.During the same period, the control group of pedal cyclists showed a negligible change in average daily cycling distance.Additionally, the study found that the e-bike riders increased the share of bicycle transportation as a percentage of all transportation methods from 17% to 49%.The results of the study come at a time when e-bikes sales are skyrocketing in the US.As commuters seek out socially distant ways to navigate the urban jungle, electric bicycles have proven to be a potent combination of utilitarian transportation and recreational joy ride.And an industry shift toward more value-oriented electric bicycles has helped make e-bikes more accessible to a wider audience.While $4,000 electric bicycles still offer high-quality rides, new offerings such as the $999 RadMission from industry leader Rad Power Bikes has opened the door to low-cost yet well-made urban commuter e-bikes.More recreation-oriented e-bikes with fat tires have also been dropping in price recently. Startups like Lectric E-Bikes have gone from garage startups to $20M+ companies overnight by offering popular models like the $899 Lectric XP folding fat tire e-bike.Electric bicycles are also becoming increasingly popular as a form of exercise for weight loss and a general shift toward healthier lifestyles. Some e-bike riders have attributed their 100+ pound weight loss journeys to riding e-bikes and shifting toward a more active way of life.If you’re wondering where to get started with your first e-bike on a budget, check out our guide to some of the best value e-bikes on the market.",ebikes
2020/08/26,"Elegant design and high-quality European manufacturing combine to create the Ampler Stellar, a beautiful and well-made electric bicycle designed to get you cycling all over the city.We’ve covered plenty of high-power and high-speed electric bicycles here on Electrek.The Ampler Stellar is not one of them.Instead, it is a chic and refined electric bicycle with just enough speed and power to take the pain out of cycling. It’s not designed to ferry you around effortlessly, but rather to help you put in some honest pedaling on a high-quality e-bike.And boy, does the Ampler Stellar deliver!Check out my video review below to see this beautiful e-bike in action, then read on for the bike’s tech specs and all of my detailed thoughts on the Ampler Stellar!Everything about the Ampler Stellar feels completely different than nearly any e-bike I’ve tested before.It begins from the moment you open the box. Inside you’ll find an expertly packaged bike and a tool kit supplied in what appears to be a laser-cut wooden box with live hinge. Inside the wooden box is a build card from the Estonian factory that hand-built and tested the bike, and even a piece of Estonian chocolate in a gold coin foil wrap. Details, people. Details.But that’s just the beginning. Once you get to the actual bike, the high-class experience continues. You won’t find some dinky wheel skewer to install your front wheel; instead, you get a true thru-axle. The lights aren’t no-name Chinese OEM lights, either. They’re brand-name Busch+Müller IQ2 EYC lights on the front and LightSKIN LED lights built directly into the back of the seat tube. The whole bike is just so much higher quality than I’m use to seeing on value-oriented e-bikes. In fact, just check out those welds. Among the hundreds of e-bikes I’ve tested over the years, these are probably the second best-looking welds I’ve ever seen, only coming in behind Aventon. In addition to being higher quality, the bike simply looks sharper and cleaner. There’s no extraneous parts or cables or plastic mounts or stickers or absolutely anything unnecessary. The handlebars are just so clean and classy, there’s no visible battery on the frame and the rear hub motor disappears behind the 10-speed cassette and hydraulic brakes. The bike can literally pass for a non-electric bike. In fact, my family is so used to seeing different electric bicycles parade into and back out of my garage that I was asked multiple times why I was switching to a pedal bike.While the Ampler Stellar embodies a simple and classic look, it’s actually packed with technology. Not only does it use a magnetic charging connector, but it also sports Bluetooth connectivity to sync with your phone and provide telemetrics as well as over-the-air firmware updates for the bike.The phone app also serves as an optional display for the bike. You don’t have to use it, as there’s an on/off button on the side of the seat tube, but it’s useful for modifying your ride parameters and keeping tabs on your speed and distance. You can monitor your battery life even without your phone by checking the LED light ring around the on button. It changes from green to yellow to orange to red and then finally to flashing red as the battery slowly drains. But that also requires you to look down at the seat tube if you want to check your battery while riding — not the best angle for a quick peak. So you’ll likely want to use the phone display if you’ve got range anxiety and like to have your battery status data front and center.Alright, so the Ampler Stellar looks great. But how well does it work?In a nutshell, it works amazingly well.Like I mentioned, this isn’t a powerhouse of an e-bike. But it’s no slouch either. While most European-spec e-bikes opt for 36V batteries, Ampler instead chose to go with a 48V system. That means it has more power and torque when placed into its highest pedal assist setting, which is perfect for hill climbing, yet can also provide just a gentle push in its lower assist levels.And sure, the label says 250W, but I’m curious what the peak wattage on this system really is. I’m guessing a fair bit more, based on the bike’s performance that I experienced.While you only get three pedal assist levels to choose from, the bottom bracket incorporates a torque sensor that makes those pedal assist levels more effective and feeling more natural. You also get a whopping 10 pedaling speeds from the Shimano transmission. If you can’t find a comfortable cadence with 10 speeds to choose from, you’re doing something wrong.The Shimano hydraulic disc brakes complement the high-end Shimano Deore RD-T6000 10-speed transmission, again indicating the care and quality that went into both the parts selection and the production of the Ampler Stellar. The battery isn’t huge at just 336 Wh, but I’m actually impressed that they stuffed that much battery into the frame. And since this is a pedal-assist-only e-bike without a throttle, you get similar range compared to a throttle e-bike with twice as much battery.When it comes to a combination of a recreational, transportation and fitness e-bike, the Ampler Stellar has actually become one of my favorite e-bikes for all three tasks. Some e-bikes make great utility bikes, while others are great for getting a workout. But few can do everything so well. The Ampler Stellar is a comfortable e-bike for pedaling, light enough for a hectic daily life, and high-enough quality to last for years. It may not be the quickest or the longest range or the have the highest weight capacity, but despite not taking top prize in any one category, it still gets high marks in just about every category.As you might imagine, higher-end components and European manufacturing do have an impact on the cost. But at a price of €2,490 (approximately $2,900) including EU VAT, the Ampler Stellar is more than fairly priced, especially considering the complete two-year warranty plus the five-year warranty on the frame and fork. They even offer a 14-day free-return period to give customers peace of mind to try out the bike, risk-free.In my opinion, this e-bike offers huge value. Between the built-in technology, included rack and fenders, high-quality components, European manufacturing, and the sleek design that doesn’t even look electric, the Ampler Stellar is an incredible e-bike that can fill so many roles for so many people.If you’re looking for a powerhouse of an e-bike, this isn’t it. But if you want to put in some pedaling on a well-made e-bike designed for nearly every urban task you can throw at it, then the Ampler Stellar will absolutely have you covered.",ebikes
2020/08/25,"The Lectric XP fat tire electric bike from Lectric E-Bikes has developed a massive fan base with nearly 25,000 e-bikes sold. Yet barely more than a year ago, no one had ever heard of a Lectric XP.So where did the massively popular e-bike come from?This is the Lectric XP origin story.Founded by lifelong friends Robby Deziel and Levi Conlow, Lectric E-Bikes first began as a quest to find a more affordable e-bike for Levi’s dad. He was in the market for an electric bike and had seen plenty of fancy $3,000+ e-bikes, but wanted something much more budget-friendly for his first experiment with an e-bike.Robby and Levi saw the opportunity in the market and decided to combine the former’s mechanical engineering background with the latter’s business and entrepreneurism education.They started by designing a simple, inexpensive commuter e-bike that got the job done but didn’t come with any fancy bells or whistles. Levi’s dad invested and the pair had a number of samples built to start testing sales. Things were looking promising until they realized that they couldn’t find any customers. They tried to sell their new design on their website, craigslist, flea markets, and anywhere they could. But no one bought it.So they started gathering feedback from people who tried the bike. And the more they heard, the more they learned. Riders responded that they wanted something that wasn’t as tall as a commuter bike. They wanted something smaller that could be transported without needing a bike rack on the back of their car. They wanted something more comfortable.Robby and Levi took that feedback and returned to the drawing board. And after redesigning the bike, the Lectric XP popped out the other side as that bike we know today. The Lectric XP featured a lower height thanks to its 20″ wheels, yet used fat tires to keep it comfortable even without suspension. It offered a folding mechanism so riders could transport the bike in a trunk instead of on a car rack. It was fast, with a 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed. And most importantly, it was priced at a reasonable $899.The only problem remaining was that they had burnt through their initial loan on the first design. They tried their luck one more time, As Levi explained to Electrek, “I had to go back and ask, ‘Hey Dad, how would you like to lose some more money?'”Now in the summer of 2019 and with enough money for 10 sample bikes, Robby and Levi jumped back into the fire one more time. But this time, they took a different approach. They sent their 10 samples out to 10 different e-bike reviewers (of which I happened to be one of them, barely a year ago this month).It was a huge risk, as they were out of cash and almost out of time. Robby was counting the days before he ran out of rent money and had to move back home.It was at that point when the first reviews were posted. And this time the response was huge. The sales immediately flowed in and quickly became a torrent as more reviews were published. The public went nuts for a fast, powerful fat-tire electric bike for just $899.In just a few weeks they had already hit $1 million in pre-orders. At first the pair were working out of their apartment and garage, but as hundreds of thousand of dollars in pre-sales began to pour in, it became obvious that they were going to need to upgrade. They soon moved into an office complex and added a warehouse. Next came time to build the team.Robby and Levi had been initially handling everything themselves, working 18-hour days and answering the phones non-stop. But soon they learned how important it was to bring in the right people to build out the team. And the first major goal was to build up a good reputation for customer support.As Robby explained, “We know we can’t provide the absolute best e-bike for just $899. But we can provide the best value. And we can provide the best customer support.”And so that’s what they did. As the sales continued to flood in, Lectric E-Bikes expanded their customer support team who often work 12-hour days to answer phones and emails. They started with 10 customer support reps but expect that number to triple by this time next year as they continue to grow. The founders have also made sure to put their staff on their own Lectric XP e-bikes to have firsthand experience, and keep loaners available so that staff can take their friends on rides as well.Robby and Levy have also brought in a new director of operations to bring in outside expertise and experience, who helped further improve the company in the midst of a massive run on e-bikes across the country.As Levi explained: At first it can be hard to let go of running things yourself, especially when you have a smooth operation going. But bringing in our new director of operations has been a huge benefit. She obsesses over performance and details. We first told her about our competitors and how they can have wait times of days for emails and wait times of hours for calls, and how we thought we were doing alright since we had phone wait times of around 20 minutes and maybe up to a day for emails. But she came in and said ‘Nope, that’s not fine by me.’ She wanted those numbers brought down to 97% of phone calls being answered in under one minute and emails being treated more like a customer chat with quick responses. She wanted to make us become the most available electric bike company. And someone with that type of vision, it inspired all of us to get behind it. And now I’m confident in saying we have one of the best if not THE best customer support in the industry now.While letting go of the responsibilities of their company has been difficult for the founders, these kinds of experiences have shown them why it is so critical to bring in new expertise.As Robby elaborated, “We used to wear about 20 hats each, and now we’re wearing more like 10.”Freeing up some of their time has also helped Robby and Levi focus on building their community, which the pair explained has been critical to their success. Lectric E-Bikes spends almost nothing on marketing, instead relying on a community of satisfied customers to spread the word about the Lectric XP e-bike.As Levi continued:We sell an $899 e-bike, we can’t afford to spend much on customer acquistition. Instead, we rely on our customers sharing our story. We’ve created amazing customer advocates, and a big part of that is the good customer support that we provide. The community that we are building is incredibly special and I would say that one of the most rewarding things right now is being out in public and seeing our bikes. We have close to 25,000 bikes out in circulation and it is just so rewarding to see people out there riding our bikes and hear them spreading the word.As Lectric E-Bikes looks toward the future, they’ve continued to focus on expanding their team and their offerings. The company recently launched a new step-through version of the Lectric XP that makes the bike more accessible to riders who have trouble swinging their leg over a bike. As the company continues its skyward trajectory, where will they be a year from now? We’re as excited as anyone else to find out!",ebikes
2020/08/23,"While keyboard warriors have long debated whether or not electric bicycles provide a good workout, the science is conclusive: e-bikes can provide just as effective of a workout as pedal bicycles, and sometimes more.But you don’t have to tell Jon Treffert, a medical devices software developer from Knoxville, Tennessee. He already knows it.Jon had enjoyed cycling as a grad student 30 years ago but gave it up after school. However, three decades and one type 2 diabetes diagnosis later, he was ready to make a change in his life. Weighing 270 lb (122 kg) at the time, Jon was determined to change his lifestyle. Along with focusing on a healthier diet, Jon decided to get back into cycling. But hilly Knoxville was a tall order for someone who hadn’t cycled in three decades. So Jon opted for an accessible, comfortable e-bike from the company Day6 Bikes and began putting on the miles. As time went on, he began increasing his rides and pushing harder.As Jon explained to Selene Yeager in Bicycling:Five months into my journey I reached a milestone of 1,000 miles [1,600 km]. I was riding primarily from home with a typical distance of 30 miles [48 km]  and an elevation gain of 2,000 feet [600 m] at a brisker pace of 15.6 mph [25 km/h].Just over a year into his e-biking journey, Jon had covered over 3,300 miles (5,310 km). But Jon didn’t stop there. He kept riding, and now three years later, he is back to his high school weight of 165 lb (75 kg). Of course Jon’s e-bike wasn’t the only part of his impressive weight loss journey. Rather, it was part of an overall lifestyle shift that included becoming more active and eating healthier.As Jon explained:“Cycling is so great for your mood, joints, and health. It’s such a tonic every time I’m out on the road. I want to motivate people by showing them an enjoyable sustainable pathway to change for which the e-bike is a catalyst and remains a key component. If we can replicate my experiment of one, we can, person by person, make a real change in our obesity and diabetes epidemic.”One of the reasons an e-bike was so useful in helping Jon change his lifestyle was because it lowered the barrier of entry.Electric bicycles still allow the rider to pedal as hard as they want, offering an effective workout, yet they also provide a safety net to help returning riders cycle more safely when further from home. E-bikes are also helpful for taking the edge of off hills, which are one of the biggest obstacles preventing people from picking up biking – a fear of cycling up hills.I’ve worked in the e-bike industry for over a decade, and I recently created a list of my top five tips for anyone who wants to get fit and lose weight with the help fo an e-bike. Check them out below:Choosing the right e-bike is important, and we’ve previously discussed how to choose your first e-bike. But don’t let decision paralysis stop you. There are hundreds of interesting e-bikes out there. You don’t necessarily need to drop $4,000 on a Specialized fitness e-bike (even though it’s a totally awesome e-bike).My brother-in-law rocks the pedal assist function on his $1,199 RadRunner utility bike from Rad Power Bikes. That’s definitely not the first bike you’d think of for fitness, but it works for him and gets him riding. He doesn’t even touch the throttle, opting instead for a low pedal assist level so that he does most of the pedaling work.Even an $899 Lectric XP would make an awesome e-bike for trail riding, and the pedal assist function would allow you to put in a decent afternoon’s effort while the bike simply assists you as much (or as little) as necessary.So don’t let yourself get sucked too far down the rabbit hole of comparing every single nut and bolt on every e-bike. Find something that fits you and your budget and get out there and ride!Pedal-assist, or the ability for the e-bike to multiply your pedaling force, is what makes e-bikes such potent exercise tools for riders that are returning to cycling. And most e-bikes have between four to eight levels of pedal assist, allowing you to fine-tune the amount of extra power provided by the motor.But I always advise new e-bike riders to avoid using the very lowest or very highest pedal assist setting.Some riders mistakenly opt for the very lowest level with the goal of getting the best workout, but this can often leave new riders exhausted and in over their heads. The last thing you want is to find yourself totally spent while you’re still many miles from home.On the other hand, the highest pedal assist is often nearly the equivalent of “full throttle” and usually doesn’t result in much of a workout at all. The highest pedal assist level is best for when climbing steep hills and usually isn’t appropriate for casual riding on flat ground.So like most things in life, moderation is key when it comes to pedal-assist. Try starting in the middle, then working down to a lower pedal assist level as your fitness level improves.It might sound difficult to use your e-bike every day. But the best way to achieve it is to incorporate your e-bike into your life as a form of transportation, not just as a piece of exercise equipment. Try to replace as many car trips as you can with your e-bike. If you just need a couple of things from the store, toss on a backpack (or add a pair of panniers) and ride there instead of taking the car.If you’re visiting your friends at the coffee shop, consider riding instead of taking an Uber.Find any way you can to fit the e-bike into your daily schedule. The more you ride, the more it becomes integrated into your lifestyle. If you have the option of riding off-road, I highly recommend including it at least occasionally in your rides.Bike lanes are great for transportation and roads are certainly easier for efficient pedaling, but there’s nothing more enjoyable than pedaling down a nature trail with the sights, sounds, and smells of the earth around you. You don’t have to find a crazy, super technical single-track course; in fact, it’s better if you can ride on a relaxed, easy-going, and flat trail in the beginning. The point isn’t to make the ride harder, but rather just to mix it up with a more pleasant atmosphere.Whether you’ve got a local beach path, a forest trail, dirt roads, or any other piece of land that hasn’t been paved, you’ll be surprised how big of a difference it can make if you’re used to riding on the road.And anything you can do to make the e-biking experience more relaxed and fun will go a long way towards ensuring that e-biking becomes integrated into your lifestyle and not relegated to the side as just some task that you know you should complete.Lastly, try and find at least one other person to ride with. It could be a riding group or even just a friend that you convinced to get an e-bike after you discovered how much fun they are.Riding with others can be another great way to ensure that you’re getting out there more often. Both of you will keep each other honest since its harder to blow off a ride when you already told someone you’d meet them.You don’t even need to find another e-bike companion. A good friend of mine is a performance cyclist and we go on rides together all the time. I could never keep up with his fancy (non-electric) gravel bike on my own, but my e-bike helps me pace him and we enjoy rides together on the same trails, even though he’s a much stronger cyclist than I am. My e-bike helps level the playing field and allows us to ride together.Ultimately, e-biking for exercise and fitness is all about putting in the time so that you can reap the rewards.For some people, the reward is a lower number on the scale or a few holes down on the belt.For others, those are just side benefits that accompany the main reward of finding a fun new hobby that brightens their day.For me, e-biking has become a mixture of fitness, recreation, and transportation. I can do it all on just one e-bike, and I wouldn’t have it any other way!",ebikes
2020/08/22,"What has 1,500 peak watts and can climb mountain trails like a billy goat? Jeep’s new e-bike, apparently. And now Jeep and its partners are sharing new updates about the powerful new off-road, fat-tire electric bicycle.Car companies have been jumping on the e-bike bandwagon left and right over the past few years.And now that e-bike sales are skyrocketing, electric two-wheelers are more lucrative to automotive companies than ever.So it wasn’t a huge shock when Jeep decided to add a rugged off-road e-bike to complement the brand’s off-road four-wheeled vehicles.The bigger surprise was how much power Jeep had incorporated into the fat tire e-bike. While other car companies have stuck with cute little 250W hub motors, Jeep went in a different direction by adopting a 750W continuous-rated and 1,500W peak-rated mid-drive motor known as the Bafang Ultra.Through a partnership with the e-bike company QuietKat, earlier this year Jeep launched its new off-road full-suspension electric bicycle with a powerful motor.The bikes went on sale in March at a whopping $5,899. Compared to other popular fat tire e-bikes like the $1,499 RadRover from Rad Power Bikes or the even lower-priced $899 Lectric XP e-bike, that’s a pretty steep price. But Jeep apparently sold enough of the bikes to move forward with the project, as the company has now announced that shipping of the first models will begin within a week.To celebrate the upcoming shipping, QuietKat has also shared some new videos showing the Jeep e-bike in action.In the video below, the team took the Jeep e-bike up some very steep mountain roads to show off its powerful climbing ability.With 160 Nm (118 ft-lb) of torque, that Bafang Ultra motor makes quick work of nearly any trail. In fact, I’ve experienced the incredible climbing power of that motor myself. Last year I visited the Chinese factory where the Jeep e-bike is produced and had the opportunity to ride a similar e-bike up a downhill e-bike course. The owners of the bike park had said that previously only dirt bikes like the electric Sur Ron had managed to climb the trail backwards, and that the Bafang Ultra-powered e-bikes we rode were the first bicycles to ever perform the feat.So suffice it to say that while pricey, the Jeep e-bike is loaded with one of the most powerful mid-drive motors available on a retail e-bike.And when you add in the high-end RockShox suspension, 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes, the 10-speed transmission, and the rest of the high-end components, it’s safe to say that those early adopters are in for quite a thrilling ride when the Jeep e-bikes start shipping soon.",ebikes
2020/08/21,"Despite its name not doing the bike any favors, the Cyrusher XF650 is a powerful fat tire e-bike that could be an excellent way to shred everything from bike lanes to off-road trails.For those still scratching their heads, “Cyrusher” is a portmanteau of “cycling” and “rusher”, a name that Harry Xie chose when he founded the company in order to double down on his goal of pushing (or “rushing”) the e-bike industry forward.From my testing of the Cyrusher XF650, I can definitely say that the bike provides quite a rush. The combination of a powerful 48 V system and those joy-riding fat tires results in a fast e-bike with almost no limits to where you can ride.And those bright colors sure are fun too!Check out my video review below showing the Cyrusher XF650 in action. Then keep reading for my full written review.The Cyrusher XF650 comes in a number of bright colorways that are much louder than the bike itself.Powered by a geared 1,000 W rear hub motor, the Cyrusher XF650 cruises along fairly quietly, which is great for exploring trails without bothering the nature around you.Those fat tires are perfect for everything from off-road riding to standard bike lanes and city streets.The bike ships with a rather limiting 15.5 mph (25 km/h) speed limiter, but it’s easy enough to remove to have some high speed 26 mph (42 km/h) fun!For those wanting to do the operation themselves, just enter the menu and change the P08 setting to ’50’. Now go have fun!Of course, the range is much better when you keep it in the limited speed mode. The Cyrusher’s 48 V and 13 Ah battery offers 624 Wh of battery. That’s enough for around 25-30 miles (40-48 km) of throttle-only riding or even more if you use the pedal-assist option.If you remove the speed limiter then you’ll of course see a decrease in range, so that’s something to consider if you’re a speed demon.When it comes to bike components, the Cyrusher XF650 sets you up with a decent selection, though nothing is top shelf. The brakes are Zoom hybrid hydraulic disc brakes. That means they use a cable to actuate the brake from the handlebar levers, but have a hydraulic piston at the caliper that uses its hydraulics to apply the actual braking force onto medium-sized 180 mm rotors.The bicycle transmission uses a 7-speed Shimano shifter and derailleur that isn’t high-end but is good enough for the leisure/recreational riding of a bike like this.There’s a built-in headlight that runs off the main battery and is absolutely not just for show – that sucker is bright!The coil spring saddle is wide enough to give a nice comfy base, perhaps at the slight expense of some serious pedaling movement. But let’s be honest, this is a big ol’ fat tire e-bike. No one is going to be going pedal-only on this thing very often. With the addition of the ample pedal assist, a bit of a wider saddle is a nice addition to the bike.That saddle also helps complement the front suspension and provides some nice ride comfort. With no rear suspension, the saddle and fat tires have to work together to cushion the rear (i.e. your rear).The bike even includes fenders and a rear rack, though mine arrived missing the front fender bolt. One trip to the home improvement store and I had my front fender and headlight bolted in place and was ready to ride. This is not a budget e-bike and it’s not a low-power commuter e-bike. The Cyrusher XF650 is for having some serious fun.The motor is powerful and torquey for all of your shenanigans, plus the battery gives you enough range for an afternoon of riding, though you can also upgrade to a higher capacity 840 Wh battery if you really want to go nuts.The 4″ wide Kenda tires are where the magic happens — they get that torque down to the asphalt or the dirt and make the bike super fun for flying through corners.The only downside I could see in terms of performance was that braking wasn’t as powerful as I would have liked for a bike of this power level. When you have plenty of go, you also want plenty of stop.Four-piston hydraulic disc brakes are becoming much more common on electric mountain bikes and fat tire e-bikes, and so I’d love to see the Cyrusher XF650 be gifted a nice set of 4-piston stoppers.But in terms of rolling everything into a single package, I think the company did a pretty good job. Compared to something like the industry-standard RadRover at $1,499, the Cyrusher XF650 is a bit pricer at $1,799. For the extra cost, you get hybrid hydraulic brakes, theoretically higher peak power (though Rad doesn’t publish their peak power ratings so it could be similar), higher top speed, an included rear rack, and a wide range of color options. Oh yea, and a name that is much harder to pronounce when people stop you and inevitably ask you, “hey man, what IS that thing?!”If speed and power are your thing, the Cyrusher XF650 might be a good option for you. It has plenty of both and will take you just about anywhere you could ever want to go on two wheels.",ebikes
2020/08/20,"Last year, I reviewed the Gazelle CityZen T9 ebike and thought it was a fantastic offering for those people content with 20mph assist speeds on smoother roads. But as someone who commutes on rougher backcountry roads, I much prefer getting close to 30mph before the electric assist cuts off. That not only means a Class 3 capable motor but some other improvements are necessary to the bike.Today we are looking at the answer to most of my concerns with the T9:  Gazelle’s Medeo T10+In our CityZen T9 review, I noted that there were 2 things I would improve about the bike before I’d consider owning one:The 20 mph (32 km/h) power cutoff and thin Continental tires didn’t work well with my commute and lifestyle. I usually spend most of my e-bike ride in the mid-upper 20s (upper 30s in km/h) on flat ground (slower on uphill, faster downhill obviously). Also, the roads in my area aren’t smooth at all and in fact can be quite bumpy.The Medeo T10+ is a similar sturdy aluminum bike with similar sporty geometry. It also includes all of the same high-quality literal bells and whistles, including integrated:You are also looking at the similar high-quality 10-speed Shimano Deore external drivetrain and Shimano BR-MT420 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes. Both are rock solid and feel like they will last years before they will need work.While these seem like high-end parts, Gazelle actually makes a $500 more expensive version of this bike with the same drivetrain called the “Ultimate”. Besides the paint job and maybe the front lighting, I’d personally save the $500…In other words, this thing is loaded to the teeth with high-end components and has the same $3500 price tag as the T9. I know a lot of people want amazing bikes with top tier components for $1000 but the reality is that Bosch probably charges more than that for the drivetrain alone. Add over 100 years of Dutch engineering and high-end integrated parts and the price actually makes a lot of sense. This bike is going to last years!The T10+  also upgrades the wheels to wider Schwalbe Big Apple tires and a Suntour Mobie A32 NLO suspension fork which totally changes the ride experience on rough roads. I’m not a stickler for suspension on commuter bikes and to be honest, I’ve had some bad experiences with low end, too soft front fork suspension. But the adjustable Suntour here is the best of both worlds. Firm enough not to get in the way while pumping and soft enough to cushion those big potholes. The tires/wheels are also the Goldilocks of just big and soft enough, yet efficient.Combined with the stiff frame and the bigger tires, it is hard to find something to complain about in the ride. Gazelle offers 3 sizes of this bike (45, 50, 55) and also offers a mid-step version of this bike in an aqua color:The biggest and most important upgrade here is the motor. The T9 did an admirable job but cutting out at 20mph (as a Class 1 ebike motor should do) was disappointing. Bosch Performance Line Speed 4.0 keeps the power coming all the way up to 28 miles per hour. Although 8 miles per hour might not seem like a lot, on the 30-35mph roads, it is the difference between riding with traffic and having to edge to the side of the road to get passed. I have to say that I’m always impressed with the amount of efficient power Bosch is able to squeeze out of its motors. You are going to get close to 20 miles of range on turbo mode and 3 times that on eco. I’ve tested this on my hilly commute and find the numbers to be very accurate if not a little conservative, especially in the realm of fantastical ebike range ratings. Bosche’s latest version of the Performance speed has also dropped some weight although I think it might have also dropped some sound insulation. Meanwhile, the motor is extremely powerful with its 75-85nm of torque. It will both get you up the steepest of hills and to 28mph with ease. Bosch even managed to drop some weight from its speed line of motors making this bike barely heavier than the smaller T9 at around 50lbs. The Purian display is minimalist but gets the job done very well.I’m not certain if I had the 75nm or 85nm of torque since Bosch is upgrading its motors for more torque with a software update. But either way, this thing has all the power you need in pedal assist. You can add a second battery to this bike bringing the total to 1kWh of battery and range that extends beyond 100 miles for those longer “insane on a bike” commutes.No bike is perfect and I’m sticking to this being the “best commuter bike for me that I’ve ridden.”  But I’ll list some areas where Gazelle might reach a wider audience with some improvements.I’m really not looking forward to giving this one back and returning to my 2017 Raleigh Redux IE with Brose drivetrain. I’ll miss the suspension and the splashproof fenders and swept-back handlebars for sure. But what I’ll probably miss most is the reliability, range, and sheer hill-chomping torque of the Bosch Performance line Speed system. The T10+ is a truly great commuter.Maybe they’ll forget to pick it up?FRAME/FRONT FORK• Frame: Stable lightweight aluminium sloping frame with 70,5° headset angle and 73° saddle tube anglefor a sporty posture and precise handling.

2020/08/19,"Less than two months ago, electric bicycle manufacturer Sondors quietly announced three new high-powered e-bikes that were unlike anything the company had made before. The new e-bikes are part of the upcoming Sondors Elite line and are now taking orders for the second production run of the new models.Don’t expect these new e-bikes to be mass produced, at least not according to Sondor’s marketing.The company says that the new Sondors Elite e-bikes will be part of a small production batch, described on the Sondor’s site as “Small Batch Precision Production — Extremely Limited Reservation Opportunities Now Available in North America Only.”After selling out of the initial production run that will ship in October of this year, the next batch of production is expected to begin shipping in January 2021.There are three types of e-bikes included in the new Sondors Elite range, each of which is powered by the Bafang Ultra mid-drive motor. That motor, whose official designation is the Bafang M620, is one of the most powerful electric bicycle motors on the market outside of specialty DIY motors.The motors can provide up to 1,600 W of peak power, though Sondors appears to have throttled them back down to around 1,200 W of peak power with a controller limited to 25 A. That’s the amount of power the system pulls during peak loading, which generally occurs during acceleration or hill climbing (peak watts are calculated by current (amps) x voltage (volts). The bikes are marketed as 750W continuous, which is the nominal wattage of the motors.That still leaves plenty of power, and the large 48 V 21 Ah batteries should last even longer with the more reasonable power level compared to other Bafang Ultra-powered e-bikes that use every bit of extreme power from the motors. At just over 1 kWh, the battery packs are rated by Sondors for between 40-60 miles (64-96 km) of range on a single charge.The three bikes in the Sondors Elite lineup include the Sondors Rockstar, Sondors Cruiser, and Sondors LX.The Sondors Rockstar is the only full-suspension bike in the trio, offering 150 mm of rear travel, a “bespoke forged and machined aluminum alloy frame”, and a top speed of at least 28 mph (45 km/h). The Rockstar is priced at $2,599 but can be pre-ordered with a $299 deposit.The Sondors Cruiser is the polar opposite of the Sondors Rockstar, at least in terms of frame design. It features a rigid fork and hardtail, so there’s no suspension other than the balloon tires.The frame is also a low-step design for increased accessibility. The Sondors Cruiser is a bit more affordable than the Rockstar as well, priced at $1,999 with a $299 deposit.Lastly, the Sondors LX is something of the Goldilocks e-bike in the lineup. It features front suspension similar to the Sondors Rockstar yet has a step-through frame and hardtail design like the Sondors Cruiser. The Cruiser also sports fat mountain bike-style tires, further confusing its classification between a performance trail bike and a laid-back cruiser-style bike.For their part, Sondors describes the LX as “a premium mid-drive sport utility fat electric bike with an all-new low-entry, elevated chainstay frame.”The LX is also priced at $1,999 with a $299 deposit. First of all, it’s great to see Sondors expanding into the high-performance category of e-bikes.It’s not like we haven’t seen some awesome Bafang Ultra-powered e-bikes before. But many of them come from smaller companies with less brand awareness than Sondors.Sondors’ name carries some decent weight in the e-bike industry and could help put more of these high-powered e-bikes into Americans’ garages.The pricing is also pretty nuts. Most Bafang Ultra-powered e-bikes start well north of $3,000. So to see Sondors opening at $2000 is impressive.My only two caveats are that we still haven’t seen any real images of the Sondors Elite lineup and that Sondors is pretty mum on component specs.For inside looks, all we’ve gotten from the company so far are renders. Where are the bikes? Are they out there, Sondors? Show us the goods!And for components, we’re also fairly in the dark. What kind of brakes are you using? What about suspension? Bars, drivetrain, tires, anything? Give us some details, Sondors![Author’s note: This article previously omitted the 750W nominal rating of the motors as well as the fact that the original production run planned for October shipping had already been sold out. The article has been updated to include this information.]",ebikes
2020/08/18,"We’ve seen lightweight e-bikes before, but none have ever approached the 15.15-lb (6.872 kg) Freicycle electric bike built by mechanical engineer Dennis Freiburg. His featherweight e-bike recently set a new Guinness World Record for the Lightest Electric Bicycle – Prototype.The Freicycle took Freiburg the better part of a year to design and build, serving as part of a project for his doctoral degree.Built on a carbon Merida Scultura road bike, the Freicycle benefited from the start with an ultralightweight frame weighing less than 2.2 lb (1 kg).Freiburg kept the rest of the weight down with as much carbon fiber as possible for critical load-bearing components such as the wheels, fork, and cranks. Other components that couldn’t be sourced light enough were 3D-printed, such as special ultralight pedals.But of course, the beating heart and soul of any electric bicycle are the motor and battery. For the motor, Dennis relied on a decidedly low-tech but lightweight solution: a friction drive. Lightweight hub motors and mid-drive motor exist, but they can’t compare to the minimalism of a properly-designed friction drive.These types of e-bike drives have been around for decades due to their simplicity. A powered roller is pressed against the bicycle tire, requiring minimal mounting and zero gearing. Freiburg used a brushless RC helicopter motor capable of putting out 600 watts of power, wrapped in an abrasive sleeve to provide grip to the rear tire.The torque of the motor causes its simple mount to swing down and engage the rear tire. When the motor’s power is cut, the spring-loaded mechanism pulls it back out of the way of the tire. Simple. Effective. Light.Since the Freicycle was built in Europe, the motor is limited to a street-legal 250 W and a top speed of 15.5 mph (25 km/h). But when unlimited, the Freicycle can apparently reach speeds of up to 30 mph (48 km/h) with its full 600 W of power.An easy way to save on weight would be to install a tiny battery. A watch battery might make the wheel spin a revolution or two with a step-up converter, but it wouldn’t take you very far. To cut down on shenanigans like that, Guinness requires a battery of at least 137 Wh for a valid record attempt. Freiburg built a regulation battery and managed to stuff it inside a lightweight drink bottle held in place by a 3D-printed bottle cage. The bottle cap even serves double duty as the on/off switch, which you can see in the video below. The battery isn’t huge, but with enough pedaling it will apparently take the rider between 12-22 miles (19-35 km).I’ve ridden lightweight e-bikes before that passed the one-finger lift test, but I’ve never seen a 15 lb e-bike. And while this obviously isn’t something that you can buy today, the DIY nature of the project is still impressive. We’ve featured a number of DIY e-bike builds and even undertaken our own. But we’ve never seen anything quite like this!As e-bike construction continues to evolve and more carbon fiber e-bikes reach production in the coming months, it will be interesting to see if a retail e-bike can ever challenge Dennis for the record.via: Newatlas",ebikes
2020/08/17,"One of the things that I love about the electric bicycle industry is that there is so much room for innovation and creative design. And the JackRabbit 2.0 might be one of the best examples of out-of-the-box e-bike design I’ve seen in a long time. And boy, does it give me a chuckle too!Referred to by the company as a “mini e-bike”, the JackRabbit 2.0 lacks functional pedals and instead opts for folding foot pegs, thus making it technically more of a seated electric scooter. Whatever you want to call it, there’s no doubt that it’s going to draw looks wherever it goes.The JackRabbit 2.0 was designed to incorporate the best advantages of both electric scooters and electric bicycles. I’m not sure it managed to snag the aesthetics of either, but at least its odd design does serve a purpose.After a successful Kickstarter brought the JackRabbit 1.0 to life two years ago, the company is back with a number of design improvements.Compared to most scooters, the JackRabbit 2.0 sports large 20″ wheels. Yet compared to most e-bikes, it also sports an ultralight weight of just 23 lb (10.4 kg).The JackRabbit 2.0 features a 300W continuous-rated hub motor that can propel the bike up to 20 mph (32 km/h). The bike actually pushes a peak 336W from the 158 Wh battery comprised of 21700 cells. That’s not face-melting speed or power by any stretch of the imagination, but is better than most electric scooters or bikes in this price range. The company claims that testing shows the battery is good for between 9 to 18 miles (14.5 to 29 km) of range, with an average of around 12 miles (20 km). So this obviously isn’t a long range commuter. Rather, the JackRabbit is designed for utility and short trips. Its lightweight and compact design make it easy to lift and stowaway like a scooter.Part of the comical look comes from a mismatch of proportions. The rear wheel sports a fat tire for a better ride, while the front wheel rocks a narrower tire to reduce weight. The wheelbase is dramatically shortened, which results in a turning radius of just 33 inches (84 cm) – narrow enough to pull a U-ey in a hallway.The funny little bike is claimed to fit rider heights from 4’10” to 6’3″ (147 to 191 cm), and up to 240 lb (109 kg) of rider weight. The frame has also been structurally tested to conform to ISO 4210 Part 6: vertical frame fatigue; 100,000 cycles at 1000N load (just over 100 kg or 220 lb).And despite the jarring look, the JackRabbit 2.0 actually seems to offer some decent features. I spy a disc brake, a folding handlebar/foot pegs that makes the bike just 7″ (18 cm) wide when folded, USB charger and a lockable/removable battery hidden in the frame.The JackRabbit 2.0 carries an MSRP of $999. But thanks to the current Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, pre-orders are going for a 50% discount at just $499. The company expects delivery to occur in December of this year.As always, we advise caution with any crowdfunding campaign since you are essentially backing a project and not directly buying a product. In this case, the company has run a successful campaign before and so is likely a safer bet than a brand new startup.In terms of the vehicle, this is definitely a bike (or scooter?) for someone that doesn’t get all bent out of shape about what other people think about them. I’d say there’s a minimum level of healthy self-confidence required to scoot around on this thing.While it does look silly though, I can see the utility. Those folding handlebars and foot pegs mean you can stick this thing up against a wall and take up only 7″ of space – that’s pretty awesome for the narrow spaces that many of us live and work in.And for that pre-order price of $499, this seems like a great deal for a 20 mph (32 km/h) bike/scooter-thing that can easily hit commuter-level speeds.I do wonder how well it handles at high speeds due to that short wheelbase, but the riders in the videos seem to be doing just fine (see below).I’m looking forward to testing the JackRabbit 2.0 out at some point before I can give it any kind of real recommendation. In the meantime though, I applaud the team for the out-of-the-box thinking and thank them for a good chuckle – something we could probably all use right now.",ebikes
2020/08/15,"Delfast’s bikes are normally known for their excessively large batteries and equally excessively high speeds. But now the Kyiv-based company is heading into decidedly dirtier territory with their new Delfast Cross Dirt electric bike. And you’re definitely going to want to see the specs this new e-bike is packing.First of all, you should know that Delfast is playing fast and loose with the term “e-bike.”Just like Delfast’s other 80 km/h (50 mph) police-edition “e-bikes” and the company’s high-power consumer “e-bikes,” the new Delfast Cross Dirt has handlebars, two wheels, and pedals, but that’s pretty much where the bicycle components end and the light motorcycle realm begins.And when you check out the performance specs of the bike, the picture becomes even more clear.The Delfast Cross Dirt boasts a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) thanks to its 3,000W continuous, 5,000W peak-rated rear hub motor.The bike is available with two battery options. The smaller of the two batteries is still fairly huge at 1.9 kWh. Delfast rates it as sufficient for 120 km (74 miles) of range when riding at slow-ish speeds (likely around 32 km/h or 20 mph). But you could also opt for a certifiably gigantic 2.76 kWh battery pack rated for 280 km (174 miles) – but again those ranges are calculated at slower speeds. The batteries feature Bluetooth BMS modules to allow the user to monitor battery health at the cell-level via their smartphone.For anyone that doubts Delfast’s range capabilities, you can take your complaint up with Guinness World Records. Delfast set the record for the longest-range production e-bike when a different model rode 380 km (236 miles) after having its pedals removed to ensure the ride was performed entirely on battery power.Of course, we like to joke that those pedals are vestigial anyways, as who really pedals a 55 kg (121 lb) bike that can do 80 km/h (50 mph)?The Delfast Cross Dirt is built on an enduro-style frame that the company backs with a lifetime warranty. The bike sports DNM suspension, moto-style saddle, 19″ moto wheels with sand/off-road tires, dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes with large 203mm rotors in the front and rear, and high/lo beam lights for riding off of the beaten path.The bike also includes a built-in alarm and GPS tracker (though you have to provide your own SIM card if you want the bike to phone home and let you know where it is).Delfast is positioning the Cross Dirt electric bike as a competitor to the highly popular Sur Ron electric trail bike, based on marketing from the company’s site.That’s going to be a bit of a tough sell since the Sur Ron already comes with a highly-respected reputation, solid distribution network, a huge community of modders, and aftermarket parts. But Delfast makes the case that despite the slightly higher price (€3,699 or approximately $4,370), the Delfast Cross Dirt includes other advantages such as built-in pedals and a larger battery option.Can Delfast take on the Sur Ron? That’s going to be a tall order, but we’ll wait and see once the first bikes start making deliveries after production begins in September.Until then, let us know what you think. Does Delfast stand a chance against Sur Ron? Sound off in the comment section below!",ebikes
2020/08/12,"As someone who travels almost entirely by two-wheeled electric vehicles, I’ve found that major GPS navigation apps can sometimes be just as precarious as they are helpful. Usually intended for cars, most GPS navigation apps can occasionally send us micromobility users onto unfriendly streets. But now ScootRoute is solving that problem with a highly customizable navigation app designed specifically to help riders of e-bikes, e-scooters, and other micromobility devices stick to safer roads.ScootRoute works in cities and suburbs, letting riders select specific perimeters to receive customized turn-by-turn GPS directions.Factors such as hill-climbing tolerance, traffic, bike lane availability, road type, and speed limits can be adjusted by the user, according to their preferences.An electric mountain bike rider might want to include the option for shortcuts across off-road trails, while a scooter rider will likely prefer sticking to streets with bike lanes or low speed limits.The app also uses three different mapping technologies and includes voice-based turn-by-turn navigation so riders don’t have to look down at their phone while navigating. Commonly used routes can also be saved to access quickly in the future.ScootRoute is the brainchild of Meghan Braley, a Vespa rider who wanted to find a better way to help smaller vehicles navigate cities and suburbs more safely. She was so passionate about the idea that she left her job at a Fortune 500 company in order to pursue her goal of developing the app.Being a Vespa rider for more than 10 years, commuting with endless traffic, sporadic bike lanes and confusing signals is frustrating. Popular navigation apps would route me on to highways and off-road bike trails, and I couldn’t find the best and safest streets to get to my destination. Fully committing to the launch of ScootRoute, I left my senior level position at a fintech company, partnered with a local development shop focused on startups and created ScootRoute™, a navigation app designed exclusively for the growing micro-mobility market.ScootRoute is available as a free download for both Android and Apple iOS devices.I love this idea and I think it could be perfect for a lot of riders out there.When I’m on my electric motorcycles, I can stick with Waze or Google Maps. But when I switch to my e-bike, e-scooters, e-skateboards, or other micromobility devices, I always have to take GPS directions as a suggestion. Waze and Google Maps both give me the option to avoid interstates, which is helpful, but I never know if I’m being routed onto a cute little 20 mph avenue with bike lanes or a 45 mph local highway with zero shoulder.Bicycle or walking directions on Google Maps can also be useful, but they often route me onto trails that I can’t take with my scooters or skateboards, meaning I have to backtrack and find another way.So a dedicated app designed for riders like me that can safely route to paths that are appropriate for my different micromobility vehicles sounds like an awesome idea to me!",ebikes
2020/08/11,"For the last few years, the RadWagon has set the benchmark for affordable, capable electric cargo bikes. But that didn’t stop Rad Power Bikes from rolling out a series of upgrades this year to make the new RadWagon 4 better than ever.We’ve previously discussed how useful electric cargo bikes can be, with both consumers and businesses showing higher rates of e-cargo bike adoption.Many families are finding that an electric cargo bike can replace the need for a second car (or their first car in some cities!) while many businesses have been able to reduce costs by switching to delivery via electric bicycles similar to the RadWagon 4.The RadWagon 4 and its latest updates to the popular RadWagon platform could very well be the new standard by which budget-friendly electric cargo bikes are judged.Check out my video review of the RadWagon 4 below, then keep reading for my detailed experiences on the bike.Rad Power Bikes made some big changes on the RadWagon 4.The most obvious change is a redesigned frame with smaller wheels. The wheels are both smaller diameter and wider, meaning the bike doesn’t sit quite as high and the tires have larger air volume to absorb more road shock or improve handling on less-than-ideal terrain.The new wheel size contributes to the single largest change in the feel of the bike. While riding, the bike feels noticeably more like a traditional bike and less like a stretched cargo bike. A big part of that is due to the lower ride height. The previously taller axles and larger wheels meant the whole bike had to sit higher, including the rear rack and cargo. With the new smaller diameter wheels, the bike rides more comfortably even with the rear rack loaded down with cargo or kids (more on that in a moment).The one downside to the new tire size is that you are now locked into Rad Power Bikes as your single tire and tube supplier. This isn’t as big of an issue when it comes to tires as some nitpickers will make it out to be. Most people don’t go through more than one pair of tires in a season. However, you’ll want to pick up a few spare tubes when you buy the RadWagon 4 since your local bike shop likely won’t stock this 22″ diameter size. And punctured tubes have a habit of popping up when we least expect them. So be prepared and grab some tubes in advance.While the frame and wheel redesign are the most obvious changes to the RadWagon 4, there are other smaller changes that improve the performance and utility of the bike.The new geared hub motor replaces the previous direct-drive motor. Both provide 750 W, but the new motor is torquier yet smaller. It will likely run more efficiently and be a boon on hill climbing, though it does remove the previously available regenerative braking feature.As we’ve discussed in the past though, regenerative braking on electric bikes only adds a small amount of efficiency, and its larger benefit is usually increasing the life of brake pads instead of substantially increasing range.The RadWagon 4 also received a new telescoping seat post. Paired with the lower frame, it offers a wide range of heights to fit riders between 5’1″ to 6’4″ (155 to 198 cm). I’m comfortably in the middle of that range and was happy as a clam. A new adjustable handlebar stem also helps riders of varying heights and arm lengths adjust the bike for the perfect fit.As I mentioned, the ride is better than ever thanks to the smaller wheels and redesigned frame. The previous RadWagon was already a pretty good ride, but could feel a bit gangly when the high rear rack was loaded down with an adult-sized passenger or lots of cargo.I found that while riding the RadWagon 4 without cargo on it, it basically felt like a typical e-bike during pretty much all scenarios outside of low-speed maneuvering. There’s no hiding that the bike is long, especially when wheeling it around your garage.You should also note that there’s no suspension on the RadWagon 4. I barely noticed the lack of suspension though, even while riding on grass. The balloon-ish tires are great for road riding and I even took some grassy shortcuts that the bike handled just fine.While testing with a few kids on the back, the new lower design performed well and kept me feeling super stable. I also opted for the running boards (which are now an accessory) and the deck pads to make sure my nephews had a nice and comfortable seat. There are also footpeg accessories if you don’t want the added bulk of wooden running boards.In fact, there is a really wide range of accessories that can be used to completely customize the RadWagon 4 and turn it into the perfect utility or cargo bike for your needs, from grocery shopping to neighborhood carpool duty.The RadWagon 4 continues to use largely the same tried-and-true electronics found on other Rad Power Bikes. The 672 Wh battery is larger than the industry average and should net you between 25-45 miles (40-75 km) of range depending on whether you go full throttle or like to take it easy with modest pedal assist.In fact, the fairly standard battery across most of Rad Power Bike’s lineup offers a nice advantage if you happen to have multiple bikes. My brother-in-law rides a RadRunner and if I was planning a really long trip, I could swing by his place and “borrow” his battery for a bit, doubling my range. Rad also carries spare batteries, but what is family for if you can’t steal their stuff?The motor is plenty powerful and gets me up to 20 mph (32 km/h) in less time than I’d expect, especially for a big bike like this. The torquey geared motor combined with the higher torque from a smaller diameter wheel means the bike can accelerate swiftly and make quick work of hills.Rad had a few years to work on upgrades to the popular RadWagon platform and it seems like they really nailed it.A few compromises were made in moving to a proprietary wheel size and doing away with regenerative braking, but the small tradeoffs are greatly offset by the enhanced utility and rideability of the RadWagon 4.At just $1,599, the RadWagon is a fully-capable electric cargo bike that costs less than some non-electric cargo bikes. I still don’t understand how Rad Power Bikes can build such good e-bikes for such reasonable prices, but I’m glad they’ve somehow figured out the magic formula.",ebikes
2020/08/10,"Tern’s flagship utility e-bike GSD has been setting the benchmark for ultra-convenient utility/cargo e-bikes since 2017. And now the company has just announced the new Tern GSD G2, the latest iteration of the GSD with significant updates to the design.Despite maintaining the same footprint as a standard bicycle, the Tern GSD is designed as a do-anything utility e-bike with a large enough (and strong enough) rear frame design to carry two children or one adult passenger, in addition to the main adult rider.Rated for a gross vehicle weight of 440 lb (200 kg), the GSD is one of the heaviest-hauling e-bikes on the market.The bike offers tool-free adjustments that allow it to fit riders from 4’11” to 6’5″ (150-195 cm). The seat tube angle has been slackened while the handlebar adjustment range has been heightened to increase the range of riders that can comfortably fit on the bike.The bike’s telescoping seat post and folding handlebars help reduce the size of the GSD for easy transport, such as when placing it into a car. Its vertical parking option also helps it take up less space in small apartments.The new Tern GSD G2 gets a beefier frame that includes what Tern calls its Easy-Step design (essentially a mid-step frame that looks like something between a step-through and a step-over frame). The truss design of the frame has been optimized for maximum stiffness and rigidity, while a new custom-designed suspension fork in all models and a suspension seat post in the higher-spec models keep the ride feeling nice and comfortable.Tern stuck with Bosch motors and batteries for the GSD 2, but upgraded to the newest Bosch Gen 4 Cargo Line motors. That adds more power to the GSD with up to 85 Nm of torque and up to 400% pedal assist. Higher spec models also get an upgrade to Gates Belt Drive systems and even a Rohloff internally geared hub with 14 speeds and electronic shifting as well as automatic downshifting.For lighting, every GSD model gets Tern’s RearStop Brake Light system with always-on functionality when the bike is in use. Higher spec models also get fitted with an Ignis 700 lumen wide-throw headlight with low- and high-beam selector.The bike also features the patented Atlas Lockstand kickstand. The design is stronger and more stable, plus it features Auto Lock and a Remote Unlock lever on the handlebars. For anyone looking to run their own e-bike kiddie carpool, a sturdy locking kickstand may be an important upgrade.The three new models of the GSD will be available in the US beginning in Q4 of 2020 with a starting price of US$4,599.I’ve only spent a short amount on the higher-spec GSD, but the bike definitely impressed me with the amount of utility it offers in such a small foot print.It made me feel like I had a much bigger, more capable cargo e-bike when in fact the GSD was the same size as a standard bike.I even had the opportunity to experience the backseat perspective when Tern Team Captain Josh Hon took me for a spin on the back of his GSD, seen below.While the price is quite high compared to more budget-friendly options, Tern has never competed on price. Instead, they’ve competed on quality and utility. So this might not be the cargo e-bike for everyone, but rather for those looking for a daily driver e-bike that they can depend on for years of arduous, daily use. And for those with deep enough pockets to afford that luxury.For anybody seeking many of the same benefits of Tern’s GSD but who can’t quite fit the bike into their budget, consider checking out the GSD’s little brother, the Tern HSD. We tested the HSD last year at Eurobike 2019 and came away quite impressed with the slightly more economical version. Check out our review video below.",ebikes
2020/08/09,"Garelli has just announced a new upgrade to the company’s electric moped line in the form of the Garelli Ciclone E4.Originally founded in 1919, Italian motorbike company Garelli was well-known for its scooters and light motorcycles. The company was forced to close up shop in 1987, but the brand was then bought and revived in 2019 as an electric motorbike company — 100 years after its original founding.The Garelli Ciclone line available from the brand’s relaunch previously consisted of rather low-powered 2 kW electric mopeds, but the new Ciclone E4 doubles that power to 4 kW. The rear hub motor provides a maximum torque of 160 Nm.The new Garelli Ciclone E4 electric moped also increases the model line’s top speed from 45 km/h (28 mph) to 70 km/h (43 mph) — a speed increase that fellow Italian moped-maker Vespa also performed on its own electric moped last year.The speed of the Garelli Ciclone E4 can also be restricted to help it fit into lower moped classes that don’t require a motorcycle license.With a reduced speed, the E4 can reach a maximum range of 110 km (68 miles) thanks to a 2 kWh removable battery back. Riding in the fastest speed mode will drop the range to just 70 km (43 miles).The Garelli Ciclone E4’s step-through frame is reminiscent of early mopeds of yesteryear, while its inverted suspension fork and rear monoshock invoke a more motorcycle vibe that speaks to the company’s early roots in motorcycle racing. A pillion seat and matching footpegs offer the ability to carry a passenger, and the bike can be fitted with street or trail tires so riders can take the fun both on or off-road Garelli has dealers all over Europe and the new Ciclone E4 is priced at €4,500 (approximately US$5,300 with VAT).Retro-inspired electric mopeds have been increasing in popularity lately.The ONYX RCR has been selling in large numbers for nearly two years now, and electric bicycle companies have been getting into the mix with their own electric moped-inspired e-bikes such as the Juiced Scorpion, Ariel Rider D-Class and the Rad Power Bikes RadRunner.New startups are also tossing their hats in the ring. Companies like BlackTea have unveiled their own retro-inspired light electric motorcycles with attractive pricing, hoping to win over riders of gas-powered mopeds, scooters, and light motorcycles and instead switch them over to an electric-powered yet retro-inspired motorbike.via: Rideapart",ebikes
2020/08/05,"Yamaha recently announced its first ever full-suspension electric mountain bikes, each of which comes with a novel frame design.While the rest of us are riding around here in 2020 on our plain ol’ not-split-in-half bike frames, Yamaha is coming at us straight out of the future with its Yamaha YDX Moro frame using a patent-pending new dual-twin frame design. The dual-twin frame design features a split frame set up on both the top tube and the down tube.The split top tube allows the saddle to rest lower by making more room for the rear shock. That offers a lower standover height at rest and helps get the saddle lower on tough, technical terrain where riders will be standing on the pedals, no saddle needed. The lower split portion also cradles the battery to better protect it from crashes and also makes it easier to remove the battery for charging off the bike.When first announced, Yamaha showed us the goods but didn’t give us any pricing or spec details. Now the company is ready to spill the beans on all the juicy details.Yamaha’s first full-suspension electric mountain bike is available in two models, the Desert Yellow YDX-MORO and the Blue/Nickel YDX-MORO Pro.The former gets a price tag of $4,499 while the latter is a bit pricer at $5,499. The bikes share the same frame, dropper seat post, and 500Wh battery/motor setup, so the difference is in the specs.The more modestly-priced Yamaha YDX-MORO rides on a RockShox Revelation RC fork and Deluxe Select+ rear shock. The Pro model gets upgraded to the RockShox Yari RC fork and a Super Deluxe Select+ rear shock.According to Yamaha: Both incorporate RockShox’s updated DebonAir air spring and proven Motion Control damper with a total of 160 mm of travel. This combination maintains a higher ride height and smooth performance for ultimate confidence when riding steep and rough terrain.The Yamaha YDX-MORO sports a Shimano SLX 11-speed package and gets rolling, thanks to a KMC e11 Turbo chain. The fancier YDX-MORO Pro model gets upgraded to the performance Shimano setup, which offers an XT shifter, long-cage derailleur, and an 11-speed 11/46T cassette. It also gets one step further up the chain hierarchy with a KMC e11 Turbo EPT chain.Both models share Yamaha’s latest mid-drive motor, the Yamaha PW-X2.The PW-X2 mid-drive motor system uses a unique quad-sensor setup that detects pedal speed, pedal torque, bike speed, and incline angle to more precisely calculate the required pedal assist output. New helical gears used in the PW-X2 apparently help reduce the noise of the motor, which is especially welcome in electric mountain bikes that operate far away from city noises that mask the sound of commuter e-bike motors.Both the Yamaha YDX-MORO and YDX-MORO Pro wear Magura MT30 hydraulic disc brakes clamping on 203mm Storm CL discs. The YDX-MORO includes four-piston brakes up front and two piston brakes in the rear, while the YDX-MORO Pro does a bit better with the same four-piston brakes in both the front and rear.Both of the bikes feature a tubeless compatible 27.5+ wheelset with 40mm-wide rims and plus-sized tires. The Yamaha-designed 27.5+ alloy wheelset uses Boost hub spacing, which Yamaha claims will give a more direct chain line. The YDX-MORO Pro sports Maxxis High Roller II 27.5 x 2.8-inch tires both front and rear, while the YDX-MORO gets a CST BFT 27.5 x 2.8-inch tire up front and a CST Patrol 27.5 x 2.8-inch tire in back. As Yamaha’s Power Assist Bicycle group sales and marketing manager Drew Englemann explained in a statement provided to Electrek: We couldn’t be more excited for people to experience how our new drive unit and new frame design work as-one. We’ve created a never-felt-before level of rider control and balance with our Dual-Twin frame design in perfect alignment with the powerful and easy functionality of the new PW-X2 drive unit. Yamaha has designed this bike to deliver on its promise to bring a new level of unified power and performance to all types of e-MTB trails, and with these quality components, we’re rounding out the package to make these YDX-MORO models an absolutely phenomenal ride.",ebikes
2020/08/01,"Ducati seems to be doing everything it can to elbow its way into the electric bicycle market, now unveiling three new designs for folding electric bicycles. The newest electric vehicles to join the Ducati family come in the form of a trio of folding e-bikes, each with their own unique designs.The move comes just one week after Ducati made headlines by unveiling a new urban-oriented electric trekking bicycle.The Ducati Scrambler urban trekking bike was designed to tackle both urban riding and light trail duty, and the same could likely be said for some of Ducati’s new designs.The three new models also cover a range of riding possibilities from urban commuting to off-road shenanigans.First up, Ducati introduced a new folding fat-tire bike that leverages the company’s Scrambler brand.It features a suspension fork and large 20″x4″ fat tires, offering the ability to hit trails and sand, in addition to plain old urban riding. It also has built-in LED lighting (with the tail light integrated into the seat post, nice!).The SCR-E also appears to have an option for a rear rack.Despite the fat tires, the folding feature of the bike hints at its utility and transport-optimized design, allowing the Ducati SCR-E to be folded to fit in a trunk of a car.The bike’s 375 Wh battery is hidden in the aluminum frame, and Ducati claims that it is sufficient for 70 km (43 miles) of range, though we don’t know what the top speed of the bike will be. We also don’t have pricing info yet, but we don’t expect it to be cheap.For those looking to get a bit more intense with their riding, the Ducati SCR-E Sport adds rear suspension to the front suspension of the Ducati SCR-E. It also swaps on road-oriented tires and replaces the spoked wheels with casted units.The larger 470 Wh battery is apparently sufficient for 80 km (50 miles) of range.Lastly, the nicest looking bike in the lineup comes in the form of an urban folding e-bike aptly named the Ducati Urban-E.The slick-looking design arrives courtesy of Ducati’s Centro Stile Ducati design branch. The difference in attention to detail is obvious in the bike’s integrated split headlight, rear fender design, and the narrow sweeping frame tubes. That red bump apparently helps house part of the 375 Wh battery hidden in the frame tube (though seemingly large enough that it can’t be completely concealed).All three bikes look to sport commuter-ready components including multi-speed transmissions, hydraulic disc brakes, and built-in mudguards.Hopefully, Ducati decides to grace us with more tech specs and pricing info soon. If so, we’ll be back to update. Though I’d trade that for the electric motorcycle that Ducati promised us and has yet to deliver.Until then, let’s appreciate the huge push Ducati has made into the e-bike space, releasing over half a dozen e-bikes in the past couple of years.Sounds like Harley-Davidson isn’t the only motorcycle manufacturer with a keen eye on the rapidly ballooning electric bicycle market.",ebikes
2020/07/30,"Is there anything more fun than kicking back on an electric cruiser bike, enjoying the big saddle, wide bars, and comfortable upright seating position? If there is then I don’t want to hear about it, because today we’re all about cruisers! We’ve tested plenty of them this year, and below you’ll find our top 5 favorites that we’ve ridden and would recommend for summer 2020 e-biking fun!This is part of a Top 5 e-bikes for summer 2020 series that we’re currently running to help introduce our readers to some great e-bikes for hitting the road or trail this summer.We’ve already covered a few categories, but be sure to stick around over the next few days to see our choices for the following categories of electric bikes:And be sure to check out our video below that showcases all of the electric cruiser bikes in this list in action.First up on the list is the Townie Go! 7D, from Electra. Sure, Electra has a number of nice cruiser e-bikes with a wide range of specs, and the Townie Go! 7D is on the lower end of their model line at just $1,499. But that’s actually an advantage to me.Even though you could go with one of their nicer mid-drive models, if you’re happy with the hub motor bike then the Townie Go! 7D gets you rolling on Electra’s awesome cruiser frame without the additional expense of a fancy Bosch mid-drive.The motor is plenty, the ride is nice, but from afar it looks like the battery is a bummer here at just 309 Wh. However, since this is a Class 1 pedal assist e-bike without a throttle, the range is actually still really good at around 25-50 miles (40-80 km), as long as you don’t get lazy and use the most powerful pedal assist level all the time. As a Class 1 e-bike, the Townie Go! 7D gets up to 20 mph (32 km/h), which is plenty fast for a cruiser bike. These types of e-bikes are all about being low and slow anyways – you’re riding a cruiser for the experience, not to get to work quickly – so 20 mph is plenty. And it’s not the speed that draws me to these bikes, but rather it’s the experience that I love so much about the Townie Go! 7D. It’s just a smooth-riding, comfortable electric cruiser bike that looks as good as it feels. It’s also one of the few e-bikes that comes in a really wide range of colors, though I hope you like pastels because that’s pretty much all you get – a wide range of pastels.There’s also a step-over frame if you’re not into the step-through, though a big part of the market for cruiser e-bikes includes people with accessibility issues, so I’ll bet the step-through is the more popular of the two. All in all, this is a solid e-bike that is all about the experience!If you want to learn more about this e-bike, I recommend checking out my full, in-depth Townie Go! 7D e-bike review here, or watch my review video below.Next up we have the Buzz e-bike. This one combines cruiser e-bike geometry with the utility of a cargo bike by including a super sturdy front cargo basket built right into the frame. The major difference with the Buzz e-bike compared to most e-bikes on this list is that you get an upgrade to a mid-drive motor, meaning you can power the bike through the gears and can shift accordingly. The biggest advantage this lends is the ability to drop into a lower gear for hill climbing or upshift for higher speed on flat ground. The bike is still limited to 20 mph (32 km/h), so you can’t go too crazy with the speed, but it’s enough to have a good time! The mid-drive motor is one that most people aren’t familiar with, but comes from a company called Tongsheng. They don’t have Bosch’s name recognition, but they make a great mid-drive motor that is affordable as well. The bike costs just $1,499, which is the same as the Townie Go! 7D from above, but you get this mid-drive motor with a built-in torque sensor to give you nice, smooth pedal assist. When I compare the Tongsheng to other mid-drives like Bosch, I’d say the biggest noticeable difference is that it is a bit louder, but you only really hear it at lower speeds. When you’re cruising at top speed, the wind noise covers up most of the motor whirr.I also like the big, clear display the bike comes with. No squinting with this bad boy! The flame tire tread is a bit much for me. But hey, maybe that’s your style, I don’t judge.If you want to learn more about this e-bike, I recommend checking out my full, in-depth Buzz e-bike review here, or watch my review video below.Next we have the Model C, from Electric Bike Company. This cruiser is kind of a boat, but despite being so big, it still rides just as smooth and comfortable as you’d expect a beach cruiser to ride. The high quality experience with the Model C starts even before you open the box though. Electric Bike Company is one of the few manufacturers that ships its bikes fully assembled. It is superbly packaged so that nothing can be damaged and all you have to do is turn the handlebars forward and you’re ready to ride.The box and packaging is so good that I actually re-used it a few weeks later to ship a motorcycle in, believe it or not (yay for reduce-reuse-recycle!). The Model C is one of the more powerful cruisers on this list, rocking a 750W hub motor that puts out 1,250W peak from its 48V system. It gets powered by either a 550Wh or 840Wh battery, you get to choose, and the Model C has a top speed of up to 28 mph (45 km/h). It also has the nicest brakes of any e-bike on this list, with 4-piston Tektro Dorado hydraulic disc brakes both front and rear. Then you’ve got some other nice features you won’t find elsewhere, like the slick-looking front basket that is actually really useful. And the battery even comes with a built-in charger and cord so you never have to carry a charger with you. I can’t overstate how nice this is, especially if you’ve got a few e-bikes like me and are always confusing chargers or getting them tangled up. The last important thing to note about Electric Bike Company is that they are a US company that actually builds their e-bikes in the US. I’ve visited their Newport Beach factory and met their team. It’s really impressive what they do and I love knowing that they’re contributing to the local economy and creating dozens of local jobs in their community. That might explain the slightly higher price at $1,999, but to be honest, I would have expected even higher for an American made e-bike with such high speed and high power, not to mention those nice bike parts. To me, this is a smoking hot deal for anyone looking for a high-powered cruiser.If you want to learn more about this e-bike, I recommend checking out my full, in-depth Electric Bike Company Model C review here, or watch my review video.With the Schwinn EC1, I have to tell you the price right off the bat on this one, it’s just $898. That’s insane, right!? And you still get a pretty good cruiser e-bike!It’s not a powerhouse or anything, it’s only a 250W e-bike, which means this one is really meant for flat-land cruising, not climbing giant hills, but if you keep it where it excels, then it excels. The hub motor is plenty strong for a fun flat-land ride even on light trails, and the fact that the bike is pedal assist-only means that it keeps you honest with a bit of your own pedaling power. That’s either going to be a positive or a negative depending on your views on pedal assist.And the 36V battery is enough for a leisurely 30 miles (48 km) of range, though again that’s with you adding a bit of pedaling help. All the other classic cruiser features are there too. You get that accessible step-through frame, a nice wide saddle, handlebars that are tall enough to keep you upright but actually aren’t as exaggerated as some of the wide handlebars from extreme cruisers and there are also nice big tires that help make up for the lack of suspension. You even get metal fenders and a functional rack, all for $898! The Schwinn EC1 is a simple e-bike, it doesn’t claim anything fancy, but it’s a solid, well-made bike that gets you rolling on an electric cruiser for dirt cheap. It won’t win any beauty pageants or design prizes, but it is a solid option for a fun electric cruiser on a budget, and that’s why it is on this list. It just works and works well.If you want to learn more about this e-bike, I recommend checking out my full, in-depth Schwinn EC1 review here, or watch my review video.And last but not least we have something quite different but totally worth your attention. This is the Samson from a company called Day6. You might not have ever heard of these guys. Hell, I hadn’t heard of these guys until Mikey G found this bike and reviewed it for Electrek, but it is a hidden gem because despite its somewhat peculiar appearance, the low center of gravity it provides gives it better handling than pretty much any other electric cruiser. The bars are so big that they’re practically ape hangers, but you can also really torque on them and then lean hard into turns. The Samson might be marketed towards older riders looking for an accessible e-bike but it is likely to bring out the kid in everyone with its racecar-like handling. Part of what makes this bike so much fun is that it uses a really powerful mid-drive motor known as the Bafang BBSHD. Until the Bafang Ultra motor was released, this was Bafang’s most powerful mid-drive unit. It’s technically a conversion motor and this e-bike is technically a conversion as well since Day6 originally built these frames for pedal bikes, but who cares what something was intended for, I care what it’s actually doing now, and right now the Samson looks like an awesome ride with that powerful motor! The bike may look a bit goofy in general, but hey, who cares how you look if you can have this much fun? Just be prepared to pay handsomely for something like this. The Samson is a special bike, but that means it also has a special price, to the tune of $3,600. Ka-ching!If you want to learn more about this e-bike, I recommend checking the full, in-depth Day6 Samson review here, or watch the review video below.And that’s it for now, but we’ll have another Top 5 list coming soon.

2020/07/30,"I hear the same thing over and over, all the time: “I’d like to get an electric motorbike, but they just cost so much more than gas motorbikes.” Well, not anymore! Or at least not in the case of the BlackTea Moped, which is an urban electric motorbike that is priced on par with gas bike rivals.First of all, what is the BlackTea Moped? It was developed by a startup out of Munich, Germany, and it embodies the classic spirit and design of a ’70s Scrambler motorcycle.But instead of spewing hydrocarbon exhaust, it spews electrons instead. (Or more accurately, cycles electrons rapidly through a motor/controller/battery loop, but that doesn’t sound nearly as cool.)The electric moped isn’t really an electric moped as it lacks functional pedals, instead opting for motorbike foot pegs. But with a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h), it falls closer in line with moped speeds. That means you won’t be taking it out on the highway, but it would make a potent urban assault vehicle. It even has a long bench seat and passenger foot pegs so you can carry a pillion on back. The BlackTea Moped is powered by a 3kW continuous and 5kW peak rear hub motor that looks awfully similar to the one found on the back of the uber-popular ONYX RCR electric moped produced in California.A 72V and 24.5Ah battery gets stored in the body. BlackTea claims that the battery’s 1.76kWh of capacity is good for 43 miles (70 km) of range at mixed city speeds averaging 28 mph (45 km/h). But there is room to add a second battery (which BlackTea will happily sell you) and double that range.For those wondering how accurate the range rating is, I can tell you that it is likely only a tiny bit optimistic. I rode a CSC City Slicker electric motorcycle for about a year, and got around 35 miles (56 km) of range with a similar-sized battery and motor. Obviously different bikes and components perform differently, but I imagine that the BlackTea Moped’s range rating is close to accurate.The bike sports a halo LED headlight, dual sport tires on 18-inch motorcycle rims, dual rear coilover shocks, regenerative braking, and dual hydraulic disc brakes.The BlackTea Moped also comes with a VIN so it can be registered in the US and EU. It ships with a 45 km/h (28 mph) speed limit, allowing it to be registered as an L1e-b vehicle (no motorcycle license required) in the EU or as a moped or “motor-driven cycle” in much of the US. But the speed limit can be removed for “private land use” or potentially for registering it as a true motorcycle. You’ll almost certainly need a motorcycle license to ride it in the US with the speed limit removed, though laws vary from state to state.The BlackTea Moped carries an MSRP of €4,200 (US$4,950). But it is currently on pre-order with a discounted price of €2,290 ($2,700). You can add a second battery for €825 (US$1,000). Despite the German origin, the BlackTea Moped will be produced in China and will ship to both the EU and the US.The only downside is that the pre-order is an Indiegogo campaign, so you’re taking a significant risk on whether the bike ever gets produced and delivered. More on that below.I love almost everything about this bike. The design doesn’t blow me away, but it’s pretty nice. It doesn’t take any big risks and the battery box isn’t incredibly imaginative, but it’s classy and I like it. Not every motorbike needs to be over the top. Modesty is a virtue.The BlackTea Moped is designed to compete with 50cc gas bikes, according to its manufacturer, but I think it could compete up a weight class or two.My sister rides a CSC San Gabriel 250cc, nothing fancy. It’s a cute little $2,400 bike, if you’re into gas bikes. I’ll admit that even though I much prefer electric motorcycles, I’ve been known to borrow hers for a joyride every now and again. It tops out at 60 mph on the dash, but I think its closer to 55 mph in real life. That means the BlackTea Moped can hit nearly the same top speed and at nearly the same price. All without ever having to deal with adjusting a choke or tuning the carb to keep the idle where you want it.Yes, there’s definitely a lot of risk with backing an Indiegogo project like this. But the company’s timeline gives me confidence. They don’t expect to deliver the bike until spring 2021. That’s both a bummer and a plus. It sucks to wait that long, but it also shows that they are professional enough to understand how long production and certification takes, and aren’t giving unrealistic delivery dates that they know will need to be pushed back.Guys, I’m seriously debating backing this project and pre-ordering a Black Tea Moped. Somebody better talk me out of this before I spend too much time crafting a pitch to my wife on why this is a “good investment.”[Update: OK, I bought one. I’ll just tell my wife about it later.]",ebikes
2020/07/29,"Fat tire bikes are a ton of fun, but pedaling those big, heavy tires can be arduous without assistance. Fat tire electric bikes solve the problem and are one of the most fun ways to cycle over just about any terrain imaginable.Get ready, because today I’m listing my top 5 favorite electric fat tire bikes that I’ve tested for the summer.This is part of a Top 5 E-Bikes for Summer 2020 series that we’re currently running to help introduce our readers to some great e-bikes for hitting the road or trail this summer.We’ve already covered a few categories, but be sure to stick around over the next few days to see our choices for the following categories of electric bikes:And be sure to check out our video below that showcases all of the electric fat tire bikes in this list in action.First up on the list is the RadRover from Rad Power Bikes. It’s actually available in two options — either the standard RadRover with a typical diamond frame or the RadRover Step-Thru. They’re otherwise pretty similar, so the major difference is just what type of geometry you prefer. The standard RadRover has a triangle that can be nice for adding small bags or other accessories, but the RadRover Step-Thru is of course more accessible to a wider range of riders, especially riders with leg injuries or who otherwise find it hard to swing a leg over a big bike.Both options offer a great ride with a 750W motor in the back, a suspension fork up front, 672 Wh of battery, and a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), which classifies them as a Class 2 throttle e-bike. Rad Power Bikes also has a huge line of accessories that you can choose from to customize your ride. And at $1,499, it’s hard to beat Rad Power Bikes in terms of value. The only downside to the RadRover I’ve found so far is that it’s just kind of a big bike, which is why I’m actually going to include another Rad Power Bike here, the RadMini Step Thru (seen below). This bike gets you most of the awesome ride of the bigger RadRover, yet in a smaller package. Despite offering fat tires, it still folds up small enough to fit in a trunk, which is a feat the standard RadRover could never achieve. And it’s the same reasonable price of $1,499. Not bad if you ask me.Want to learn more about the RadRover? Check out my full RadRover review here, or watch my RadRover Step-Thru review video.Next up on the list, we have the Aventon Sinch, another folding fat tire electric bike that would be great for riding the beach or snow all day and then stuffing in your car when you’re done. The Aventon Sinch features an internal 672 Wh battery, which is as much battery as the RadRover above, except that the battery gets hidden in the Aventon Sinch’s frame resulting in a sleek look without an eyesore of a battery. You don’t need to remove the battery to charge it, but you can if you want to charge it separately from the bike. For power, the Aventon Sinch has a rear 500W geared hub motor that runs at 750W peak. There are mechanical disc brakes, which I would have loved to have seen upgraded to hydraulic discs like Aventon’s other classy bike, the Aventon Level. But at a reasonable price of $1,499, I can do mechanical disc brakes. And Aventon makes up for it with those beautiful, invisible welds on the frame. I have yet to see another e-bike company get close to the frame build quality of Aventon.Fenders don’t come standard, which is a slight bummer, but they’re an optional add-on for those of you that live in rainy environments.In all of my riding, I can only find one drawback of substance to this bike — the throttle doesn’t work from rest. You need to pedal about half a revolution or so before the throttle kicks in. That’s fine on the road, but in deep sand, that half a revolution is a tall order indeed. Once you get going though, it’s smooth sailing and this bike is honestly just a blast and a half to ride. The wide tires float above sand and obstacles while the small tire diameter keeps the bike nimble and agile. It’s just a great fat tire bike that looks pretty darn good, too, if you ask me. I’ll be posting my complete, in-depth Aventon Sinch review soon, so keep checking back for more details on this awesome folding fat tire e-bike!Next up, we have the CSC FT750 series. There are actually two e-bikes in the series, offering a 20″ wheel size (CSC FT750-20) and a 26″ wheel size (CSC FT750-26).Both wheel sizes feature fat tires of course, and pretty much everything else is identical between the bikes. The main difference is that the smaller version rides more like a BMX bike while the larger version is a bit more of a boat, but that also means it’s better for tackling larger obstacles. Both are very nicely spec’d and are the first models on this list to come with hydraulic disc brakes. They both get nice suspension forks, LED lights, large displays, USB charging ports, etc. Both of the CSC FT750 models have 750W motors and can easily ride even in loose deep sand, making them powerful bikes that aren’t afraid of hills either. And with a top speed of up to 25 mph (40 km/h) on pedal-assist or a bit slower 20 mph (32 km/h) on throttle, these are class 3 e-bikes that would make great commuter bikes as well. Sure, fat tires look a bit strange on the road, but the same aspects that make them ride so well on trails also mean you get a nice cushy ride on hard surfaces as well. The fat tires aren’t quite as responsive as skinnies, but we’re not competing here, we’re commuting, so they’re just fine for us. At $1,688, the FT750 e-bikes cost a bit more than the first two e-bikes on the list, but they go faster and have nicer specs too, which makes them winners in my book.To learn more, check out my in-depth CSC FT750 e-bike review here, or watch my review video below.Different e-bikes make my “Top 5” lists for different reasons. Some are works of art, some have crazy power, and some are just simple e-bikes at great prices. The Ecotric 500W fat tire e-bike fits into that last category.For $899 on Ecotric’s website (or $928 on Amazon), the Ecotric fat tire e-bike gives you a 500W motor and a 470 Wh battery. There are exactly zero extra frills. Oh, and zero suspension. But you know what? The bike still works quite well for two reasons. First, on a budget bike like this, suspension would have to be so cheap that I’d worry about how long it would hold up before breaking, and so I’d rather not have suspension on an ultra-budget bike like this. Instead, I know a rigid fork and hardtail frame will simply last. And second, with fat tires, you get a bit of suspension just from the large air volume. Look at the kind of off-road trails I’m riding in the video below – rutted out mountain trails – but the ride is much better than you’d expect from a bike with zero suspension. That’s because I’m effectively riding on air cushions. In terms of the bike’s performance, it definitely doesn’t have the power of the 750W e-bikes in this list, which means that on steeper hills, I had to help pedal instead of relying only on the throttle alone. If you don’t have the strength to pedal or have leg injuries that mean you rely on throttle only, this might not be the bike for you if you live in a hilly area. But for anyone else, as long as you don’t mind pedaling on the steeper hills to help, then the bike performs great the rest of the time on moderate hills and of course on flat ground. The reason I like this bike so much is that its just a solid budget option, and since not everyone can afford a multi-thousand dollar e-bike, I think it’s great that there are solid options even in the sub-$1,000 range for bikes that aren’t super high end but are good enough to have a lot of fun on. There really is an e-bike out there for everyone!To learn more, read my full in-depth Ecotric 500W fat tire e-bike review here, or watch my review video below.And last but not least, we’ve got a massive e-bike for you to round out the list, the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500. And yes, the 1500 in the name stands for 1500 W, believe it or not. There are not one but two 750 W motors on this bike — one in each wheel — and they put out a continuous 1500 W together. But get this: at peak power, they’re rocking closer to 3,000 W of combined power, which is what you’ll feel on acceleration and while climbing hills.This is, of course, a hunter oriented e-bike, if you couldn’t tell by the paint job, but that doesn’t mean you have to go shoot Bambi’s mom to ride it. It’d make a great adventurer’s bike too for anyone that covers tough terrain and needs a fat tire e-bike with all-wheel-drive and extreme power.It’s also going to be available in black soon, for those that don’t want to go all camo on us. But at the speeds this thing can hit, I’m not sure you’ll be around long enough for anyone to notice what color the bike is anyways. I’ve gotten the Super Monarch Crown up to 33 mph (53 km/h). The thing is a beast; it just wants to do that power and speed all day. And with a pair of batteries adding up to 1500 Wh, it really can ride all day. That’s right — it’s got dual batteries. And dual motors. And dual suspension. And dual racks. And dual hydraulic disc brakes with four pistons each. Seriously, folks — this e-bike is the epitome of excess and it makes me love it even more for it. It’s just a blast to ride on everything from narrow trails to wide-open roads. The high speed makes it a good commuter that can keep up with traffic, and the suspension and AWD fat tires make it the ultimate armageddon bike that won’t stop at anything and will keep trucking over everything that gets in its way. It doesn’t come cheap at $3,995, but you didn’t think a 3,000 W fat e-bike with dual suspension was going to be cheap, did you? This e-bike probably isn’t going to apply to as many people as budget e-bikes like the Ecotric above, but if you want to cover the most ground on the widest range of terrain with a fat tire bike, then AWD powerhouses like the Super Monarch Crown AWD 1500 are the way to go.Just like saying thank you’s at the Oscars, I don’t want to leave anybody out. It’s hard to choose just five fat tire e-bikes, especially since we’ve tested so many interesting ones. There are some other great options like the $899 Lectric XP folding fat tire e-bike that I’ll have on the Top 5 folding e-bikes list (spoiler alert!). And we’ve also tested other fun fat tire e-bikes like the EUNORAU FAT-AWD. Electrek’s publisher Seth Weintraub even built his own DIY fat tire electric bike at home, and you can follow his journey to see how he did it here.There are a ton of great fat tire e-bikes out there, and we hope you’ll stick around to see many more here on Electrek in the future.Don’t forget to come back tomorrow for another list of our top 5 e-bikes for summer 2020 in the next category!",ebikes
2020/07/29,"Yamaha has finally unveiled its new Yamaha YDX MORO electric mountain bike line. The new models feature Yamaha’s latest mid-drive e-bike motor and a brand new frame design unlike anything we’ve seen before.The Yamaha YDX MORO electric mountain bike line shows off Yamaha’s new patent-pending dual-twin frame design that features a split frame setup on both the top tube and the down tube.The split top tube allows the saddle to rest lower by making more room for the rear shock. That offers lower standover height at rest and helps get the saddle lower on tough, technical terrain where riders will be standing on the pedals, no saddle needed.The split downtube cradles the bike’s 500Wh battery and protects it in a cage-like structure. That not only helps prevent damage during drops or from twisting during a crash, but it also makes battery swaps easier than on other frames that conceal the battery inside the downtube. The design of the Yamaha YDX MORO also uses a steeper-than-typical downtube angle resulting in moving the battery further rearward and better centering the weight of the bike.As Yamaha further explains:Within this exclusive frame design, the drive unit is rotated in alignment with the down tube angle — better aligned with the axel path and the ground. The drive unit simply fits better within the frame than competing models. Placed more vertically in the frame, flex is decreased, clearance is increased, and the rear center measurement is shortened, keeping the chain stay short. Because the drive unit is in a fixed position in the frame, it is tucked in and tracks with the frame while cornering.Together, the split top tube and down tube give a funky new look that only marks the beginning of the list of innovations in the Yamaha YDX MORO e-bike line.Next, the new electric mountain bikes feature Yamaha’s latest mid-drive motor, the Yamaha PW-X2.The PW-X2 mid-drive motor system uses a unique quad-sensor setup that detects pedal speed, pedal torque, bike speed, and incline angle to more precisely calculate the required pedal assist output. How well does it work? That answer will have to wait until we get a test unit to review. But the marketing sure sounds great, right?!New helical gears used in the PW-X2 apparently help reduce the noise of the motor, which is especially welcome in electric mountain bikes that operate far away from city noises that mask the sound of commuter e-bike motors.The PW-X2 also features an automatic mode. No, unfortunately it’s not automatic shifting in terms of the bike’s gears, but rather through the pedal assist levels. When engaged, it can intelligently shift between Eco, Standard, and High mode. This sounds like another system that is hard to gauge without actually trying it, but I can see the merit. There’s nothing worse than riding down a valley and then hitting a hard climb back up at the bottom, only to realize you’re still in the lowest pedal assist level.The motor also has a new EXPW mode that adds assist up to a pedal cadence of 170 RPM. At that high pedal cadence, this mode can be helpful for technical sections or steep hill climbs where a rider might shed gears rapidly and pedal with all they’ve got, or even on startup where a quick spin of the pedals is needed to get up to speed.Unfortunately, we don’t have any pricing details yet, as those will have to wait until the Yamaha YDX MORO is closer to production. We don’t even have too many tech specs either.We know the bike will be a Class 1 model with assist up to 20 mph (32 km/h), but we’re still in the dark about many other details. Yamaha reps tell me that “Full specs, pricing and availability will be announced in the coming weeks,” so at least we have something to look forward to. I’ve been a fan of Yamaha e-bikes for a while now, so I’m excited to see what else this e-bike will be packing. Zooming in on press shots shows decently high-end suspension including a RockShox Yari fork and Super Deluxe Select+ rear shock on the Pro model. And those Magura brakes look pretty nice, too. But we’ll have to wait and see which parts make the final cut.What the heck, let’s start a guessing game about how much this thing is going to cost! I’ll be shocked if they get it under $4k, though that might be possible for the non-pro model, which looks to sport slightly lower-spec suspension components, perhaps among other compromises. Let me know what you think of Yamaha’s first full suspension electric mountain bike in the comments below.",ebikes
2020/07/28,"The term “Urban mountain bike” is a bit of an oxymoron, but it makes a lot of sense for electric bikes. These are usually hardtail, hybrid-style e-bikes that incorporate mountain bike-style suspension forks, drivetrains or brakes, yet are designed to tackle the urban jungle. These e-bikes are often more rugged than standard commuter e-bikes and even allow riders to add in some trail riding on the same bike they ride to work every day. Now, I’m compiling my top five favorite hybrid-style urban e-bikes that I’ve tested for the summer!This is part of a Top 5 E-Bikes for Summer 2020 series that we’re currently running to help introduce our readers to some great e-bikes for hitting the road or trail this summer.We’ve already covered a few categories, but be sure to stick around over the next few days to see our choices for the following categories of electric bikes:And be sure to check out our video below that showcases all of the hardtail urban electric mountain bikes in this list in action.The Ride1Up 500 Series is honestly one of my favorite hybrid-style electric bikes that works equally well for street-riding and trail-riding. It is more than fairly priced at $1,195, and when you check out these specs, I think you’ll see that the price is a steal for what you get. Like all bikes on this list, it’s a hardtail with a suspension fork up front. In the rear, we’ve got a 750W Bafang hub motor that can get the 500 Series up to an advertised top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h), though I find that I get a hair under that speed. Still, this is a fast e-bike that will definitely get you where you’re going quickly. For battery, we’re rocking a 500 Wh 48V pack with true LG battery cells. It’s not a huge pack, but 500 Wh is enough for most people, especially if you’re going to help pedal. On throttle only, range is around 20-25 miles (32-40 km/h). But if you want to add some pedal-assist power you can nearly double that range. There’s also the option to order a larger battery pack that gives you around 70% more battery and more range. The Ride1up 500 Series doesn’t include racks or fenders in the price, but they sell add-ons so you can add them if you need fenders for rainy areas or racks for carrying cargo. You do get a few nice accouterments though, including leather grips, a built-in LED headlight that runs off the pack and some really nice cable management, if you’re into that sort of thing.At under $1,200, this is a basic e-bike that offers plenty of speed and range for the average urban warrior.To learn more about the Ride1Up 500 Series, see my full-length detailed review, or check out my video review below.Straight out of Portland, the pXcycle E-XC+ is marketed as the ultimate in urban electric mountain bikes.This e-bike comes standard with a loadout designed for utility. That includes not just a rear rack but also a front rack, allowing you to carry tons of cargo. And the front rack even mounts to the head tube so it remains super stable even in turns. A hydraulic suspension fork up front smooths out the ride for you, and speaking of smooth, there’s nothing smoother than the pedal assist on this mid-drive motor. The E-XC+ sports a 500W Shenyi mid-drive motor that uses a torque sensor to give you the smoothest pedal assist. There’s no throttle on this bike, so the pedal-assist better be good… and it IS good! In top gear, it will rocket you up to 27 mph (43 km/h) without breaking a sweat. Seriously, this thing has significant pull when you put it in the higher pedal assist modes. Being a mid-drive, you can drop it down into the lower bike gears to get extra torque when you’re climbing hills, not that it doesn’t have plenty of torque anyways. The E-XC+ can climb like a champ and hit high speeds all in the same commute. The battery isn’t necessarily huge, with a similar 500 Wh pack just like the Ride1up 500 series above, but you get more range out of it due to the pedal-assist only operation of the bike. They tell you 20-40 miles (32-64 km) of range, but I don’t know how you’d ever see the low end of that. In my experience, you’ll be looking at the higher end of that range most of the time and sometimes exceeding it if you keep the pedal assist level low enough. Another nice addition it has over the 500 Series is a set of Shimano hydraulic disc brakes. They aren’t very high up on Shimano’s hierarchy of juice brakes, but they sure beat adjusting cable brakes any day of the week. These features add up a bit, meaning you’ll be paying more for a bike like this. When you factor in the two racks, a mid-drive motor, and hydraulic brakes, the price gets bumped up to the tune of $1,895 bucks. For a mid-drive e-bike that can hit class 3 speeds though, that’s a reasonable price. I’ve seen plenty of hub motor e-bikes with similar level specs at this price.I don’t have my full, in-depth review of the pXcycle E-XC+ bike up yet, but it is coming very soon! So far testing has shown it to be an awesome e-bike and one that I can wholeheartedly recommend as a dual urban/trail bike.The Aventon Level is a beautiful e-bike that offers a masterclass in how to design a slick-looking bike that still offers plenty of get up and go. Like all of Aventon’s bikes, the frame is just beautifully constructed. Look at the welds here, or more like, what welds? You can’t even see them. It’s like they pulled the frame out of the earth like this, already forged by the e-bike gods themselves. I’ve ridden a couple of other Aventon e-bikes before and from what I can see, whoever is welding these things deserves a Carnegie Prize in art. But of course, it takes more than pretty welds to make this list. Back on the e-bike side of things, we’re looking at a Class 3 e-bike that can hit 28 mph (45 km/h) and comes with both a throttle and pedal assist. Up front, you’ll find 75 mm of suspension travel, and in the rear, you’ve got yourself a 750W peak motor paired with an 8-speed Shimano drivetrain. The battery is nicely hidden away in that slightly chunky down tube and packs in 672 Wh of battery that the company claims will give you a real-world 40 miles (64 km) of range, on average. But they also give you actual TESTED ranges at different speeds, which I really appreciate. Almost no other company does this and it sets Aventon apart as a straight and true company. Respect!The rest of the components are equally nice, including a large display, hydraulic disc brakes on 180mm rotors, an 8-speed Shimano drivetrain, included rack and fenders, etc. Basically a bunch of pretty nice parts.The Aventon Level is priced at $1,599. Is that a fair price? You better believe it is! A Class 3 e-bike with juice brakes, premium construction, and backed by a super honest company that’s up front about their bike’s performance right from the start? Heck yeah, I’d pay that. Just compare it to the competition and you’ll see that this price is more than fair. And while you’re at it, compare their welds too!I’ll be publishing my full, in-depth review of the Aventon Level e-bike soon. For now, rest assured that I’m loving the bike and definitely give it two thumbs up!Up next is a crowd favorite, the RadCity 4 from Rad Power Bikes. Rad is the largest e-bike company in the US and for good reason, they know how to make e-bikes that people love and they know how to get them out there on the road. And the RadCity is no different. This bike is a commuter classic that received a few updates at the beginning of the year. Up front, it sports a Suntour spring fork with 100 mm of travel, and in the rear, it rocks that massive direct drive 750W hub motor, making it the only e-bike on this list that is capable of performing regenerative braking. Not only does that dribble a bit more charge into the battery, but it also saves your brake pads from wearing out as quickly or needing adjustment, which is good because we’re rocking mechanical brakes here. There’s nothing wrong with mechanical brakes, they just require sporadic maintenance that hydraulic brakes save you from. Powering that big motor is a 672 Wh battery with Samsung 18650 cells. It should be good for around 30 miles or 50 km of range on throttle riding and around 50 miles or 80 km if you do some honest pedal-assist riding. Part of the reason that the range is so good is that the top speed is a bit slower at just 20 mph (32 km/h). That seems to be enough for many people, though you didn’t hear this from me, you can actually remove the speed limit on the bike to get about 25% higher speed. All in all, this is a solid commuter e-bike that can easily handle both smooth bike lanes and pockmarked streets. Between the included rack and fenders and the included LED lights, you’ve got everything you need to get rolling right out of the box. At just $1,499, Rad remains one of the best modestly-priced e-bike brands in the business. Sure, there are nicer parts out there on other bikes, but it’s hard for anyone to touch Rad Power Bikes when it comes to value, service, and support. That’s just what you get when you choose a company with the staying power of Rad.If you want to learn more details about the RadCity 4, check out my full in-depth RadCity review, or watch my review video below!And last but certainly not least is the Electric Bike Company Model R, an e-bike that I very recently reviewed and very recently fell in love with. It’s another hardtail like the rest of the bikes on this list, but with a different twist, it has more of a cruiser bike vibe to it. Check out the wide handlebars and the upright seating position. However, it’s much more rugged than a typical cruiser bike. In fact, that’s what the “R” in Model R stands for.You get a nice suspension fork and plush saddle to give the most comfortable ride possible. This e-bike was absolutely built for cruising, and cruising is what it does, right up to a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h).Its motor is rated at 750W continuous but pulls up to 1,250W peak, meaning it can climb hills like a champ and get up to speed quickly. It also has the best brakes of any bike on this list, with 4-piston Tektro Dorado hydraulic disc brakes. Another unique selling point of the Model R is that it’s an American made e-bike. The company has a factory in Newport Beach, California, which must cost them a fortune but somehow they still do it, with Americans building American e-bikes. I visited their factory and was blown away by the quality they put into these things. The Model R is just a really nice commuter that combines power with comfort. Priced at $2,199, it’s not cheap, but then again you’re getting the most power on this list, some of the best components, and American assembly on top of everything, so you get what you pay for.If you want to learn more details about the EBC Model R, check out my full in-depth Model R e-bike review, or watch my review video below!I hope you enjoyed my list of my five favorite hardtail hybrid-style e-bikes I’ve reviewed this year. It’s a tall order to choose only five, and there are plenty of other great bikes out there too, such as the hardtail Ariel Rider D-Class mini-bike, which I included on my Top 5 electric moped list. We’ve also tried other interesting hardtail hybrid e-bikes such as the Surface604 Rook and the Haibike Sduro Trekking 4.0 e-bike, both of which are worth checking out as well.Don’t forget to come back tomorrow for another list of my top five e-bikes for summer 2020 in the next category!",ebikes
2020/07/28,"Gogoro first unveiled its new Eeyo 1 and Eeyo 1s electric bikes in May. Now the company is announcing the first availability of the sleek electric bikes as customers line up to place orders.After teasing a US-entry in the past, the move marks Gogoro’s first sales in the United States. While the company is likely better known for its popular 55 mph (88 km/h) seated electric scooters and its enormous distributed battery swap network, Gogoro has been steadily expanding its product line over the last year.First came a line of smaller urban-oriented seated electric scooters under the Viva model line, and now Gogoro is making available its lightest vehicle yet: the carbon fiber Gogoro Eeyo 1 and 1s.Both bikes use Kevlar-reinforced carbon fiber to construct a strong, open frame and rigid fork. The lack of a typical seat tube allows more space in the frame and makes it easier to throw the 27 lb (12.2 kg) bike over your shoulder. Try that with most 50+ lb (23+ kg) electric bikes!The main difference between the two bikes is that the Gogoro Eeyo 1 features an alloy seat post, handlebars, and rims, while the Gogoro Eeyo 1s is completely carbon fiber.Both bikes are powered by the Eeyo SmartWheel from Gogoro, an all-in-one drive system that encapsulates the battery, motor, torque sensor, and smart connectivity together inside of the small rear hub. Paired with the SmartWheel is a Gates Carbon Drive system that used a carbon fiber-reinforced belt instead of a chain for smoother, quieter, and maintenance-free pedaling.The motor propels the bike up to 19 mph (30.5 km/h) in the US, or a slightly slower 15 mph (25 km/h) in the EU.The Gogoro Eeyo 1 also offers an innovative charger stand that performs double duty, displaying the bike and keeping it charged. The standard charger is equally as innovative, using a flexible band that snaps around the shell of the motor to begin charging. No more fiddling with little charger connectors!The battery is rather small compared to other e-bikes, at just 123 Wh. But Gogoro claims that by designing the entire powertrain in-house, their system has been made efficient enough to reach as far as 40 miles (64 km) in Sport Mode or 55 miles (88 km) in Eco Mode.Electrek should have a Gogoro Eeyo 1 to test out soon, so I’ll be sure to check out the range in addition to the many other unique aspects of the bike in our full review.As Gogoro’s Chief Marketing Officer Kirk James explained in a statement provided to Electrek:“Eeyo 1 is an innovative approach to the hyper-local and multi-modal transportation challenges people in cities face every day and we designed it so riders can navigate the busy stop and go traffic in the quickest and most agile way possible. We focused on the essentials that make it an absolute joy to ride. Because the more fun the ride – the more we ride. And that’s the whole point.”So what will Gogoro’s electric bike run you? The top-of-the-line Eeyo 1s is priced at $4,599 and is available in a “warm white matte finish” while the Eeyo 1 is priced at $3,899 and comes in either “cloud blue” or “lobster orange.”What do you think of the Gogoro Eeyo 1 and 1s carbon fiber e-bikes? Let us know in the comments below! ",ebikes
2020/07/27,"When it comes to extreme comfort for the road or extreme handling for the trail, it’s hard to beat the benefits of full-suspension electric bikes. I’ve tested a pile of them for Electrek and now I’m compiling the list of my top 5 full-suspension e-bikes for summer 2020!This is part of a Top 5 e-bikes for summer 2020 series that we’re currently running to help introduce our readers to some great e-bikes for hitting the road or trail this summer. Check out the different installments of the series below:And be sure to check out our video below that showcases all of the awesome full-suspension electric bikes from this list in action.First on the list is the FREY EX Pro, which is a dual battery, full suspension electric bike designed for serious off-road riding. I’m talking big jumps, downhill, uphill, everything!I’m by no means a highly skilled trail or downhill rider, but the FREY EX has absolutely been helping me up my game.I don’t really know what I’m doing, but I think I’m getting better. And my FREY EX is definitely helping! 1.5kW! (Though this was on Eco mode with just pedal assist) pic.twitter.com/lvCF6cH5rpIt features super high-end suspension including a RockShox Lyrik fork and RockShox Deluxe rear shock. Combined with the Magura MT5E 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes on 203mm rotors, which are my absolute favorite e-bike brakes, and the FREY EX has some seriously nice specs to brag about.But the key to making this e-bike so awesome is its Bafang M620 Ultra motor, which puts out around 1.5 kW of power and an insane 160 Nm of torque.This thing pulls like a tractor and can wheelie like a beast in low gear.In fact, I’m doing all sorts of awesome riding that I never would have tried before, and that the high-end suspension and extreme power of the Frey EX has given me the confidence to try.Sure, I probably could have done a lot of this on a lesser e-bike, but it is the high build-quality of the FREY EX that gave me the confidence to even attempt it and show myself what I could do. When you’re on the street you can really open it up and see how fast this motor can take you. Thanks to the mid-drive setup, you get power through the bike gears and can keep it low geared for torque or high geared for speed. At the top end I can hit around 36  or 37 mph, which is around 60 km/h, and that’s flat ground speed, which is pretty nuts. And before we move one, the last thing that I want to note about the FREY EX is that the Pro model here comes with the option for two batteries, with one hidden inside the downtube and the other piggybacking on top. Together that adds up to 1.5 kWh of capacity and equals an entire afternoon of riding trails without having to stop and charge. This is just an incredible e-bike that you can ride just about anywhere, street or trails, and have an awesome time on while pushing it hard thanks to the high-spec components.  Of course those high spec components, dual batteries, and gigantic motor don’t come cheap, ballooning the bike’s price up to around $4,000 for the top-end model. And while some people are understandably hesitant about sending that much money off to China to a company they’ve never seen in person, let me put your fears to rest. I actually went to visit the FREY factory in Jinhua, China and met the team. I can vouch for them being amazing, salt of the earth people. And the fact that they build amazing bikes is the cherry on top!If you’re looking for a high-quality electric mountain bike that can hang with the best, the FREY EX should be on your list like it is on mine. This isn’t even a full review of this epic bike – that will be coming in the next few weeks. For now, suffice it to say that the FREY EX Pro is an absolute machine for trails and the street.And don’t worry, the rest of the bikes on this list are more affordable, but we had to start with the best!.Next up we have the Super Monarch AWD 1000. This flamboyant orange beast of an e-bike rocks a pair of 500 W motors that combine to give 1,000 W of all-wheel-drive off-roading fun. And whether you’re using the bike to hit the trails or sticking to the street, the full-suspension will make sure your ride is as good as it can be. Upfront we have a GT Mark adjustable air suspension fork complemented by an adjustable DNM air shock in the rear. Neither of these are top end parts, but they’re both quite good and do everything I need for a recreational full-suspension e-bike.With two motors providing all-wheel-drive at 1,000 W, riders can burn through a battery pretty quickly. That’s why the Super Monarch comes with two batteries to make sure you can keep putting on the miles. It’s also got extra-wide fat tires which are just as good at rolling over curbs on the street as they at hitting obstacles on the trail. And in case you’re wondering, yes it comes in other color options, so if you don’t like the screaming orange then you can go with red or black. But come on, when you have an e-bike as ridiculous as this, you have to lean into it! The only major downside to the Super Monarch AWD 1000 is its weight, at just over 90 lb (41 kg). That’s a seriously heavy bike and it means you might want to have a friend help you lift it onto your car rack… if you can find one rated for it. Instead, I skip the rack all together and use the large battery capacity to ride the bike straight to my favorite trails. I can hit around 33 mph (53 km/h) on the street without burning up too much battery, then slow it down and enjoy my trail rides with more than enough capacity to make it all the way back home. To summarize, this thing is crazy in a good way, and worth the $3,495 price for the sheer power and utility of this AWD full-suspension dual battery e-bike.If you want to learn more about the E-Cells Super Monarch in detail, check out my full-length Super Monarch review or watch my review video below.Next on the list is the M2S M600 FS AT, a full-suspension all-terrain electric mountain bike with a powerful mid-drive motor. Remember that crazy 1.5 kW Bafang ultra motor from the FREY EX above? Well, this motor isn’t quite as powerful, but it’s just one step below the Ultra motor in Bafang’s lineup. This is the Bafang M600 and it is still a powerhouse that puts out 120 Nm of torque. In fact, some people actually prefer this motor since it is plenty powerful but a bit easier on bike parts. With 120 Nm of torque, you can still tackle just about any obstacle that comes your way. On the bike side of things we’re rocking DNM suspension, Tektro Auriga hydraulic disc brakes on 180 mm rotors, and Shimano Alivio transmission. You also get a built-in headlight, something you don’t find on all electric mountain bikes. The M2S M600 FS AT is also more affordable than a lot of high-power, full-suspension electric mountain bikes at $2,999. It’s not quite as fast as the other two bikes we’ve seen so far, topping out at around 25 mph (40 km/h), but that’s plenty for most trail riders, and works just fine for bike lane riding. If you’ve been looking for a full-suspension electric mountain bike with a powerful mid-drive motor, but don’t want something quite as excessive as the FREY EX or Super Monarch, then the M2S M600 FS AT could be right up your alley.If you want to learn more about the M2S M600 FS AT in detail, check out my full-length M2S M600 FS AT review or watch my review video below.FREY is on the list a second time with a completely different type of full-suspension electric bike. The FREY CC is a full-suspension commuter bike, words you don’t often hear together. But boy does the suspension on this bike turn it into a great ride. Upfront the Frey CC sports a RockShox Recon fork complimented by a Monarch shock hidden in the frame in the rear. Not the craziest downhill e-bike suspension by any means, but more than enough for a commuter bike that you can definitely take shortcuts through the air on.I absolutely love using full-suspension e-bikes as commuter bikes. You don’t find full-suspension on commuters often partly for the cost and partly for the added weight. But with e-bikes, the added weight doesn’t really cause much of a penalty while riding since the motor can overcome any additional pounds.And speaking of the motor, this FREY bike is also rocking the 1.5 kW Bafang Ultra motor with its 160 stump-pulling newton-meters of torque. Oh man, I love this motor!If you’ve got a hilly commute or just want to get up to speed quickly, this is the motor that will get you there. I have yet to see a hill it can’t climb, and when matched with the commuter oriented FREY CC frame and that Rockshox suspension, it turns this into the ultimate urban assault e-bike. I should note that this motor is almost too awesome, as it can be tough on bike transmission components like chains and sprockets. It is absolutely critical that you ride in the proper gear (not the fastest gear all the time!) and exercise proper shifting when using this motor, which means laying off the throttle or pedal assist for a brief moment while shifting gears. I even occasionally lightly tap the brake lever while shifting – not enough to engage the brake pads – but enough to trigger the motor shutoff. That keeps my shifts smooth and my bike parts in one piece.In talking with other FREY riders that do hard mountain biking, 400 miles  (640 km) is a reasonable lifespan for their chains. But if you don’t shift properly or you ride around in highest gear all the time (a big no-no!) then you could be forking over cash for a new chain in under 100 miles (160 km).I’m over 100 miles on my FREY EX and have almost no wear on my smallest three sprockets. My chain doesn’t look new, but it’s still in great shape. The point is: exercise caution and ride correctly, and your chain and sprockets will thank you.The price for the FREY CC is more than fair at $2,980. And I didn’t even mention that you’re getting a large 840 Wh battery, high-end Magura MT5e 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes, a Shimano M6000 transmission, etc. This is truly a high-end full-suspension electric commuter bike at a price that can put similar spec’d bikes from companies like Riese & Müller to shame for charging so much. I absolutely recommend the FREY CC anytime I hear someone is looking for a powerful, full-suspension commuter e-bike. It just ticks all of my boxes.If you want to learn more about the FREY CC full-suspension electric commuter bike in detail, check out my full-length FREY CC review or watch my review video below.Lastly we’re going to feature something that is entirely different yet is still a really fun full-suspension e-bike. The Fiido L2 e-bike actually spans a few categories. Sure, it’s a full-suspension e-bike, but it’s also a folding e-bike, and it’s also kind of a moped-style bike, and it is even something of a utility bike with that rear seat on it that doubles as a rack. The rear seat is small enough that you can really only carry a child back there, but it’s a nice little addition.As far as suspension goes, the Fiido L2 has dual coilovers in the rear that are pretty good, and a front suspension fork that is, ehhh, alright. Together they work pretty well and combine with a suspension saddle to give a very nice ride. The wheels are cast instead of spoked which means you never have to deal with broken spokes or adjust spoke tension over time. The rear wheel houses a 350 W motor that is absolutely putting out more than 350 W. The first clue is that the bike is running on a 48 V electrical system which is definitely going to provide more power than typical 36 V 350 W units, and the second clue is that the Fiido L2 takes off like a bat out of hell and can climb hills that you wouldn’t have expected. And speaking of that 48 V battery, it’s a 20 Ah pack, meaning you’ve got almost 1 kWh of capacity here, which is pretty nuts. That translates into around 50 miles or 80 km of range, meaning many people could probably get away with charging this bad boy just once a week or less, depending on their commute. When it comes to commutes, this is obviously an urban e-bike. It’s got bike lane written all over it. The top speed is also pretty slow, at just 15 mph (25 km/h), meaning it is spec’d more like a European or Asian e-bike. But if that’s fast enough for you and you just want a simple and affordable full-suspension e-bike for city riding, the Fiido L2 has you set at around $800 bucks. At that price, this thing is a steal!If you want to learn more about the Fiido L2 full-suspension electric folding e-bike in detail, check out my full-length Fiido L2 review or watch my review video below.I hope you enjoyed my list of my five favorite full-suspension e-bikes I’ve reviewed this year. It can be tough to choose just five, and there are other great bikes that I’d like to include, but I’ve put on other lists, such as the full-suspension Juiced Scorpion, which I included on my Top 5 electric moped list.We’ve also tried other interesting full-suspension bikes such as the 350W UHVO on the ultra-low-price end of the spectrum and the Greyp G6 on the ultra-high-price end. There are a ton of great full-suspension e-bikes out there and we hope you’ll stick around to see many more here on Electrek in the future.Don’t forget to come back tomorrow for another list of my top 5 e-bikes for summer 2020 in the next category!",ebikes
2020/07/26,"The moped or minibike form factor for e-bikes has become a breakout success this year. A wave of new models has poured out from every corner of the e-bike industry, giving us exciting new options to choose from. I’ve been fortunate enough to test a pile of these types of e-bikes, and now I’m compiling my list of the Top 5 that you need to see!This is part of a Top 5 E-Bikes for Sumer 2020 series that we’re currently running to help introduce our readers to some great e-bikes to hit the road or trail this summer.Stick around over the next few days to see our choices for the following categories of electric bikes:And be sure to check out our video below that showcases all of the electric mopeds in this list in action.First up we have the ONYX RCR, which is definitely the leader of the pack right now when it comes to high power and high-speed electric mopeds. The RCR is somehow perpetually on backorder since the company can’t seem to produce them as fast as they can sell them, despite having two California factories and being in business for two years now. But the bike is worth the wait, as it can hit nearly 60 mph or 100 km/h thanks to its 3 kW continuous rear hub motor that puts out around 5.5 kW of peak power. I got it up to 59 mph myself, and the bike felt rock solid and stable. A big part of that is the design. The frame was created by leading modern-day moped designer Tim Seward and is based on the classic Puch frames. I even took the RCR off-roading for a bit and found the ride to be quite good for such a simple little bike. Range is super variable and will depend on whether you’re scooting around town at 20 mph (32 km/h), or zipping up those canyon roads at 60 mph (100 km/h). In the city at 20 mph, Onyx says you’ll get a maximum of 75 miles (120 km) of range. But expect that to drop off steeply once you lay heavily on the throttle. When it comes to the RCR’s pedals, they’re mostly vestigial and there to keep the bike quasi-legal. Sure, you can pedal it, but it’s not a comfortable or fun bike to pedal. Those pedals are basically footrests for all intents and purposes. Plus at the speeds this thing can hit, you won’t be able to keep up with the pedals most of the time. In addition to being the fastest moped on this list, it’s also the most expensive. There’s no sale right now, so its priced at its full MSRP of $4,149, plus shipping. And while that’s pretty pricey, the fact that there’s such a long waiting list shows that people are still lining up to fork it over for an RCR.If you want to learn more about the RCR in detail, check out my full-length ONYX RCR review or watch my review video below.Next we’re going in a different direction, the humble little RadRunner from Rad Power Bikes. This cute little thing isn’t particularly fast, at just 20 mph (32 km/h), but it’s a hell of a lot more affordable than the ONYX RCR, coming in at just $1,199 with free shipping!And the Radrunner is very much a different kind of bike. It’s got that step-thru, moped-style frame, but this bike is all about utility. I mean, just look at how many accessories you can fit on this thing, come on! I’ve got mine kitted out with the passenger kit that includes footpegs and the bench seat on the rear, but then I went and added the cargo box up front, which has been great to use as a small trunk. I like it better than the rack for things that I don’t want to worry about tying down in the wind.Despite the modest top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), it’s got a great range of up to 45 miles (72 km) from its 672 Wh battery. And the 750W hub motor puts out 80 NM of torque, making it plenty powerful for pulling passengers or tackling hills.There are a few places where Rad did make reasonable compromises to keep the price down. The display is a super simple LED display that doesn’t really give you much more info than the bare necessities of battery life and pedal assist mode. There’s also no multi-speed transmission, instead, the bike is a single-speed. The single-speed design doesn’t bother me too much since the gear ratio is actually pretty decent, and the bike is already quite pedal-able. It doesn’t feel awkward to pedal like a lot of electric mopeds do. All in all the RadRunner packs a few compromises but is mostly a big winner in my book, especially for its insanely affordable price.If you want to learn more about the RadRunner, check out my full-length RadRunner review, or watch my review video below.Next up we’re checking out the Ariel Rider D-Class, an all wheel drive electric minibike that has power for days. Like, seriously. Just. So. Much. Power. Those motors are 750W nominal hubs but Ariel Rider has them pulling peak power of 1,500W. Between the two of them, that means you’ll hit 3kW of power during acceleration. For me, that’s enough to do burnouts like a piece of cake. It’s also enough for high-speed riding. I hit a maximum of around 33 mph (53 km/h) on the Ariel Rider D-Class. At those speeds, the front suspension helps but the lack of rear suspension means that if you hit a good-sized bump, prepare for your rear end to part ways with the seat for a heart-stopping second.Speaking of that seat, it’s one of the most comfortable electric moped seats I’ve ever had the pleasure of sinking into. It almost makes up for the lack of rear suspension. Almost.Up front, we’ve got that beautiful giant headlight matched by a rear LED taillight on the back of the battery. That battery is a fairly high capacity one too, at 864 Wh. Theoretically, that will take you around 40 miles (64 km) on a charge at average speeds, but definitely not if you’re riding at top speed the whole time. You can extend the range a bit by pedaling, and the D-Class is actually quite comfortable to pedal. And believe me, a good pedaling electric moped is a rarity.Priced at $2,395, the Ariel Rider D-Class is mid-range in terms of electric moped pricing, but the bike’s high top speed, ridiculously fun power level, and large capacity battery make it worth the price, in my opinion.If you want to learn more about the Ariel Rider D-Class, check out my full-length review, or watch my D-Class review video below.This might be cheating, but I’m going to list two of Super73’s mopeds here. I think that’s fair, especially since Super73 is perhaps the first company to come to mind for many people when thinking about moped-style electric bikes. They didn’t invent the category, but they were one of the earliest and played a major role in building it into what it is today.First let’s check out the Super73-Z1, which is the brand’s budget model. Its price varies but is usually in the $1200 to $1,400 range. It packs a 900W peak motor and gets up to 20 mph (32 km/h). The range isn’t great at about 20 miles (32 km) in optimal conditions, but in real-world conditions it gets a bit less. It’s also not the best bike to pedal, in fact, it is downright awkward to pedal. On this e-bike, you’ll want to just rely on the throttle and cruise around like a minibike, which is basically what it is. Those wide tires make turns so much fun to lean into, and the decently powerful motor pulls you right through and out the other end. While the Super73-Z1 is a nice bike, if you can spring for it then I recommend upgrading from the Z series to the S series. I’ve spent some good time on the Super73-S1, which has a higher power motor and gets up to 25 mph (40 km/h). It’s also a bit more comfortable to pedal, though it’s still best ridden with the throttle, in my opinion. The Super73-S1’s larger 768 Wh battery will take you further than the Z1 also. Super73 claims up to 50 miles (80 km) of range, but again, that’s in ideal conditions. The S1 gives you some other nice additions such as hydraulic disc brakes, which are just such a big convenience upgrade, in my opinion. Right now the Super73-S1 is priced at $1,800 and is definitely worth the upgrade over the Z1, especially if you live in a hilly area or just want the extra range and nicer parts.You can learn more by reading my full-length Super73-Z1 review or my full-length Super73-S1 review. You can also check out my review video for each bike below.Lastly, finishing up the Top 5 electric mopeds I’ve tested for summer 2020 is the Juiced Scorpion. It’s not last because it lacks anything compared to the rest of these, but rather because I needed something impressive to round out the list. The Juiced Scorpion just screams attitude and style. I mean, c’mon… look at this thing! This is what a modern-day electric moped should look like. It’s got both front and rear suspension, plus a pretty decent seat. Not nearly as comfy as the Ariel Rider D-Class’s seat, but still quite nice. And with the added rear suspension, the ride is very comfortable. What isn’t nearly as comfortable is the pedaling. It’s another bike that can be pedaled, and it’s fine for pedaling, but it’s not amazing. I used the pedal-assist a lot but I always felt more comfortable ripping on the throttle on the Juiced Scorpion. I imagine that very few people are going to get this model as a mainly pedal-assist bike. It’s more for cruising in style and using for utility-type trips. For that use, it’s perfect, especially with that big rack on the rear that is included standard. The one area that was a bit of a bummer on the Juiced Scorpion was the power level. It’s just fine, but the 750W motor didn’t blow me away. The bike looks so awesome that I was just expecting more power. And even though the power is adequate, it just wasn’t as roaring as I had hoped. But that’s ok because Juiced has you covered with a higher power version of the scorpion known as the HyperScorpion. It’s about $700 more than the $2,200 base level Scorpion, but it gets 30+ mph speeds (50+ km/h) compared to a top end of about 25 mph (40 km/h) h on the base Scorpion, and it comes with a bigger battery, mirrors, turn signals, etc. Both are great options but the HyperScorpion is what you want for really powerful riding and for going farther on a charge. Even if you want to stick with the base Scorpion though, you’ll definitely be cruising around town in style.Learn more about the Juiced Scorpion by reading my full-length review, or watch my review video below!That’s my list of the Top 5 electric mopeds for summer 2020! If electric mopeds aren’t your thing though, don’t worry because we have many more Top 5 e-bikes coming soon. Keep checking back this week for the rest of the list!",ebikes
2020/07/25,"Peugeot is serious about its e-bikes, with a wide line of electric mountain bikes, electric folders, city e-bikes, and even road e-bikes. But the French aren’t done there — Peugeot has announced it is getting into the trekking game with a new line of eT01 Crossover e-bikes that marry trail-ruggedness with urban riding.I’ve admired Peugeot’s electric bikes ever since seeing them in person at the Paris Motor Show in 2018.Those were mostly the company’s electric mountain and gravel bikes, which have been a Peugeot e-bike staple.In a move that matches similar trends in the industry towards trekking e-bikes, Peugeot’s six new e-bikes in the Crossover eT01 line combine the best of mountain bikes and city bikes in set of do-anything urban e-bikes.The new model line starts with the Crossover eT01 D9, which is available in a high-step (Sport) or mid-step (Mixt) frame style. The Crossover eT01 D9 features a Bosch Active Line mid-drive motor that gets paired with a Bosch PowerTube 400 Wh battery. Peugeot says it should take you 110 km (68 miles) on a single charge, presumably in the lowest pedal assist setting.The bike wears Hutchinson Python 2 tires featuring aggressive knobbies all the way to the sidewall and sports Shimano MT201 hydraulic disc brakes.The Crossover eT01 D9 will set you back €2,499 (or about $2,900), including EU VAT.The press release provided by Peugeot claims an aluminum frame, while the website says the bike uses a carbon frame. Based on the pricing, I’m inclined to believe the press release. The lack of a Monarch rear shock or a “Ruby Red” color also leads me to believe there’s a good ol’ copy/paste error on the website.The next step up in the line is the Peugeot Crossover eT01 D10 Equipped, which bumps up the power with a larger Bosch Performance CX mid-drive motor. The battery also gets a 20% bump in capacity to the PowerTube 500 Wh battery, though the max range stays the same at 110 km (68 miles).In addition to more motor power and battery capacity, the higher price of €3,299 (or about US$3,800) including EU VAT also gets you a fully equipped bike with LED lights, mudguards, and rear rack, plus an upgrade from Shimano Alivio transmission components to higher-spec Shimano Deore components.The Peugeot Crossover eT01 D10 is also available in the high-step (Sport) or mid-step (Mixt) frame styles.For those that want to get a little more aggressive with their choice of terrain, the Peugeot Crossover eT01 FS adds full suspension with front and rear travel of 80 mm. The standard FS model features the same Bosch Active Line motor and PowerTube 400 Wh battery as the D9 above and is priced at €3,299 (or about $3,800) including EU VAT. If you’re looking for full suspension AND the higher-spec motor and battery combo, then the flagship model in the Crossover line is what you’ll want. The Peugeot Crossover eT01 FS Equipped combines the Bosch Performance CX motor, PowerTube 500 Wh battery, and full suspension frame together.It also adds the LED light package, mudguards, and rack into the picture, resulting in the ultimate fully-equipped electric trekking bike for the city and occasional off-road excursions.Of course, to get the best, you’ll have to pay the most. The Peugeot Crossover eT01 FS Equipped is priced at €3,999 (or about $4,660) including EU VAT.What do you think of Peugeot’s new line of crossover trekking e-bikes? Let us know in the comments below!",ebikes
2020/07/24,"Day6 is a bike company on the path to electrify their bike lineup. Although the bike is made for accessibility, the detail that has gone into the geometry and design really shine through in a race-car feeling.Day6 bikes are new to me and I believe new to a lot of the electric bike community as well. I think they have the potential to take the market by storm. This electric bike is very new and very good. Although it amounts to a conversion at the moment, it’s still worth a good look.What if I told you that this total tractor seat comfort bike could hold over 400lbs, corner like a sports car, and allows more riders into electric cycling?The Day6 totally does.I want to focus on the ride aspect since it’s absolutely amazing. After that, we’ll talk about some of the livability issues I’ve had, and then the bright future for the bike.At first glance, the Samson is a combination of comfort and accessibility. The low step-through height, the bottom bracket forward position, and those tall ape hanger bars make this bike super easy to walk into and feel like sitting in a car. This bike was specially made for those who have lower back pain. Instead of riding on a full recumbent or a mobility trike, now there’s an option that is less cumbersome and less stigmatizing.The Day6 also supports a good deal of weight on the frame: 400lbs. While the cargo capacity is limited, this means a large rider is completely at home, such as 19-year NBA veteran, Pistons power forward, and World Champion Rick Mahorn and 18-year NFL veteran and seven-time Pro Bowler Lomas Brown. You don’t need to be taller than a refrigerator to enjoy the bikes, ‘cause there’s one other aspect that completely shocked me.The Day6 has remarkable handling and steering. A big part of it is the lower position of the rider, and thus a low center of gravity. Another part of it is the seat. On account of all that surface area, the extra contact with your hips enables finer, more intuitive balance that can be leveraged to steer the bike effortlessly. I was so enthralled I decided to do some donuts at the high-school. The bike made me feel so confident that I crashed while riding way too fast, I had a blast. I really didn’t expect to like this bike so much, but this fresh take on cycling made my week. Let’s make a hard turn and talk about some of the negatives, shall we?Although there are different sizes to fit all sorts of people, comparatively, the bike is tall and long, so if you’re commuting or parking the bike in an apartment, you’d best make some space for it. That long wheelbase may or may not fit on a car rack, be aware of that. Despite the cornering I mentioned earlier, off-road, the bike lacks control, since there is very little weight on the front tire. For flat stuff, you’re probably ok, but tight, technical riding isn’t a strong suit. I use backpacks a lot, so on account of the seat, I was out of luck there. I wish I opted for the rear rack listed on the Day6 bikes’ website. My bad.Conspicuously absent from this review is the mention of specific components. Let’s do that now.Mechanically, there are differences between the models, such as the brakes, shifter, tire size. This model, the Samson, had hydraulic discs, and Shimano Deore shifting, which I really enjoyed.Electrically, Day6 is currently in the process of evolving their bikes to the electric market. Right now the bikes are conversions, which is normal for bike companies who are headed down this path. You can get a mid-drive option, as reviewed, with a Bafang BBSHD, a classic performer, or the hub drive option listed on their site. I’m going to guess that Day6 is trying a few options, and will soon hone in on a more factory-made electric bike.Here in the USA, the largest market for electric bikes is baby boomers. As father time creeps in, bikes like the Day6 will become more and more popular. When the demography and population pyramid realigns to normal, we’ll still have these great bikes for years to come. I’m really excited to have found and showcase this company to you — the viewer — because I think it will help more people enjoy our beautiful country. Electric bikes have changed people’s lives with their capabilities, and the Day6 bikes are another way of extending that reach. Even if you don’t need one for physical reasons, the bike is loads of fun and if you’re like me, that’s why you love electric bikes in the first place.",ebikes
2020/07/24,"Instead of the electric motorcycle that Ducati has long promised us, its latest two-wheeled electric vehicle is another electric bicycle. This time, the company is announcing its new Ducati e-Scrambler electric bike.Ducati is no stranger to electric bikes, having produced a number of them over the last few years as part of a partnership with electric bicycle company Thok.Previously Ducati has focused on high-performance electric mountain bikes, but now the company’s new Ducati e-Scrambler puts it squarely in urban territory.The e-Scrambler is an urban trekking bike with a Shimano electric bicycle system at its core.That means it features the Shimano Steps E7000 motor, which puts out a nominal 250 watts and an actual 60 Nm of torque, all from a pint-sized 2.8 kg (6 lb) mid-drive setup.Energy comes from a 504 Wh Shimano battery that gets mounted underslung-style to the downtube, a favorite mounting position for Ducati….. err, Thok.There’s no word on the estimated range of the e-bike, but on a similar Shimano setup I can get around 75 miles of extrapolated range with a medium amount of pedaling effort.A Suntour XCR fork with 100 mm travel offers a bit of suspension relief up front, something the hydroformed 6061 aluminum alloy frame doesn’t.Brakes come in the form of a pair of 4-piston Sram Guide T units clamping down on some giant 203 mm rotors. Sram also provides the transmission, a NX 11-speed in the rear. Both are good components, though not at the top end of Sram’s parts hierarchy by any stretch of the imagination.The Ducati e-Scrambler gets Thok’s e-plus wheels sporting Pirelli Cycl-e GT 27.5″x2.35″ tires.The bike even boasts a dropper seat post, integrated lights, and a rear rack rated for 25 kg (55 lb) loads — all in a bike weighing just 22.5 kg (49.6 lb) without the pedals. “Why without the pedals?” you may ask. Presumably because once you screw them on, you’ll have to say 50 lbs, which sounds a lot heavier to the marketing folks than 49.6 lb.For pricing, the Ducati e-Scrambler will run you €3,699 ($4,280). It’s available directly from Ducati as well as through their dealer network.Between the included fenders, built-in lights, and high-strength frame with decently large volume tires, the Ducati e-Scrambler is shaping up to be quite an urban trekking e-bike. I’m a huge Shimano mid-drive fan, so I’m always glad to see the unit popping up on more bikes.I love that they included a dropper seat post. At first it might sound a bit silly, especially for an urban e-bike. Dropper seat posts are normally used by mountain bikers so they can adjust their seat height on the fly without dismounting as they cross different types of terrain.But for an urban bike, when you’re loaded down with cargo and come to a rest, it could be nice to hit a button and let your feet casually sink toward the ground. I’d much rather flat-foot it at a red light than hop in and out of the saddle each time.The price is a bit high for me, especially since some of that is going toward the Ducati decal on the side. But it’s obviously a very different bike than a budget-minded RadCity or something of the like.For someone who wants a high-spec’d urban trekking bike and isn’t squeamish about cost, everything I’ve seen makes me think this should be a pretty solid ride.",ebikes
2020/07/23,"What happens when you mix cruiser bike styling with a mountain bike fork and motorcycle-level hydraulic brakes? Oh, and when you slap on a 1,250 W peak motor for good measure? You get the Model R from the aptly-named Electric Bike Company.I visited the company’s hometown of Newport Beach, California to see this new e-bike in person and put it through its paces.Electric Bike Company was kind enough to invite me and out host me so I could not only test the new Model R e-bike, but so that I could also tour their factory and watch the bikes being built.From the high-end parts to the enthusiastic team, the quality and energy that I saw going into these e-bikes surprised me.But the best part is of course the ride, and I spent the afternoon touring Newport Beach in style on a new Model R. From the sandy beach paths to the city’s hills, I rode it all and soaked up the sun.Check out my video review below to see the bike in action, then read on for my complete thoughts.We’ll get to the performance in a moment, but I want to start by talking about the experience.Electric Bike Company puts a lot of effort into designing comfort into their bikes, and the Model R is no exception.You can really feel the cruiser bike roots of the company shining through with the pedal-forward geometry, plush comfortable seat, and wide handlebars. Plus the step-through design makes it easy to mount and dismount.The whole time I was riding it, I just felt like I was cruising down a California boardwalk while the Beach Boys looped in my head. Which is perhaps because that’s where I was and what I was actually doing, but the point is that the bike can give you that feeling no matter where you are. That’s just how it rides.But where the bike really comes into its own is when you consider the performance.If you want to take it slow and easy, you can embrace the cruiser lifestyle. But if you want to open it up and really get some wind in your face, the Model R is more than willing to oblige.With a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) and 1,250 W of peak power, this e-bike is both a speedster and a hill climber. Between the flat open coastal roads and the winding cliff climbs, I had ample opportunity to test out both types of riding.The large 3″ tires that are custom made for Electric Bike Company make you feel nice and secure when you lean hard into turns.And between the large air volume and the front suspension fork with hydraulic lockout and pre-load adjustment, the ride is just oh so nice.While I’m usually guilty of laying on the throttle more than I should, the pedal-assist on the Model R worked great and the pedal forward geometry was nice and comfortable. I could pedal easily and still flat-foot it at stops.I’m no lycra-boy, I want to be able to rest comfortably with both feet on the ground while waiting for that family of six to finish dragging their beach cart across the bike lane.At $2,199, the Electric Bike Company Model R is on the higher end of the moderate price range for leisurely cruiser-style electric bikes. But in my opinion, you get what you pay for and more here.Not only are the bikes built in the USA (see my factory tour video below), but you also get a bunch of high-end parts.The brakes are 4-piston Tektro Dorado hydraulic disc brakes, a model we normally only see on higher-end electric mountain bikes.The motor comes with a 10-year warranty, and the battery comes with a 5-year warranty.The batteries use genuine Samsung cells, something you won’t find in most of the major budget e-bike brands.The bikes arrive in a giant box, fully assembled. All you have to do is turn the handlebars and get ready to ride. And as someone who has literally assembled hundreds of e-bikes, I can’t tell you how nice it is to just get an e-bike and be able to ride without having to first start wrenching on it.So between all of those add-ons that you won’t find from most other suppliers, the price seems fair to me.The Model R costs a bit more than a budget electric cruiser or leisure e-bikes, but it’s also a better bike.It’s better spec’d, comes with nicer parts, is built locally by American workers, and supports a local company.But perhaps most importantly of all, it’s just a fun e-bike to ride! It’s the epitome of a comfortable cruiser and yet packs in the power and utility to serve as a daily rider e-bike for more than just leisurely jaunts.All in all, I’m super happy with my experience on the Model R and I would definitely recommend the bike as a winner.",ebikes
