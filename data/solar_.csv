2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2023/03/16,"Maerdang hydropower station in China, the “highest-altitude facility of its kind,” is expected to begin operations in March 2024.The state-run China Daily reports that Maerdang, which is currently under construction in Qinghai province, is at 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) above sea level, on the upper reaches of the Yellow River. For perspective, the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania stands at 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level.Maerdang’s operator, China Energy, says that the hydropower station will have a total installed capacity of 2.2 million kilowatts, and it’s expected to generate an average of more than 7.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year once it’s up and running. It’s the company’s first integrated renewable facility to include hydropower, solar, and energy storage.China Energy says Maerdang will cut 2.56 million metric tons of standard coal equivalent consumption and 8.16 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.China is the world leader in renewable energy, yet it’s also the world’s largest coal miner and consumer. Its coal output rose by 5.8% in the first two months of 2023 from the same period a year earlier, government data showed yesterday.

2023/03/16,"PivotGen repowers aging wind farms, and together with its partner ACEN, it’s acquiring eight wind farms in Texas to give them a new lease on life. Chicago-based PivotGen, which has to date repowered 2,176 MW of wind, and renewable energy platform ACEN have formed a partnership called UPC Power Solutions. The new partnership has signed an agreement to buy the Texas wind farms from energy storage developer Glidepath, and it will repair, upgrade, and repower them.Electrek spoke with Tim Rosenzweig, CEO and cofounder of PivotGen, about how old wind farms are repowered, and what UPC Power Solution’s plans are going forward.Electrek: Tell us about the Texas wind farms that you’re buying.Tim Rosenzweig: They’re eight projects in the Texas Panhandle. Glidepath, who is selling the wind farms to us, has pivoted their focus toward energy storage. The wind farms range in size from 10 to 68 MW. They’re clustered within a drive of each other. They’re selling into the network there, and the turbines are made by Suzlon. The first wind farms went online between 2006 to 2009. Our repowering plan is to get them fully functional and optimized within six to 12 months. Electrek: How does a wind farm refurbishment work, exactly?Tim Rosenzweig: Think of it like fixing a car: You have different components, and there’s a supply chain. OEMs get their stuff from other people. We’re doing that: going to suppliers and getting those parts. There’s a robust international supply chain for wind turbines.There’s a whole spectrum of stuff you can do. Our plan is to go in, project by project, and plan what makes the most sense. Some require lots of new components, and others require less refurbishment. Some were built at the same time the iPhone came out, and think about how much the iPhone has improved. We increase their megawatt hours through better efficiency. A lot of the wind power industry is focused on growth, and that’s great, but after 20 years, we don’t want the older ones to just fall off the radar. We want to support these local communities with service jobs instead of tearing them down. And we’ve picked up some great technical guys from GE to figure out the optimal plan on a turbine-by-turbine basis.Employment-wise, we like to retain the people currently working on the wind farms, and we’ll bring in expertise where needed. We’re also looking to put in innovative technologies to help wind power be better. Electrek: Once you acquire the wind farms, do you keep them or sell them to someone else? Tim Rosenzweig: We’re going to look to own and operate. The benefit of the [Biden administration’s] recent Inflation Reduction Act is that it extended the window for wind and solar to get built. It also has a production tax credit transferability mechanism that will enable new capital structures, so it opens the door for this type of project.Read more: A Danish wind turbine giant just discovered how to recycle all bladesPhoto: wind-turbine-models.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/14,"Wind turbine rotor firm Gulf Wind Technology and Shell New Energies US will together develop hurricane-proof wind turbines unique to the Gulf of Mexico.Shell has committed $10 million to create the Shell Gulf Wind Technology Accelerator program with Louisiana-based Gulf Wind Technology, which specializes in developing hurricane-proof wind turbine technology.The accelerator program aims to develop, test, and deploy a Gulf of Mexico-specific demonstrator turbine as early as 2024.In addition to its R&D work on the hurricane-resistant turbine, the Shell Gulf Wind Technology Accelerator will also launch an education and training facility to develop a workforce for the region’s new offshore wind industry.  James Martin, CEO of Gulf Wind Technology, explains why the Gulf of Mexico requires a unique approach when it comes to the development of its offshore wind industry:Wind resources in the Gulf region are more variable than what you find on the East Coast where most US offshore wind development activity is currently happening.Seasonal hurricane conditions and moderate average wind speeds create a situation that requires a novel approach to the application of technology and the framework in which it is both developed and demonstrated. The program has been specifically created to address and fulfil this need and enable next steps for the region and for the industry.Louisiana has a 5 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind target by 2035, and late last month, the US Department of the Interior proposed the first-ever offshore wind lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico.That followed the Biden administration’s announcement in July 2022 that it would pursue the development of offshore wind energy in the Gulf, which is already a hub for oil and gas production.The Proposed Sale Notice announced includes a 102,480-acre area offshore Lake Charles, Louisiana, and two areas offshore Galveston, Texas, one comprising 102,480 acres and the other comprising 96,786 acres.

2023/03/14,"In an agrivoltaic study, UCLA engineers put a semi-transparent solar roof on a greenhouse, and some unexpected things happened with both the roof and the plants.The researchers at UCLA Samueli School of Engineering designed semi-transparent organic solar panels that can absorb energy from sunlight without blocking the light that the plants need. The study, “Achieving sustainability of greenhouses by integrating stable semi-transparent organic photovoltaics,” was published last week in Nature Sustainability. The research team’s organic solar cells rely on carbon-based materials, instead of inorganic substances used in conventional solar devices. The team incorporated a layer of L-glutathione, a tripeptide molecule made up of three amino acids: glutamine, cysteine, and glycine. It’s an antioxidant found naturally in the human body, and it’s sold over the counter as a dietary supplement to support overall health and well-being.The team found that adding L-glutathione extended the solar cells’ lifetime, improved their efficiency, and still allowed sunlight to reach plants in the greenhouse prototype, which was about the size of a small dollhouse.Lead scientist Yang Yang explained:Organic materials are uniquely suitable for agrivoltaics because of their light-absorption selectivity. The main drawback that has prevented their widespread use up to now is their lack of stability.Organic solar cells tend to degrade more quickly than inorganic solar cells because sunlight causes them to oxidize and thus lose electrons. The researchers found that the additional L-glutathione layer stopped the other materials in the solar cell from oxidizing. That in turn resulted in the organic cells maintaining more than 80% efficiency after 1,000 hours of continuous use — as opposed to less than 20% without the added layer, according to the UCLA Samueli newsroom.Researchers tracked the growth of such crops as wheat, mung beans, and broccoli in two different experiments. In one, they used a transparent glass roof with segments of inorganic solar cells on the greenhouse, and in another, the roof was made entirely from semi-transparent organic solar cells. The crops in the greenhouse with the organic solar roof grew more than the crops in the regular greenhouse. The scientists believe that happened because the L-glutathione layer blocked both ultraviolet rays that can inhibit plant growth and infrared rays that can cause greenhouses to overheat, thus causing the plants to need more water.Lead author Yepin Zhao said:We didn’t expect the organic solar cells to outperform a conventional glass-roof greenhouse.But we repeated the experiments multiple times with the same results and after further research and analysis, we discovered that plants don’t need as much sunlight to grow as we’d originally thought. In fact, too much sun exposure can do more harm than good, especially in climates such as California’s, where sunlight is more abundant.Would be interesting to see combined with other features like LED grow lights powered by battery packs (charged by the PV) to extend light to optimum, increased CO2 to the optimum, optimal hydroponics or drip, etc. The whole system might be net more efficient than versions that don’t make full use of natural sunlight. The research team has now established a startup at UCLA that aims to scale up production of the organic solar cells for industrial use, and they’re hoping to commercialize greenhouses with organic solar cell roofs in the future.Read more: These new vertical solar systems are specially designed for farmsPhoto: Yang Yang Laboratory/UCLAUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/13,"Thin-film solar panel maker Ascent Solar Technologies announced today that it’s going to repurpose its Thornton, Colorado, factory to accelerate industrial-scale commercialization of perovskite solar modules.Perovskite solar cells use a thin film of perovskite to harvest light, and they have the potential to be a low-cost, power-conversion-efficient alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells.However, perovskite solar cells still have some stability, environmental, and scalability issues, but efforts to work out the kinks in recent years by such research groups as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have delivered promising results.So the folks at Ascent have now decided that it’s time to take the next step forward, dedicating its Thornton factory to the development of perovskite solar cell manufacturing.Ascent’s lightweight and flexible solar modules have been used in such applications as portable charging, unmanned aerial vehicles, and building-integrated photovoltaics, and it’s now going to convert its patent-pending perovskite solar technology to industrial scale.The factory, which Ascent calls a “Perovskite Center of Excellence,” will feature R&D, manufacturing, and operations along with $30 million of industrial equipment.Last week, Ascent announced that it’s signed an agreement to acquire manufacturing assets from a “leading European manufacturer of thin-film solar technology and a worldwide license of its intellectual property portfolio” for $5 million.Rather than the author simply rewriting the press release, it would have been useful to state the problems with thin film perovskite panels. That way the readers would learn something, for example why it’s not appropriate to wrap their cars in the stuff. It’s not sufficient to state that the technology has stability, environmental, and scalability issues. The author that they are being paid to research, not simply rewrite already existing material. Jeffrey Max, president and CEO of Ascent Solar, said, “We’re fortunate that we have a manufacturing facility of this scope that we can dedicate to developing and delivering innovative Perovskite solar PV at scale… When translated to industrial scale, the efficiency gains we’ve recorded in the lab will be a game changer for the solar industry.”Read more: Biden administration announces $56 million for US solar manufacturingPhoto: Ascent Solar/TwitterUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/13,"GE Vernova is developing a 17-18 megawatt (MW) Haliade-X offshore wind turbine, CEO Scott Strazik confirmed during the company’s investor conference late last week. GE Vernova is GE’s portfolio of energy businesses, including Renewable Energy, Power, Digital, and Energy Financial Services. According to GE, which announced in December that GE Vernova’s global headquarters will be in Cambridge, Massachusetts, “it’s planned for a tax-free investment-grade spin-off from GE in early 2024.”“We’re getting a very positive reception from the market with our 17-18MW Haliade-X variant of what we’re shipping this year,” said Strazik. Specific details about the larger Haliade-X are not yet on GE’s website.GE Renewable Energy announced in December that its Haliade-X, the first wind turbine capable of more than 12 MW, received a full type certificate for operations up to 14.7 MW from DNV, the world’s largest independent certification body, which officially made it the world’s most powerful wind turbine.And the global race to develop gigantic offshore wind turbines is well under way, because in January, Chinese industrial manufacturer CSSC Haizhuang unveiled the rotor hub and nacelle for an 18 MW offshore wind turbine prototype.Haizhuang’s H260-18MW will have a rotor diameter of 853 feet (260 meters). To put that in perspective, that rotor diameter is as long as the height of the Haliade-X, which has a rotor diameter of 722 feet (220 meters). The H260-18MW turbine will have 420-feet-long (128-meter-long) blades with a sweep area of 570,487 square feet (53,000 square meters).Wind turbine manufacturers keep building larger turbines because the more power a turbine captures, the more the cost of electricity is reduced.Read more: A new study about seabirds and offshore wind turbines may surprise youPhoto: GE Renewable EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/10,"Despite Russia’s ongoing invasion, Ukrainian energy company DTEK Group has finished the construction of the first 114 megawatts (MW) of a 500 MW wind farm.In the spring of this year, 19 Vestas 6 MW wind turbines will begin to generate 114 MW of electricity. The Tyligulska wind farm, which is in the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine, is another step toward DTEK’s goal of achieving 30 GW of installed renewable energy capacity in Ukraine by 2030.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said: Despite all the challenges of this year of war, DTEK has constructed an additional 114 MW of green power generation for Ukraine. It’s been a difficult task, but thanks to the high levels of professionalism and bravery of the company’s employees, the new wind farm with 19 turbines will start operating this spring. DTEK is building new energy facilities because we believe in the victory of Ukraine. And we are sending a signal to international partners that it’s possible to invest in Ukraine today without waiting for the end of the war.The DTEK Group has every intention of completing Tyligulska so that it reaches its full 500 MW capacity. It’s seeking support from international donors and partners to further advance the project.Work on the wind farm initially stopped when Russia invaded Ukraine but resumed despite dangerous conditions – workers wore body armor in order to build the wind farm.Ukraine’s current installed renewable energy capacity, including the occupied energy facilities in the south of the country, is around 10 GW.

2023/03/06,"Wind, solar, and batteries make up 82% of 2023’s expected new utility-scale power capacity in the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) “Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory.”As of January 2023, the US was operating 73.5 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar capacity – about 6% of the country’s total.But solar makes up just over half of new US generating capacity expected to come online in 2023. And if it all goes as expected, it will be the most solar capacity added in a single year in the US. It will also be the first year that more than half of US capacity additions are solar.As of January 2023, 141.3 GW of wind capacity was operating in the US – about 12% of the US total. Another 7.1 GW are planned for 2023. Tax incentives, lower wind turbine construction costs, and new renewable energy targets are spurring the growth. And developers also plan to add 8.6 GW of battery storage power capacity to the grid this year, and that’s going to double total US battery power capacity.However, differences in the amount of electricity that different types of power plants can produce mean that wind and solar made up about 17% of the US’s utility-scale capacity in 2021, but produced 12% of electricity. Solutions such as energy storage, smart grids, and infrastructure development will help bridge that gap.Read more: The US’s largest solar panel maker just got a huge domestic order Photo: OrstedUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/02,"Swedish power giant Vattenfall did a two-year, €3 million study of seabirds at an offshore wind farm off Scotland – here’s what it found.The aim of the 115-page study, which took place at Vattenfall’s 11-turbine Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, aka the European Offshore Wind Deployment Center, was: …to improve our understanding of seabird flight behavior inside an offshore wind farm. This should be achieved through collection of as detailed seabird flight data as possible rather than through estimation of avoidance rates for collision risk modeling per se.Vattenfall, which is owned by the Swedish state, combined radar data with cameras to identify the species of seabird and create a three-dimensional image of birds’ flight patterns and how they avoid offshore wind turbines’ rotor blades.The movements of herring gulls, gannets, kittiwakes, and great black-backed gulls were studied in detail from April to October, when bird activity is at its height. (This study only looked at four bird species, but Vattenfall says the model can and should be applied to more types of seabirds and to onshore wind farms as well.) The study’s findings: Not a single collision between a bird and a rotor blade was recorded.Vattenfall says that the herring gulls and kittiwakes showed horizontal avoidance further away from rotor blades, 90-110 meters (295-361 feet) and 140-160 meters (459-525 feet), respectively, while the gannets and great black-backed gulls only exhibited avoidance behavior at 40 and 50 meters (131 and 164 feet) from the tips of rotor blades.And if you just muttered under your breath, “Well, they would say that, wouldn’t they?” Vattenfall says it’s got video evidence to back up its study’s findings – ten thousand videos of birds flying around Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, in fact.Henrik Skov, who led the project, said:This is the first time that any kind of bird species has been studied this closely and in detail at an offshore wind farm. And these birds are really good at avoiding the turbines. Now we need studies on more varieties.He added that surveys on bird behavior are part of an overall effort to avoid building wind farms in flight corridors.Curious to know why they spent all that money on monitoring equipment when they could have just floated some large circular floating pontoons around a percentage of the base to simply count the number of fallen dead birds. Well, I guess I do know.By way of comparison, each of these human-related sources kill millions or even billions of birds per year: fossil fuels, deforestation, pesticides, windows, and the common housecat.Read more: A Danish wind turbine giant just discovered how to recycle all bladesPhoto: “First Year Herring Gull In Mid Air” by Jeffsphotoart is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/01,"Princess Elisabeth Island, a pioneering electricity grid at sea, connects offshore wind farms to the mainland, and it also creates connections with neighboring countries.The Princess Elisabeth Zone is a future 3.5 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farm that will be in the North Sea, almost 45 km (28 miles) off the coast of Belgium. Belgian electricity transmission system operator Elia is developing what will be the world’s first offshore artificial energy island. The island will act as a hub for electricity transmission, receiving power from the Princess Elisabeth Zone, which is the second Belgian offshore wind zone, as well as from interconnectors with other European countries such as the UK and Denmark. The energy generated by the wind turbines will be transmitted to the island via undersea cables, where it will then be converted to high-voltage electricity and distributed to Belgian mainland and other European countries. Elia announced yesterday that Belgian-based offshore construction companies DEME Group and Jan De Nul Group have formed joint venture TM EDISON in order to build Princess Elisabeth Island. Construction will start in early 2024, and completion is planned for mid-2026. It’s expected to be fully connected to all wind farms and the mainland by 2030.The energy island is expected to play a major role in meeting Belgium’s renewable energy targets and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Belgian government award the project with a grant of around €100 million ($106 million).

2023/02/28,"US utility-scale solar developer Lightsource bp has placed an order with First Solar, the largest solar panel maker in the US, for 4 gigawatts (GW) of advanced thin film solar modules.The thin film solar modules are scheduled to be delivered between 2026 and 2028, and will power Lightsource bp projects in the US. The deal includes orders for First Solar’s Series 6 Plus and next-gen Series 7 modules.For perspective, 4 GW of solar modules would be enough to power around 800,000 homes in the US, assuming an average annual electricity consumption of 5,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per household.Lightsource bp placed a previous order for up to 4.3 GW of solar modules in 2021, so today’s announcement puts the San Francisco-headquartered company in the running to be one of First Solar’s biggest clients.Kevin Smith, chief executive officer, Americas, Lightsource bp, said:The US solar industry is at a pivotal moment, poised to expand at an exponential rate with the Inflation Reduction Act serving as the catalyst.We are seizing the opportunity by not just growing our 20 GW development pipeline across the United States, but also creating sizeable demand for our US-based partner First Solar, which, in turn, is investing in innovation and manufacturing, and supporting thousands of direct and indirect American jobs.First Solar is unique among the world’s 10 largest solar manufacturers for being the only US-headquartered company and only manufacturer of thin film PV modules.The Tempe, Arizona-headquartered company uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV technology. Its ongoing investment in developing cadmium telluride since 1999 has made it the second most common PV technology in the world after crystalline silicon. CdTe solar cells are known for their high efficiency and low cost.First Solar’s third factory is expected to come online in Ohio in the first half of 2023, and it has a fourth factory in Alabama that’s under construction and expected to be operating by 2025.

2023/02/28,"The pace of clean technology rollout is set to put the EU at 45% renewable energy by 2030, according to new analysis from energy think tank Ember.That exceeds the 40% target originally set in the Fit-for-55 package. The European Climate Foundation summarizes what the Fit-for-55 package is:Released in two batches in July and December 2021, the “Fit for 55” package includes drafts of EU climate and energy legislation to underpin the bloc’s political pledge to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% in 2030 compared with 1990 levels. This target, a more ambitious one than the previously agreed 40% reduction goal for 2030, is part of the EU’s aim to become climate-neutral by 2050.Since Fit-for-55 was introduced in Europe in 2021, the capacity growth for clean technologies has ramped up a lot faster than everyone expected. A surge in solar power leads the boom, with 2030 capacity expected to be at least twice that originally forecast by EU policy. Rooftop solar in particular is showing especially rapid expansion, with huge growth already evident in 2022. High fossil fuel prices and subsidies in some EU countries have resulted in heat pump deployment being 50% higher – reaching at least 60 million in total – than Fit-for-55 forecasts.Electric vehicle rollout is expected to outpace Fit-for-55 targets by 30% – that is, the EV fleet is expected to expand to a minimum of 40 million – with record sales last year and newly announced EU policy already increasing momentum. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission’s REPowerEU plan – “the European Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030” – proposed raising the bloc’s 2030 renewable energy target from 40% to 45%. That plan had overwhelming support from the European Parliament, but some member states aren’t so keen, so negotiations will likely continue in March.Elisabeth Cremona, energy and climate data analyst at Ember, said:A new energy reality has unfolded across Europe since the Fit-for-55 package was presented eighteen months ago. As 40% renewables no longer reflects where we are heading, sticking with the lower target means aiming for failure. With a more realistic 45% target, the EU can align policy with where the markets are already heading, helping the EU respond to this unprecedented moment.Read more: Renewables will be the top source of global electricity by 2025UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/24,"Solar energy company Arevon Energy and San Diego Community Power have broken ground on the Vikings Energy Farm, one of the first solar peaker plants in the US.Vikings Energy Farm is a solar + storage power plant in Holtville, California, in Imperial Valley, near the Baja California border. It was first announced in May 2021. It will consist of First Solar thin film Cadmium Telluride PV solar modules and a Tesla Megapack for battery energy storage. Tesla Megapack stores energy for the grid reliably and safely, eliminating the need for gas peaker plants and helping to avoid outages. Each unit can store over 3 MWh of energy – enough energy to power an average of 3,600 homes for one hour.The Vikings Energy Farm solar peaker plant has a unique 1:1 configuration of 137 MW of solar and 150 MW/600 MWh of battery energy storage. That allows it to shift daytime solar production to late afternoon and evening hours, providing on-peak energy whenever necessary. Arevon says it will “power tens of thousands of homes” once it’s online, but did not indicate when the project will be completed.The project will provide renewable energy to San Diego Community Power and help meet peak summer demand and support grid reliability. A solar peaker plant uses solar energy to generate electricity during periods of high demand. It’s designed to provide reliable power during peak demand periods, and can help to reduce the need for fossil fuel-fired peaker plants, which are more expensive and produce greenhouse gas emissions.Read more: This solar + storage project could be a US grid game changerUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/23,"The US has a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 – and that can’t happen without floating offshore wind farms.The Departments of Energy, the Interior, Commerce, and Transportation are today on their second day of a two-day Floating Offshore Wind Shot Summit. The summit’s goal, which is being attended by federal and state government leaders, and industry and labor leaders, is to cut the cost of floating offshore wind energy by over 70% by 2035.MIT Technology Review noted in December:Estimates are tricky because the technology is so new, but the US Department of Energy pegs the cost of floating offshore wind at about $200 per megawatt hour. That’s significantly more expensive than the agency’s estimates for land-based wind ($30), solar ($35) and even fixed offshore wind ($80). The Summit aims to cut the cost to $45 per megawatt-hour. They want to achieve this with “breakthroughs across engineering, manufacturing, and other innovation areas.”So basically, the Summit is an intense brainstorming session that its delegates then have to roll out in a viable and timely way in order to achieve the Floating Offshore Wind Shot‘s goals:Offshore floating wind is now being rolled out all over the world. It’s also really new. In September 2022, a White House brief noted that “globally, only 0.1 GW of floating offshore wind has been deployed to date, compared with over 50 GW of fixed-bottom offshore wind.”And when it comes to the US, which is the very beginning of its offshore wind deployment, around two-thirds of US offshore wind energy potential is in water that’s too deep for fixed-bottom wind turbines.The US’s goal is to deploy 15 GW of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035, so it’s got its work cut out to reach this goal. But hey, it put a man on the moon in the 60s, and there’s already a fairly good general grasp of the technology, seeing how it’s already been successfully deployed in places like Norway, Scotland, and Portugal. The Floating Offshore Wind Shot’s goals are on point, and this effort is going to be herculean and extremely challenging. I’m hopeful, because really cool clean energy innovation that is being used IRL literally lands in my inbox every day. Let’s hope innovation and momentum triumphs at the Summit this week.Read more: World’s largest floating offshore wind farm is now onlinePhoto: WindFloat Atlantic, PortugalUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

These areas have the potential to power almost 1.3 million homes with clean energy.In 2022, BOEM reduced the size of the two areas from their draft versions to address concerns expressed by the Department of Defense and the US Coast Guard regarding shipping, marine navigation, and military operations.The Biden administration announced in July 2022 that it would pursue the development of offshore wind energy in the Gulf, which is already a hub for oil and gas production.Elizabeth Klein, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said:BOEM is committed to ensuring any offshore wind activities are done in a manner that avoids or minimizes potential impacts to the ocean and ocean users.Today’s announcement comes after years of engagement with Tribes, other government agencies, ocean users and stakeholders, and this proposed sale notice provides another opportunity for them to weigh in on potential offshore wind leasing in the Gulf of Mexico.The Proposed Sale Notice will publish in the Federal Register later this month, and that will initiate a 60-day public comment period. If the Department of the Interior decides to proceed with the sale, BOEM will publish a Final Sale Notice at least 30 days ahead of the sale that would announce the time and date of the lease sale and the companies qualified to participate in it.The expansion of the US offshore wind industry is a key part of the Biden administration’s plan to decarbonize the electricity sector by 2035.Read more: Here’s why the first commercial spiral-welded wind turbine tower is a game-changerUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/22,"PacWave is a US Department of Energy-funded, grid-connected, full-scale test facility for wave energy conversion technologies. It’s the first of its kind in the US, and construction is well under way. PacWave is also a joint venture with the state of Oregon and Oregon State University. It’s being developed off the coast of Newport, Oregon. Here’s what PacWave is going to look like, and how it’ll work:PacWave will be sited in water between 213 to 256 feet (65 to 78 meters) deep. It will be able to accommodate up to 20 wave energy converters – devices that convert wave energy into electricity – in four separate berths at the same time. Each berth will produce up to 5 megawatts (MW) of energy and will have a dedicated transmission cable – so the test site’s maximum power output from the test site will be 20 MW. Paris-based global cable-making giant Nexans today announced that it’s been selected to provide the four medium voltage AC cables (pictured above) that bring the energy from the berths to shore. The cable lengths are around 20 km (12.4 miles) each. PacWave is expected to come online by 2024.It’s still early days for marine renewable energy technologies, but SAE Renewables yesterday announced that its MeyGen tidal stream power project in Scotland, off the coast of Pentland Firth, generated the world’s first 50GWh of electricity from tidal power – a significant milestone for generating electricity from tidal power.

2023/02/21,"Growth of wind and solar power has saved the European Union (EU) €12 billion in avoided gas costs since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to a new analysis from energy think tank Ember.This Friday, February 24, marks a year since Russia invaded Ukraine. And in that rough period – from March 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023 – EU wind and solar grew by 50 TWh (+10%) since the start of the war, generating 23% of EU electricity in that period (546 TWh).The annual increase in wind and solar alone reduced the amount of gas required for electricity generation by 90 TWh (9 bcm) and avoided gas costs of €12 billion ($12.78 billion).Ember’s European Electricity Review 2023 showed a triple crisis facing the EU’s power sector in 2022: As Europe moved to cut ties with its biggest supplier of fossil gas, it faced the lowest levels of hydro and nuclear in at least 20 years. A drought across Europe led to the lowest level of hydro generation since at least 2000, and there were widespread unexpected French nuclear outages just as German nuclear units were closing.This is why the fossil fuel industry has no problem spending billions a year to prevent the installation of renewable energy with misinformation campaigns, paying off politicians and making fake grassroots organizations.  I have had solar on my home since 2012.  I still hear people telling me solar is a scam!  I have spreadsheets that prove my 2012 install paid for itself in 8.4 years.  I installed a smaller system on the north side of my home and it will pay for itself in 4.5 years.  Now it's all return on investment and that is if you ignore the benefits to the environment!However, wind and solar growth, alongside a fall in demand, helped the EU weather the crisis and prevented a threatened return to coal power.Sarah Brown, senior analyst at Ember, said:Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked Europe into action. Suddenly, gaping vulnerabilities due to fossil fuel dependence became a stark reality. The last year has been a scramble to address these risks through an accelerated transition to a cleaner, more secure power system. At the year marker of Russia’s devastating war in Ukraine, it remains critical that the EU rapidly expands solar and wind to attain permanent energy independence.The report’s executive summary states that “2023 will be quite the opposite”: Hydro generation will rebound, French nuclear units will return, wind and solar deployment will accelerate, and electricity demand will likely continue to fall over the coming months. In 2023, Europe is set to witness a huge fall in fossil fuels – of coal power, yes, but especially gas power.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/21,"The first commercial spiral-welded wind turbine tower has begun operation – here’s what it is and why it matters.The spiral-welded wind turbine tower was built by GE Renewable Energy and wind turbine producer Keystone Tower Systems. And after years of collaborating with the US Department of Energy, they installed the 89-meter-tall (292-foot-tall) tower on the GE 2.8-127 wind turbine.The US Department of Energy explains what spiral welding is:Spiral welding is when the steel used to make the tower is curled into a cylinder; essentially, these towers are built from meters-wide steel plates.The technique requires only one machine to construct a tower section, and it can produce towers up to twice as tall and 10 times faster than conventional towers.  Keystone designs and builds its own custom spiral welding wind turbine tower manufacturing equipment in Denver. The manufacturing process uses coil steel – flat-rolled steel that’s been coiled up into a roll or coil shape – and Keystone’s machine allows tapered towers with variable wall thickness to be manufactured from constant width sheets of steel. The manufacturing equipment completes the joining, rolling, fit-up, welding, and severing of a tower section – and that results in the continuous production of steel tower shells:And here’s why spiral-welded wind turbine towers are going to be impactful: Keystone says it can make the lightest, lowest-cost, and most structurally optimized towers in the wind turbine industry.GE and Keystone made their inaugural tower at Keystone’s factory in Pampa, Texas, in the state’s Panhandle. The brownfield factory was built at an idled factory that used to make oil and gas drilling equipment. The new wind turbine factory will return nearly 200 manufacturing jobs to the region.""Keystone’s machine allows tapered towers with variable wall thickness to be manufactured from constant width sheets of steel.""I think  you mean variable diameter of the tower (to me, that is what 'tapered' implies).  It seems like it would be difficult to change the plate thickness on the fly, as this is meant to be a continuous production process-- but maybe?Keystone is also developing mobile factories capable of building taller towers directly at wind sites. Production is now being ramped up of spiral-welded towers, with additional deliveries targeted for the first quarter of 2023. They’ll make more towers for the GE 2.8-127 turbine, and they can be used interchangeably with GE’s conventional 89-meter-tall tower. The spiral tower has received a component certification from TÜV NORD for a 40-year lifetime. Eric Smith, Keystone’s cofounder and CTO, said: I’m very proud of the years of hard work our team has invested in developing and scaling up tapered spiral welding.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/20,"Solar contractor SALT Energy has installed a rooftop solar system in Florida that’s now the state’s largest rooftop solar system, as well as its largest privately owned solar project. The 3.24 megawatt (MW) solar project is installed on the roof of Badia Spices’ 300,000-square-foot factory in Sweetwater, Florida, which is in Miami-Dade County. The project is currently the largest privately owned solar project in Florida. It’s comprised of 40 inverters, 7,200 solar panels, and is capable of producing more than 3.24 million watts DC of power output.  Marathon, Florida-based SALT Energy specializes in installing hurricane-proven solar arrays “in corrosive and high-wind conditions” in Florida and the Caribbean. The Miami-based company used flat roof racks made by PanelClaw and solar panels provided by San Jose, California-based SunPower on this project.David Kaul, vice president of engineering and operations for SALT Energy, said:The requirement by our customer to avoid roof membrane penetrations for anchoring the array to preserve the warranty, coupled with the hurricane wind load design requirements in Miami-Dade County, posed the two greatest technical challenges for our Badia Spices project.SALT Energy used roof anchors made by Anchor Products in Haltom City, Texas, that attach directly to a fully adhered roofing system by hot air welding instead of penetrating roofing screws.Badia Spices is a family-owned Hispanic food company that was founded in 1967. The company’s new rooftop solar installation – its second – will offset around 80% of the factory’s electricity usage. In 2019, SALT Energy installed a 529-kW rooftop solar array on Badia Spices’ 100,000-square-foot facility in Doral, Florida. All together now: Rooftop solar on big box buildings is an absolute no-brainer. Nice going, Badia family. This is awesome.The technical challenges Kaul refers to on this project are Floridian in nature. Miami-Dade is a high-velocity hurricane zone, so it rightly has some of the world’s toughest building regulations. Florida insurance requirements are getting tougher, and the factory will want to keep its solar panels secured in high winds.Read more: Florida’s EV chargers are about to double in number, with 6,000+ on the wayPhoto: Badia SpicesCorrection: We previously said that SALT Energy is based in Miami, and is a subsidiary of Washington, DC-based Salt Service.

2023/02/16,"E-commerce giant Amazon is funding the world’s first commercial-scale offshore wind seaweed farm that will sit between turbines – and this project has the potential to achieve a lot of great things.The North Sea Farm 1 project, off the Netherlands coast, will consist of a a 10-hectare (25-acre) seaweed farm that is expected to produce at least 6,000kg of fresh seaweed in its first year.It’s expected to become operational by the end of the year, and the first seaweed harvest is expected in spring 2024. The hope is that the project evolves into a blueprint for offshore seaweed farming that can be rolled out globally.Amazon’s news release doesn’t give any details about the wind farm itself – whether it already exists or whether it needs to be built, how many turbines, whether it will actually generate clean energy – but it would appear from the CGI below that Amazon posted that it’s a floating offshore wind farm:The North Sea Farmers, a collective of Dutch seaweed farmers and businesses that are working to promote the sustainable cultivation and use of seaweed in the North Sea region, is leading the project. Researchers Plymouth Marine Laboratory, seaweed extract makers Algaia, and marine contractors Van Oord are also taking part in the project, among others.Amazon is funding the project with a €1.5 million ($1.6 million) grant, which comes from its $100 million global Right Now Climate Fund.By locating the farm specifically in unused space between turbines, the project is able to expand seaweed cultivation in the otherwise heavily used North Sea. If seaweed farming were to occupy all of the space occupied by wind farms – and that’s expected to be around 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) by 2040 – it could reduce millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.And seaweed has a lot of really cool benefits; it absorbs CO2 during photosynthesis, which can help to mitigate the effects of climate change. In fact, seaweed can absorb more CO2 per unit area than land-based plants, making it an effective tool for carbon sequestration.It can provide habitats for marine life, including fish, crabs, and shellfish. By creating new habitats, seaweed farming can help shore up marine biodiversity.Plus, we can eat it: It’s a nutritious food source that doesn’t require freshwater, fertilizer, or pesticides to grow. It can also be harvested year-round, and it can be used for a wide range of products, from food and cosmetics to biofuels and fertilizers.Another reason to grow seaweed is humans have destroyed many fishing grounds around the world so it provides jobs to people who used to be able to fish.It sounds like a great project, and the timeframe is also quick which is a positive.Eef Brouwers, manager of farming and technology at North Sea Farmers, said:Potentially, up to 85,000 full-time jobs could be created in the European seaweed sector by replicating North Sea Farm 1 across the North Sea, repurposing the space among wind farms. These jobs would not only be in the farming process but also in the production and sales of seaweed-based products.Read more: A Danish wind turbine giant just discovered how to recycle all bladesPhotos: AmazonUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/16,"All new cars sold in New Jersey will have to be zero emissions from 2035, Governor Phil Murphy (D-NJ) announced yesterday.As Electrek previously reported, New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection called for a gas car sales ban by 2035 in October 2020. Murphy’s new executive orders are the next step. The new EV regulations will be complete by the end of 2023.New Jersey joins New York, California, and the European Union in ending new gas vehicle sales by 2035.Also, the state will put $70 million in new grant funding toward medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicle adoption.Murphy said:These are the next big steps forward.By the year 2035, the new cars sold in New Jersey will all, and I emphasize all, be zero-emission vehicles.Murphy also announced in his policy speech at Rutgers University that New Jersey’s goal of sourcing 100% electricity from clean energy is being bumped up to 2035.He addressed the expected pushback of his announcement head-on:We are ready to take the next six big steps in our fight against climate change.Now, let me make one thing perfectly clear at the outset before the right-wing meme-makers go off: No one is coming for anyone’s gas stove. No one is walking into anyone’s kitchen. No one is going to be forced to do anything, in any way.Further, the state will also include installing zero-carbon-emission space heating and cooling systems in 400,000 homes and 20,000 commercial properties, and make 10% of all low- to moderate-income properties electrification-ready by 2030, and proposed flood protection rules.In 2021, natural gas and nuclear power accounted for 90% of New Jersey’s total electricity net generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration. New Jersey is making a big push for wind and solar to get off natural gas. It’s approved 3,700 megawatts of offshore wind power generating capacity and is set to solicit another 1,200 megawatts in early 2023 to reach the state’s goal of obtaining 7,500 megawatts of wind power capacity by 2035 and 11,000 megawatts by 2040.New Jersey was the US’s ninth-largest producer of electricity from solar in 2021 and ranked third in small-scale solar.Photo: “EV Charging Only” by ken fields is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/15,"Ørsted’s huge Hornsea Four offshore wind project and a BP-led carbon capture project are at loggerheads because the two projects’ footprints are overlapping in the North Sea.The Endurance carbon capture and storage project and Hornsea Four, both off the east coast of England, are clashing due to boats used to monitor carbon leaks being at risk of colliding with wind turbines.The two projects share an area of around 110 square kilometers (42 square miles), and that’s known as … the Overlap Zone.As a result of this standoff, the Secretary of State has extended the deadline for the planning decision until mid-July. (Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2 are in operation, and Hornsea 3 is now approved for development.)On one side, there’s the 2.6 gigawatt Hornsea Four, which would feature up to 180 wind turbines spread over up to 492 square kilometers (190 square miles).On the other side, there’s the Endurance Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project, which aims to capture and store CO2 emissions from industrial processes in the UK’s Humber and Teesside regions. The CO2 would be captured from four different sites, including a refinery, a hydrogen production facility, and two power plants.In 2013, both projects agreed to enter into an Interface Agreement so that they could coordinate and collaborate. But that hasn’t really worked. Offshorewind.biz explains what the beef is:Ørsted said it proposed protective provisions for the benefit of the [Northern Endurance Partnership] project in its draft [development consent order] for Hornsea Four, which envisages co-existence in the Overlap Zone, while bp proposed protective provisions also for the benefit of its project, which would prevent the development of Hornsea Four infrastructure in the part of the Overlap Zone in which the carbon storage project would be located, referred to as the Exclusion Area.Ørsted and bp have not managed to find common ground on the matter so far.According to Reuters, “A spokesperson for Orsted said the group was ‘obviously disappointed,’ and would give the British authorities all information requested in the hope of a positive decision without further delays.”Other companies invested in Endurance besides BP include Equinor, National Grid Ventures, and ENI. BP and its partners say they will make a final investment decision on Endurance in mid-2023.The British government views both offshore wind farms and carbon capture projects as vital weapons against fighting climate change, so chances are that it, and both companies, will figure out some sort of compromise. Team Offshore Wind and Team Carbon Capture say “they are committed to finding a solution to allow both projects to go ahead,” according to Reuters. There’s simply too much at stake here for deadlock between these gigantic projects.Read more: The world’s largest offshore wind farm is now fully operationalPhoto: ØrstedCorrection: We previously wrote: “As a result of this standoff, the UK’s Planning Inspectorate is delaying Hornsea Four’s permitting decision until mid-July.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2023/02/15,"The European Union has put its stamp of approval on a reworked law yesterday banning all new sales of ICE vehicles from 2035. Meanwhile, the European Commission has also proposed new targets to cut CO2 emissions from city buses and trucks from 2030 and onward. Here’s the latest.The landmark bill regarding ICE vehicles, which was approved last year but still needs to go through one more round of approvals in March, officially bans the sale of all new petrol and diesel vehicles in the entire 27-country bloc. This latest revision signed yesterday, according to Reuters, sees a 55% cut in CO2 emissions for new cars sold from 2030 versus 2021 compared to the previous target of 37.5%.Of course, there are a couple of caveats: For one, the law only addresses new cars, not the second-hand market, meaning that a brand-new ICE vehicle bought in 2034 will still be legal to drive in 2035 and onward. Given the life cycle of most cars is about 10 to 15 years or so, that’s not good news when it comes to meeting climate goals. The final deal also includes a workaround for smaller carmakers producing less than 10,000 vehicles a year to meet weaker targets until 2036.While there has been pushback from the auto industry over the past year, most European car manufacturers are already on board with plans to heavily invest in electrification, including Volkswagen’s commitment to only produce electric cars in Europe from 2033. Others, such as Bentley, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and Jaguar, have already begun shifting their global production strategies toward an all-electric future.The European Commission has also turned its eye toward cutting greenhouse emissions from the transport section, with an aim to phase in stronger CO2 emissions standards for all new heavy-duty vehicles, including city buses and long-haul trucks, and gradually shift to zero emissions in the coming years. The plan, announced yesterday, suggests a 45% emissions reduction from 2030, then 65% emission reduction from 2035, to 90% from 2040. Yet, the plan is a tad more aggressive for city buses, requiring zero-emissions standards by 2030.To all the people complaining that this is too slow, too late, too little, .... it is for the WHOLE of EU. EU is not just Germany, Netherlands with some France and Sweden on the side. EU is also Lithuania and Romania and Greece and Croatia and Portugal and Finland. ALL the EU countries now need to figure out how exactly will they have not only high speed charging on ALL highways in the country, but also how they will deploy, literally, millions of local chargers (like Level 2 11kW AC) so that normal people driving around towns all over the EU can actually charge conveniently in their everyday life and not clog high speed chargers when they do not need to do so.Rich, central Europe will be there much sooner than 2035. Some places, like Netherlands, some parts of Germany, Denmark, Sweden are already nearly there. The rest are just barely starting and will need a LOT of EU support to get there in time as there for sure is not enough local financial power to deploy hundreds of fast chargers required to cover Greese for example. There is a total of 19 DC chargers in the entirety of Greece right now and none of them are over 100kW. And less than 300 AC chargers. For a country of 10 million people, 2 500 km of motorways and over 100 000 km of highways and about 100 000 new cars sold in the country annually.As is, heavy-duty vehicles account for more than 6% of total EU greenhouse gases and more than 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions from road transport. It’s early days for the proposal, with legislators already debating the potential loss of employment for hundreds of thousands of people in the ICE industry and the rising electricity costs, with centrist and conservative leaders asking for a rethink of the truck ban.The time it takes for European legislation to take form is tediously slow, to say the least, requiring endless debate and revisions – and the clock is ticking – but the fact a law of this scale continues through the labyrinth of required approvals is good news. European consumers are ready, and already claim 25% of global EV sales. Still, the shift won’t be easy, especially in a fragile economy with millions, maybe billions, of euros still needed to build out electric grid infrastructure in a sustainable way to ensure EVs run on clean power. A McKinsey study estimates this bill at upward of €240 billion by 2030. In terms of public chargers, the EU offers about five public chargers for every 100km, and the European Federation for Transport and Environment suggests that deploying 2.7 million public charging points throughout the continent by 2030 would require around €1.8 billion. Considering that is about 3% of the EU’s yearly budget for roads and infrastructure in Europe, it seems like a decent start. ",solar
2023/02/14,"California-based solar EV charging tech company Enteligent is debuting what it claims is the world’s first DC-to-DC rooftop solar-powered hybrid bidirectional EV charger.Enteligent is launching its new product this week at Intersolar North America 2023 in Long Beach, California. The solar EV charger, which draws power from rooftop solar, can supply 25 kW of fast DC charging – three times faster than AC Level 2 EV chargers – while also supporting vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities.EV owners currently plug their cars into home chargers that are powered by an alternating current (AC) flow of energy generated from the electric grid. But EV batteries operate on a direct current (DC), requiring the power to be converted from AC to DC in the charging process. AC to DC conversion is inefficient and results in lost energy and longer charging time.Enteligent says its charger’s DC to DC conversion results in 13% energy savings, and direct charging DC bypasses the EV’s internal conversion electronics, shortening charge time.Here’s how Enteligent’s solar-powered EV charger works:On February 1, Enteligent announced that it has raised $7 million in capital from strategic and institutional investors to fast-track commercialization of its solar EV charger.I emailed the company to find more details about the product. It sounds intriguing for people who already have solar on their roof. I'm interested to find out if their system works as a grid-tie inverter as well. If so, then this could replace my current inverters and continue to provide power to my house when not charging the car, but when I plug in, it could direct the DC power directly to the car. I currently schedule my car to only charge between 9am and 3pm when the solar panels are generating enough power to not pull from the grid, so getting a 13% increase in efficiency while doing what I already do will be awesome if it's actually brought to the market.What do you think of Enteligent’s new charging product?

2023/02/14,"The first US pilot that will site solar panels over irrigation canals is going to deploy long-duration iron flow battery storage.Project Nexus is a $20 million pilot in California’s Turlock Irrigation District that launched in October of last year. The project team is exploring solar over canal design, deployment, and co-benefits using canal infrastructure and the electrical grid.India already has solar panels over canals, but Project Nexus is the first of its kind in the US.The Turlock Irrigation District was the first irrigation district formed in California in 1887. It provides irrigation water to 4,700 growers who farm around 150,000 acres in the San Joaquin Valley.About 8,500 feet of solar panels will be built over three sections of Turlock Irrigation District’s canals. The three sections feature areas of various orientations and canal widths that range from 20 to 100 feet wide.Project Nexus will explore whether the solar panels reduce water evaporation as a result of midday shade and wind mitigation; create improvements to water quality through reduced vegetative growth; reduce canal maintenance as a result of reduced vegetative growth; and of course, generate renewable electricity.The California Department of Water Resources, utility company Turlock Irrigation District, Marin County, California-based water and energy project developer Solar AquaGrid, and The University of California, Merced, are partnering on the pilot.Long-term iron flow battery storage is now going to be added to Project Nexus; Wilsonville, Oregon-based long-duration iron flow battery maker ESS is going to supply two 75kW turnkey “Energy Warehouse” batteries.ESS says that its technology was selected for its “inherently safe and non-toxic characteristics, making it preferable for siting adjacent to water infrastructure.” Its iron flow technology can provide up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity. Iron flow chemistry doesn’t use critical minerals such as lithium or cobalt – it uses iron, salt, and water.Hugh McDermott, ESS senior vice president, said:Long-duration energy storage is the key that will enable Project Nexus to not only conserve water and generate renewable energy, but provide on-demand, clean power 24/7.This project addresses multiple climate challenges at once and is the kind of innovative approach that will build a climate-resilient future.If all 4,000 miles of California’s canals were covered with solar panels, that could produce 13 gigawatts of renewable power. A gigawatt is enough to power 750,000 homes, so that would be enough power for 9.75 million households. For perspective, as of July 2021, there were 13.1 million households in California. I have a small holding in ESS. The stock has been mauled, but I truly believe in this tech. Sure, we need high energy density batteries as well, but this tech, with a replaceable electrolyte that's non-toxic sounds like a great idea for places where space isn't an issue, like the back (or roof) of any big box store. The question is on price. If it can be cheap, then it's the default option in such cases. Project Nexus is expected to be completed in 2024.

2023/02/13,"Calhoun County Public Schools in West Virginia is going to install rooftop solar at two public schools – a state first.Calhoun County schools will also be the first in West Virginia to install solar power onsite at no upfront cost through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). A PPA is a contract between a solar developer and a customer – in this case, Calhoun County Public Schools and Secure Solar Futures – to purchase the electricity generated by its solar array. This rate is typically lower than what the customer pays to their utility for electricity. West Virginia passed a law to enable solar power purchase agreements in April 2021.Calhoun, with a population of under 7,000, serves as the trade and industry center for oil and gas operations along the Little Kanawha River. Kelli Whytsell, superintendent of Calhoun County Schools, said in a statement:Calhoun County Schools is excited to be the first public school system in the state of West Virginia to install solar panels on their school roofs.We will be partnering with Secure Solar [Futures] to be able to produce electricity that our schools will be using in the near future. We hope that being the first public school system to install the solar panels on our roofs will encourage other school systems to follow suit.Calhoun County Schools selected Secure Solar Futures as their solar provider in a competitive public procurement process through a Request for Proposals issued in the fall of 2022.A solar array of 596.6 kilowatts (kW) will be installed on the roof at Calhoun Middle/High School in Mt. Zion, and a second array of 172 kW will be put on the roof at Pleasant Hill Elementary School in Grantsville. The combined capacity of 768.6 kW is projected to save the school district nearly $740,000 in energy costs over the next 25 years.Combined, the systems will use 1,671 Tier 1 460-Watt monocrystalline solar modules manufactured by solar PV module maker Heliene in Minnesota. Installation will begin this spring and is expected to finish by the end of 2023.This may not seem like a big deal, but it’s actually really significant for West Virginia. Here’s why.The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that as of third quarter 2022, there were just 24 MW of solar installed in the state of West Virginia. Its state ranking for solar installed is 48th – and it actually fell from 45th in 2021.The percentage of West Virginia’s electricity from solar? Zero. Zilch. Nada.It’s growth projection is 671 MW over the next five years, bringing it to 42nd. So while enough solar to power the equivalent of 78 homes seems like a drop in the bucket compared to solar powerhouses like Texas and California, it’s a small step forward for the second-largest producer of coal in the US. And even better, Secure Solar is also providing a state-compliant K-12 learning curriculum that includes teacher training, lesson plans, and hands-on kits for science experiments on energy.

2023/02/13,"Wind turbine giant Siemens Gamesa announced today that it’s going to build a large offshore wind nacelle factory in New York State – giving the fledgling yet mushrooming US offshore wind industry yet another boost.A nacelle is the housing on top of a wind turbine’s tower that contains the rotor and generator. It contains all the major components, including the gearbox, control electronics, and braking system. Ørsted and Eversource are going to use Siemens Gamesa wind turbines when they build the 130 megawatt (MW) South Fork, New York’s first offshore wind farm, and also the 924 MW Sunrise Wind, which is also in New York. The factory will be sited at the Port of Coeymans, a fairly new marine terminal on the Hudson River, about 10 miles south of Albany. It will result in a $500 million investment in the region and will create around 420 direct jobs and a large number of indirect jobs. The factory is subject to the company’s wind turbines being selected in New York State’s third offshore wind auction. (The 3D visualization of the facility is pictured above.) It would supply components for all Siemens Gamesa offshore wind power projects along the US East Coast.Siemens Gamesa, a Spanish-German company, is also going to localize several new component supplier facilities, including steel component fabrication, bearings, and composite components, and that’s going to help develop a local supply chain.This is the company’s second announced US factory – the first is an offshore wind turbine blade finishing facility in Portsmouth, Virginia.As of 2021, GE Wind was the largest wind turbine manufacturer overall in the US in terms of installation capacity, with Vestas coming in second. But the US offshore wind industry is still in its early stages of development.New York State expects to procure at least 2 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy and up to 4.7 GW in this third round of procurement to achieve a total of 9 GW of offshore wind. That’s a sizable chunk of the US’s target of achieving 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030.Read more: Siemens Gamesa claims world’s first recyclable offshore wind turbine bladePhoto: Siemens GamesaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/10,"Wind turbines usually consist of one turbine with a set of blades, but Norway’s Wind Catching Systems thinks its floating multi-turbine offshore wind technology will make clean energy more efficiently.The 320-meter-tall (1,050-foot-high) unit – that’s just 33 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower – is made up of a matrix of beams that supports around 115 turbines. Each turbine has a diameter of around 30 meters (98 feet). The pilot project will be installed at Norway’s Mehuken wind park, on the west coast, this year.Wind Catching Systems asserts that its floating technology can generate five times the annual energy of the world’s largest single turbines because it has double the swept area of a conventional 15 megawatt wind turbine. The company also says that its huge floating wind turbine unit could be used to power as many as 80,000 homes.ENOVA, a government-owned company that works to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in Norway, thinks Wind Catching Systems is onto something, as it just this week awarded the company a pre-project grant of NOK 9.3 million (US $0.9 million). This is the second grant that ENOVA has awarded Wind Catching Systems – the first was in October 2022 for NOK 22 million (US $2.1 million).Wind Catching Systems was founded in 2017 and is headquartered at Lysaker, outside Oslo. The company’s largest owners are GM Ventures (the venture capital arm of General Motors), Ferd (Norway’s largest private investment company), and North Energy ASA, a publicly traded energy investment company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.This is certainly a creative and intriguing clean energy project. The idea is that the smaller turbines will be more efficient and maximize power generation from a concentrated area and, due to their smaller size, could also handle higher winds. But will the small turbines have to rotate a lot faster to capture the same amount of power as larger, individual turbines? And might the giant matrix add a lot of extra drag? While my gut reaction was skepticism, being able to easily accommodate the wind shear and increasing RPM with constant tip speeds gives you a lot of opportunity.  I can't imagine the bottom half of the array is doing much in terms of relative production, but maybe it gives them an option to optimize the blades and rotor diameter with height.  Much more information is really needed to make a critical analysis.We’ll keep an eye on how this pilot performs when it’s up and running. Let us know what you think in the comments below.Read more: A Danish wind turbine giant just discovered how to recycle all bladesPhoto: Wind Catching SystemsUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/09,"Ground-mount solar installer Sunstall has launched Sunzaun, a company that makes vertical solar systems for farms and agricultural settings.Sunzaun has designed its vertical solar systems for the growing field (no pun intended) of agrivoltaics – when agriculture and solar coexist on the same land. Crops are grown, or smaller animals such as sheep graze, around or underneath solar panels. Benefits include efficient land use, clean energy, and potential water savings due to shade created by the solar panels.The Novato, California, company says its vertical solar systems can also be used as city infrastructure – that is, along highways, next to railroads, and as residential or public fences. Sunzaun says on its website that its system is designed to accommodate framed and unframed bifacial vertical solar panels, and that wires are managed in a safe way. The systems are usable in slopes up to 15 degrees and can provide up to 0.084 psi wind load. The company says its UL 2703 certification – the safety standard for PV modules and panels – is in progress. Check out Sunzaun’s system on the Somerset Gourmet Farm, a winery in Somerset, California. It features 43 vertical bifacial modules with a total power of 23 kW that are connected to a microinverter and two batteries:Sunzaun writes about Somerset’s vertical solar system:The Sunzaun follows the hilly area of the vineyard over 200 feet and supplies the farm with electricity mainly in the morning and in the afternoon. Besides the provided shading this vertical installation enables the farmer to move his harvesters next to the Sunzaun. In this way, wine growing and the production of renewable energy increase the efficiency of land use.Researchers at Leipzig University of Applied Sciences claim in a paper published in August 2022 in the journal Smart Energy that mounting bifacial solar panels with one side facing east and the other facing west would produce renewable electricity in the range of inclined south systems.Read more: Here’s why 1,000 sheep on a Colorado solar farm will be a win-winPhotos: SunzaunUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/09,"Big global companies have secured a record 36.7 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy to power their operations in 2022, up 18% from 2021 – and big tech bought the most, according to a new report.BloombergNEF’s (BNEF) “1H 2023 Corporate Energy Market Outlook” assessed 167 big corporations that announced power purchase agreements (PPAs) in 36 markets worldwide. A PPA is a contract between an electricity generator and a power purchaser, such as a utility company and in this case, large commercial energy user.In total, corporations have signed PPAs for 148 GW of clean power since 2008 – more than the total power-generating capacity of France.In the US, companies have adopted the virtual PPA model, in which a clean power project sells directly into the wholesale market to capture the spot price, rather than literally delivering its electrons directly to the customer. Such contracts are comparatively easy for buyers to sign and allow them to hedge against power price spikes.Big tech firms were the top corporate clean energy buyers in 2022. Amazon led with 10.9 GW of PPAs signed in 2022, followed by Meta (2.6 GW), Google (1.6 GW), and Microsoft (1.3 GW). Amazon has announced 24.8 GW of PPAs to date, giving it the seventh-largest clean energy portfolio in the world – and that takes utilities into account. And tech companies will need to keep on buying clean energy to supply their rapidly growing electricity demand.In 2022, 56 new companies joined the RE100 – which are companies that have committed to sourcing 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. In all, the 397 RE100 companies have purchased an estimated 249 terawatt hours (TWh) of clean electricity to date, but they’ll need an additional 290 TWh in 2030 to meet their goals, according to BNEF projections. Companies like Google and Microsoft have pledged to meet their demand for power at all hours of the day with carbon-free energy, so demand will be even higher.Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF, said:Corporate clean energy buying has been an unwavering constant even as other aspects of [environmental, social, and governance] investing have come under scrutiny.Companies can access clean energy at scale in most major countries, the economics make sense, and amid turbulent energy markets, PPAs have become useful risk-mitigation tools for CFOs.Read more: Renewables supplied nearly 75% of new US electrical generating capacity in 2022UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/08,"Renewable energy provided 74.1% of new utility-scale generating capacity in the US last year, according to new data released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that was reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign.New utility-scale solar capacity – that is, not including rooftop solar – was 9,924 megawatts (MW), or 39.6% of the total. New wind capacity provided 8,512 MW, or 33.9% of the total. Solar and wind each comfortably surpassed the 6,469 MW of new natural gas capacity (25.8%).Including geothermal (90 MW), biomass (31 MW), and hydropower (24 MW), capacity additions by the mix of renewable energy sources accounted for 18,581 MW of the 25,085 MW in new generating capacity by all sources. Oil added 18 MW and nuclear increased by 17 MW; FERC reported no new coal additions.So by the end of 2022, renewable energy sources collectively provided 27.3% of the total available installed generating capacity in the US, with wind’s share – 143,280 MW – being 11.4% and that of solar – 80,400 MW – expanding to 6.4%.For perspective, renewables’ share of US generating capacity was 24.1% in December 2020 and just 17.8% in December 2015.The recent growth in new solar and wind generating capacity significantly surpasses what FERC had forecast three years earlier. FERC then reported that “high-probability” additions of new solar between January 2020 and December 2022 would total 19,973 MW. Instead, new solar capacity grew by 38,530 MW, virtually doubling FERC’s forecast. FERC had anticipated 26,403 MW of net “high-probability” new wind capacity to be added during that three-year period. Instead, wind grew by 41,350 MW, or 56.6% more than forecast.FERC is now projecting that over the next three years – that is, through December 2025 – net “high-probability” solar capacity additions could total 75,642 MW, potentially nearly doubling solar’s current capacity. Moreover, “all additions” in the three-year solar pipeline could actually total 214,006 MW. FERC also expects net “high-probability” wind additions to total 18,211 MW, representing a 12.7% increase, with the possibility of all net additions reaching 76,012 MW. If FERC’s three-year forecast proves accurate, by the end of 2025, renewable energy sources would account for 33% of total available installed generating capacity in the US. Of that, wind and solar would account for nearly equal shares: 12.2% wind, and 11.8% solar.SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said:Renewable sources, led by solar and wind, are now adding almost two percentage points each year to their share of the nation’s electrical generating capacity.If that pace continues or accelerates – as seems likely – renewables will be providing a third of total installed generating capacity within three years and quite possibly more.Photo: ErthosRead more: Minnesota just passed a 100% clean energy bill – here’s what’s in itUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/08,"Wind turbine maker Vestas today announced that it’s figured out how to recycle all wind turbine blades – even ones already sitting in landfills.The Danish company says it has discovered a solution that “renders epoxy-based turbine blades as circular, without the need for changing the design or composition of blade material.”Vestas, Aarhus University, Danish Technological Institute, and epoxy maker Olin have developed a novel process that can chemically break down epoxy resin into virgin-grade materials. The four industry and academic partners formed a coalition called the CETEC project – Circular Economy for Thermosets Epoxy Composites – in May 2021.Lisa Ekstrand, vice president and head of sustainability at Vestas, said:Until now, the wind industry has believed that turbine blade material calls for a new approach to design and manufacture to be either recyclable, or beyond this, circular, at end of life. Going forward, we can now view old epoxy-based blades as a source of raw material. Once this new technology is implemented at scale, legacy blade material currently sitting in landfill, as well as blade material in active wind farms, can be disassembled and reused. This signals a new era for the wind industry, and accelerates our journey towards achieving circularity.Vestas says it will now scale up the chemical disassembly process into a commercial solution through a newly established value chain, supported by Nordic recycling firm Stena Recycling and Olin. Once mature, Vestas says, “the solution will signal the beginning of a circular economy for all existing, and future epoxy-based turbine blades.”Up to now, turbine blades have been challenging to recycle due to the chemical properties of epoxy resin, a resilient substance that was believed to be impossible to break down into reusable components. Well, this is a huge announcement. If Vestas indeed just figured out how to recycle ALL wind turbine blades EVERYWHERE, then this solves one of – if not the biggest – the wind industry’s major headaches.WindEurope expects around 25,000 tonnes of blades to reach the end of their operational life annually by 2025, rising to 52,000 tonnes by 2030.

2023/02/08,"Renewables will dominate the growth of global electricity supply and meet the vast majority of the increase in demand to 2025, according to a new report out today from the International Energy Agency (IEA).Renewables’ share of the global power generation mix is forecast to rise from 29% in 2022 to 35% in 2025, with the shares of coal- and gas-fired generation falling, according to the IEA’s “Electricity Market Report 2023.” So that means that the CO2 intensity of global power generation will continue to fall in the coming years. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said:The world’s growing demand for electricity is set to accelerate, adding more than double Japan’s current electricity consumption over the next three years.The good news is that renewables and nuclear power are growing quickly enough to meet almost all this additional appetite, suggesting we are close to a tipping point for power sector emissions. Governments now need to enable low-emissions sources to grow even faster and drive down emissions so that the world can ensure secure electricity supplies while reaching climate goals.Here are five standout points from the report’s executive summary:Renewables and nuclear will dominate the growth of the global electricity supply over the next three years, together meeting on average more than 90% of additional demand. China accounts for more than 45% of the growth in renewables from 2023 to 2025, followed by the EU with 15%.Global electricity generation from both natural gas and coal is expected to remain broadly flat between 2022 and 2025. Gas use will drop in the EU but is expected to rise in the Middle East. A drop in coal use in the EU and the Americas will be matched by a rise in Asia Pacific. Developments in China, where more than half of the world’s coal-fired generation occurs, will remain a key factor.After reaching an all-time high in 2022, power generation emissions are set to plateau through 2025. Global electricity generation emissions increased 1.3% in 2022, a rate similar to the 2016-2019 average. That’s a significant slowdown from the 6% rise in 2021, which was driven by the rapid economic recovery from the pandemic. After 2021, 2022 marks the highest percentage growth in emissions of EU power generation since the oil crises of the 1970s, recording a 4.5% year-on-year growth. However, the EU’s setback will be temporary, as power generation emissions are expected to decrease on average by about 10% annually through 2025. Coal is expected to fall by 10% and gas by almost 12% annually on average over the outlook period as renewables ramp up and nuclear generation recovers.Electricity demand in India and the US rose, while the zero-Covid policy affected China’s growth. The US recorded a significant 2.6% year-over-year demand increase in 2022 that was driven by economic activity and higher residential use to meet both heating and cooling needs amid hotter summer weather and a colder-than-normal winter. Electricity demand in India rose by a 8.4% in 2022, due to post-pandemic economic recovery and exceptionally high summer temperatures.Photo: Siemens GamesaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/02/07,"Minnesota governor Tim Walz (D-MN) today signed a 100% clean energy bill into law after the State Senate passed it on February 2.SF 4 requires all of Minnesota’s utilities to produce 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The road map to carbon-free electricity before 2040 is as follows: 80% for public utilities and 60% for other utilities by 2030; 90% for all utilities by 2035.The bill implements safeguards to ensure marginalized communities benefit from – and are not harmed – by a 100% clean energy transition, and it prioritizes equitable development of clean energy and the growth of local union jobs. The bill defines renewable energy as solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, and hydrogen. Nuclear power is defined as carbon-free. Minnesota has two nuclear power plants that it will continue to operate for at least the next couple of decades. Building new nuclear plants is currently banned in Minnesota.MPR reports that the largest utilities in Minnesota are “cautiously supportive”:They already have goals of being carbon-free by 2050, so this would move up that date by a decade.“We’re actually excited about being pushed to go faster,” Chris Clark, Xcel’s president in Minnesota, North and South Dakota, said in an interview. “We also recognize, though, that it’s a challenge.”A big reason why major utilities aren’t opposing the bill is because it includes exemptions and ways they can meet the standard without ditching fossil fuels altogether. This bill allows utilities to be able to buy renewable energy credits to offset electricity generated by fossil fuels.Patty O’Keefe, organizing representative for Sierra Club, said last week:Minnesotans need and deserve clean and affordable energy. Wind and solar provide the cheapest price per kilowatt hour in Minnesota, and will continue to get cheaper. This bill will lower energy prices and hold energy companies accountable to provide their customers with reliable clean energy and good paying, family-supporting jobs.And Gary Moody, Audubon’s director of state and local climate strategy, said today:Minnesota’s commitment to reaching carbon-free electricity is good news for the state’s climate-threatened species – and for Minnesotans who now have access to a more sustainable future.We will continue to advocate for responsible clean energy policy like this in the Midwest and throughout the country.Photo: “Presenting Curt Tosh’s farm-based solar project – Solar Works in Central Minnesota!” by CERTs is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

The system is called SEPV Sierra, and it uses B2U’s patented EV Pack Storage (EPS) technology. It’s made up of 1,300 reused EV battery packs that were sourced from Nissan and Honda. None of the EV batteries used need to be modified, and that virtually eliminates repurposing costs.B2U says it’s also successfully tested Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3 battery packs with its EPS system, and that it can be configured to operate any EV battery.The EPS system continuously monitors and controls each battery to ensure operating specifications are maintained. EPS cabinet controllers and ancillary equipment sense and manage the internal cabinet environment surrounding each battery pack. To mitigate any potential hazards, battery packs are automatically disconnected if any component deviates from its operating specifications and design limits. SEPV Sierra’s 25 MWh of operational storage capacity is the largest operational UL 9540-certified energy storage system utilizing second-life EV batteries anywhere. (UL 9540 is a safety standard, if you’re wondering.) This seems like, by far, the best use of old EV batteries.  To recycle EV batteries while simultaneously building new batteries for grid storage is a pointless waste of energy and resources.Hope to see more like this.SEPV Sierra started commercial operations in 2020, and B2U has been scaling its capacity in phases. SEPV Sierra is interconnected directly to the grid, selling power and grid services into California’s wholesale power market. It generated over $1 million in revenue in 2022 alone.

It’s sited southeast of the Liuao Peninsula in China’s Fujian Province.The 400 MW Zhangpu Liuao Phase 2 offshore wind farm will be able to produce about 1.6 TWh of electricity per year. According to CTG, this can save about 500,000 tons of standard coal and reduce emissions by about 1.36 million tons per year.This will be the first wind farm to deploy the 16 MW wind turbine that CTG developed with Goldwind Technology. It has a rotor diameter of 252 meters (827 feet). It also has a swept area of around 50,000 square meters (538,195 square feet) – that’s the equivalent of seven standard football pitches. The turbine’s hub is 146 meters (479 feet) high – as tall as a 50-story building.One 16 MW wind turbine is capable of generating 34.2 kWh of electricity per revolution, and it can produce more than 66 GWh of clean electricity per year, according to CTG.Western manufacturers GE, Siemens Gamesa, and Vestas are all currently developing 15 MW turbines.At the beginning of January, China’s CSSC Haizhuang unveiled the rotor hub and nacelle for an 18 MW offshore wind turbine prototype.

2023/01/31,"Wind and solar generated a record one-fifth (22%) of electricity in the European Union in 2022 – overtaking fossil gas (20%) for the first time, according to a new study published today.Energy think tank Ember’s analysis, “European Electricity Review,” also reveals that coal power share increased by just 1.5 percentage points to generate 16% of EU electricity in 2022, with year-on-year falls in the last four months of 2022 as Europe prevented a threatened return to coal power in the wake of the 2022 energy crisis. Dave Jones, head of data insights at Ember, said:Europe has avoided the worst of the energy crisis. The shocks of 2022 only caused a minor ripple in coal power and a huge wave of support for renewables. Any fears of a coal rebound are now dead.Europe faced a triple crisis in the electricity sector in 2022, according to Ember. As Europe scrambled to cut ties with Russia, its largest fossil gas supplier, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it faced the lowest levels of hydro and nuclear in at least 20 years, and that created a deficit equal to 7% of Europe’s total electricity demand in 2022. But record wind and solar growth helped cushion the hydro and nuclear deficit. Solar rose the fastest, growing by a record 39 TWh (24%) in 2022 – almost twice its previous record – which helped to avoid €10 billion in gas costs. Twenty EU countries set new solar records in 2022.Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, said:Solar is stepping up right when Europe needs it most. These new numbers show that rapid solar growth is truly the foundation of the energy transition. In 2023, with the right support, solar will break more records, reduce fossil energy demand further, and take us one year closer to a 100% renewable Europe.Lower electricity demand also helped reduce the deficit. EU electricity demand dropped by 7.9% in the last quarter of 2022 compared to the same period the previous year (-56 TWh). Mild weather played a large part, along with affordability pressures, energy efficiency improvements, and EU citizens actively cutting energy in response to the crisis in Ukraine.Just one-sixth of the nuclear and hydro deficit was met by coal. Coal generation rose by 7% (+28 TWh). As a result, EU power sector emissions rose by 3.9% (+26 MtCO2) in 2022 compared to 2021. But wind, solar, and a fall in electricity demand prevented a much larger return to coal. So contextually, coal’s rise was not substantial: It remained below 2018 levels and added only 0.3% to global coal generation.Coal power in the EU fell in all four of the final months of 2022, down 6% year-on-year. The 26 coal units placed on emergency standby for winter ran at an average of just 18% capacity. Despite importing 22 million tonnes of extra coal throughout 2022, the EU only used one-third of it.Surprisingly, fossil gas generation was almost unchanged (+0.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, despite record-high prices. Gas generated 20% of EU electricity in 2022, up from 19% the previous year. However, this is expected to change drastically in 2023. In 2023, Europe’s wind and solar transition is expected to speed up in response to the energy crisis, and hydro and French nuclear is going to recover. So fossil fuel generation could drop by 20% in 2023, double the previous record from 2020, according to Ember. Coal generation will fall, but fossil gas generation, which is expected to remain more expensive than coal until at least 2025, will fall the fastest.Ember’s Jones said:Europe’s clean power transition emerges from this crisis stronger than ever.Not only are European countries still committed to phasing out coal, they are now striving to phase out gas as well. The energy crisis has undoubtedly sped up Europe’s electricity transition. Europe is hurtling towards a clean, electrified economy, and this will be on full display in 2023.Change is coming fast, and everyone needs to be ready for it.Read more: Solar will become 10 times cheaper than gas in Europe – studyPhoto: OrstedUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/30,"WindFloat Atlantic – the world’s first semi-submersible floating offshore wind farm – has been online for two years, and it’s far exceeding power output expectations.The 25 megawatt (MW) WindFloat Atlantic project ended 2022 with an electricity production of 78 gigawatt hours (GWh) – 5% more output than its first year. It supplies power to more than 25,000 households and avoids 33,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Its annual availability was between 93-94%.The offshore wind farm sits 20 km off the coast of Portugal in the municipality of Viana do Castelo, north of Porto. It’s made up of three 8.4 MW Vestas wind turbines that sit on semi-submersible, three-column floating platforms anchored by chains to the seabed. A 20 km long (12.4 mile long) cable connects it to an onshore substation.WindFloat Atlantic was connected to the grid at the end of 2019 and commissioned in 2020, and it’s now finished its full second year in operation. It has an operations and maintenance base in the port of Viana do Castelo, where the team receives the wind farm’s information in real time so can address any issues that arise in real time. Onsite intervention can be complex, due to adverse weather and sea conditions in the area where it’s sited.It’s a joint venture between Spanish renewable company EDPR, global energy firm ENGIE, Spanish energy firm Repsol, and California-headquartered floating offshore wind firm Principle Power. Principle Power, which also worked on Scotland’s Kincardine, the world’s largest floating offshore wind farm, says on its website that the “WindFloat” technology is compatible with any standard offshore wind turbine and can be deployed in waters deeper than 40 m (131 feet).So, what makes semi-submersible floating offshore wind unique? Here’s what Principle Power says:The WindFloat has been developed specifically to achieve exceptional stability performance, while reducing structural weight, and simplifying logistics during installation and operation.The virtual pitch- and yaw-free performance in the offshore environment allows the use of existing commercial offshore wind turbines, located at one of the columns, with only minor modifications to control software. Photo: Principle PowerUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/27,"Swedish wind turbine maker SeaTwirl got the go-ahead to test its 1 megawatt (MW) S2X vertical-axis floating offshore prototype in Norway. In March 2022, Norway’s Ministry of Energy gave approval to SeaTwirl and Norwegian offshore wind test center Marine Energy Test Centre to pilot the vertical-axis floating wind prototype for five years at a former fish farm in Boknafjorden, northeast of Lauplandsholmenoff, 700 meters (2,297 feet) from the coast.But four groups – the Norwegian Environmental Protection Association, the Norwegian Fishermen’s Association, and two campaign groups – appealed against SeaTwirl’s permit, and so the project was put on ice.Yesterday, the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate rejected the appeal, so SeaTwirl’s S2X pilot can now proceed, and no further appeals will be considered.CEO Peter Laurits said:Our main focus is the commercialization of large turbines, SX, in floating wind farms. The outcome provides freedom to choose and plan the installation of S2x in the way that best supports that goal.SeaTwirl says that “multiple S2xs can be placed in a dense pattern for increased output.” The company’s reasoning for building vertical (instead of horizontal) axis floating turbines is this: The simplicity of the design and low center of gravity are the big advantages. All moving parts and electrical systems are easily accessible [and] close to the water’s surface, lowering maintenance costs.I hope they succeed, both wind and vertical turbine need a little boost... Being on open water it will now differently really test out if vertical can succeed once and for all... And yeah, it does look a little too close to surface, but who knows... The S2X prototype is 55 meters (180 feet) above sea level, and it’s around 80 meters (262 feet) below sea level. The turbine diameter is 50 meters (164 feet). Its rotor blade height is around 40 meters (131 feet). Its optimal operating depth is 100 meters (328 feet) and deeper. SeaTwirl isn’t the only company testing vertical-axis wind turbines off the Norwegian coast – earlier this month, aluminum and energy giant Hydro and floating wind specialist World Wide Wind announced that they’re going to test a vertical-axis wind turbine made out of aluminum.

2023/01/26,"Scientists have proven that an ultrathin protective coating can protect a perovskite solar cell in space, according to newly published research from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).Space-based solar power – collecting solar power in space using solar power satellites and sending that power back to Earth – is being investigated by the US, China, the UK, France, Japan, and other countries. (Check out this infographic from the US Department of Energy about the pros and cons of space-based solar power.)Perovskite solar cells are less expensive and more lightweight than other technologies used in space, and they now have the potential to achieve similar efficiencies to current space PV technologies.The protective coating scientists tested – silicon oxide – hardens the solar cell against environmental factors on Earth, too, which is detailed in the paper published in Nature Energy today, “Metal oxide barrier layers for terrestrial and space perovskite photovoltaics.” But space has its own unique environmental challenges for solar, and in this case, for perovskite solar. Perovskites have to be resilient against such challenges as “radiation, atomic oxygen, vacuum, and high-temperature operation,” according to the study’s abstract.The researchers found that a layer of silicon oxide just a micron thick – that’s about 100 times thinner than a typical human hair layer – would preserve the efficiency and increase the lifetime of perovskite solar cells in space.Lead author Ahmad Kirmani said the silicon oxide layer could reduce the weight of conventional radiation barriers used for other solar cells by more than 99%, and that it serves as a first step toward designing lightweight and low-cost packaging for perovskites.The researchers’ simulations and experiments revealed that the silicon oxide layer reduces radiation damage, so the lifetime of the protected solar cells used in Earth’s orbits and deep space would be increased from months to years.Kirmani said:Power conversion efficiency and operational stability of perovskite solar cells have been the two primary focus areas for the community so far.We have made a lot of progress, and I think we have come far to the point that we might be pretty close to hitting those targets needed for industrialization. However, to really enable this market entry, packaging is the next target.The co-authors are from NREL, and several key collaborators are from the University of North Texas and the University of Oklahoma. One researcher is doing postdoctoral work at NASA and conducts research at NREL.Read more: Will perovskite give silicon a run for its money in semiconductor solar cells?Photo: NRELUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/26,"New York City’s largest fossil-fuel plant, which powers 20% of the city, will be replaced with offshore wind power. Ravenswood Generating Station is the New York City fossil fuel plant that will become an offshore wind hub. It’s a 2,480-megawatt (MW) power plant in Long Island City, Queens, across from Roosevelt Island, and it’s the Big Apple’s largest power plant.Rise Light & Power, a New York based energy asset manager and developer that holds Ravenswood as its core asset, is submitting a proposal today, with support from community and state leaders, to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) in response to the state’s offshore wind solicitation. In a nutshell, the 27-acre waterfront oil and gas industrial site is going to be converted into a clean energy hub that will power one-fifth of New York City with offshore wind power.The Ravenswood offshore wind project will reuse existing physical and electrical infrastructure, and that’s going to save New York ratepayers money. An HVDC conductor cable will be brought onshore at the existing power plant site. The cable will interconnect via underground HVAC cables to the NYISO bulk electric system at existing substations adjacent to the site.It will also become an offshore wind operations and maintenance hub that will support the just transition of the existing fossil fuel plant workforce, and drive economic investment into a historically underserved community. Rise Light & Power states that the project will, with training programs and job opportunities, justly transition and upskill Ravenswood’s current Local 1-2 UWUA union workers.US congresswoman Nydia Velázquez (NY-7) said:America’s first renewable repowering of a fossil-fuel burning plant can happen right here in Long Island City, Queens, home to the city’s largest power generating facility. This project would greatly advance our state’s climate goals and be a win for environmental justice communities living nearby.I believe that the repowering of the Ravenswood Generating Station can serve as a model for the rest of the country as we work to cut our dependence on fossil fuels while also providing a just transition for residents and workers.If they install batteries on the site, and combine that with wind. This would stabilize the City power grid near permanently and reduce any need to install new long-distance power lines into the city. Ditching fossil fuels is also going to improve the air quality in Western Queens, which has a higher asthma rate. In fact, it’s known as “Asthma Alley,” so unsurprisingly, this impactful change has strong community support.Read more: New York City is buying 925 EVs – here’s what’s includedPhoto: Rise Light & PowerUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/25,"Texas is hot below ground and full of folks with oil and gas drilling expertise, so that makes it ripe for a geothermal energy boom, according to a new study from researchers at five Texas universities.Researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Southern Methodist University, Rice University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Houston, as well as the University Lands Office and the International Energy Agency, just published a landmark study, “The Future of Geothermal in Texas: The Coming Century of Growth & Prosperity in the Lone Star State.”The study evaluates the scale-up potential of geothermal — the earth’s internal heat that can be harnessed as renewable energy — in Texas, as well as its potential to scale globally over the coming decades. There are at least 12 geothermal startups currently headquartered in Texas, with many more maintaining a business presence, employees, or planning projects in the state.  Almost 90% of these startups were founded and launched in the last 24 months, and they’re being invested in by oil and gas majors.And what makes Texas unique is that geothermal energy can be produced from existing oil and gas wells, as either electricity or direct-use heat.All of the startups have oil and gas industry veterans in their ranks because of course they have drilling-for-energy transferrable skills. The study’s authors report that oil and gas technology and knowledge transfer is projected to deliver 20-43% in cost savings to geothermal, using existing oil and gas industry technologies. Further, 70% of oil and gas respondents to the study asserted that there are no geothermal-related technical challenges that the oil and gas industry can’t solve.The researchers calculated a number of geothermal growth scenarios, both globally and in Texas, placed in the context of the scale of the oil and gas industry. They concluded that drilling 1.4 million wells globally between 2030 and 2050 could meet 77% of the world’s projected electricity demand, and Texas would be able to decarbonize 100% of its grid. Jamie Beard, principal investigator and editor of the study, said:The outcomes of this study are big – but so is the oil and gas industry – and the role of the industry is what has been the missing link in prior assessments about geothermal and its potential to scale.To achieve the outcomes reported, we would need an Apollo-style mobilization of effort globally, but that is what climate change requires of us. We’ve done Apollo before – let’s do it again.The Texas study is going to serve as a model for a program supported by geothermal expansion nonprofit Project InnerSpace to develop similar, state-specific geothermal roadmaps across the US where there’s current oil and gas industry engagement. Projects in Idaho, Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah will launch in the first half of this year.Read more: Here’s how deep geothermal drilling might be clean energy’s futurePhoto: “Picture A Day September 26, 2010 – Santa Rita No. 1, Completed May 27, 1923” by mlhradio is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/25,"The big climate, energy efficiency, and EV bill – the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – became law in August. It’s packed with loads of rebates and tax credits that will help Americans purchase everything from electric vehicles to high-efficiency electrical appliances to heat pumps. If you’re ready to electrify but you’re not sure which rebates and tax credits you qualify for, then check out this easy-to-use IRA savings calculator from Rewiring America.Rewiring America is an electrification nonprofit whose “purpose is to make electrification simple, measurable, and inevitable.” I’m going through this process now myself, so this savings calculator is my go-to. We recently bought a US-manufactured 2023 Volkswagen ID.4, and the Rewiring America calculator helped confirm the amount of tax credit the car qualified for – fortunately, the full $7,500 tax credit.In my electrification journey, I’m finding that I need to do my own research and advocate for myself, as electricians, heat pump installers, and car dealerships are still learning about how the new tax credits and rebates work. (Then I share what I learn with all of you – that is my job, after all.)The folks I’m working with want to know, and they want to help me in turn. Everyone I’m working with is concerned about climate change, and they appreciate it when I share the information I find with them.The IRA is still fairly new, so Rewiring America rightly disclaims in the FAQs section:Unfortunately we don’t know exactly when the electrification rebates marked “2023” will be available, because it will depend on how each state rolls out its incentive program. Our best guess is that electrification rebates will be available in late 2023.Here’s how the IRA Savings Calculator works: Type in your zip code, homeowner status (renters qualify, too), household income, tax filing status, and household size into the IRA Savings Calculator, and click “Calculate!” It then displays your personalized incentives and splits out tax credits from upfront discounts (i.e., rebates).I created the “Smith family” as a case study: a hypothetical family of four, homeowner, household income $100,000, joint tax filing, zip code 05001 (that’s Vermont). The Smiths qualify for $14,000 in upfront discounts – that’s rebates – and $8,250 in available tax credits, with an estimated bill savings per year of $1,450, and the latter is based on energy costs in Vermont. As upfront discounts (rebates) are based on a percentage of area median income, the Smith’s area median income is $90,100, as they live in the 05001 zip code area. You can find your area median income using this Area Median Income Lookup Tool from Fannie Mae.The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHR) provides point-of-sale consumer rebates to help low- and moderate-income US households to electrify their homes.So if the Smith family wanted to replace their gas stove with a new electric or induction stove, then they would qualify for 50% of electric/induction stove costs, up to $840, upfront, as their income ($100,000) is over 100% of area median income ($90,100) in their 05001 zip code:For low-income households (under 80% of Area Median Income), Electrification Rebates (HEEHR) cover 100% of your electric/induction stove costs up to $840. For moderate-income households (between 80% and 150% of Area Median Income), HEEHR covers 50% of your electric/induction stove costs up to $840.Total HEEHRA discounts across all qualified electrification projects are capped at $14,000.Rewiring America also provides an easy-to-understand online guide to the IRA called “Go electric!

2023/01/24,"Danish wind turbine maker Vestas has released a video that shows how it built the world’s most powerful wind turbine prototype.The Vestas V236-15.0 MW offshore prototype produced its first power earlier this month.It’s installed at the Østerild Test Center for large wind turbines in Western Jutland, Denmark, and it’s undergoing an extensive test and verification program before full type certification and serial production begins.Vestas just released a video that shows how they erected the giant wind turbine, and it’s fascinating to watch, as it’s a first for many things, such as size, location, and capacity.As Christian Gjerlov, product owner of Vestas Power Solutions, says in the video below:It’s a massive civil engineering feat to put up one of these turbines onshore.The tower, the nacelle, and the blade are installed by some of the biggest cranes available onshore, and we’ve actually had to develop special lifting processes to be able to erect this very big turbine onshore.Check out the short (and pretty exciting) video here:Vestas’ V236-15.0 MW was introduced to the market in February 2021. It has a rotor diameter of 774 feet (236 meters) and a wind-swept area of 470,845 square feet (43,743 square meters) – the wind industry’s largest.At 919 feet (280 meters), it’s also the world’s tallest wind turbine.The 379-foot (115.5-meter) blades were manufactured at Vestas’ blade factory in Nakskov, Denmark.A single Vestas V236-15.0 MW is capable of producing 80 GWh per year. That’s enough to power around 20,000 European households and save more than 38,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing 25,000 passenger cars from the road annually.The V236-15.0 MW will make its debut next year at Denmark’s Frederikshavn wind farm.It’s also been selected for New Jersey’s Atlantic Shores offshore wind farm as well as New York’s Empire Wind 1 and Empire Wind 2 projects.And it won’t stay the world’s most powerful wind turbine for long, as ever more powerful wind turbines are being debuted, most recently in China.Read more: This Chinese offshore wind turbine will be able to power 90K homesPhoto: VestasUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/20,"Increased US power generation from mostly wind and solar will reduce generation from both coal and natural gas power plants in 2023 and 2024, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) “Short-Term Energy Outlook.”The EIA forecasts that solar and wind, including new projects coming online this year, will account for 16% of total generation in 2023, up from 14% last year and 8% in 2018. In contrast, the EIA’s forecast share of generation from coal falls from 20% in 2022 to 18% in 2023, and to 17% in 2024. The forecast share from natural gas declines from 39% to 38% in 2023, and to 37% in 2024.Solar and wind has grown at a rapid pace in the last five years. The US electricity sector operated around 74 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV capacity at the end of 2022 – three times the capacity at the end of 2017. US wind power has grown by more than 60% since 2017, to about 143 GW of capacity.Solar capacity is expected to expand another 63 GW (84%) by the end of 2024, thanks to declining construction costs and tax credits. So the EIA forecasts that the solar generation share will rise from 3% of US generation in 2022 to 5% in 2023 and 6% in 2024. Much of the growth in solar capacity is in Texas and California, where natural gas has been the primary source of electricity.The EIA has a terrible track record when it comes to making statements about the future; seriously, their predictions are often laughably bad.  Coincidentally, their predictions almost always paint as rosy a picture as possible for coal and other fossil fuels.  Since this prediction is a warning to the fossil status-quo, I have to wonder if the next year or two might not see a pretty large reduction in fossil energy -- we will see. Despite their past failures at prognostication, the EIA is an excellent resource for historical data.Scheduled wind power growth is at about 12 GW of new planned capacity over the next two years. The forecast wind generation share in 2023 remains relatively similar to 2022, averaging 11%, and then increases to 12% in 2024.Read more: The Home Depot is putting rooftop solar on its storesPhoto: “Three pigeons on a roof” by Dunnock_D is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2023/01/20,"Nucor, the largest steel producer in the US and the biggest scrap recycler in North America, has announced that it will manufacture sustainable steel plate especially for the US offshore wind industry. Nucor’s new sustainable heavy gauge steel plate product for the offshore wind sector is called Elcyon. The company says not only that it’s the “world’s most sustainable steel plate,” but also that it’s the only plate steel in offshore wind sizes that’s melted and manufactured in the US:Elcyon is the world’s first steel plate for offshore wind applications made using electric arc furnace (EAF) technology, with a recycled content in excess of 90% and greenhouse gas emissions 1/5 the global blast furnace average.Offshore wind turbine towers and monopiles and jackets for their foundations are made of steel.Nucor will manufacture Elcyon at the company’s new $1.7 billion steel mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky, which produced its first steel plate at the end of December 2022.Leon Topalian, chair, president, and chief executive officer of Nucor Corporation, said:By launching Elcyon at Brandenburg we have effectively created the first domestic supply chain of sustainable steel for our nation’s offshore wind energy industry.In November, it became the first major industrial company to join the United Nations 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Global Compact, which is aimed at accelerating the decarbonization of the world’s electricity systems.The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act’s $300 billion for clean energy development will support the goal to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, which in turn could result in around 7.5 million tons of additional steel demand, according to Nucor.Read more: These companies will build a floating wind turbine out of aluminumPhoto: OrstedUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/20,"A team at the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory has developed a utility-scale solar and storage project that can provide power to both AC and DC high-voltage lines, and thus shore up grid stability – here’s how it works.Most of the US power grid uses alternating current, or AC, which constantly switches the direction of electron flow. But solar and battery storage uses direct current, or DC, that flows in a single direction. The US power grid includes a smaller number of high-voltage DC lines that are more efficient at delivering bulk power over long distances or to remote regions. Converting current between DC and AC requires specialized power electronics. So researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a design and control system and architecture for a solar and storage plant that can provide power to both AC and DC high-voltage lines. As a result, renewable power can be more easily and reliably transmitted.The project is called MARS, or “multi-port autonomous reconfigurable solar power plant.” It’s an all-in-one package that includes power electronics, electrical architecture, and cybersecurity software. And because it’s plug-and-play, it’s easier and cheaper for utilities to get it online. Case simulations in hardware that were based on two California sites revealed that MARS achieved up to 50% reduction in power loss, a 16% improvement in stabilizing AC voltage frequency, and 100% detection of cyber intrusions.MARS can also reconfigure itself based on available energy. For example, when the solar panels weren’t generating electricity at night, MARS could continue to connect the AC and DC transmission systems and use stored battery power to supplement its operation.The researchers found that MARS reduced electrical costs by up to 40%, as they developed an algorithm to fine-tune plant size and energy storage to maximize annual revenue.  MARS also includes an innovative type of inverter that can maintain grid stability and jumpstart the  grid after a disturbance.Team lead Suman Debnath team explained:You do not want the power grid to have significant losses of power when disturbances happen. Traditional renewable plants may disconnect from the grid or stop sending power, but we did not see that happen with MARS. It could cope better with failures in the external grid and  continue to operate, supporting the broader power system.Oak Ridge National Laboratory is working with such industry partners as Southern California Edison, Opal-RT, Hitachi Energy, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Oak Ridge team and its partners are working together to roll out an initial field demonstration of either MARS components that support grid stability, or a scaled-down version of the full design.I’d like to know more about this.  But our over-looked & most rapidly exploitable renewable energy resource is parking lots. Just follow France, by constructing solar canopies with integrated stationary storage batteries & vehicle-to-grid chargers on ALL existing parking lots with 80 or more spaces within 5 years, & within 3 years for big parking lots with hundreds of spaces. Do this before building more utility scale solar on remote farmland & environmentally sensitive habitat.Produce & store power right where most energy is consumed; shade existing asphalt heat islands; reduce utility bills for tenants of leased commercial property, like neighborhood shopping centers & large apartment buildings. And accomplish all this without requiring expensive new long distance utility transmission infrastructure. These can be storage hubs of 1 to 2 mile radius micro grids networked across typical lower density solar neighborhoods. Widely distributed, cheap, reliable local power production & storage instead of centralized, expensive, unreliable utility monopoly power.This is not a utility fix-all, but it can be accomplished very rapidly, everywhere, with existing standardized technology, expedited local permitting, & an existing trained workforce. Yes, the supporting canopies cost more than existing building roofs, but the area available is massively greater, and canopy structures will last for at least 75 years….and that’s 3 successive generations of improving solar panels & batteries.Southern California Edison’s senior engineer for grid technology innovation, Md Arifujjaman, said:From the point of view of a good algorithm to track down cybersecurity problems and technology we can use on the DC side,  MARS is very helpful. The DC technology is also promising for scaling down DC voltage for electric vehicle charging stations.  Photo: Existing and potential high-voltage direct current lines in states with the greatest solar potential, and prospective sites for MARS/Oak Ridge National LaboratoriesRead more: A Mars rover scientist is about to scale carbon-oxygen batteriesUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/19,"The Home Depot is going to install 13 megawatts of rooftop solar on 25 of its stores.Solar company DSD Renewables is working with the DIY giant to install rooftop solar on the stores, which are all in California. The solar roof installations will directly power the company’s store locations within the portfolio.Construction will begin in early 2023, and once the solar rooftop installations are fully online, they’re expected to generate more than 17 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy annually. That’s the equivalent of removing 2,648 gas cars from the road annually. The Home Depot’s goal is to produce or procure 100% renewable energy by 2030, equivalent to the electricity needs for all its facilities. There are nearly 2,300 Home Depot stores across North America, and the average Home Depot is around 104,000 square feet in size, so that’s a lot of empty rooftop space just waiting to be covered in solar panels.But these aren’t the first rooftop solar installations for Home Depot; they’ve been at it since at least 2017, when it worked with Current, a subsidiary of GE, and Tesla.DSD and The Home Depot are working together on further solar projects in New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, with additional projects planned in Arizona, California, Illinois, and New York.Dan O’Brien, vice president of direct origination at DSD, said: This project marks 98 [Home Depot] stores that will have deployed solar rooftops with DSD.The Home Depot shares our commitment to reduce its carbon footprint and we applaud the expansion of its renewable energy program.In January 2022, Electrek reported that Home Depot’s annual rooftop solar potential was 2,732.8 GWh.Every big box retailer should be considering this. How many square miles of big box roof top is there in the US? I'm sure a lot. Saves the companies money. Gets them a tax break. Doesn't require finding new space for a ground array. Makes Mama Nature smile. That's a lot of checks in the win column. Next: Home Depot to install EV charging at its locations. Putting rooftop solar on big-box retail roofs is a complete no-brainer. Put it everywhere. Otherwise it’s completely wasted space.

2023/01/18,"Noon Energy, which has developed “ultra-low-cost, high energy density carbon-oxygen battery technology for long-duration energy storage” for solar and wind power, today announced that it’s secured $28 million in Series A financing to commercialize its technology.Boston-based Clean Energy Ventures and Aramco Ventures’ new Sustainability Fund (as in, Saudi oil Aramco) led the round. Noon Energy previously closed on a $3 million seed round in April 2021.Chris Graves, Noon Energy’s founder and CEO (pictured above center), launched the company in 2018 after helping to develop NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover MOXIE device, which produces oxygen from the Martian carbon dioxide atmosphere.The 10-person team at Noon Energy has since developed a battery that stores energy in carbon and oxygen using “nature-based chemistry principles.” So metals such as lithium and cobalt aren’t needed, and Noon Energy says its battery requires just 1% of other critical elements compared to lithium-ion batteries.The Palo Alto-based startup says its battery offers more than 100 hours of energy storage at at one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries for long-duration storage. And because it’s extremely dense, that means a compact footprint three times smaller than current lithium-ion batteries. In the past 14 months, Noon Energy says its team has achieved a 50x scale-up of its core technology and that it plans to bring its battery to market in two years.  David Miller, cofounder and managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures, said:Noon Energy’s technology has far greater potential as modular, scalable, and low-cost long-duration energy storage than any other approach we’ve ever seen, and therefore can enable any system, from a single home, to an entire grid, to run on 100% solar and wind.Noon’s approach to long-duration storage is not only inspiring but proven, and we look forward to supporting this world-class team as they continue to scale and enable 100% renewables penetration.This is the way. We are in the very earliest days of an all-electric/low -or no-carbon grid. Innovation will certainly happen, and looking outside of traditional metals-based chemistry is very promising, just because we've ""mined"" various lithium ion chemistries for well over a decade. 2 years is a long time, and it is also the blink of an eye. There is a CO2/heat pump battery out there, too - which also holds great promise.Human ingenuity will provided the few tools we still need to end our fossil fuel addictions.PS - ""3 times smaller"" isn't a thing. Noon Energy’s website gives very little away, but it’s hiring in order to scale up. Its next move will be to build demonstration products to test its carbon-oxygen batteries in the field.Read more: This game-changing big ‘brick toaster’ battery is now on the marketPhoto: Noon EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/17,"In less than two weeks, Chinese wind turbine maker Mingyang has stolen the title of “world’s largest offshore wind turbine” from CSSC Haizhuang.Offshore wind turbines just keep getting bigger: Mingyang Smart Energy has unveiled the MySE 18.X-28X, and it’s bumped CSSC Haizhuang’s H260-18MW out of the top spot.The MySE 18.X-28X features a rotor diameter of more than 919 feet (280 meters) and 459-foot (140-meter) blades. The turbine has a swept area of 711,000 square feet (66,052 square meters) – that’s equivalent to the area of nine football fields.Under an annual average wind speed of 8.5 miles per second, each turbine can generate 80 GWh of electricity per year, and that’s enough to power 96,000 households, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 66,000 tonnes, according to Mingyang.Compare that to CSSC Haizhuang’s H260-18MW’s specs:The H260-18MW will have a rotor diameter of 853 feet (260 meters). To put that in perspective, that rotor diameter is as long as the height of the Haliade-X, which has a rotor diameter of 722 feet (220 meters). The 18 MW turbine will have 420-feet-long (128-meter-long) blades with a swept area of 570,487 square feet (53,000 square meters). Mingyang says its massive turbine will be able to operate reliably in “the most extreme ocean conditions such as a level-17 typhoon with wind speeds >56.1 m/s.”The company doesn’t indicate a timeline for production on its announcement.To put it succinctly, efficiency and cost cutting. Mingyang explained on LinkedIn:When compared to the installation of 13 MW models, the higher output of the MySE18.X-28X would save 18 units required for a 1 GW wind farm, shaving off construction costs by $120,000-150,000 per megawatt.Increasing the swept area of a wind turbine increases power output, and it costs money to put each offshore wind turbine into the seabed. So if you put a more powerful turbine in, then you’re going to need to install fewer wind turbines. It brings down the cost of installation, and eventually the cost of energy that the offshore wind turbines generate.But it remains to be seen whether increasing the size of these giant wind turbines will throw up logistical and supply chain challenges.Photo: Mingyang Smart EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/13,"China’s JA Solar, the world’s fourth-largest solar panel maker by capacity, is going to open its first factory in the US – a major win for the Biden administration, which has created a domestic clean energy manufacturing growth boom with laws passed late last year.Beijing-headquartered JA Solar has leased space in Phoenix to manufacture photovoltaic products – a $60 million investment. The Arizona Commerce Authority said in an announcement that the facility is expected to be operational by fourth quarter 2023, and that the new US plant will create more than 600 jobs.JA Solar says it will use “highly automated assembly lines to produce high-efficiency solar panels (PV modules) for commercial and residential rooftop applications, as well as for utility-scale solar power plant deployment.” Once it’s fully up and running, the Phoenix factory will have an annual production capacity of 2 gigawatts (GW). It’s been a very good week for US solar manufacturing announcements: Seoul-headquartered Qcells announced on January 11 that it’s going to manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished panels in Bartow County, Georgia. It will also assemble an additional 2 GW of solar panels at its Dalton, Georgia, facility – the largest solar panel manufacturing plant in the Western Hemisphere.Add to that the announcement by First Solar in November 2022 that it’s going to open a fourth PV solar module factory in Alabama by 2025 with a planned annual capacity of 3.5 GW.To put it all in perspective [via Bloomberg], “The US currently has 4.5 gigawatts of annual silicon panel production capacity, according to BloombergNEF data.”So just these three projects alone – and there are more – more than double the United States’ current annual solar production capacity.I also reported this week that China’s Trina Solar is going to open a factory in Vietnam in order to comply with US trade laws. Trina Solar was one of the Chinese solar companies preliminarily found by the US Department of Commerce to be attempting to dodge US tariffs by doing minor processing in Southeast Asian countries before shipping its solar products to the US.The US solar industry has understandably been concerned that the DOC investigation and tariffs on Chinese solar would stifle solar component supply to the US in the short term as demand mushrooms. But it’s apparent that in the longer term, the Biden administration’s tariff actions, along with the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, are going to stimulate US clean energy manufacturing growth.Read more: A Chinese solar maker being probed for skirting US tariffs will open a US trade-compliant factoryPhoto by Pixabay on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

The Cedar Rapids-based company also produces microfibers and additives from wind blade components that can be used in a range of composite, concrete, and soil stabilization applications.Jeff Woods, director of business development at Travero, said in a statement:With tremendous growth projected in the wind industry and an increasing number of turbines already reaching the end of their approximately 20-year lifespan, REGEN Fiber is entering the market at the perfect time.Recycling blades without using heat or chemicals while simultaneously keeping them out of landfills or being burned supports the sustainability goals of both the wind industry and customers receiving the recycled products.In 2021, REGEN Fiber began to pilot the process and collaborate with the concrete industry at a facility in Des Moines, Iowa. It will begin commercial-scale blade recycling in the second half of 2023. A new facility is currently being built in Fairfax, southwest of Cedar Rapids.Once commercial-scale operations in Fairfax reach full production levels, REGEN Fiber anticipates recycling more than 30,000 tons of shredded blade materials annually.REGEN Fiber is already recycling new wind turbine blade manufacturing scrap materials at commercial scale at its Des Moines facility.

2023/01/11,"Eco Wave Power is officially unveiling its onshore wave energy power station at public-private ocean institute AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles tomorrow.The AltaSea pilot project is the Israel-based Eco Wave Power’s first in the United States, and it says it believes it’s the “first-ever onshore wave energy technology that will be deployed in the United States.”Eco Wave Power, which produces clean electricity from ocean and sea waves, has modified, upgraded, and transported the unit to Los Angeles in just over a year. It arrived in December. The company says its technology is easily transported or reproduced to meet the unique energy needs of a country’s coastline.Eco Wave Power’s floaters – the blue dinghy-like things in the water in the photo above – convert the rising and falling motion of the waves into energy generation.The movement of the floaters compresses and decompresses the connected hydraulic pistons that transmit biodegradable hydraulic fluid into accumulators on land, where pressure builds. The pressure rotates a hydraulic motor, which rotates the generator, and then electricity is transferred into the grid via an inverter. After decompression, the fluid flows back into the hydraulic fluid tank, where it’s then reused by the pistons, creating a closed circular system.The whole wave-energy power station is controlled and monitored by a smart automation system.Eco Wave Power plans to develop further onshore wave energy power stations in the US, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, and other locations, as part of its 404.7 megawatt project pipeline.The company already has projects up and running in Israel and Gibraltar.Read more: These companies will build a floating wind turbine out of aluminumUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/11,"Chinese solar maker Trina Solar today announced that it’s going to open a 6.5 gigawatt (GW) silicon solar wafer facility in Vietnam in mid-2023 to supply the US market – and the company also says it will be trade compliant. In December, a preliminary finding from a US Department of Commerce investigation found that four Chinese companies — Trina Solar, BYD Hong Kong, Canadian Solar, and Vina Solar — attempted to bypass US duties by doing minor processing in Southeast Asian countries before shipping to the United States. The DOC said that Trina Solar’s “third country” where it was conducting minor processing was Thailand.The company issued the following response:Our sales, operations, finance, and management teams all reside locally within Trina Solar US.The recent findings will not affect our company’s future regional plans or our existing customers in the US. If the preliminary finding is confirmed, company-specific tariffs will be applied in June 2024 when a two-year tariff waiver that President Joe Biden granted in June 2022 expires. According to a DOC official in December via S&P Global Market Intelligence, Trina Solar is subject to a 254% import tariff. Trina Solar said today that its “Southeast Asia cell and module manufacturing facility will utilize wafer capacity from the facility in Vietnam so that Trina will meet US market requirements and receive exemption from circumvention.”Trina, which has an office in Fremont, California, asserted in a statement that it was already doing the following prior to the DOC investigation:Trina has worked to expand production locations, arrange business operations, and diversify supply chains to comply with US regulations and minimize tariff impact on its products. Trina’s ongoing process already includes polysilicon sourced outside of China and manufacturing modules and cells in Southeast Asia. The wafer facility is a further step in Trina’s supply chain diversification. Trina’s news will likely be applauded by the US solar industry, as it found the DOC investigation destabilizing. That’s because the US solar industry relies on solar module imports to meet mushrooming demand. Today’s news that Korean solar company Qcells is going to build a full solar supply chain in Georgia is welcome, as it will create a big boost for the US solar manufacturing industry.

Qcells is the only company in the U.S. to establish a fully integrated, silicon-based solar supply chain from raw material to finished panel.In the first quarter of 2023, Qcells will break ground on a new facility in Bartow County, Georgia, that will manufacture 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished panels, respectively. Qcells will also assemble an additional 2 GW of solar panels at its Dalton, Georgia, facility – the largest solar panel manufacturing plant in the Western Hemisphere. Qcells will hire an additional 510 people in Dalton, bringing Qcells’ total employment in Georgia to 4,000 and accumulated investment in the state to $2.8 billion. Qcells opened its first factory in Georgia in 2019 and hired 750 people to manufacture 1.7 GW of solar. In 2021, it announced it would add 1.4 GW to its manufacturing output and hire 535 more people. The investment is expected to bring Qcells’ total solar panel production capacity in Georgia to 8.4 GW by 2024.In August 2021, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which was introduced by Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) became law.

We look forward to continuing our close partnership with Senator Ossoff to create fully American-made and sustainable solar solutions, starting here in Georgia.This is a really big deal. Not only is it the largest investment in US clean energy manufacturing to date, a complete solar supply chain means that not one solar component will need to be imported.

2023/01/10,"Aluminum and energy giant Hydro and floating wind specialist World Wide Wind will build an offshore floating wind turbine out of aluminum.Oslo-headquartered Hydro is one of the largest aluminum companies in the world. It has operations in some 50 countries.World Wide Wind is a Norwegian startup that has designed a wind turbine with counter-rotating rotors mounted on a vertical axis that tilts with the wind, similar to sailboats. Its design (pictured above) has no nacelle, gear, cooling, or yaw. It has two rotors with three blades each that sweep in an inverted V-shape. The generator is at the base, so the added weight helps keep the turbine afloat.World Wide Wind asserts that “today, wind turbines used for offshore floating wind have more or less the same design as turbines meant for land-based wind. In effect we are moving a land-based technology offshore.” Hydro and World Wide Wind will jointly develop a wind turbine prototype that they say will be uniquely designed for floating deep-water offshore conditions. The companies will use sustainable and recyclable materials – including aluminum – in the construction of the prototype.Trond Lutdal, CEO of World Wide Wind, says:Having Hydro as a partner in developing our turbine using sustainable materials as aluminium is a big step forward for us. Use of local [materials] will be part of our common strategy going forward.And Trond Furu, research manager at Norsk Hydro Corporate Technology, says:For Hydro, this is an entry into the wind turbine production chain, and at the same time we are strengthening our position within renewable energy.The companies will also build a consortium of industrial partners.Read more: A colossal 18 MW wind turbine is about to debut in ChinaPhotos: World Wide WindUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/09,"Clean energy achieved momentum globally in 2022, yet it was something destructive that triggered that momentum.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine catapulted the world into a global energy crisis. And that in turn sparked a drive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables. As European governments and businesses work to quickly ramp up energy alternatives to replace Russian gas, the amount of renewable power capacity added in Europe in the 2022-27 period is forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to be twice as high as in the previous five-year period. That’s being driven by a combination of the attempt to limit global warming to 1.5°C and energy security worries.However, multinational banking giant ING reported in its 2023 Energy Outlook that, despite uncertainties, most European utilities “fared very well [in 2022] and will continue to do so in the next [year].”In the US, the federal government’s passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in late 2022 will provide support and long-term visibility for the expansion of renewables.

2023/01/07,"A Chinese manufacturer is on the brink of launching what will become the largest offshore wind turbine when it’s complete.GE Renewable Energy announced in December that its Haliade-X, the first wind turbine capable of more than 12 megawatts (MW), received a full type certificate for operations up to 14.7 MW from DNV, the world’s largest independent certification body. That officially made it the world’s most powerful wind turbine – but the Haliade-X won’t get to wear that crown for long.That’s because industrial manufacturer CSSC Haizhuang, a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corporation, one of China’s top 10 defense groups, has unveiled the rotor hub and nacelle for a monstrous 18 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbine prototype.The H260-18MW will have a rotor diameter of 853 feet (260 meters). To put that in perspective, that rotor diameter is as long as the height of the Haliade-X, which has a rotor diameter of 722 feet (220 meters). The 18 MW turbine will have 420-feet-long (128-meter-long) blades with a sweep area of 570,487 square feet (53,000 square meters). The blades will have independent pitch control, a well-known method of reducing blade loads.CSSC says 80% of the turbine’s components are being made in-house to cut down on supply chain issues.According to the Chongqing-based company, the H260-18MW will be able to generate 44.8 kilowatt-hours of electricity per revolution at full power. A single wind turbine will be able to produce more than 74 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy per year – the equivalent of the annual electricity consumption of 40,000 households.CSSC’s 18 MW turbine is going to bump MingYang‘s and Goldwind/China Three Gorges Corporation’s 16 MW turbines out of their anticipated top spots. The latter’s nacelle debuted in November.Western manufacturers GE, Siemens Gamesa, and Vestas are all currently developing 15MW turbines.I stopped and pondered why I get such a charge out of (no pun intended) the announcements of ever-larger wind turbines being built. Is it just childish excitement over superlatives, like when we’d pore over the Guinness Book of World Records as kids? Maybe a tiny bit. Plus, innovation is exciting.But mostly, it’s the sheer amount of clean energy these titans can produce. “The equivalent of the annual electricity consumption of 40,000 households” – that brings hope. And in the race to keep global warming to 1.5° C, we can use every clean kilowatt-hour of energy – and all the hope – we can get.Photo: CSSC HaizhuangUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/06,"The UK’s Dogger Bank, which will become the world’s largest offshore wind farm once it’s completed in 2026, will need to remove unexploded ordnance (UXO) items before it can proceed.The UXO items were identified during an inspection campaign last year, and they’ll be cleared in February. Dogger Bank is being built in three 1.2 GW phases – A, B, and C’s UXO inspection campaign is expected to be completed by March 12.Tables and maps in a notice to mariners published last year indicate that there are two unexploded ordnance items at Dogger Bank A and six at Dogger Bank B. In waters around the UK, there are over 100,000 tonnes of UXO that typically date back to World War I and World War II. In order to safely develop offshore wind farms it must be removed. Safelane Global, which specializes in UXO removal, notes on its website:As the devices have been buried beneath the ground or lain below the water’s surface, they will have experienced significant degradation via erosion making them increasingly less stable. The risk of detonation is heightened if these old, unstable devices are disturbed – perhaps from vibrations during construction works or the sub-sea engineering processes essential for the development of wind farms. When ordnance is exposed to heat, vibration, or contact, it may explode.Dogger Bank is a relatively shallow seabed in the southern central North Sea, and its sands tend to shift due to soft sediment, thus making UXO exposure possible. The offshore wind farm is a joint venture between Norwegian energy giant Equinor (40%), British utility SSE Renewables (40%), and Italian energy company Eni Plenitude (20%). A, B, and C will be capable of powering up to six million UK homes once it’s completed. SEE Renewables and Equinor are looking into building a fourth phase, Dogger Bank D, which would make the project even more massive.Read more: The world’s most powerful wind turbine has produced its first powerPhoto: General ElectricUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/01/02,"Renewable energy provided almost 23% of US electrical generation during the first 10 months of 2022, according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.The final issue of the 2022 EIA “Electric Power Monthly” report series, which was released in December and contains data through October 31, reflects that renewable energy – wind, utility and rooftop solar, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass – increased electrical output by 14.26% compared to the same 10-month period in 2021. By comparison, electrical generation by all energy sources combined grew by 3.14%.Year-to-date (YTD), renewables provided 22.6% of total US electrical generation compared to 20.40% in 2021. They are on track to meet or exceed EIA’s forecast of renewables providing 22% of US electricity in calendar year 2022.Solar output alone increased by 26.23%, and its share of total US electrical generation YTD surpassed 5%, providing 5.05% through the end of October. For perspective, solar’s YTD share first reached 1% in March 2016. Since then, solar’s monthly generation has increased almost sixfold. The trend seems likely to continue – in October alone, US solar output was 31.68% greater than a year earlier, a rate of growth that far exceeded every other energy source.Electrical generation by wind expanded by 16.86% and provided 9.8% of total electrical generation for the 10-month period.Renewables collectively outproduced both coal and nuclear by 16.62% and 27.39%, respectively. However, natural gas continues to dominate with a 39.4% share of total generation. SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong, who reviewed the EIA data, said:As we begin 2023, it seems very likely that renewables will provide nearly a quarter – if not more – of the nation’s electricity during the coming year.And it is entirely possible that the combination of just wind and solar will outpace nuclear power and maybe even that of coal during the next 12 months.Read more: The US’ largest solar panel maker will make millions of panels for National Grid RenewablesPhoto: First Solar Desert Sunlight Solar Farm/US Department of the InteriorUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/30,"Aerones uses robots to repair, inspect, clean, and ice-proof wind turbines, and the Latvia-based startup just raised $38.9 million in funding.TechCrunch reported that the funding was raised this month “from dozens of undisclosed investors.” And according to its SEC filing, it looks as though Aerones is hoping to bring in another $2.5 million.The Riga-headquartered Aerones, which was founded in 2015 and backed by US startup accelerator Y Combinator, has a US office in San Jose, California. The company, according to its website, has serviced 5,000 onshore wind turbines and 12,000 blades in 19 countries to date. (There are nearly 71,000 wind turbines in the United States alone, so Aerones has a lot of potential customers.)Aerones is working with 9 out of 10 of the world’s largest wind companies, including Siemens Gamesa, Enel, GE, and Vestas.In April, the company announced that it had raised $9 million in seed funding. It’s also developed an offshore robot prototype, which is co-funded by the European Union and is in the process of testing. Aerones’s patented robotic tech is compact. According to the company, it can be “transported in a single van,” and once it’s up the turbine, three Aerones technicians operate it from the ground.The company says it “inspects and maintains turbines up to six times faster and up to 40% more cost efficiently than humans.”Turbine blades can develop cracks or erode. The robots can inspect the blades with ultrasound scanning and cameras, and they can also repair them by cleaning and then applying filler to eroded surfaces or cracks. They can also apply protection coating to help prevent future damage and a special coating to prevent ice from forming on the turbines in colder climates.The robots can also clean the wind turbines by power washing them with liquid detergent, and funnels beneath the blades collect the liquid for so it can be used again.CTO and cofounder Janis Putrams said in April:We recently released an internal inspection robot that crawls and scans inside wind turbine blades and provides digital twin inspection data with unprecedented detail, and a cleaning solution that removes dirt and oil from turbine towers and blades very effectively.This short video demonstrates how the robots work:Read more: The world’s first floating offshore wind farm turns 5 — here’s how it’s goingPhotos: AeronesUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/29,"The world’s first floating offshore wind farm, Hywind Scotland, has been in operation since 2017. On its fifth birthday, its operators shared how it’s going and what they’ve learned.Hywind Scotland, a pilot project, is off the coast of Peterhead, the easternmost point in mainland Scotland, in Aberdeenshire. It consists of five floating wind turbines with a total capacity of 30 megawatts (MW). It generates enough electricity to power the equivalent of 34,000 households in the UK. Its maximum height, base to turbine, is 253 meters (830 feet), and it’s located in a water depth of 95-120 meters (312-394 feet). It has a spar-type substructure.Its operator, Norwegian power giant Equinor, claims that Hywind Scotland is the world’s best-performing offshore wind farm, achieving a capacity factor of 54% over its five years of operations. (For comparison, the University of Michigan’s Center for Sustainable Systems reported that offshore wind capacity factors are “expected to reach 51% by 2022 for new projects.”)The company developed a floating wind turbine motion controller that it implemented at Hywind Scotland. The company says that the technology has resulted in “world-leading capacity factor performance,” despite the wind turbines’ movement due to floating.Equinor also asserts that Hywind Scotland has achieved the highest average capacity factor of all UK offshore wind farms. Equinor has also developed special training for onshore wind technicians so that they can operate and maintain Hywind Scotland and says that its operating staff has had no loss time injuries during the floating offshore wind farm’s time online.William Munn, plant manager of Hywind Scotland at Equinor, explains what they’ve learned so far:Operating the Hywind Scotland project for the past five years has informed Equinor of some of the unique challenges associated with a floating wind farm, and the rewards if we get it right. Because of its location and the harsh weather conditions it encounters, Hywind Scotland has exposure to higher wind speeds than we typically see on a fixed-bottom wind farm, but also has to withstand large waves, while continuing to produce power with wave heights of 10 meters [33 feet]. Due to the environment, unique operations and maintenance methods have been required, such as a high-performance crew transfer vessel (CTV) that can continue operations in higher-than-standard transfer conditions.As a pilot floating wind farm, Hywind Scotland is acting as a trailblazer, with much larger floating wind farms now in the pipeline.Steinar Berge, head of floating wind at Equinor, said:Equinor is the world’s most experienced operator and developer of floating wind, and is taking lessons learned from Hywind Scotland further toward global opportunities. We are advancing plans to develop additional projects, including in South Korea, Australia, France, Spain, California, the UK’s Celtic Sea, and Norway. Hywind Scotland provides Equinor with strong confidence in floating offshore wind technology and enables us to advance even-larger projects with a solid operational foundation, getting us closer to the ultimate aim of industrializing and commercializing floating wind.Equinor’s Hywind Tampen, the world’s largest floating offshore wind farm, delivered its first power in November. It’s also Norway’s first floating offshore wind farm. When Hywind Tampen comes online in 2023, Equinor will operate about half the world’s total capacity of floating wind farms.Read more: World’s largest floating offshore wind farm is now onlinePhoto: © EquinorUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/28,"Swedish multinational power company Vattenfall announced today that it has successfully conducted large-scale seabed surveys with uncrewed robotic boats at several of its offshore wind farms in Denmark, Sweden, and the UK.Offshore wind farm operators need to periodically survey the seabed around turbine foundations and substation jacket legs to monitor changes in cable burial depth and scour development, which is defined as the “removal of sediment such as silt and sand, which can result in the formation of scour holes and may compromise the integrity of the structure.”Seabed intel is also necessary for repair and maintenance conducted by jack-up vessels, as their legs need stability to ensure safe elevation out of the water.Rasmus Juncher, senior lead geophysicist at Vattenfall, explained in a statement:When we issued the tender to select a contractor for seabed surveys across our Danish wind farms, we received an interesting proposal using uncrewed vessels. Having observed their deployment in small-scale trials elsewhere, we were curious to understand how successful their deployment would be on a larger scale. This technology consumes much less fuel than a traditional survey vessel, and because the vessel is controlled from an onshore operations center instead of having a crew onboard, personnel aren’t exposed to the same challenges as working offshore, thereby improving safety and wellbeing.Irish ocean data collection company XOCEAN conducted the robotic boat surveys on Vattenfall’s offshore wind farms. They took place in late summer and early autumn this year, and Vattenfall plans to expand the use of its uncrewed surface vessels – USVs – in future operations.The robotic boats are remotely controlled and monitored over a satellite internet connection by a team of pilots onshore. The robotic boat is significantly smaller – 4.5 meters in total length (14.7 feet) – than crewed boats. XOCEAN says its robotic boat’s carbon footprint is “a thousand times smaller than those of manned research vessels.”Juncher continued:This is the first step of many using uncrewed vessels, supporting the aims of a fossil free future. We want to pursue further opportunities to support other functionalities of the uncrewed vessels, for instance for visual inspections of our assets both above and below water and in-site investigations on a broader scale to support the wind farm design. Read more: These new, affordable electric heat pumps can easily replace gas boilersMain photo: VattenfallUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/27,"Japan’s first large-scale offshore wind farm started operation on December 22 – a major milestone in the country’s transition to renewables.Japan already operates several demonstration offshore wind turbines, but this is its first commercial offshore wind farm.The 140 megawatt (MW) project consists of two offshore wind farms – Noshiro and Akita. Noshiro Port offshore wind farm is around 300 miles northwest of Tokyo in the Sea of Japan, in Akita Prefecture. It’s the Noshiro Port part of the project that just came online. The Akita Port offshore wind farm’s “commercial operation based on FIT is expected in due course.”Noshiro and Akita together have 33 fixed-bottom Vestas wind turbines that were installed by UK offshore installation firm Seajacks International. Noshiro features 20 4.2 MW wind turbines, and Akita has 13 4.2 MW wind turbines. The offshore wind project will provide electricity to Tohoku Electric Power, which has a 20-year power purchase agreement for the wind farm’s entire output. It will power around 150,000 households.Tohoku Electric Power services 7.6 million individual and corporate customers in six prefectures in Tohoku region, plus the Niigata Prefecture, in Honshu.The Akita Offshore Wind Corporation owns the project. Tokyo-based investment firm Marubeni is the largest investor in Noshiro and Akita, and many other Japanese companies are invested, including utilities and banks.Japan aims to install up to 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and up to 45 GW by 2040.Currently, 25% of Japan’s electricity comes from renewables. It has a plan to bump that percentage up to 38% by 2030.At the end of May, for the first time and joining the other six member states of G7, Japan pledged to end public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022.Read more: Japan’s government wants to remotely control private ACs to avoid power outagesPhoto: Akita Offshore Wind CorporationUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/26,"Heating and cooling equipment multinational Johnson Controls has developed an air source heat pump prototype that can operate in temperatures below -20F (-29C) as part of the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge.DOE launched this challenge because, according to the program’s fact sheet, “additional efforts are needed to address common technical and market barriers to wider adoption by consumers – which include performance at temperatures of 5F and below, installation challenges, and electricity grid impacts during peak demand periods.”DOE is working with manufacturers to lab test cold climate heat pumps’ performance. Field testing will take place over the next couple years, and DOE is aiming for commercialization in 2024.Besides Johnson Controls, other manufacturers such as Carrier, Trane, and Bosch are also taking part in the challenge. Trane successfully completed its lab testing phase required by the heat pump challenge in early November and moved into the field trials phase. Katie Davis, vice president of engineering and technology, Residential HVAC, Trane Technologies, told Contracting Business in December that “there are no products in the market that currently meet the DOE CCHP Challenge performance specifications.” However, Davis said:When tested at the DOE’s lab, the Oak Ridge National Lab Facility, Trane’s CCHP prototype performed in temperatures as low as -23F, surpassing the mandatory -20F Fahrenheit DOE requirement. There are already units on the market in the United States that work at low temperatures – just not as low as the Johnson Controls or Trane prototypes. Johnson Controls currently has two residential heat pumps on the US market – the York YZV and York HMH7 – that can operate at temperatures as low as 5F (-15C). (Johnson Controls bought York in August 2005.) And Trane’s Platinum XV20i can operate at temperatures as low as 0F.I had a Mitsubishi unit installed last summer. It’s rated down to -24.

2022/12/23,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced this week that it wants to significantly raise the minimum common lightbulb efficiency level from 45 lumens per watt to over 120 lumens per watt.The DOE previously banned incandescent bulbs from 2023, and this new rule will accelerate the transition away from compact fluorescent bulbs as well toward LED bulbs, which are more efficient, longer-lasting, and save money. The DOE estimates that the new rule would deliver consumer benefits of up to $20 billion and conserve roughly 4 quadrillion British thermal units of energy in the 30 years after its implementation. It’s also estimated that in the same timeframe, it would result in cumulative emission reductions of 131 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and 903 thousand tons of methane – an amount roughly equal to the electricity use of 29 million homes in one year. Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a statement:The LEDs on today’s store shelves are a great product, but it turns out the best technology can make the bulbs even more efficient. We use so many light bulbs that this improvement would meaningfully reduce energy costs for households and businesses while cutting climate pollution from power plants.This plan would also mark the end of an era for compact fluorescent bulbs, which are still sold in some stores today but are inferior to LEDs.I can't believe that you can still buy non-LED light bulbs in the US. In Denmark its has been all LED for several years now.Congress first passed standards to phase out incandescent bulbs during the George W. Bush administration, and those standards were implemented during the Obama administration. The Trump administration reversed the rule in 2019, but the Biden administration reimplemented it and finalized it in April.The DOE will host a webinar on February 1, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. ET to solicit feedback on its proposed rulemaking.

2022/12/19,"Australia’s federal government has declared its first offshore wind farm zone. It’s off Victoria’s south coast, in the southeastern region of the country.The Bass Strait, which separates Tasmania and Gippsland, a region in southeastern Victoria, has been designated the first offshore wind zone. The windy, 15,000-square-kilometer  (5,792-square-mile) region could potentially support more than 10 gigawatts (GW) of energy generation, according to the Australian government. That’s equivalent of the power generated by around five coal plants.The Star of the South project, which will be 7-25 km (4-16 miles) off the Wellington coast of Gippsland, announced today that it has been awarded Major Project Status, so it looks set to be Australia’s first offshore wind farm. Danish company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is investing in the Star of the South, and a team in Victoria is developing it. Its project website claims that Star of the South could achieve up to 2.2 GW of energy with up to 200 turbines. That means enough power for 1.2 million households.As for the timeline, Star of the South’s website states that “it typically takes 6-10 years to develop and build an offshore wind project.” Star of the South CEO Charles Rattray also said the offshore wind farm could see first power by 2030, which is in line with Victoria’s goal to achieve 2 GW of offshore wind generation by 2032, 4 GW by 2035, and 9 GW by 2040.PV Magazine Australia writes that the “Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said feasibility licence applications for offshore wind projects in the Gippsland area will open soon. The Offshore Infrastructure Registrar will lead assessment of all applications and make recommendations to the Minister.”Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said that the “Star of the South project alone will support more than 2,280 jobs during construction and a further 300 direct jobs during operations.”UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/12/16,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) today released “Coal 2022,” its annual market report on the fossil fuel’s sector. Here’s where the world currently stands, according to the report, which is considered a global benchmark for the demand, supply, and trade of coal.Let’s get the bad news over with first. Global coal use is set to rise by 1.2% in 2022, surpassing 8 billion tonnes in a single year for the first time and eclipsing the previous record set in 2013. This was not a surprise to the IEA, as it predicted this peak would happen either this year or next.Coal used in electricity generation – the largest consuming sector – is expected to grow by just over 2% in 2022.Thanks to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fossil fuel prices have risen substantially this year, and natural gas saw the sharpest increase. Some regions in the world switched back to coal as a more price competitive option. Europe is on track to increase its coal consumption for the second year in a row.Alexandru Mustață, coal campaigner at Europe Beyond Coal, said:The IEA’s analysis underlines the urgent need to massively scale up renewable power and energy efficiency so that we cut people’s bills, secure our energy supplies, and keep essential climate targets intact. Importantly, no European country has revised its plans to phase out coal completely by 2030, and Europe is still on track to be coal free by the end of the decade. Now is the time for governments to ambitiously invest in green solutions so that we don’t risk falling back on fossil fuels that make us sicker, poorer, and less secure.In China, the world’s largest coal consumer that accounts for 53% of global coal consumption, a heat wave and drought pushed up coal power generation during the summer, despite COVID restrictions slowing down demand.The IEA notes:Developments in China, the world’s largest coal consumer, will have the biggest impact on global coal demand in the coming years, but India will also be significant.Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security, said:The world is close to a peak in fossil fuel use, with coal set to be the first to decline, but we are not there yet.Coal demand is stubborn and will likely reach an all-time high this year, pushing up global emissions.Sadamori continued:At the same time, there are many signs that today’s crisis is accelerating the deployment of renewables, energy efficiency, and heat pumps – and this will moderate coal demand in the coming years. Government policies will be key to ensuring a secure and sustainable path forward.The “Coal 2022” report comes only just over a week after the IEA announced that solar is set to overtake coal globally by 2027. And even though coal use rose in 2022, it was kept in check by renewable deployment.Most growth will come from renewables, so the world is close to a peak in fossil fuel use, and coal will be first in line to decline. We’re just not there … yet.By 2025, European coal demand is expected to decline below 2020 levels. And the IEA says that that despite high prices and comfortable margins for coal producers, “there’s no sign of surging investment in export-driven coal projects. This reflects caution among investors and mining companies about the medium- and longer-term prospects for coal.”Renewables will increasingly displace fossil fuels for electricity generation in advanced economies, and those are the economies that create the most emissions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has also caused a scramble to beef up the renewables pipeline in Europe quickly in order to reduce dependency on Russian natural gas.Developing economies in Asia are set to increase coal use at the same time as they add more renewables to help power their economic growth. But this week, wealthy nations pledged $15.5 billion to help Vietnam move from coal to renewables, following similar agreements with Indonesia and South Africa. Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest emitters, has now pledged to generate about one-third of its power from renewables by 2030.Dave Jones, head of data insights at independent energy think tank Ember, said about the “Coal 2022” report:This report shows renewables will stop any further big rises in coal power generation in the coming years. This is a key tipping point: Renewables are working for the climate. And with coal prices still at record highs, this means renewables are working for the bill-payer as well.In other words, we’re in for short term pain but long-term gain as renewable adoption grows.Read more: Renewables will be the largest source of electricity by early 2025Photo: “Pennsylvania – Scranton: Lackawanna Coal Mine” by wallyg is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/15,"GE Renewable Energy announced today that its Haliade-X wind turbine, the first 12 MW+ turbine built, has received a full type certificate for operations up to 14.7 MW from DNV, the world’s largest independent certification body. DNV is an international accredited registrar and classification society headquartered in Høvik, Norway. This certification follows an earlier DNV certification that the Haliade-X could operate at up to 13.6 MW. The full type certficate is verification that GE’s turbines will operate safely, reliably, and according to design specifications. Haliade-X is now the largest wind turbine with a full type certification.The process of certifying the Haliade-X 14.7 MW-220 involved a series of tests on a prototype located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (pictured). The prototype was extensively tested and validated from November 2019 and has set several world records for continuous power output in one day.Kim Sandgaard-Mørk, executive vice president for renewables certification at DNV, said:At DNV, we forecast 2 TW of grid installed offshore wind capacity by 2050. This development is also linked to larger turbines like GE’s Haliade-X. Continued increases in turbine, blade, and tower size will lead to improvements in the capacity factors. We are happy to support GE with our certification services to ensure safe and reliable wind turbines supporting the growth of wind energy.Just one GE Haliade-X 14.7 MW-220 offshore wind turbine can generate up to 76 GWh of gross annual energy production. It’s able to power the equivalent of 20,000 European households and save up to 53,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.The 14.7 MW Haliade-X will first be brought online at the 3.6 gigawatt (GW) Dogger Bank Wind Farm in the UK, which will become the largest offshore wind farm in the world when it’s complete. It’s a joint venture between SSE Renewables, Equinor, and Vårgrønn. It’s located between 78 and 180 miles (125 and 290 km) off the east coast of Yorkshire.Due to its size and scale, Dogger Bank is being built in three consecutive phases: Dogger Bank A, Dogger Bank B, and Dogger Bank C. The 14.7 MW will be applicable for the 87 14 MW turbines at Dogger Bank C.Photo: Danny Cornelissen for GE Renewable EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/15,"Tokyo’s local assembly today ruled that all new houses built by large-scale homebuilders in the Japanese capital must have solar panels installed from April 2025.This is the first time a Japanese municipality has mandated solar on new homes. It means that around 50 major builders will be required to supply homes that are up to 21,500 square feet (2,000 square meters) in size with renewables – and in particular, solar panels.Home buyers that privately contract the construction of a residence 2,000 square meters or more will also be required to install solar panels.Kyodo News writes:The metropolitan government estimates that the 980,000 yen ($7,200) initial cost for installation of the 4-kilowatt panels can be covered within 10 years from electricity sales revenue and can be further reduced down to six years with subsidies it will provide.Subsidies for the initial costs will also be provided to leasing firms to reduce the burden on home buyers, the metropolitan government said.Only 4% of buildings in Tokyo that are able to host solar panels actually have them at present, according to Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike.Tokyo’s metropolitan government aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, compared with 2000 levels. The city has a population of nearly 14 million people.Japan increased its renewable power generation target overall from the previous 22-24% to 36-38% by 2030. Renewables are forecast to account for 34.6% of Japan’s generation mix in 2030, falling just short of its goal.In October 2020, Japan, the world’s fifth-largest carbon emitter, pledged to reach net zero by 2050.Read more: Five of Asia’s biggest economies are forecast to see dramatic solar growthPhoto: Tokyo Institute of Technology Green Hills Building 1 view from the bottom/ykanazawa1999/flickrUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/15,"First Solar, the largest solar panel maker in the US, announced today that it will supply clean energy company National Grid Renewables with 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels – and that’s a very big deal.Minneapolis-based National Grid Renewables is part of the Ventures division of National Grid plc, one of the world’s largest publicly listed utilities with its HQ in the UK. National Grid Renewables has a portfolio of solar, wind, and energy storage projects throughout the US in various stages of development, construction, and operation.First Solar is supplying National Grid Renewables with its Series 7 thin-film solar modules. The up to 540-watt panels combine the company’s thin-film cadmium telluride technology with a larger form factor and have up to 19.3% efficiency and a 30-year warranty. The Series 7 panels are designed and developed at First Solar’s factories in California and Ohio.First Solar says that the Series 7 panels’ frameless design improves soiling and show shedding, and it also says that it offers the solar industry’s only solar cell cracking warranty.This new 1.6 GW order expands First Solar’s supply of solar panels to National Grid Renewables to over 4 GW, as the two companies made an agreement for 2 GW of solar panels in June of this year. National Grid Renewables and First Solar have also partnered on multiple projects over a decade, including the 200-megawatt (MW) Prairie Wolf Solar Project, in Illinois, and, in Texas, the Noble Solar (275 MW) and Storage Project (125 MW).Last month, First Solar announced that it will invest up to $1.2 billion to ramp up production of US-made solar panels.This may look like a typical business story – X company orders Y product from Z company – but here’s why it’s noteworthy.First of all, that’s a LOT of solar panels. Just 1 GW of power alone is equivalent to 3.125 million solar panels, and National Grid Renewables ordered 1.6 GW.Secondly, every time news like this is announced, it’s evidence that the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act is giving American manufacturing a major shot in the arm.This will create even more jobs, and domestic manufacturing will also smooth out US supply chain snags. US manufacturing also means the distance the solar panels need to travel will be shorter, which means less transport emissions are created. There’s also accountability here when it comes to ethical manufacturing, as First Solar is the only company among the 10 largest solar manufacturers globally to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance, the world’s largest industry coalition that supports the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain. This agreement is yet more evidence of a major shift in US renewables manufacturing. And that never fails to be exciting.Read more: The largest American solar panel maker pledges to build $1B factory in US SoutheastPhoto: First SolarUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/14,"German manufacturer Kopp has launched a foldable, four-panel solar rooftop system that comes with everything it needs for installation in reusable transport boxes.The foldable rooftop solar panels are preassembled at Kopp’s facility in Kahl am Main. The panels are called SmartFlex, and they consist of four fold-out PV modules and come with module carriers, ballast material, cables, and building protection in reusable boxes, thus reducing packaging waste.The SmartFlex module is approximately 6.8 square meters (73 square feet) when unfolded and has an output of 1.6 kilowatt peak. The modules can be connected together easily, without anchoring on the roof, with one tool. Kopp says installation is quick. A crane lifts the foldable rooftop solar panels out of their delivery boxes onto the roof, and they only need two solar technicians to unfold them and connect them to each another.Kopp says its SmartFlex system can “easily” withstand strong winds and other extreme weather as a result of the ballast material that comes with the panels.Check out Kopp’s video below that shows how the foldable system gets installed. Even if you don’t speak German, it’s a good way to understand how it works. We think it’s pretty clever.Read more: This Texas solar farm’s panels will sit flat on the groundPhoto: KoppUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/13,"A 90 megawatt (MW) solar farm will be built around the runway of an airport in Sweden, and it will be the largest solar power purchase agreement (PPA) contracted in Sweden to date.Ninety megawatts is enough to power over 16,000 households in Sweden annually, but this PPA is between Swedish fashion retail giant H&M Group, renewable energy producer Neoen, and solar developer and independent power producer Alight.The solar farm, which will be jointly owned by Neoen and Alight, will be installed around Hultsfred airport’s runway in southeastern Sweden. The long-term agreement will provide H&M Group with local clean energy and guarantees of origin.The solar farm’s construction is planned for the second half of 2023, and it’s expected to come online in 2025.Ulrika Leverenz, Head of Green Investment of H&M Group, said:Renewable energy plays a crucial role in our climate roadmap to reduce emissions and achieve net zero by 2040. Business and countries must show leadership to limit global warming to 1.5C according to what the climate science urges us to do.H&M Group has set a goal to reduce the company’s absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions and its scope 3 emissions by 56%, both by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. It’s also set a goal to increase the annual sourcing of renewable electricity to 100% by 2030.Sure, it’s somewhat interesting that this is the largest PPA agreement in Sweden to date. But that’s not what grabbed my interest. What did was the siting of this solar farm next to an airport runway.The only drawback I can see to building solar farms next to airport runways is that the solar panels may need to be cleaned more frequently due to airport particulate matter. But, like building solar panels on top of warehouses or landfills, this just makes so much sense. Land next to airport runways is essentially dead space, so let’s use it for something good.Do you think putting solar farms next to airport runways is a good idea?

2022/12/12,"Erthos, an Arizona energy tech company that makes Earth Mount Solar PV, a mounting system that secures solar panels flat to the ground, signed an agreement with renewable energy developer Industrial Sun for a 100+ megawatt (MW) solar project in Texas. It will become the only utility-scale solar farm mounted flat on the ground to date.Erthos writes that “the project has an expected interconnect capacity of 100 MWac, all of which Industrial Sun is seeking to utilize,” as the exact size of the solar farm has not yet been revealed.Industrial Sun was faced with a land constraint problem for this particular project, and that’s where Earth Mount Solar PV came in. Conventional solar mounting technologies typically require more than five acres of land per megawatt of capacity. But Earth Mount Solar PV only needs less than 2.5 acres per megawatt of capacity. So according to Erthos, its flat mounting technique enables solar farms to achieve an energy density that’s more than twice that of conventional utility-scale solar farms. Erthos claims that a solar farm on its flat mounts can be built in half the time for half the cost of conventional mounting systems. It also says that it uses 70% less cable and needs 70% less trenching and that its system is hurricane proof. In September 2021, PV Magazine Australia explained how Earth Mount Solar PV works:The “ErthCompatible” specification that is licensed by Erthos requires the use of IP68 glass-glass modules. Module suppliers have mostly used bifacial modules to fit that requirement. Another feature of the specification is using aircraft cable threaded through the sides of the module, to prevent movement both up and down or side to side. Keeping the panels secure and flat allows the utilisation of another innovation of Erthos: an autonomous cleaning robot. The robot, or fleet of robots, runs nightly, and a single robot can clean up to 2 MW every day.Educational website Solar Tech Advisor explains what IP68 solar panels are: The highest rating that a solar panel can achieve for waterproofing is IP68. This rating means that the product is dust-tight and can be submerged in water for long periods of time. IP68 rated solar panels can be used in areas with high water pressure, such as permanent underwater solar applications.Erthos says its robots take care of dirt and bird poo. Its CEO, Jim Tyler, told PV Magazine Australia:The rough cost to clean a tracker plant, one time, is about 50 cents per kW. We clean our solar plant every day for a year for 50 cents per kW.He also addressed concerns about high temperatures in the same interview:I did a fatal flaw analysis on the idea. The only fatal flaw of concern that I had personally was temperature. And so once I proved the temperature performance of max cell temperature of the module, I was satisfied. I happened to live in Phoenix which is one of the highest temperature places on the planet. And it happened to get to 118 degrees (47.8 C) outside when I was running our first plant in 2019. And sure enough, the module cell temperatures don’t even approach maximum cell temperature. And I said: That’s the answer.In March 2022, Erthos closed a $17.5 million Series B financing round, which was led by Capricorn Investment Group that has also invested in Tesla and SpaceX.I would think that this makes sense in equatorial areas near 0 latitude where the sun actually swings a bit north and south through the course of the year.What do you think of solar farms being mounted flat on the ground?

2022/12/12,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced $8 million in research funding for six agrivoltaics projects – that is, pairing solar with farming.When solar power and agriculture – including crop production, livestock grazing, and/or pollinator habitat – coexist on a piece of land, it’s called agrivoltaics. An Oregon State University study published in 2019 found that “if less than 1% of agricultural land was converted to solar panels, it would be sufficient to fulfill global electric energy demand.” Yet less than 2% of US solar energy projects are currently co-located with crops or pollinator habitats.For smaller farm animals such as sheep (cows are another matter because of their size), solar panels provide shade and shelter, and the animals keep the grass trimmed and eat for free. The shade that the solar panels create reduces heat and light underneath, thus helping to conserve water.This DOE funding program is called FARMS: Foundational Agrivoltaic Research for Megawatt Scale, and it “examines how agrivoltaics can provide new economic opportunities to farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry.” The DOE announced the program in May, and it announced the six selected projects late last week.The six projects are, as explained by the DOE (Editor’s note: Below is a direct quote):In February 2021, Electrek published a story about the top five trends in solar’s future, and agrivoltaics was on that list. So we’re happy to see this research funding announcement from the Biden administration. Combining solar with farming is an excellent idea that needs to be deployed quickly. It’s efficient, it conserves water, it provides clean energy, and it’s both a moneymaker and a money saver for farmers and growers. It provides habitats for pollinators. It provides land for solar panels.

2022/12/07,"The first of 62 transition pieces to be manufactured for Vineyard Wind 1, the United States’ first utility-scale offshore wind farm, has just been moved to the port of Avilés, Spain, for shipment to Massachusetts.The transition pieces are being made and delivered by Spanish wind turbine tower maker Windar Renovables, which won the contract in 2019. Windar says the Vineyard Wind project will create 500 jobs at peak production times. The transition piece is made of steel and binds the monopile and the turbine together. It’s a vital link in the entire offshore wind turbine.Italian electrical cable company Prysmian Group’s cable-laying vessels, Cable Enterprise and Ulisse, are also in the United States and installing submarine cables manufactured and tested in Finland and Italy.The $3.5 billion Vineyard Wind will feature 62 Haliade-X 13 megawatt (MW) turbines spaced one nautical mile apart.The 800 MW Vineyard Wind 1 is a 50-50 joint venture between clean energy company Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) funds CI II and CI III.Vineyard Wind 1 is 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket and 35 miles from mainland Massachusetts. It will supply clean energy for over 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts and reduce carbon emissions by over 1.6 million tons per year. Electricity generated by the turbines will be collected by an offshore substation before being transmitted to shore.Vineyard Wind 1 is expected to be online by 2023.It’s exciting to see a milestone clean energy project start to take shape. Of course the US offshore wind farm industry is still in fledgling stage, so it has to have help from expert companies in Europe while it sets up shop. And, Vineyard Wind 1 still has to overcome not-insignificant obstacles: in mid-November, a commercial fishing group asked a judge in Boston to make a judgment without a trial in its lawsuit to halt Vineyard Wind 1, as it claims the project is rushed and illegal. We’ll be watching to see what happens.the question i have is: there is no doubt there are downsides to windpower, including its impact on local scenery.  But would you rather keep giving USD$ to Saudi Arabia (and their funding of extremist Wahabist Islam around the world), or Iran (with their funding of Hezbollah and their oppressive theocratic regime), or Russia (with Putin trying to reclaim ex-USSR sphere of influence)?  Surely, no matter how ugly windfarms of any type is - it is 1 million times better than giving money to undemocratic regimes around the world that is trying to kill many hundreds of thousands of people in one way or the other?

2022/12/06,"Wind and solar are set to account for over 90% of global electricity expansion over the next five years, overtaking coal to become the largest source of global electricity by early 2025, according to “Renewables 2022,” the latest edition of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) annual report on the renewable sector.Total renewable capacity growth worldwide is set to almost double in the next five years. In other words, the world will add as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the past 20. And even better, the report also lays out a case in which renewable power capacity could grow a further 25% on top of the main forecast.The IEA report also notes that global renewable power capacity is now expected to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) over the 2022-2027 period – an amount equal to the entire power capacity of China.This huge expected increase is 30% higher than the amount of growth that was forecast just a year ago. The rapid growth is attributed by the IEA to governments rapidly lining up the adoption of renewables in response to the global energy crisis. The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in Europe working to quickly replace Russian gas with alternatives. Europe’s renewable power capacity added from 2022 to 2027 is forecast to be twice as high as in the previous five-year period.The IEA writes:An even faster deployment of wind and solar PV could be achieved if EU member states were to rapidly implement a number of policies, including streamlining and reducing permitting timelines, improving auction designs and providing better visibility on auction schedules, as well as improving incentive schemes to support rooftop solar.The US, China, and India are also driving renewables’ upward trajectory. China is expected to account for almost half of new global renewable power capacity additions over the 2022-2027 period as the result of its recent 14th Five-Year Plan. And new policies in the US and India are expected to boost investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion over the next five years.The IEA says that in a large majority of countries, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind are the cheapest options for new electricity generation.Global solar PV capacity is set to almost triple over the 2022-2027 period and become the world’s largest source of power capacity. The report forecasts growth of residential and commercial rooftop solar.Global wind capacity almost doubles in the five-year period, with offshore wind making up one-fifth of the projected growth.Sean Rai-Roche, policy adviser at climate change think tank E3G, said:The latest analysis from the IEA reiterates an increasingly clear trend: Renewable energy is now a cheaper, cleaner, more energy-secure way to power our economies than burning coal, oil, or gas.Wind, solar, and energy storage are the fastest, most cost-effective routes to achieving this and would upgrade societies by equipping them with the tools necessary for an energy-secure future.Read more: The largest landfill solar project in North America is now completeUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/05,"The US Department of Commerce (DOC) has determined that four out of eight Chinese solar companies that it’s been investigating are “attempting to bypass US duties by doing minor processing in one of the Southeast Asian countries before shipping to the United States.” Here’s what it means for the US solar industry. December 5 update: One of the four solar companies, Vina Solar, is owned by Xi’An-headquartered LONGi Green Energy Technology, the largest solar manufacturing company in the world. LONGi today said that it would provide evidence to the DOC that Vina is complying with US laws. The solar giant said in a statement to Reuters:Next, the US Department of Commerce will conduct onsite audit in the next few months to verify the authenticity of the investigation information. During this period, we will actively provide evidence that shows we are compliant with US trade law and not circumventing.Electrek will continue to monitor this story.The DOC found that the four Chinese companies that attempted to circumvent US duties by processing in Southeast Asia are:The DOC findings are preliminary, and the agency will conduct in-person audits in the coming months. The DOC also noted that a ban is not going to be implemented on products from Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam:Companies in these countries will be permitted to certify that they are not circumventing the [antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders], in which case the circumvention findings will not apply. The DOC also notes:Further, some companies in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam did not respond to Commerce’s request for information in this investigation, and consistent with longstanding practice, will be found to be circumventing.As Electrek reported in mid-May, the DOC launched an investigation of whether Southeast Asian solar cell manufacturers are using parts made in China that would normally be subject to a tariff.That investigation destabilized the US solar industry, which relies on solar module imports to meet growing demand. The majority of the US solar industry then asserted that the DOC investigation would harm the US solar industry and wanted the investigation dismissed.On June 6, President Joe Biden waived tariffs for 24 months on solar panels made in Southeast Asia in response to the investigation. He also invoked the Defense Production Act to spur on US solar panel and other clean energy manufacturing. That way, domestic production could be sped up without interfering in the DOC investigation.The DOC today asserted that Biden’s presidential proclamation provides US solar importers with “sufficient time to adjust supply chains and ensure that sourcing isn’t occurring from companies found to be violating US law.”For years the Solar Installation Associations have resisted and resented efforts to support manufacturing and R&D efforts in the US and Canada, favoring cheap readily available Chinese products  on which they can slap larger margins.  Now that the federal government has found that the Chinese manufacturers have been yet again trying to circumvent US anti-dumping laws the local distributors and installers are yet again whining about short-sighted government bureaucracy.  Short-sighted?  I was driven out of the solar industry 7 years ago by the same whining and unwillingness to show resolve against corporate China's government subsidized anti-competitive behavior!But Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), didn’t see it that way. She said in a statement:The only good news here is that Commerce didn’t target all imports from the subject countries. Nonetheless, this decision will strand billions of dollars’ worth of American clean energy investments and result in the significant loss of good-paying, American, clean energy jobs. While President Biden was wise to provide a two-year window before the tariff implementation, that window is quickly closing, and two years is simply not enough time to establish manufacturing supply chains that will meet US solar demand.This is a mistake we will have to deal with for the next several years.George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, the US’s largest utility-scale solar installer, also wasn’t pleased about the DOC’s announcement. He said in an emailed statement:After years of supply chain challenges and trade disruptions, I remain concerned that the Commerce Department chose a path that could jeopardize the solar industry’s ability to hire more workers and construct the clean energy projects needed to meet our country’s climate goals.The upside is that Commerce took a nuanced approach to exempt a number of manufacturers rather than issuing a blanket ban of all products from the targeted countries. While it’s positive that companies will be able to access some of the crucial materials we need to deploy clean energy, it’s still true that this ruling will further constrict a challenged supply chain and undercut our ability to fulfill the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act.Photo: Tom Fisk on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/12/05,"France has received the green light from the European Commission to start cracking down on ultra-polluting short-haul flights within the country, starting with a ban on three popular flights from Paris-Orly Airport. The country also aims to curb the use of private jets in an effort to both reduce CO2 emissions and keep up the social media backlash against the super-rich jet set in a time of soaring inflation and energy cutbacks.The measure to ban short-haul commercial flights within France, first proposed in 2021, needed the nod of approval from the EC after considerable pushback from the Union of French Airports and the European branch of the Airports Council International. While the original plan hoped to ban eight flights, the EC only approved three flight routes that offer good alternatives to travel by rail in less than 2.5. hours, with many options for direct train travel throughout the day. That includes journeys between Paris-Orly and Bordeaux, Nantes, and Lyon.Three more routes may potentially be added to the list – between Paris Charles de Gaulle and Lyon and Rennes, and between Lyon and Marseille — but these weren’t approved because travelers needing to get to airports in Paris and Lyon don’t, at the moment anyway, have options to take very early or very late trains. Two other proposed routes, from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Bordeaux and Nantes, were excluded from the plan because traveling by train takes slightly more than 2.5 hours on high-speed trains. The new ban will be valid for three years, after which it will need to be reassessed by the EC. “This is a major step forward and I am proud that France is a pioneer in this area,” France’s Transport Minister Clément Beaune said in a statement. While green campaigners had hoped for a more ambitious plan, the mood after Friday’s vote was generally positive. Greenpeace’s Thomas Gelin adds, “The French ban on short-haul flights where quick train connections exist is a baby step, but it’s one in the right direction.”The French government also plans to radically curb the number of private jets allowed to fly within the country, to cut back on emissions and react to a growing backlash against the ultra-rich and their gas-guzzling puddle-jumping, with the most popular route being from Paris to the French Rivera. This is a great first step. The crackdown on private jets is FULLY justified. The uber-rich create hundreds or even thousands of times the pollution generated by average citizens of developed counties. We must not be afraid to enact good policy simply because we're afraid of upsetting the uber-rich and their obsequious lapdogs (including the gullible poor who watch Fox News and thus become trained to hate themselves).“There are some behaviors that are no longer acceptable,” Beaune told Le Parisien last August.And for good reason: A report from Transport and Environment, the European federation for clean transport, found that private jets are up to 14 times more polluting than commercial flights per passenger mile, and 50 times more polluting than trains.An example of total excess, director Steven Spielberg’s private jet reportedly burned more than $116,000 in jet fuel in two months this summer, emitting some 179 tons of CO2 into the air, according to flight-tracking data from ADS-B Exchange. France – which has the highest number of private jet flights in Europe – won’t likely ban private jets, however, but more likely apply heavy taxation and restrictions, asking companies to be more transparent in how their corporate jets are used.

2022/12/02,"Montgomery County, Maryland, will be the US East Coast’s first county to ban natural gas in new buildings.Montgomery County will require all new construction to only use electric energy equipment. Montgomery County, which is just north of Washington, DC, has a population of just over 1 million, so this is an impactful decision for the region.That means specifically that all new buildings in the county will need to go electric for heating, hot water heating, and cooking from the end of 2026. However, income-restricted housing and schools will have until the end of 2027.The Montgomery County Council backed the gas limits with a 9-0 vote, and the county executive is expected to sign off on Bill 13-22, “Comprehensive Building Decarbonization.”About half of the county’s emissions come from buildings, so environmental groups welcomed the decision. Mike Tidwell, director of climate change public policy advocate group CCAN Action Fund, said about Bill 13-22 on November 17:Our safety and health will benefit from a move to all-electric buildings, and we will be doing our part to address climate change.Unsurprisingly, the natural gas industry isn’t as enthusiastic. E&E News reports:Representatives from Washington Gas Light Co., which distributes gas to over a million customers in Montgomery County and the Washington area, said the ban focused on electrification “while dismissing other proven opportunities for decarbonization,” like mixing hydrogen into the natural gas system.“We urge the Council to consider a more holistic approach to decarbonization, one that puts affordability, reliability, resiliency, and security at the forefront,” wrote the company in a July 26 filing to the County Council.Electrification brings higher upfront costs to developers but lower operating costs in the long run.Only two West Coast states, California and Washington, have banned the sale of all new natural gas-fired heaters and water heaters by 2030.Here in Ontario, Canada, despite relatively cheap electricity, it’s still much more expensive to heat homes electrically than with natural gas. So the assertion of lower long term cost for electricity would be incorrect here. And I doubt it’s true in Maryland, either.To date, no East Coast state has passed a natural gas ban. Massachusetts has a program that allows up to 10 cities to enact a natural gas ban, and New York State is considering one.Read more: The largest electric school bus fleet in the US just launched in MarylandPhoto: Pixabay on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/30,"Hitachi Energy just launched wireless Spark Prevention Unit indicators that help prevent wildfires by enabling remote monitoring. According to the US Department of Energy, approximately 10% of wildfire ignitions are sparked by faults on electrical infrastructure or electric equipment failure. Hitachi Energy’s new Wireless SPU Indicators allow utilities to monitor the grid remotely, in real time, with automated visual inspection rounds.The SPU monitors the current and thermal load of surge arresters – which protect equipment from surges in the power system – installed in wildfire risk areas. If there’s a thermal overload in the grid, the SPU interrupts the current flow and disconnects the surge arrester, thus preventing any arcing – which is when a circuit becomes overloaded and overheats – sparking, or ejection of hot particles that could potentially start a wildfire.A visual indicator on the SPU lets the utility field crew know that it needs to be replaced. Hundreds of thousands of SPUs installed in some of the world’s most wildfire-prone areas, such as in the United States and Australia, have had a real impact in preventing wildfires. Being able to monitor them remotely is only going to improve wildfire prevention.Read more: How the US can achieve resilient power grids and support EV deploymentPhoto: Pok Rie on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/28,"France and Ireland signed contracts on Friday to advance the Celtic Interconnector, a subsea electricity link to allow the exchange of electricity between the two EU countries. It will be the first interconnector between continental Europe and Ireland. Representatives for Ireland’s electricity grid operator EirGrid and France’s grid operator RTE signed financial and technical agreements for the high-voltage submarine cable. The countries’ respective energy ministers witnessed the signing.European commissioner for energy Kadri Simson said:In the current energy market situation and the need to move away from imports of Russian fossil fuels, European energy infrastructure has become more important than ever. The Celtic Interconnector is of paramount importance as it will end Ireland’s isolation from the Union’s power system and ensure a reliable high-capacity link improving the security of electricity supply and supporting the development of renewables in both Ireland and France.EirGrid and RTE signed €800 million ($827 million) worth of financing agreements with Barclays, BNP Paribas, Danske Bank, and the European Investment Bank.In 2019, the project was awarded a Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) grant worth €530.7 million to support construction works. The CEF program also provided €8.3 million for the Celtic Interconnector’s feasibility study and initial design and pre-consultation.Siemens Energy will build converter stations in both countries, and Paris-based global cable company Nexans will design and install a 575-km-long cable for the project. The cable will run between East Cork, on Ireland’s southern coast, and northwestern France’s Brittany coast and will connect into substations at Knockraha in Ireland and La Martyre in France.The Celtic Interconnector, which is expected to be operational by 2026, will be approximately 600 km (373 miles) long and have a capacity of 700 MW, which is enough to power 450,000 households.

2022/11/28,"The US Interior Department today announced that an oil and gas lease sale for Alaska’s Cook Inlet will take place on December 30 – a concession made to Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) so that he’d vote for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).The Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a final notice of sale today for 958,202 acres off Alaska’s south central coast. The IRA directed BOEM to hold the sale by December 31, 2022.In May, BOEM canceled the Cook Inlet sale, along with two Gulf of Mexico lease sales, citing lack of interest. Congress then directed BOEM to carry out the sale by the end of 2022.In July, Manchin announced that he’d reached an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to vote for the groundbreaking $370 billion IRA climate bill. In order to secure fossil-fuel advocate Manchin’s vote in the Senate, Schumer had to concede to Manchin’s demand that these oil and gas lease sales be resurrected alongside the escalation of clean energy deployment. Manchin said in a statement on July 27:The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types – from hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage – to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible. It is truly all of the above, which means this bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels. It invests heavily in technologies to help us reduce our domestic methane and carbon emissions and also helps decarbonize around the world as we displace dirtier products.President Joe Biden issued an executive order that suspended new oil and gas lease sales in his first week in office. In March 2022, a federal court blocked Biden’s executive order. This is now the second oil and gas lease sale that the Biden administration has had to carry out.On November 22, environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice wrote that there were alternate paths to the Cook Inlet and Gulf of Mexico oil and gas lease sales, and it’s actively campaigning to stop the Cook Inlet sale. Steve Mashuda, managing attorney of Earthjustice’s Oceans program, said:Legal scrutiny of the IRA shows that it does not bind us to fossil-fuel interests to the extent that many might believe.While the IRA does require three offshore lease sales to be held, Interior has the responsibility and the discretion to make the right choices here: It should, for example, decide that any leases be conditioned with measures that protect people and wildlife and that limit greenhouse gases emitted from the resulting industrial activity.It would be better to have no more oil and gas lease sales, but we feel the Cook Inlet sale is not one to get seriously worried about. Earlier in the year, there was very little interest.Watch for another no-interest sale. Even with the price of oil sky high. The reality is oil investors get that fossil fuels are dying - it is just politicians and ideologues that are still pushing it. A lot of fossil fuel lease sales are procedural, and this may also be the case for Cook Inlet. The oil companies are sitting on roughly half of unused US public leases, and they’re not drilling due to lack of access to financing and supply chain shortages. We don’t see either of those things changing anytime soon. And if they do, chances are good that drilling won’t make sense financially, due to renewables becoming ever more inexpensive.Read more: The real reason Joe Manchin is sabotaging the US clean energy planPhoto: “Cook Inlet, Alaska” by LCDRDAN is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/28,"Renewable energy provided almost 23% of electrical generation in the US during the first three quarters of 2022, according to new data released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign.EIA’s “Electric Power Monthly” report, which contains data through September 30, reflects that in the first nine months of 2022, renewable energy sources, including rooftop solar, increased their electrical output by 15.44% compared to the same period a year earlier. Year to date, renewables have provided 22.66% of total US electrical generation, compared to 20.33% a year earlier. For the nine-month period, electrical generation by wind increased by 18.64% and provided 9.75% of total electrical generation. Solar grew by 25.68% and provided 5.01% of electrical output in the US. In addition, generation by hydropower increased by 7.98% and accounted for 6.29% of the total. Geothermal also grew by 6.95%, while electrical generation attributed to the combination of wood and other biomass dropped by 1.12%. Taken together, during the first three-quarters of 2022, renewable energy sources comfortably outproduced both coal and nuclear by 15.52% and 28.25%, respectively. In fact, over the past half decade, the mix of renewables has moved from fourth into second place among electrical generating sources, bumping coal and nuclear down to third and fourth place.However, EIA’s data also suggest that renewable energy’s strong growth this year may slow down during the last third of 2022.In September alone, electrical generation by solar grew by 21% and geothermal increased by 5.1% compared to September 2021. On the other hand, generation by wind dropped by 6.81%, as did hydropower (down 1.14%) and biomass/wood (down 4.57%). Taken together, electrical output by renewables was just 1.45% higher than a year ago, and because electrical generation by all sources increased, renewables’ share in September was nearly unchanged from a year earlier – 19.18% vs. 19.14%.Ken Bossong, executive director of the SUN DAY Campaign, said:For some time now, EIA has been forecasting renewables to provide 22% of US electrical generation in 2022 – up from 20% a year earlier.While they are presently ahead of that level, a slowdown in generation by wind and hydropower during the last quarter of this year could result in renewables falling short of that mark while still exceeding their 2021 record output.Read more: White House announces $13B to modernize the US power gridPhoto: Pexels Free PhotosUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

It’s also Ford’s official charging partner. So it’s not a surprise that solar giant Sunrun got their hands on some sweet new F-150 Lightnings to build up its electrified fleet. The company spokespeople didn’t say how many Lightnings they have, however, or where in the US they’re being deployed.As Sunrun explains in its updated 2021 Impact Report, the solar and storage company has also partnered with Ford to enable Sunrun customers to use their Lightnings as a backup energy source to power their homes when needed. Sunrun is the preferred installer of Ford Intelligent Backup Power, which consists of the 80-amp Ford Charge Station Pro and Home Integration system, which the two companies designed and developed together. When the Lightning is connected to the bidirectional Ford Charge Station Pro, the home charging station can either charge the truck or power the home, assuming the home is properly equipped and the home transfer switch disconnects the home from the grid.In October, Electrek reported that Sunrun also launched a Level 2 home EV charger with Enel X Way, the Enel Group’s global electric mobility business.

2022/11/22,"Swell Energy today announced that it has raised $120 million to grow its virtual power plants (VPPs). Virtual power plants allow clean energy to be quickly added to the grid to address frequency and voltage imbalances, local disruptions, and keep the grid stable.The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund I, LP, and brings Swell’s total equity capitalization to date to $152 million.This series B raise will help Santa Monica-based Swell Energy work toward its goal of 600 MWh of VPPs through the deployment and aggregation of 26,000 energy storage systems at homes and businesses across the US.Swell’s VPP programs help reduce the use of fossil fuel peaker plants by utilities and provide other grid services by integrating solar, energy storage, and electric vehicle charging with the utility to provide a more reliable and cleaner grid.Businesses and homeowners who participate in VPPs pay less for their solar energy generation and storage systems, potentially reducing the risk of a local power outage, and keeping their homes and businesses securely powered through outages.For example, Swell works with multiple California utilities to help expand residential participation in capacity bidding programs. Homeowners with solar and storage support the reliability of their local grids while reserving battery power for personal emergency use. The efforts are part of the California Public Utility Commission’s goals to reduce the state’s load during California Independent System Operator emergency power events.Photo: Swell EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/21,"Quaise Energy is on a mission to prove that deep geothermal drilling could provide more than enough clean energy to meet the world’s needs as we move away from fossil fuels. Matt Houde, cofounder at Quaise Energy, explained its potential at the TEDX Boston Planetary Stewardship Event last week.The aim of the Boston event, which was timed to run at the same time as COP27 in Egypt, was to “spotlight actionable ideas for human activity to achieve a sustainable relationship with the planet’s natural systems,” according to TEDX Boston’s website.Houde, a speaker at TEDX Boston, explained why deep geothermal has so much potential:The total energy content of the heat stored underground exceeds our annual energy demand as a planet by a factor of a billion. So tapping into a fraction of that is more than enough to meet our energy needs for the foreseeable future.But we can’t yet drill deep enough to unlock that energy. Houde continued:If we can get to 10 miles down, we can start to find economic temperatures everywhere. And if we go even deeper, we can get to temperatures where water [pumped to the site] becomes supercritical, [a steam-like phase that will allow] a step change improvement in the power production per well and so cheapen the cost of energy.The deepest hole that’s been drilled to date, the Kola borehole in Russia, is 7.6 miles deep. It took 20 years to complete because conventional equipment like mechanical drill bits break down at those depths. “And the truth is, we’ll need hundreds if not thousands of Kola boreholes if we want to scale geothermal to the capacity that’s needed,” Houde said. He went on to assert that Quaise: [I]s developing technology to blast rock with microwaves to potentially drill the deepest holes on Earth. And no, I’m not stealing a plot device from Star Trek. This technology is real and has been proven in [an MIT] lab.Houde explained the benefits of deep geothermal energy in general. These include being available 24/7, which “can help balance out the intermittent flows of wind and [solar].” Deep geothermal plants also won’t need much land. Houde illustrated this with an artist’s rendition of a future rig next to truck shipping containers (see main photo).Houde also said that deep geothermal is “the perfect energy source to take advantage of the largest workforce in the world, the oil and gas industry.” That industry has “11 million jobs in the US alone, and a skill set that is exactly what’s needed for geothermal to rapidly scale.”Quaise is working to replace conventional drill bits with millimeter wave energy – cousins to the conventional microwaves we heat up our leftovers with. Those millimeter waves literally melt then vaporize the rock to create ever-deeper holes.Scientists developed the general technique at MIT over the last 15 years, and proved that millimeter waves could actually drill a hole in basalt. The gyrotron machine that produces the millimeter wave energy has been used for around 70 years in nuclear fusion research.Quaise’s technique also uses conventional drilling technologies developed by the oil and gas industry. The company will use these to drill down through surface layers – what they were optimized for – to basement rock – which millimeter waves can easily power through. Houde explained that millimeter waves “are ideal for the hard, hot, crystalline rock deep down that conventional drilling struggles with.” They’re not as efficient in the softer rock closer to the surface, but “those are the same formations that conventional drilling excels at.” That’s why Quaise applies a hybrid approach to the problem.There are still several challenges that Quaise has to tackle in order to scale its technology, including a better understanding of rock properties at great depths. Further, Houde said, “we need to advance the supply chain for gyrotrons” and the waveguides that carry their energy downhole. That equipment is currently optimized for specialized one-off projects in fusion research. For deep geothermal applications, they must be produced in quantity and be robust and reliable in a field environment.There are also engineering challenges that must be addressed. Houde said: Chief among them is, how do we ensure full removal of the ash [created by the process] and transport that ash up the borehole over long distances?What these articles don't often discuss is that you need heat-transfer area as well as a temperature differential. Just like a pot of water on a hot stove, the water doesn't immediately become hot when the pot touches the stove. It takes a while, often quite a while, even though the flame is much higher than the boiling point of water. That's with a few liters of water. Geothermal will require millions of liters of water per day, and somehow we'll have to provide hundreds or thousands of square meters of contact area between water and hot rocks. Doing that 10 miles underground is not easy.Also, rock is a pretty good insulator. The rock may be very hot the moment you begin circulating water. But as the water heats up, it cools the surfaces it is in contact with, and heat needs to transfer some substantial distance through solid rock to replace the energy that is lost. Under steady-state operating conditions, the temperature that can be maintained may be substantially less than what is measured under static conditions.In the MIT lab, engineers drilled a hole in basalt with a 1:1 aspect ratio – 2 inches deep by 2 inches in diameter. Quaise built upon MIT’s results by scaling up the power density of the microwave beam and the depth of the hole by a factor of 10 to achieve a 10:1 aspect ratio. The company is now building the first field-deployable prototype millimeter-wave drilling rigs.Houde said:Our current plan is to drill the first holes in the field in the next few years. And while we continue to advance the technology to drill deeper, we will also explore our first commercial geothermal projects in shallower settings.Image: Hector Vargas/Quaise EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/18,"The Biden administration, through the US Department of Energy (DOE), today announced that applications are now open to states, tribes, and utilities to tap into $13 billion in new financing opportunities for the expansion and modernization of the US power grid.The Grid Resilience Innovative Partnership (GRIP) program and the Transmission Facilitation Program are funded by the Biden administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Together, the two programs represent the largest single direct federal investment in critical transmission and distribution infrastructure. It’s also one of the first down payments on a more than $20 billion investment under the Biden administration’s Building a Better Grid Initiative. The White House also announced a $2.3 billion program that funds grid resilience investments by states and tribes to reduce impacts due to extreme weather and natural disasters.According to the DOE, independent estimates show that the US needs to expand electricity transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and may even need to triple current capacity by 2050 to accommodate a rapidly increasing supply of clean energy and meet growing power demand for EVs and electric home heating, as well as reduce power outages from severe weather due to climate change.If they want to build a better grid, they need to reform the permitting process.  Maine recently killed a transmission line that would bring Canadian hydropower south into New England.  New transmission capabilities are desperately needed to support the proposed renewables.According to UtilityDive, ""With a Senate permitting law now in doubt, FERC reform of planning factors like who benefits, who builds, who pays, and who does oversight is urgently needed to resolve impediments to development.""US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said:With nearly 70% of the nation’s grid more than 25 years old, the President’s agenda is making historic investments that will strengthen the nation’s transmission grid to drive down energy costs, generate good-paying jobs, and help keep the lights on during extreme weather events.Read more: Without a grid upgrade, US electrification can’t go forward. This company is helping to fix itI like to think of the journey to electrification within the context of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. We can’t “self-actualize” – become fully net zero – if we don’t have our “physiological and safety” needs met – fix the power grid. Having a stable and upgraded grid is the very foundation of electrification. Unless we all go off-grid, it’s simply not possible to move up the “hierarchy.” So this White House announcement is great news. There are some very innovative companies working hard to update the grid, and hopefully states and utilities will tap into their knowledge. It’s exciting.",solar

Electrek asked Enel where the factory would be located, and Giovanni Bertolino, head of 3Sun USA, Enel, replied:Enel is currently evaluating prospective sites for the facility, taking into consideration factors like land availability, the presence of a skilled workforce, connections to transportation networks, and tax and incentive structures. We plan to make a final site selection by the end of 2022 and anticipate the facility would start production at partial capacity by the end of 2024, with full capacity in 2025.Up to 1,500 new jobs will be created as a result of this manufacturing push.

Enel intends to replicate the gigafactory in the US to produce bifacial heterojunction PV cells that capture more sunlight, as the cells respond to light on both the front and rear surfaces.Fewer than five large-scale solar module manufacturing facilities (over 1 GW) are currently operating in the US, while annual US solar PV installations are projected to grow from 16 GW in 2022 to 41 GW by the end of 2025, according to the SEIA and Wood Mackenzie.Read more: Now that the US climate bill is law, here’s how states can quit fossil fuelsPhoto: Enel North America",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/11/16,"In just two years, Northern European companies have taken wooden wind turbines from prototype to commercialization. Now Finnish renewable product maker Stora Enso, one of the largest private forest owners in the world, is partnering up with German start-up Voodin Blade Technology to make sustainable wooden wind turbine blades.The two companies are currently producing a 20-meter (66-foot) blade and are planning to make an 80-meter (262-foot) blade. The 20-meter blade will be installed on a 0.5-megawatt turbine near Warburg, Germany, by the end of 2022.By developing blades with sustainable wood – laminated veneer lumber (LVL) – Stora Enso and Voodin Blades can make the blades lighter and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.LVL is a mass timber product that has a high-load-bearing capacity, and Stora Enso says it can easily support large-scale rotary blades. Unlike steel and concrete, LVL is relatively lightweight to transport on-site without heavy-duty equipment. LVL is also renewable with a minimal carbon footprint. In addition to its collaboration with Voodin Blades, Stora Enso recently announced a partnership with Swedish wood technology company Modvion to establish wood as the material of choice for wind turbine towers.Modvion erected the first wooden wind turbine tower on an island outside Gothenburg, Sweden, in May 2020.Danish wind turbine maker Vestas invested in Modvion in February 2021, and in October 2022, Modvion unveiled a deal with global developer RES. Recharge notes of the latter deal:The agreement foresees supply of about 20 towers annually for 10 years from 2026, which could be worth around SKr 4 billion ($353 million).Because an LVL tower is modular and wood is lighter than steel, it’s also easier to transport, so towers can be built taller, which means access to stronger winds.Photos: ModvionUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

The company asserts that adopting its geothermal system will reduce a household’s energy expenses by 47% annually, and that it can increase a home’s resale value by up to 7.1%. There are also tax credits – 30% – and up-front rebates after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.When Electrek spoke with Dandelion Energy president Kathy Hannun in September 2020, she explained that Dandelion expands when utilities want to actively work with the company, and it also moves into places where they can easily send their drilling crews. In October, the company reached its 1,000th installation.Dandelion Energy expanded residential geothermal to Vermont in May 2021. Yet when Electrek checked Dandelion’s website to see which states it’s currently serving, it now only lists New York State, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. A reliable source tells us that Dandelion left Vermont this fall.We asked a representative at Green Mountain Power about Dandelion’s departure from the Green Mountain state, and they replied: GMP offers rebates to help customers use geothermal, and are excited to keep helping customers cut carbon and costs by electrifying their home heating. We are also supporting this important change through heat pump rebates and other customized solutions for customers. We are excited to keep partnering with businesses on clean heating solutions like geothermal.We’ve asked Dandelion Energy’s spokesperson why the company left Vermont and are waiting to hear back. We will update this story when we do.If you live in Massachusetts, New York State, or Connecticut, and you’d like to learn whether Dandelion Geothermal would work for your home, please click here.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/14,"Hywind Tampen, the world’s largest and Norway’s first floating offshore wind farm, powered up yesterday for the first time.Norwegian power giant Equinor has developed and will operate Hywind Tampen, which consists of 11 8.6 megawatt (MW) turbines. It’s located around 140 km (87 miles) off the Norwegian coast in a water depth of between 260 and 300 meters (853 to 984 feet).Seven of the wind farm’s turbines are scheduled to come online this year. The last four turbines were assembled this autumn and will be installed in 2023, when weather allows. It will also be the world’s first floating wind farm to power offshore oil and gas platforms. The 94.6 MW, €488 million ($522 million) project will provide electricity for the Snorre and Gullfaks oil and gas fields in the Norwegian North Sea. It’s expected to meet around 35% of the five platforms’ annual power needs.Equinor asserts that Hywind Tampen will reduce the need for locally produced gas power and “thus reduce annual emissions from the fields by about 200,000 tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to emissions from 100,000 vehicles.”Norway is the world leader in electric cars per capita. It’s planning planning 30 GW of offshore wind by 2040. But the Scandinavian country is also Western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer. The petroleum sector makes up around 40% of Norway’s exports and 14% of its gross domestic product.The Norwegian government says it will work to cut the country’s net emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. That’s aligned with EU targets. But unlike its EU neighbors, Norway says its move to clean energy will be gradual and that it has no intention of giving up oil and gas exploration.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/14,"US president Joe Biden and China’s president Xi Jinping today agreed to renew climate talks, ending months of silence due to geopolitical tensions. Here’s why that’s a major breakthrough.The US and China stopped talking about climate change in August after US representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) visited Taiwan. There has also been a lot of strain between the two countries over trade and security issues. Biden and Xi met for more than three hours today ahead of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. At the conclusion of  their meeting, they announced that the two countries would, as Biden said, make an effort to “manage our differences.”After the meeting, the White House released a statement:President Biden underscored that the United States and China must work together to address transnational challenges – such as climate change, global macroeconomic stability including debt relief, health security, and global food security – because that is what the international community expects. The two leaders agreed to empower key senior officials to maintain communication and deepen constructive efforts on these and other issues.Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an emailed statement:This unequivocal signal from the two largest economies to work together to address the climate crisis is more than welcome, it’s essential. The world needs every country at the table, striving to deliver on solutions that curtail the use of fossil fuels and sharply accelerate investment in clean energy, as well as take steps to reform international financing institutions so they pump more resources into climate action and to address crushing debt in developing countries impeding their move to clean economies.The window to hold global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees – and avoid the worst damage from climate change – is closing fast. We urge the world’s two major economies to act with speed and conviction to meet the challenge of the moment.This is a major breakthrough because China and the US are the two largest sources of fossil fuel emissions in the world.US climate envoy John Kerry and China’s climate envoy Xie Shenhua have not been able to formally negotiate at COP27 in Egypt. A restart between the US and China comes at a pivotal time when nearly 200 countries are working at COP27 to fight climate change, and specifically, discussing whether industrialized countries should compensate developing countries for climate-catastrophe damage.It’s a big deal because there is no way the world can keep global temperature rise to 1.5C without the US and China cooperating with each other.Read more: A city in China is planning an offshore wind farm so big that it could power all of Norway Photo: FlickrUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/11,"The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) – the largest utility in the United States – will launch a first-of-its-kind pilot program to determine whether closed coal ash storage sites can host utility-scale solar.Pending environmental reviews and regulatory approval, the $216 million pilot project would explore repurposing a capped 300-acre coal ash storage pit into a 100 megawatt (MW) solar farm at the Shawnee Fossil Plant, around 10 miles northwest of Paducah, Kentucky.The solar farm, which TVA officials say should be operational within two years, will connect to the transmission infrastructure already in place at the 1,696-acre coal plant.According to the News & Observer:Officials say the model could ultimately be used at other closed Tennessee Valley Authority coal ash sites, with a capacity of 1,000 MW combined if they were to pursue that expansion.TVA is a federally owned utility corporation that provides electricity for business customers and local power distributors that serve nearly 10 million people in parts of seven southeastern states. TVA receives no taxpayer funding, deriving virtually all of its revenues from electricity sales. It also manages nearly 300,000 acres of land that could potentially be tapped to host solar.TVA’s latest solar announcement is welcome. The company has less ambitious emissions reduction goals than the Biden administration’s aim for electricity to be net zero by 2030. TVA’s plan is “70% reduction of carbon by 2030; developing a path to an approximate 80% reduction by 2035; and… net-zero by 2050.”The utility does have plans to add 10,000 MW of solar by 2035, and it’s also developing small module nuclear reactors. It issued a 5,000-MW clean energy request for proposals in July. But the TVA is also considering switching two aging coal plants in Tennessee to natural gas, when it ought to use the sites to host renewables instead, as it plans to do with Shawnee’s coal ash site. As a federally owned corporation, as we’ve said before, TVA can and should do better.Read more: Watch the TVA blow up its oldest coal-fired plant (and they want to replace it with natural gas)Photo: Shawnee Fossil Plant/TVAUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/11,"The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the nonprofit trade association of the US solar industry, just flagged a proposed change to the 2024 International Building Code by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that would do more harm than good to the US solar industry.November 11: Good news! US solar just averted a major crisis. The International Code Council’s members – that’s who sets US building codes – have approved two compromise proposals that designate solar and storage projects as Risk Category 2 infrastructure, rather than Risk Category 4, which is typically reserved for emergency services buildings and structures and would have made solar growth prohibitive.SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said:We are grateful to the ICC voters for recognizing how impractical it was to include solar and storage projects as Risk Category 4. This decision is undoubtedly a victory for clean energy deployment in the United States after more than 300 companies signed a letter urging approval of SEIA’s compromise proposals.The extreme and overly burdensome code measures that would have been required under the FEMA proposal could have stifled clean energy growth without improving grid resilience. The resulting effect, whether intended or not, would have been a disastrous decrease in renewable energy projects while we aggressively strive to meet important climate goals.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA, published a blog yesterday that draws attention to the potential damage this misguided code change would inflict on solar, battery storage, and wind. She writes:This misguided proposal by FEMA would raise the structural “risk category” for ground-mounted solar installations, energy storage systems, and wind turbines to the highest level possible, on par with requirements for hospitals and fire stations.Ross Hopper argues that the current codes ain’t broke, so don’t fix them:This is a gross overreach. There is no extended record of irreparable damage to solar arrays from higher seismic, wind or snow loads, and there is no justification for these overly burdensome codes.There are already strict requirements in place that make solar panels sufficiently resilient against high winds and snow loads. Ross Hopper cites the resilience of Florida’s Babcock Ranch development, a “solar-powered town” 12 miles outside of Fort Myers that kept its power, internet, and water supply despite the devastating Hurricane Ian passing over it. CNN writes:“We have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,” Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. “We have water, electricity, internet — and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.”The proposed code changes would result in unnecessary increased costs for solar projects, as developers would need to procure more materials such as steel, concrete, and higher rated solar PV modules to comply with stricter new requirements. The SEIA fears that this would make solar growth cost prohibitive:This much is certain: The proposed code change is unworkable. In its current form, S76-22 would cause a drastic spike in construction costs, forcing the cancellation of dozens of gigawatts of clean energy projects that support thousands of jobs and that the United States is relying on to boost grid resiliency.As for wind power, the SEIA points out in its fact sheet that S76-22’s “unneeded load increases constrain the size & height of wind turbines, reducing power output.”Proponents of S76-22 believe that applying higher seismic, wind, and snow loads to structural calculations would lead to greater grid reliability.But grid reliability is under the scope of influence of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the SEIA says those two agencies weren’t even consulted about FEMA’s code change proposals.So, the SEIA has opted for political diplomacy: It’s calling for compromise solutions that would allow solar projects to be designated as Risk Category 2:While it still increases the structural requirements for solar facilities, this framework takes a reasonable approach and will help ensure more projects get built.I met up with a solar industry executive on September 8 for coffee here in Vermont. They were headed to FERC’s “New England Winter Gas-Electric Forum” in Burlington and said that no clean energy industry representatives were included on the panel. I found that extremely surprising, seeing how the Biden administration is pushing hard for the move to electrification, and FERC is a federal government agency. The executive explained that government agencies can sometimes lag behind in getting on the bandwagon on newly implemented initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction Act. That situation seems to be the case here with the stricter FEMA building code proposal. It falls into the “well intended, poorly executed” category, and SEIA is right: It needs to either be amended or scrapped. The United States can’t afford to lose momentum under any circumstances in its move to clean energy.Read more: This modular off-grid solar EV charger can be installed in just four hoursPhoto: US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh at First SolarUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/10,"Dallas-based Hover Energy, which makes wind-powered microgrids with solar and storage, is going to begin commercial-scale production in January 2023. And potential customers can feel confident about the resiliency of the company’s rooftop-mounted microgrids – one survived 105 mph winds during Hurricane Ian.Hover Energy’s Wind-Powered Microgrid is a combination of Hover’s patented 36kW wind turbine and solar. It’s installed as an array on the windward edge of a building’s roof. The aerodynamic design uses the building as a sail and delivers commercial-scale power. A direct drive generator reduces friction and allows for low cut in speeds. The solar PV array installed in the center of the roof acts as a complement to the turbine array, generating power during daylight hours. The energy captured by both sources is directed to Hover’s Integrated Energy Management System where the energy is combined, cleaned, and converted into three-phase AC power that is directly linked to the building management system. Excess power, such as power generated at night, can be stored in batteries. Hover Energy says tests have proved that its microgrid can offset 100% of a building’s power consumption in most cases. Time of use remains the only challenging factor, as with any microgrid.The company partnered with global electronics manufacturer Jabil in 2017 in order to test its rooftop array system. Hover Energy installed its first array system on Jabil’s building in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 2021, to test it out.Here’s Hover Energy’s microgrid on Jabil’s roof in the face of Hurricane Ian’s gales:This incredible closed-circuit video footage highlights our turbine being tested in 50 mph winds and withstanding the powerful forces of Hurricane Ian, which had wind speeds recorded up to 105 mph. #energysecurity #hoverenergy pic.twitter.com/1vabwHXpZL Hover’s CEO Chris Griffin said:There is constant experimentation in the renewable energy sector, but only a small percentage of these ideas make it through testing and are made available to the market at scale. Hover spent nearly 8 years in R&D, followed by two years of rigorous testing at our installation site in St. Petersburg, Florida. We know of no other wind technology that has survived two hurricanes (i.e. Ian) and is still functioning properly. Fully confident in our technology, we are thrilled to kick off scale manufacturing, which will take place in Memphis, Tennessee.Read more: Could rooftop wind give rooftop solar a run for its money?Photo: Hover EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/09,"Washington State will require new homes and apartments to have heat pumps installed from July 2023, the State Building Code Council ruled on Friday.In April, the Council passed a measure requiring that heat pumps be installed in new commercial buildings and large apartment buildings.So this heat pump mandate now covers all residential dwellings, and that makes Washington State a leader in having some of the most robust building codes in the US to require electrical appliances and thus reduce emisisons.In a May 2019 policy brief, Governor Jay Inslee (D-WA) wrote:While statewide emissions have grown 10% overall since 1990, building emissions have jumped by 50%, more than any other source in our state.As of 2020, 56% of Washington residents used electricity for heating, and 37% of residents used natural gas or bottled, tank, or LP gas.The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act provides $4.5 billion of direct rebates for heat pumps for low and moderate income households under the High Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHRA). A low-income household will receive a rebate that covers the full cost of a heat pump installation for space heating, up to $8,000.And under the The Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit, “Households can deduct 30% of the costs for buying and installing a heat pump water heater or heat pump for their space heating and cooling, up to $2,000,” according to Rewiring America.Interesting. Next spring we are replacing our 25 year old furnace and air conditioner, and I am strongly leaning towards getting a heat pump as a replacement. We live in mid Ohio, so I am a little concerned about the cold winters.An air-source electric heat pump uses refrigerant to pull heat from cold outdoor air and transfers it indoors when it’s cold, and it pulls heat out of the warm indoor air to cool your home when it’s hot outside.New homes in Washington State are going to save money up front due to rebates and tax credits and they will also save money in the long run, as heat pumps reduce electricity consumption by up to 50%. Emissions will be cut as well.Read more: How US-made heat pumps could help weaken Russian power over EuropeUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/08,"Global sustainable energy giants Hitachi Energy and Equinor today announced that they have signed a strategic collaboration agreement. They’re going to join forces on global electrification, renewable power generation, and low-carbon initiatives.The two companies have worked together over many decades. Hitachi Energy provided Equinor with power grid solutions and technologies on several projects, such as the UK’s Dogger Bank A, B and C, which will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm on completion.Now Hitachi and Equinor are taking their working relationship to the next level. They’ll initially focus on jointly developing standardized base designs to be applied for high-voltage direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transmission systems to connect offshore wind farms and Equinor production facilities to mainland power grids.Geir Tungesvik, executive vice president for projects, drilling and procurement at Equinor, said:Hitachi Energy has been a reliable supplier to Equinor for many years. This strategic collaboration agreement is a signal of joint ambitions to increase our competitiveness in the ongoing energy transition. Standardization of technical solutions will be a key to succeed, and we look forward to improving together with Hitachi Energy.Hitachi’s spokesperson told Electrek that it will provide its products and services to all existing and new Equinor customers in the countries in which Equinor is active, which are primarily Norway, the UK, Poland, the US, Korea, Japan, and Brazil.In October, Electrek reported that Hitachi Energy announced that it would spend more than $37 million to expand and upgrade its power transformer factory in South Boston, Virginia. That decision was in response to soaring demand for power transformers from utility companies that are scrambling to accommodate the renewable energy boom after the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/08,"The Japanese government is discussing the possibility of remotely controlling privately owned ACs and water heaters in order to avoid power outages as the country switches to renewables.Nihon Keizai Shimbun reports that the Japanese government’s Energy Conservation Subcommittee of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is considering measures to encourage the adoption of air conditioners and water heaters that can be adjusted remotely – so that the government itself can turn them up or down when it deems necessary. According to the article’s English translation, the Japanese government states:As the introduction of renewable energy, whose output is affected by the climate, is progressing, we aim to stabilize the supply and demand of electricity.Power outages can occur if demand and supply do not always match. There is a need to expand the introduction of renewable energy toward decarbonization, but output fluctuates according to the climate and is difficult to adjust. Even if renewable energy cannot generate electricity, there is a limit to what can be done with thermal power generation alone, and it will be necessary to reduce power consumption and supplement it with storage batteries.In Japan, which is cold in the winter and hot and humid in the summer, air conditioners account for around 30% of household power consumption. And, this program wouldn’t be hard to roll out, as Japanese HVAC and water heater units generally come with smart controls anyway.But before you think that this sounds like governmental overreach, the Japan Times points out that “the committee is currently working under the concept that the government would only be able to turn down AC units if their individual owners have agreed, in advance, to grant that authority.”Imagine if this idea was floated in Texas. LOL. (Just kidding.)The Japanese government’s idea is misguided, but not because of wanting to remotely control people’s HVAC systems who voluntarily sign up to have them controlled.Here in Vermont, we’ve got the Bring Your Own Device program, where we can sign up to allow Green Mountain Power to tap into our home batteries in order to stabilize the grid. (I’ll sign up once I get my solar system in place.)The Japanese government’s idea is misguided because it just seems unnecessary. What I find baffling is that the government, which has a target of 53 GW of solar PV capacity by 2030 and a target of meeting 10% of total domestic primary energy demand with solar by 2050, wants to protect the grid with this “solution” as it (not very rapidly) rolls over to renewables. Japan should always pair solar with storage and work to upgrade its eastern and western grids as quickly as possible to avoid power outages. The government’s quote above makes storage sound like it’s a last resort, but it should go hand in hand with solar. If you live in Japan and you know why this latest program idea is a better solution rather than battery deployment, let me know down in the comments below.Photo: “File:エアコン 2009 (4268265358).jpg” by Tamago Moffle is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.Read more: EU renewables plan spotlights Japan’s weak targets as G7 energy meeting kicks offUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/08,"In France, solar just got a huge boost from new legislation approved through the Senate this week that will require all parking lots with spaces for at least 80 vehicles – both existing and new – to be covered by solar panels.The new provisions are part of French president Emmanuel Macron’s large-scale plan to heavily invest in renewables, which aims to multiply by 10 the amount of solar energy produced in the country, and to double the power from land-based wind farms. Starting July 1, 2023, smaller carparks that have between 80 and 400 spaces will have five years to be in compliance with the new measures. Carparks with more than 400 spaces have a shorter timeline: They will need to comply with the new measures within three years of this date, and at least half of the surface area of the parking lot will need to be covered in solar panels. According to the government, this plan, which particularly targets large parking areas around commercial centers and train stations, could generate up to 11 gigawatts, which is the equivalent of 10 nuclear reactors, powering millions of homes. Public Sénat writes that stipulations were put into place excluding parking lots for trucks carrying heavy goods or parking areas in historic or protected areas, to avoid “distorting” them, according to an amendment to the bill. While it’s unclear, future iterations of the bill will likely detail parking lots that would be excluded, in addition to how this plan will be funded and what the penalties would be for lack of compliance.Other measures on the table include building large solar farms on vacant land found alongside highways and railways, as well as on agricultural lands where feasible. Macron has said that any bill passed would need to guarantee money that ensures local communities directly benefit from the energy shift. France’s national rail service SNCF also plans to install some 190,000 square meters of solar panels in 156 stations throughout the country by 2025 and 1.1 million square meters by 2030, all with the aim to reduce energy consumption by 25%.The government also plans to build around 50 additional wind farms likes the one offshore Saint-Nazaire by 2050 in France. Measures are in place to reduce delays in building offshore wind farms from 10-12 years down to six years, and large solar farms from six years to three years. This summer, the French government solidified two zones for offshore wind farms off the coast of the Atlantic following a massive public debate involving 15,000 participants, with environmental protection being the biggest concern. The first wind farm is planned to be sited off the island of Oléron, more than 35 km off the coast of La Rochelle, with a capacity of around 1,000 MW. The second wind farm will likely be located farther out at sea, with both wind farms together producing enough electricity for 1.6 million people.",solar
2022/11/07,"Nearly a quarter of the 200,568 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired capacity currently operating in the US has reported plans to retire by the end of 2029, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported today.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.The EIA reports that 23% of coal is being retired due to “continued competition from natural gas and renewable resources” and higher operating costs associated with older, less efficient coal-fired generators. The EIA writes:In addition, some coal-fired power plants must comply with [EPA] regulations limiting the discharge of wastewater by 2028, which would require additional capital investment, likely influencing the decision to retire some of these coal-fired units.An average of 9,450 MW of US coal-fired capacity was retired annually between 2012 and 2021. In 2022, US coal retirements are projected to total 11,778 MW.From next year, the largest amount of capacity retirement the EIA expects over the next seven years is 9,842 MW in 2028.Michigan, Texas, Indiana, and Tennessee have the most coal-fired capacity announced to retire through 2029, accounting for a combined 42%.Crucially, there are no plans reported to build new US coal-fired capacity in the future. And globally, as London-based environmental think tank Ember pointed out on Friday:It is likely that more countries will add their name to the “No New Coal” pledge during COP27, in part because China’s financing is no longer available.Data released today by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reflects that 107 units of “high-probability” additions by natural gas by September 2025 are anticipated, totaling 17,062 MW of capacity. However, there will also be “retirements” of 130 units totaling 17,489 MW. If that happens, then installed natural gas capacity would decline, and that could be an indication that natural gas generating capacity has now peaked, according to the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong, who reviewed FERC’s data. By September 2025, FERC anticipates renewable energy growth from a bit over a quarter today to nearly one-third (32.37%) of the US’s total available installed generating capacity. Utility-scale solar and wind generating capacity would expand from 17.37% of domestic capacity today to almost one-quarter (23.24%) by September 2025, with solar and wind accounting for 11.23% and 12.01%, respectively.Bossong said:FERC’s latest data may be the most dramatic published thus far this year. A sharp increase in FERC’s three-year forecast for wind and solar within just the last month coupled with an apparent peaking of natural gas seem to confirm that the nation has finally turned a corner on its transition to sustainable energy sources.Read more: A former West Virginia coal ash landfill is going to be replaced by a solar farmPhoto: PNAS",solar

2022/11/06,"Scientists have used advanced computing tech and AI to design a clear window coating that could lower the temperature inside buildings, thus saving a whole lot of cooling energy.Cooling accounts for about 15% of global energy consumption, and it’s only going to get hotter, especially in more tropical climates.The sun’s ultraviolet and near-infrared light are the parts of the solar spectrum that pass through window glass to heat an enclosed room. If window coating blocked that light and if that coating radiated “heat from the window’s surface at a wavelength that passes through the atmosphere into outer space,” energy use from cooling could be reduced, according to the American Chemical Society.That, along with not impeding visibility through a window, is kind of a big ask. But researchers at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and Kyung Hee University in Seoul tackled it anyway.According to their new paper, “High-Performance Transparent Radiative Cooler Designed by Quantum Computing” in ACS Energy Letters, a scientific journal published by the American Chemical Society, their design of a clear window coating, or “transparent radiative cooler” (TRC), was a success.Here’s what they did and how it went:The team constructed computer models of TRCs consisting of alternating thin layers of common materials like silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide or titanium dioxide on a glass base, topped with a film of polydimethylsiloxane. They optimized the type, order, and combination of layers using an iterative approach guided by machine learning and quantum computing, which stores data using subatomic particles. This computing method carries out optimization faster and better than conventional computers because it can efficiently test all possible combinations in a fraction of a second. This produced a coating design that, when fabricated, beat the performance of conventionally designed TRCs in addition to one of the best commercial heat-reduction glasses on the market.The researchers wrote that the average annual energy saving over surveyed US cities – see the bar graphs above – is 50 MJ/m2 if the TRC is used on windows. In cities with hot, dry weather, such as Phoenix, the TRC can potentially save around 86.3 MJ/m2 per year, or 31.1% of the cooling energy consumption when conventional windows are used. They also did the same calculations for selected major cities worldwide. While buildings in all cities could benefit, those in tropical regions would get a greater cooling impact.The researchers say that the clear window coating can be used not only on building windows but on car windows too.There’s no indication of commercial scaling in the study, but the researchers write that the film “can be potentially scaled up for practical applications because their fabrication can be achieved using state-of-the-art deposition techniques.” In other words, that’s the process of creating and depositing thin film coatings onto a substrate material. It’s an important manufacturing step.You can read the whole study here.Read more: Windows giant Andersen leads $30M funding of solar window companyPhoto: “Morning Glow ~ Explore #420” by Theen … is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/04,"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) analyzed roughly 2.8 million residential rooftop solar systems installed through 2021, representing 86% of all US systems. Here are the latest trends based on income among American solar adopters, according to the data.LBL’s annual report, “Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographic Trends,” looks at solar adopter trends in such categories as household income, education, occupation, age, and location within a “disadvantaged community.”As a whole, researchers found that, compared to the broader population, solar adopters tend to identify as non-Hispanic white, be primarily English-speaking, have higher education levels, be middle-aged, work in business and finance-related occupations, and live in higher-value homes.The latest findings show that solar households span all income levels. For example, around one-third of all households that installed solar in 2021 had incomes between $50,000 and $100,000. About half were above that range, and 15% of adopters were below that range. The largest percentage fell into the $75-100,000 range, and the $50-75,000 range was the second-highest percentage.Median solar adopter annual income for 2021 was about $110,000 in 2021, compared to the US median annual income of about $63,000 for all households and $79,000 per year for all owner-occupied households.The data also looks at “disadvantaged communities.” The US Department of Energy developed a designation for disadvantaged communities (DACs) that considers a diverse set of criteria related to energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, socioeconomic vulnerabilities, and fossil fuel dependence. The percentage of residential solar installations in DACs more than doubled from 5% in 2010 to 11% in 2021. But DACs make up 18% of US households as a whole, so they still remain underrepresented relative to their share of the population.Read more: Could rooftop wind give rooftop solar a run for its money?Photo: SunPowerUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/03,"Since 2015, power lines have caused six of California’s 20 most destructive wildfires. Dryad Networks’ solar-powered sensor can detect a fire within 60 minutes, and its IoT network provides accurate location data. Electrek spoke to Carsten Brinkschulte, cofounder and CEO of Dryad Networks, about how utilities can strengthen their wildfire mitigation strategies and how solar is playing a part in forest protection.Electrek: How does Dryad Networks’ solar-powered wildfire detection system work, and what is its purpose?Carsten Brinkschulte: As humans, we are responsible for about 80% of wildfires. That means it’s our responsibility to stop them.Wildfires cause up to 20% of global CO2 emissions – the same amount that all traffic (cars, airplanes, and ships combined) puts into the air. Wildfires cause more than $140 billion of economic losses each year and have a devastating impact on biodiversity, with more than 3 billion animals killed annually.Within a forest, you can’t confidently rely on a mobile network operator’s coverage, so we’re installing our own wireless network infrastructure. A key innovation of our system is a solar-powered “mesh network architecture” that enables large-scale, off-grid deployments and overcomes problems with limited network coverage.By taking advantage of the latest Internet of Things (IoT) developments, solar-powered sensors, and “mesh gateways,” Dryad can build a network across even the most remote forest. With inbuilt artificial intelligence, our sensors are placed directly into forests to monitor air composition and can “smell” a fire at its smoldering phase.The sensors then send an alert signal over our large-scale IoT mesh network architecture. Data is collected and monitored at our cloud monitoring platform, carrying ultra-early alerts of wildfires to the authorities and pinpointing the location within 60 minutes – after which it is more likely to get out of control.Electrek: You’re currently working with US utilities such as California’s PG&E. Why are utilities deploying your product?Carsten Brinkschulte: In the US, extreme weather can sometimes create wildfires by blowing trees into power lines. With wildfires, a utility must weather a disaster through coordinated emergency response and prevent the disaster from occurring in the first place. Therefore, the stakes are high, and a utility’s responsibilities for safety and damage control are complex and far-reaching.Carefully overseeing infrastructure in rural areas and over hundreds of thousands of kilometers is a monumental task. If a utility starts a wildfire, it faces potential regulatory action, enormous settlements, and even criminal prosecution. The rise of extreme wildfires therefore creates a whole host of legal, regulatory, financial, business, and reputational risks for utilities.To overcome this existential threat, utilities are prioritizing investments in emerging technologies that help them monitor these threats and control them before they get out of control. Utilities are deploying Dryad’s “ultra-early” wildfire detection technology to do so.Dryad is working with PG&E to demonstrate its Silvanet large-scale IoT network solution for early wildfire detection in Northern California. The Silvanet network includes asset-mounted sensors, a mesh network utilizing LoRaWAN – the leading open standard for long-range radio IoT networks – forcommunications, and a cloud-based data analysis dashboard.Electrek: Which other utilities are you currently working with, and how and whereis your product being deployed?Carsten Brinkschulte: We are working with several other utility companies globally, and we have several proofs of concept under way in Southern Europe.Electrek: Why are current solutions for wildfire detection, such as cameras, satellites, spotters, no longer sufficient?Carsten Brinkschulte: Existing systems that aim to tackle wildfires typically rely on satellites or cameras placed in the forest. However, these systems can take hours or even days to detect a fire as they cannot “see” what’s happening under a tree canopy, which is where wildfires first start. These optical systems also have limited use at night.In contrast, we can leave our sensors deployed in forests, under tree canopies, for up to 10 years. Our technology accounts for forest canopy densities, and it can operate through the night – ensuring deployment and reliability in sparsely populated regions and difficult-to-reach forests.As cameras and satellites have a slower response time, by the time firefighters arrive at the scene, the fire has often grown too large and can no longer be contained. Dryad aims to detect wildfires within the first 60 minutes, enabling firefighters to extinguish the fire before it spreads out of control.Read more: EVs are not a problem during California fire season, they’re the friggin’ solutionTelecoms tech veteran and serial entrepreneur Carsten Brinkschulte is cofounder and CEO of impact tech startup Dryad Networks. The firm’s large-scale IoT network for the ultra-early detection of wildfires is working to help save the world’s forests and fight climate change.Carsten’s 20 years in mobile network infrastructure includes three successful exits: Core Network Dynamics (acquired by Twilio), Movirtu (acquired by Blackberry), and Synchronica (acquired by DAT Group).",solar
2022/11/03,"The UK’s onshore and offshore wind farms generated more than 20 gigawatts (GW) for the first time yesterday, setting a new record, according to National Grid ESO. Renewables trade association RenewableUK reports today that it’s the second wind energy generation record to be set within the space of a week.UK wind generation set the record during the half-hour period from noon to 12:30 p.m., when it reached 20,896 megawatts (MW) – providing an impressive 53% of the UK’s electricity.And in more good news, National Grid ESO reported that yesterday, wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, and storage – all low emissions sources – provided 70% of the UK’s electricity overall.Yesterday’s wind generation record broke the previous record set just a week earlier, on October 26 between 11:30 a.m. and noon, when it reached 19,936 GW.It’s welcome news as the UK heads into winter and faces a natural gas supply crunch following Russia’s supply cut following its invasion of Ukraine.RenewableUK’s chief executive Dan McGrail said:Generating more than 20 GW of electricity for the first time represents a new milestone for wind energy in Britain. The fact that we’ve smashed the last record within the space of a week shows that wind is consistently generating vast amounts of clean power and becoming the backbone of our modern energy system.This benefits hard-pressed bill payers too, because wind has become the UK’s cheapest source of new power. It’s also strengthening our energy security at a time when generating our own electricity from home-grown sources has become vitally important.Although the latest statistics reflect a new electricity generation record, the highest percentage of electricity generated from wind in a half-hour period in the UK is 64% on January 29, 2022.Read more: Check out London’s new electric tram-buses that charge in only 10 minutesPhoto: “Early Morning Cornwall” by Tony Armstrong-Sly is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/02,"Halting offshore drilling expansion, along with the phase-down of existing production of fossil fuels as clean energy is adopted, would deliver up to 13% of the annual emission reductions needed to prevent the worst effects of the climate crisis, according to new analysis from ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana.Nearly 30% of all oil and gas production currently comes from offshore drilling, and that generates emissions throughout the entire process – from extraction to refining and transporting – not just from the burning of the fuel itself.By stopping offshore drilling expansion and promoting clean energy policies that would push a phase-down of fossil fuel production levels worldwide, Oceana found that emissions could be reduced by 6.3 billion metric tons a year by 2050. That’s equivalent to the annual emissions saved by removing 1.4 billion cars from the road. Only 10 countries – Saudi Arabia, Norway, Qatar, Iran, Brazil, the United States, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Angola – produce around 64% of all offshore oil and gas. That would be the best place to start. If those countries pledged to stop offshore drilling, it would make a huge impact.   Dr. Kathryn Matthews, chief scientist at Oceana, said:Stopping the expansion of offshore drilling has the potential to reduce emissions more than any other ocean-based solution. It’s irrefutable that the climate crisis is here, now, affecting all of us through more frequent and intense hurricanes, floods, wildfires, droughts, and heat waves. This report makes it clear that ocean solutions are climate solutions. If we’re serious about preventing catastrophic climate change, our ocean is a great place to start.Offshore drilling is also a major cause of ocean pollution. It greatly harms marine life, coastal ecosystems, and economies with long-lasting effects, not to mention oil spills.Photo: “Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig” by Katie Haugland Bowen is licensed under CC BY 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/01,"It would be 10 times more expensive to operate gas-fired power plants in the long term than to build new solar PV capacity in Europe, according to a new study from Oslo-based energy research company Rystad Energy.Natural gas is presently very expensive in Europe, due to the plunge in Russian gas exports. Rystad Energy reports that “spot prices on the Netherlands-based Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub, the main reference for Western Europe, have risen from an average of €46 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2021 to €134 per MWh so far this year – an increase of 187%.” And gas will be needed for power generation through the winter.But more than 50 gigawatts (GW) of new solar and wind capacity are expected to be commissioned in 2023, along with up to 30 GW of nuclear capacity currently undergoing maintenance that French multinational utility EDF is planning to bring back online. Rystad Energy forecasts that TTF prices will stabilize at around €31 per MWh by 2030, which puts the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of existing plants closer to €150 per MWh. That’s still three times more than the LCOE of new solar PV facilities. For gas-fired plants to continue to be competitive, gas prices would need to fall closer to €17 per MWh and carbon prices would need to fall to €10 per metric ton, which is, according to Rystad, “currently unthinkable.”Carlos Torres Diaz, head of power at Rystad Energy, said:Gas will continue to play an important role in the European energy mix for some time to come, but unless something fundamental shifts, then simple economics, as well as climate concerns, will tip the balance in favor of renewables.The study also found that by 2028, new clean energy generation capacity installed using money that would otherwise have been spent on gas generation would reach 333 GW – enough to generate 663 TWh of electricity. Renewable power generation would be enough to replace forecast gas-fired generation that same year. By 2050, new renewable energy capacity would be generating more than 2,000 TWh:This growth in generation only considers output from new capacity developed using ‘funds from gas’ and is on top of Rystad Energy’s base case forecast, which anticipates that 2,385 GW of solar PV and wind capacity, and 520 GW of utility scale batteries are installed by 2050.Read more: Greece runs on 100% renewables for the first time on recordPhoto: EDPUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/11/01,"Geothermal supplies just 0.4% of the world’s energy today, but it could potentially supply up to 50% of the world’s energy by 2050, according to Carlos Araque, cofounder and CEO of Quaise Energy, who made that prediction at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit 2022 last week during a panel discussion called, “Is this geothermal’s moment?”Quaise is developing a drilling technique that was pioneered at MIT to reach the hot rock some two to 12 miles beneath the Earth’s surface. Araque was joined by Kathy Hannun, cofounder and president of US residential geothermal company Dandelion Energy. The Dandelion process uses established technology that doesn’t require such deep drilling.Araque and Hannun went on to not only describe the biggest barriers to scaling up their businesses for the world but also what other geothermal problems they are “itching for people to solve,” according to moderator Candice Ammori, founder of The Climate Vine, which advises climate tech startups.First, however, the two described why geothermal is so potentially impactful. In addition to being clean and global, geothermal provides a baseload energy source that’s available 24/7. It’s also “the most powerful and abundant renewable on Earth,” said Araque, “Much more so than wind, solar, nuclear, and all fossil fuels combined.”In addition, Araque said, it’s important to weigh an energy source by its impact on externalities like the environment, land use, and mineral use: When you look at the [problem] from this lens – how much land use per unit of energy you produce, the amount of materials necessary per unit of energy, and how much carbon dioxide you produce per unit of energy – you start realizing that geothermal comes out way, way ahead of anything else.To fully tap the resource, however, will be very capital and time intensive. Araque continued:It’s very hard to achieve anything in our space with a million dollars or even $10 million. You have to start playing at the $100 million level or even $1 billion level. This is what it costs to get [deep geothermal] developed and deployed at portfolio levels.Further, the Quaise technology involved in deep drilling has been demonstrated in the lab but not yet in the field. And that will take time.However, Araque said that by the end of the decade, Quaise aims to create power from a coal- or gas-fired power plant that has been converted to geothermal: You feed in geothermal steam instead of steam from a fossil-fuel boiler. That in a brushstroke decarbonizes the power plant, and you can repeat that 10,000 times over with other plants.The key to making deep geothermal a reality? “You leverage the oil and gas industry,” said Araque, who himself comes from fossil fuels. “I think of them as a ready-made workforce, supply chain, and regulatory framework that can push this into the world at the scale that’s required.”Hannun noted that for Dandelion, simplifying complexity will be key to bringing down the costs associated with using geothermal for heating and cooling of residential homes: It’s hard to advance our building stock and change all of the buildings that already exist [to geothermal because] they’re all slightly different and there’s a lot of complexity to manage. So a lot of our focus is on making geothermal [heat pumps] as simple to get into homes as it is to install a furnace or air conditioner.Ammori ended the session by asking Hannun and Araque about remaining geothermal challenges that other entrepreneurs could tackle. Both agreed that better imaging systems to see underground are important. For deep geothermal, Araque said that there’s a need for electronics that can withstand the high temperatures associated with the resource. Hannun noted that anything related to weatherizing homes will help the geothermal heating and cooling industry.She also stressed that for both her and Araque’s industries: I would encourage entrepreneurs not to just look at the central core technology, but also the enabling technologies, products, or businesses around permitting, licensing, and transmission. There are [many] things in the ecosystem that need to happen to enable scale.Araque concluded by noting that the energy transition itself is an unsolved problem: Don’t for a second think that it’s just a matter of scaling what we have. There’s plenty of space for innovation. This is the greatest challenge of many generations, not just ours, and we need all human capital on the problem.Read more: 10 Questions: Geothermal with Dandelion Energy founder Kathy HannunPhoto: Gretar Ívarsson, geologist at Nesjavellir/edited by Fir0002/Public DomainUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/27,"First Solar, the largest solar panel maker in the United States, today announced that it will invest around $270 million in a dedicated thin film PV R&D innovation center. The new facility, which will be in Perrysburg, Ohio, is expected to be the first of its scale in the United States.First Solar’s new R&D center will be near its existing Perrysburg manufacturing facility, and cover an area of around 1.3 million square feet. It will feature a pilot manufacturing line that will be able to produce full-sized prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules. The facility is expected to be completed in 2024.Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar, said:With a record shipment backlog and consistent demand for our modules, we face the twin challenges of optimizing existing and planned production capacity to deliver on our commitments, while ensuring that our technology roadmap does not lose momentum.This investment allows us to create an R&D sandbox separate from our commercial manufacturing operations, ensuring that we can accelerate innovation without the cost of taking mission-critical tools offline.First Solar is unique among the world’s 10 largest solar manufacturers for being the only US-headquartered company and only manufacturer of thin film PV modules. The Tempe, Arizona-headquartered company’s consistent and ongoing investment in developing cadmium telluride since 1999 has made the semiconductor the second most common PV technology in the world after crystalline silicon.“Cadmium telluride is very good at capturing sunlight and converting it to energy. It’s also the cheapest type of commercial solar panels on a dollars per watt basis. Its lifetime outdoors is the same or a little better than mono or polycrystalline modules (30+ years). Its sunlight-to-electricity efficiency is slightly less than silicon,” Ken Zweibel, former manager of the Thin Film PV Partnership at NREL (retired), explained to Electrek. [Thank you, Ken, for the clarification. – Eds.]In August, First Solar announced that it would invest up to $1.2 billion to ramp up production of US-made solar panels.

2022/10/27,"The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) just released its Emissions Gap Report 2022 – and let’s just say, the news isn’t good. So brace yourselves: You’re likely to see a slew of frightening, doom-mongering headlines about it today, unleashing a fresh wave of terror over those of us who care about the planet. But rather than panicking, here’s what to do instead.The 99-page report’s title is: “The Closing Window: Climate crisis calls for rapid transformation of societies.”The UNEP really isn’t messing around with that title, is it?It undoubtedly wants to light a fire under the bottoms of world leaders ahead of November’s 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, aka COP27, in Egypt. But my heart sank when I read that the UNEP views the year between COP26 and now as “a wasted year.” Inger Andersen, the UNEP’s executive director, states in the report’s foreword that nations are procrastinating action to fight climate change, and this is what all countries must do:To get on track to limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we would need to cut 45% off current greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. For 2°C, we would need to cut 30%.A stepwise approach is no longer an option.And then Andersen summarizes the part where hope lies – in action:This report tells us how to go about such a transformation. It looks in-depth at the changes needed in electricity supply, industry, transport, buildings and food systems. It looks at how to reform financial systems so that these urgent transformations can be adequately financed.She then says something that I found deeply jarring:Is it a tall order to transform our systems in just eight years? Yes. Can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by so much in that timeframe? Perhaps not. But we must try.“Perhaps not.”So after I read over the UNEP’s embargoed report documents, I could feel the climate change anxiety setting in, so I do what I usually do on such occasions: I went into the forest near my house in Vermont to regroup. I dug in the soil and the leaves with my bare hands, getting gloriously dirty. It’s incredibly cathartic to get earth on my face and under my fingernails. And as I was doing that, and taking deep, slow breaths, I thought about how to approach this rather overwhelming UN report. This report, which asserts that “the international community is still falling far short of the Paris goals, with no credible pathway to 1.5°C in place. Only an urgent system-wide transformation can avoid an accelerating climate disaster.”And it also says really scary things like this:Policies currently in place, without further strengthening, suggest a 2.8°C hike.I won’t lie. I initially wanted to hide in the woods and not write this. I felt intimidated. But giving up is a form of passive panic. And the UN report most definitely does not say, “Do nothing.” Rather, I thought about what I choose to do instead of panic every day. I learn and write about clean energy and electric vehicles and batteries. I easily find inspirational things to write about (such as solar over canals, pictured above) because I regularly discover innovative scientific breakthroughs, or big milestones that inspire delight. I drive an electric car. I am working to electrify my house with solar and storage. And as I do these things, I then share what I learn in my stories in order to make it easier for others to navigate the path to electrification. I am also a dual US/UK citizen, and I vote in both places. I vote only for people who want to fight for our planet. Thank you, Joe Biden, for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which are catalysts for climate action in the US now. (Doesn’t that count in the “wasted year,” UNEP?) And Boris Johnson, you are a hot mess, but I appreciated you championing clean energy. Rishi Sunak, you must now do the right thing.However – I’m not a scientist. So while digging furiously in the dirt and the leaves, I decided to “look for the helpers,” so to speak. (What can I say? I find Fred Rogers comforting.) The expert I really wanted to talk to was Michael Mann. He is the presidential distinguished professor and director, Penn Center for Science, Sustainability & the Media, at the University of Pennsylvania. He’s a climatologist and geophysicist, and he also thinks panic is a waste of time. Here is Professor Mann’s take on UNEP’s Emissions Gap Report 2022:Hi Michelle,I would quibble with some of the claims made. They just don’t stand up to the actual peer-reviewed literature.The claim that “Climate pledges leave the world on track for a temperature rise of 2.4-2.6°C by the end of this century” is misleading if not outright false.The most comprehensive peer-reviewed work on this, published by a leading team of modeling experts in April in the leading journal Nature, shows that  COP26 commitments can keep warming below 2C if they are kept in full and on time.Where the report is correct is that more work clearly needs to be done if warming is to be kept below 1.5C.Just months ago, however, nobody foresaw the major policy advances in both Australia and the US with the election of a pro-action Labor government in the former case, and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act by a 50/50 Senate in the latter case. It is estimated that the legislation will lower US emissions by 40% this decade, which puts us very close to our emissions reduction target. And with US leadership, we can expect other major emitters to now come to the table at COP27.But I would once again emphasize that more has to be done, and those who care about the defining challenge of our time — the climate crisis — need to turn out in droves in the upcoming midterm elections. The president is constrained in what he can do, particularly given the punitive agenda of the current conservative majority on the US Supreme Court. That means it is necessary for Congress to take a leadership role. The Inflation Reduction Act represents real progress, but only with a larger climate-friendly majority in the Senate will it be possible to pass even more aggressive climate legislation in the US.Don’t hesitate to let me know if any of this can use further elaboration.Thanks,Mike The UN and Michael Mann align on the fact that more needs to be done. But not panicking doesn’t mean resting on your laurels. It means actually doing your part. No more “blah blah blah.” And that’s not just a directive for world leaders. That’s a responsibility everyone has to take.Insulate your house. Get an electric bike. Turn your heating down. Tap into the Inflation Reduction Act rebate for money for a heat pump. Go solar, as it’ll also save you money on your electric bill. Write your representative. Vote for the candidate who will fight climate change. Compost. Never stop learning. Drive an EV sooner rather than later.Every small change makes a difference.

2022/10/26,"General Motors (GM) today announced that it has finalized agreements to power all of its US sites with clean energy by 2025. This is in line with the accelerated target that GM announced in September 2021, which is five years ahead of the 2030 target the company announced in early 2021 and 25 years ahead of the initial target of 2050, set in 2016.GM’s clean energy portfolio now includes sourcing agreements from 16 renewable energy plants across 10 states. The company reports that that portfolio has produced over $75 million of positive cash flow since 2017.GM says its “four-pillar” renewable energy strategy is to increase energy efficiency, source renewable energy, deploy battery storage, and support policies that enable a net zero power system.In 2019, GM became a founding member of the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), that includes more than 300 corporate renewable energy buyers in the United States. CEBA helps companies of all sizes find cost-effective pathways to buying renewable energy. Its goal is to achieve a 90% carbon-free US electricity system by 2030.In May 2020, Electrek reported that GM would power its Spring Hill, Tennessee, manufacturing plant – its largest site – entirely from solar by late 2022 at cost.In 2021, GM announced its Science Based Targets for emissions reduction, as well as plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. The company says it will eliminate tailpipe emissions from new US light-duty vehicles by 2035, and it’s committed to invest $35 billion in EVs and AVs through 2025.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/10/25,"Renewable energy – solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, biomass – provided almost a quarter of electrical generation in the US during the first two-thirds of 2022, according to data just released by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which was reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign.The latest issue of EIA’s “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through August 31, 2022) reflects that, year-to-date, renewables provided 23.3% of total US electrical generation, compared to 20.6% a year earlier. Further, in the first eight months of 2022, renewable energy sources (including small-scale solar) increased their electrical output by 17.5%, compared to the same period a year earlier. For the eight-month period, electrical generation by wind increased by 22% and provided 10% of total electrical generation. Meanwhile, solar sources grew by 26.9% and provided 5% of US electrical output. In addition, generation by hydropower increased 10.5% and accounted for 6.7% of the total. Geothermal also grew by 0.7%, while electrical generation attributed to the combination of wood and other biomass dropped by 2.1%. Taken together, during the first two-thirds of 2022, renewable energy comfortably outproduced both coal and nuclear by 17.9% and 32.3%, respectively. In fact, over the past half-decade, renewables have moved from fourth into second place while relegating coal and nuclear to third and fourth place. Five years ago, coal’s share of US electrical generation was 30.3%, while that of nuclear power was 19.6%. Now, their shares have dropped to 19.8% and 17.6%, respectively, while clean energy’s share has expanded from 18.2% to 23.3%. Natural gas, however, has retained the lead (38.5%) among energy sources comprising the US electrical mix. “These latest statistics suggest that renewables may well be on track to surpass EIA’s forecast for renewables to provide 22% of US electrical generation in 2022 and 24% in 2023,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “Bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act, renewables’ share could easily surpass 25% by the end of next year.”UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/25,"You may not currently think much about subsea export cables or even know what they are. But as the offshore wind revolution ramps up for Americans in particular, all the components that transport clean energy from wind turbines to US households will become more familiar. That’s where Nexans comes in. The Paris-based global cable company is going to provide vital subsea export cables to three offshore wind projects in the United States, and those cables will bring the power to the mainland.  Electrek spoke with Ragnhild Katteland, executive vice president, subsea & land systems business group at Nexans and CEO of Nexans Norway, about the big US offshore wind projects the company is a part of, what she thinks makes the US offshore wind market unique, and what she predicts will happen in the US offshore wind market in 2023.Electrek: What does Nexans do, and what is the company’s current role in the US offshore wind revolution?Ragnhild Katteland: Nexans designs, manufactures, and installs subsea export cable systems for offshore wind farms. We believe that offshore wind is one of the most effective solutions in overcoming the challenges associated with climate change. Nexans makes and delivers cables from the only subsea high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in the US.Electrek: At what stage are the US projects that Nexans is participating in?Ragnhild Katteland: Nexans has signed three contracts to date for the US market. The first and second project are Southfork Wind Farm and Revolution Wind, both being developed by Orsted and Eversource. The cables are currently being manufactured at our facility in South Carolina, the only facility of its kind on US soil. Empire Wind, developed by Equinor and BP, is another project for which we will deliver a full turnkey export cable system solution, and we have more East Coast projects in the pipeline.Electrek: What does Nexans predict will happen in the US offshore wind market in 2023?Ragnhild Katteland: With construction beginning on key offshore wind farms in the Northeast and other projects reaching different milestones and being finalized across the country, 2023 will be a ramp-up year for growth in offshore wind, and we are excited to be part of this important journey for what the future will hold from then through 2030.Electrek: Tell me three facts that everyone should know about subsea export cables.Ragnhild Katteland: One, without subsea export cables, there would be no electricity delivered to the onshore grid and to the consumers. Two, they come in a variety of types, sizes, and voltage levels such as AC and DC cables, and are custom-made for each offshore wind farm. Three, subsea interconnectors are another crucial part of electrical infrastructure and help deliver sustainable electricity from areas with a high potential for generation to places with higher demand.Read more: The world’s longest subsea cable will send clean energy from Morocco to the UKPhotos: NexansRagnhild Kattleland has held various management positions in engineering, sales, purchasing and project management since she joined Nexans (previously Alcatel) in 1993.

2022/10/22,"The city of Chaozhou, in China’s Guangdong province, is going to build an offshore wind farm so large that it is expected to provide more power than all of Norway’s power plants combined.The city intends to start work on the 43.3-gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farm before 2025, according to the city’s five-year plan, which is published online. The plan does not disclose how much the offshore wind farm is expected to cost.The city of Chaozhou will build the wind farm between 47 and 115 miles (75 and 185 km) off the city’s coast, on the Taiwan Strait.“The area has unique topographical features that mean wind will be strong enough to run the turbines 3,800 to 4,300 hours a year, or 43% to 49% of the time, an unusually high utilization rate,” Bloomberg wrote.On October 17, Electrek reported that a 13.6-megawatt offshore wind turbine with a record-breaking rotor diameter of 252 meters (827 feet) debuted in China ahead of the country’s 20th Party Congress in Beijing.Wow – China just built more offshore wind capacity, in 2021 alone, than the rest of the world had managed in the last 5yrs put togetherIts 26GW now accounts for half of the world's 54GW totalAlso, it added twice as much in 2021 as IEA had forecast in…December 2021 pic.twitter.com/yFpctkI1ZdChina connected more offshore wind generation capacity in 2021 – 17 GW – than every other country in the world installed in the last five years.So China is going big, but it’s also going slow.

2022/10/20,"On October 14, Maksim Timchenko, the CEO of DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power generator, updated Economichna Pravda on the status of Ukraine’s electrical grid in the face of Russian strikes against the country’s power installations. He also talked about what the company’s future plans are for implementing renewables, despite the Russian attacks. DTEK shared that interview today with Electrek, and we have edited the English translation sent to us below for length and clarity.Economichna Pravda: Looking at Ukraine’s entire energy system, how much capacity was there before the October 10 strikes in the country, and how much is left now?Maksim Timchenko: It is important to understand the difference between the capacity that is left and the capacity that is still available. These strikes are not aimed at generating facilities to prevent us from producing electricity but at connection systems tied to the Ukrainian energy system. They hit open switchgears, transformers, switches, so that a station that can produce electricity cannot be connected to the unified power system. That is, the key targets are Ukrenergo transformer high-voltage substations and power distribution equipment at thermal power plants.What [are] the tactics behind this? Since Soviet times, we have built unified energy systems so that if one of the generation flows fails at some part of the system, another one picks it up. That is, everything is looped and we work in a single system. In Soviet times, a power system scheme was built, where everything is set up for similar events that are happening today.I think the Russian military [consults] their power engineers and they explain how to cause maximum harm to the energy system.When Ukrenergo’s 750 kilowatt nodal substations, which connect the regions where the generation facilities are located get hit, then a surplus is obtained in one region, and a deficit in another. They hit these substations. This is exactly what happened on Monday and Tuesday. Yesterday morning [July 13 – EP] they struck to prevent supply of electricity to Kyiv.Economichna Pravda: How many megawatts or as a percentage of the total number of capacities have been taken down?Maksim Timchenko: From the point of view of generation, we [have] capacities that are destroyed and those that are occupied. The biggest deprivation of capacity is the seizure of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Today, 6,000 megawatts are not available. This is the most difficult situation.Speaking of our thermal power plants: We have lost control over the Uglegorsk [thermal power] station, and the Lugansk, and the Zaporizhzhya thermal power plant, which is next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station [Editor’s note: It’s the largest nuclear power plant in Europe]. Three thermal power plants and one nuclear power plant are located [in] the temporarily occupied territories and cannot produce electricity for the country.Second, regarding the power output, the Ladyzhynska [thermal power] station in the Vinnitsa region, which was also hit this week, [is not in operation] today. We are working to put it back into operation. The rest of the thermal power plants are operating.Economichna Pravda: It is about 10,000 megawatts.Maksim Timchenko: Yes. 6,000 – Zaporizhzhia [nuclear power station], Uglegorsk, and Zaporizhzhia – 1,200 each. All together up to 10,000 megawatts out of 50,000 megawatts. In general, the country runs on about 52,000 megawatts.Economichna Pravda: When a minister or ministry says that 30% of the power industry is out of operation, can you say that this is misinformation?Maksim Timchenko: I certainly don’t want to challenge the minister’s statement. [I]t can be perceived in different ways. “Out of operation” in terms of the fact that we have lost connection systems – [that] is correct. That is, if we do not have connections with generating stations, as I said, then we have lost 30% of the capacity when it comes to the process of energy delivery to the consumer.Why were the rolling blackouts implemented? Because the power that was produced could not be delivered to the grids. In this regard, he was probably right. From the point of view of the availability of capacities in working condition, I outlined the picture for you.[…]There is enough own capacity within Ukraine to get through the winter and for normal operation. The problem is the hits and damage done to the infrastructure that allows this power to be provided.Another #missileattack on #DTEK #energyfacilities: 1 employee killed and 7 injured. In total, since the start of the full-scale #invasion 210 of DTEK employees have been injured, 87 killed, 15 trapped in captivity and 1 went missing.Economichna Pravda: If our Russian “friends” smash the capacities, and not the output of capacities, then the energy system will be without thermal generation. Is nuclear generation capable of operating under such circumstances?Maksim Timchenko: Firstly, we have Ukrhydroenergo [a state company that administers hydro power plants]. Hydroelectric power plays an important balancing role. Secondly, along the lines that electricity [is exported] to the EU, imports can also be carried out. Accordingly, this can also play a role in power balancing.We are not stopping our battery storage installation project. [W]e still plan to bring and install 20 megawatts of storage capacity. This battery storage will also play an important role in balancing. It may not be such a large volume, but in this situation it is important.Therefore, I believe that we cannot have some kind of Armageddon, a situation where everything will be broken, and we will end up having a total blackout. I don’t believe [we will have] this scenario. Although I did not believe in a war with Russia. Everything is possible, but based on how we have performed and how the system has performed in terms of sustainability, I have confidence that we will cope with these challenges. Again, in conjunction with the military.I rely heavily on Ukrainian Air Defense Forces. Still, even with such a massive attack, more than 50% of the missiles have been shot down. These are certain lessons for us and for the military, how to deal with such situations.Economichna Pravda: There is an opinion that the nuclear power generation infrastructure will also be destroyed and thus thousands of megawatts will be “extinguished.” Do I understand correctly that if such a scenario is implemented, then we have the technical capabilities and agreements with Europe to take electricity from them?Maksim Timchenko: Yes. Firstly, my personal comment: These Russians, perhaps, still have enough brains with their conditionally high-precision weapons not to hit nuclear power plants, because you can miss and hit the block. I hope that they will not destroy the infrastructure of nuclear power plants. But nothing can be a certainty with this madness.Yes, there are technical possibilities, there are agreements, there are financial issues, and they are still being discussed in terms of paying for electricity. You know, in our country [it’s] 4-5 times cheaper than in Europe, and the delivery will, of course, be at the level of European prices.Economichna Pravda: The other day we saw a message from the head of DTEK Dnipro Electric Grids. He was looking for generators. Do people need to buy electric generators?Maksim Timchenko: I don’t want to inspire any false calm. We live in the times of highest uncertainty. And, frankly, if it is possible to buy a generator, then it is better to buy [one]. If we take a sober look at the situation that is happening now, it is better to have reserve capacities.…Economichna Pravda: Do you agree with the statement that this war will last for years? If so, then [will you] change the group’s strategy in terms of at least diversifying your businesses to other countries [on] the European continent?Maksim Timchenko: Yesterday I [held] a job interview – we still hire people to work for important positions in the company. And … the candidate [asked]: I watched your corporate strategy 2030 [New Strategy DTEK 2030], what has changed in it? My answer was: Fundamentally nothing has changed.The priority for the development of green generation remains. It was very important for me to hear the president’s position that it is necessary to create a “green hub” in Ukraine to supply electricity to Europe, and help Europe get away from over-dependence on Russian energy resources.We have all the possibilities for this: grid access, favorable topography, wind, sun, and experience. We said that we would [make] green generation a priority, and we are not giving up on this.In the same strategy, we [addressed] our international development. … The first plans for our investments abroad were laid down. And, in accordance with this strategy, we continue to do so. Today we are implementing projects for the construction of wind and solar stations. As part of these projects, we want to develop an entire ecosystem of solar and wind power plants, including those with energy storage systems.Read more: Ukraine is now using these 200-mile-range electric bikes with NLAW rockets to take out Russian tanksPhoto: DTEKUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/20,"LineVision, based in Somerville, Massachusetts, provides “electric utilities with the real-time monitoring and analytics needed to accelerate the net zero grid.” Here’s how this company is playing a crucial role in helping to upgrade the US and international grids to ensure that the electrification revolution is a success.October 20 update: National Grid announced today that it will install LineVision’s LiDAR sensors on its power lines in western New York. The sensors offer National Grid all of the data it needs to squeeze every bit of power it can out of their power lines. This is the first time in the State of New York where LineVision’s Dynamic Line Rating technology is going to be implemented in day-to-day operations, and it’s the largest-ever expansion of the grid without physically extending the line. Hudson Gilmer, cofounder and CEO of LineVision, said:This project, along with five miles of circuit rebuilds, is projected to reduce curtailments by over 350 megawatts while increasing capacity by 190 megawatts. We will, in essence, have added enough capacity to existing power lines to power some 80,000-100,000 homes. Electrek asked Rodica Donaldson, senior director of transmission analytics at EDF Renewables, which was awarded three contracts totaling 1 GW of solar and storage in New York in June, what she thinks about this announcement. She replied:Transmission limitations resulting in congestion and curtailment for renewable projects are a material concern in many areas of the country. These issues will only get exacerbated in the future, absent new transmission infrastructure and deployment of grid enhancing technologies like Line Vision’s. With one of the largest clean energy pipelines in New York with 1,500 MW of clean energy projects under NYSERDA contract, EDF Renewables is pleased to see this type of partnership that enables a more effective utilization of the grid and improves the ability to deliver zero-cost renewables to load.To explain exactly what LineVision does in layman’s terms, it’s easiest to describe it in road traffic terms, as its CEO, Hudson Gilmer, put to me in a video chat. If the electrical grid is like a network of roads, then LineVision adds an extra lane on each road that alleviates traffic as more “cars” are put on the road, such as solar, wind, electric vehicles, and so on.Or in actual terms, LineVision’s Grid Enhancing Technology (GETs) uses patented noncontact overhead line monitoring technology that utilizes LiDAR sensors and advanced analytics to improve the grid’s capacity, resilience, and safety. The company’s sensors collect critical information to unlock additional capacity on existing lines, provide insight into conductor health, and detect anomalies and risks. Gilmer says that one GETs component takes around 20 minutes to install, and one needs to be installed between every two to three miles on the power lines.The components of LineVision’s technology are made in Maine and Texas, and customers use a secure web interface to access grid analytics. As Gilmer says, “The magic happens in the algorithm.”Gilmer pointed out that “transmission lines are currently not monitored today. Therefore utilities have to make conservative assumptions about weather. Our sensors can unlock up to 40% capacity, helping utilities to achieve more accurate capacity.”LineVision’s technology is also capable of “situational awareness” – that’s the ability to sense risks such as wildfires, which can be caused by poorly maintained conductors. The company has also developed an application that detects ice on the line, which it picks up when it senses line movement due to the ice’s weight.And the US grid needs all the capacity it can get: Gilmer noted that in order to accommodate the electrification that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is going to spur on, grid capacity in the US will need to double by 2035 and triple by 2050.LineVision’s technology is already being used in real time by utilities such as National Grid, Dominion Energy, Xcel Energy, Tennessee Valley Authority, Duquesne Light Company (pictured above), NYPA, SMUD, multiple Exelon companies, and several other North American utilities. It also works with utilities across eight European countries, Marubeni, and other EPCOs in Japan, and Oceania.And seeing how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) passed order 881 in December, which requires all transmission providers to improve “both the accuracy and transparency of transmission line ratings,” the regulatory tailwinds for grid improvement are now strong.LineVision today announced the closing of its $33 million Series C financing round, which moves it from the early stage to the growth stage, and the company will use the money to accelerate global growth.The round is led by Climate Innovation Capital and co-led by S2G Ventures, and other new investors include the $1 billion Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund and Marubeni.The IRA is expected to reduce emissions to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030. Gilmer rightly observes, “The IRA has significant incentives, but it does nothing to solve the grid capacity’s increased demand. Transmission is the critical link.”Photo: LineVisionRead more: US, UK, other G7 countries to ‘predominantly decarbonize electricity sectors by 2035’UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/19,"Meet Crimson Storage, the world’s largest single-phase battery, which is now live in the California desert.Crimson Storage is also the second-largest energy storage project currently in operation of any configuration.The 350 megawatt (MW)/1400 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery storage project, which sits on on 2,000 acres west of Blythe in Riverside County, broke ground in 2021. Canadian Solar oversaw construction and provided the battery energy storage systems, and Axium Infrastructure and solar and storage developer Recurrent Energy will be Crimson Storage’s long-term owners.Residential homes are usually served by a single-phase power supply, and this project, on average, is expected to store and dispatch enough electricity to power more than 47,000 homes each year. Crimson Storage holds two long-term contracts with local utilities: a 200 MW/800 MWh 14-year and 10-month contract with Southern California Edison, and a 150 MW/ 600MWh 15-year contract with Pacific Gas and Electric. Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) said: The Crimson Energy Storage project epitomizes California leadership – clean energy, innovation, and economic development through good, union jobs. We’ve been laser focused on quickly bringing projects like this online to achieve our goal of a 100% clean energy grid. Congratulations to the people across the public and private sectors who are responsible for bringing this major project online to the benefit of all Californians.Crimson Storage was the first standalone energy storage project to be approved by the Biden administration on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in May 2021.As Electrek reported, the BLM approved the $550 million, 350 MW Crimson Solar Project, and Crimson Storage is a part of that project; it will generate and deliver power through the Southern California Edison Colorado River Substation and will provide power for around 87,500 homes. The solar arm of this project will be constructed at a future date.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/18,"The US Department of the Interior today announced that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will hold an offshore wind energy lease sale on December 6, 2022, off central and northern California. It’s also the first-ever US sale to support potential commercial-scale floating offshore wind energy development.BOEM director Amanda Lefton made announcement at the American Clean Power Association’s Offshore WINDPOWER 2022 conference and exhibition.The wind energy lease areas are in two regions on the Outer Continental Shelf off of the California coastline that cover approximately 373,268 acres. The leases in the Morro Bay (pictured) and Humboldt wind energy areas will generate at least 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of clean power – enough to power 1.5 million homes.  The new Pacific offshore wind power will help meet both California’s goal of a net zero grid by 2045 and the US’s goal of deploying 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030.Lefton said at the WINDPOWER conference:Today’s announcement represents years of close coordination and engagement with the state of California, Tribes, ocean users, local communities, and all interested parties to move us closer toward achieving the administration’s vision to fight climate change and realizing California’s clean energy future, while creating a domestic supply chain and good-paying union jobs.Just five days ago, Electrek reported that US coastal states increased their long-term offshore wind targets by 58% in the third quarter of 2022, which sets a record for quarterly growth.  One of the things spurring that growth is federal support for a floating wind turbine industry, with the Biden administration’s Floating Offshore Wind Shot initiative and a goal to deploy 15 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power by 2035.BOEM has, to date, held 10 competitive lease sales and issued 27 active commercial wind leases in the Atlantic Ocean, from Massachusetts to North Carolina.Photo: “Morro Bay Power Plant” by Maxinux40k is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/14,"San Francisco-headquartered Sunrun, the largest residential solar and battery storage installer in the US, has launched a home electric vehicle (EV) charger. October 14 update: Enel X Way, the Enel Group’s global electric mobility business, has announced that it will be providing Sunrun’s new smart Level 2 home EV chargers.The Enel X Way Level 2 EV charger uses off-peak and automated charging to help balance the grid.The new co-branded home EV charger is available now in select California, New Jersey, and Vermont markets, and it will be rolled out across the US by the beginning of 2023. It will be sold as an optional add-on for bundling with Sunrun home solar-plus-battery systems.Sunrun’s 40-amp Level 2 EV charger is compatible with all EV models. The charger also offers smart features that allow customers to configure charger settings and control charging.Sunrun’s charger will be available next month in select California, New Jersey, and Vermont markets, and then it will be rolled out across the US by the end of the year as an optional add-on. Sunrun customers will be able to bundle it together with a rooftop solar plus battery storage system.Home charging an EV can increase a home’s electricity usage by 50% or more per year, depending on how much driving and home charging the EV owner does. With 80% of EV charging done at home, and utility prices rising across the US, homeowners who buy into rooftop solar will be able to charge their EVs with solar power while also reaping the benefits of cheaper, more predictable energy rates.Mary Powell, chief executive officer of Sunrun, said:There is a strong correlation between EV ownership and solar adoption. People want to charge their vehicles with a clean, reliable energy source that’s cheaper than what they’re used to paying. As we work with customers to understand their energy needs, our new EV charger, coupled with our ability to potentially upsize home solar systems to meet those needs, position us nicely to help them future-proof their homes and provide peace of mind.Sunrun is Ford’s recommended installer, and it’s also the biggest Tesla Powerwall certified installer.First, I am currently working with Sunrun to install rooftop solar and battery storage. I am not getting any discounts or deals. This EV charger announcement is so new that our rep didn’t even know about it when he came to see us last week.You may be thinking, what’s the big deal about the launch of another Level 2 home charger? Well, it’s because it bundles solar and storage and EV charging together, making it much easier for people to electrify their homes. Sunrun isn’t the only company to do this, but it’s big, and it’s got Ford at its shoulder. Combine that with today’s announcement that Ford is reopening orders for its Lightning F-150 on Thursday, and that creates convenience. And we all know how much we Americans like convenience. Plus, Sunrun will presumably install the EV charger for you, so you don’t have to pay an electrician separately to hook it up to both your electrical panel and your Wi-Fi.Personally, I find it interesting that Sunrun is choosing to roll out this charger in Vermont first, since those of us who are Green Mountain Power customers here in Vermont qualify for a free home Level 2 EV charger. So while I applaud Sunrun for this rollout and will be asking my Sunrun rep about the possibility, I’ll go with the cheapest and smoothest option, and installation costs will also factor in.Photo: SunrunUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/13,"The US offshore wind industry has hit the ground running: Coastal states increased their long-term offshore wind targets by 58% in the third quarter of 2022. That sets a record for quarterly growth, according to the Business Network for Offshore Wind’s inaugural “US Offshore Wind Quarterly Market Report.”Groundbreaking federal policy, record investments, and new state-level legislature boosted the US offshore wind industry boom in the third quarter, with three things, in particular, spurring growth, which are, according to the report:Liz Burdock, president and CEO of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, said:Our inaugural quarterly report could not come at a more exciting time for offshore wind.With historic federal funding, new support for floating wind turbine technology, and increasingly ambitious state-level goals, the longstanding aspirations of the American offshore wind industry are poised to become reality. Despite this tremendous growth, the industry still must overcome challenges to upgrade our grid and transmission system, localize a robust supply chain, and train a skilled workforce. Capitalizing on this momentum requires continued coordinated action from our state and federal government to deploy a comprehensive national offshore wind industrial strategy that includes critical investments in our infrastructure, ports, and manufacturers.The “US Offshore Wind Quarterly Market Report” notes that the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, combined with efforts to bring greater transparency to the federal permitting system, underpin the beginnings of a National Offshore Wind Industrial Strategy and puts the US in striking position to achieve its goal of deploying 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030.California has the largest US planning goal, but East Coast states lead on offshore wind commitments, development, and deployment. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island in particular are moving the market forward at breakneck speed.The long-term targets are set, and the hard work has begun laying the foundations needed to deploy offshore wind at an enormous scale. For example, as I wrote yesterday (link below), it doesn’t seem super titillating at first look that a power transformer factory is expanding. But it is because the infrastructure is being prepared for the massive amounts of clean energy that will come down the pipeline when those turbines are up and running. Ports are being upgraded. Components are being manufactured. New workers will be employed and trained up – there are potentially 44,000 jobs by 2030.This report confirms the beginning of a US offshore wind revolution. This is, indeed, as Burdock says, an extremely exciting time.Read more: Hitachi Energy will expand its Virginia power transformer factory to meet soaring US demandPhoto: Equinor South Brooklyn offshore wind hubUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/12,"The total global pipeline of floating offshore wind projects has more than doubled in the past 12 months in terms of capacity, from 91 gigawatts (GW) to 185 GW. That’s according to a new report published today by RenewableUK, a trade association for the wind power, wave power, and tidal power industries in the UK.The number of projects has increased globally during that time period from 130 to 230. The pipeline includes projects at any stage: operational, under construction, approved, in the planning system, or at an early development stage. Within the global 185 GW pipeline, 121 MW are fully commissioned over nine projects in seven countries. Ninety-six MW are under construction, 288 MW are consented or in the pre-construction phase, 31 GW are in planning or has a lease agreement, and 153 GW are in early development or is in the leasing process.When it comes to floating offshore wind total portfolios by country, the UK is in the lead. Its pipeline has increased from 23 GW a year ago to over 33 GW, and from 29 projects to 51, which are being developed in the North Sea (Scottish and English waters), the Celtic Sea, and the North Atlantic Ocean.One hundred seven GW (58%) of floating offshore wind capacity is being developed in Europe, and 33.3 GW (18%) of the global floating portfolio is in the UK, of which 29 GW is in Scottish waters.Outside of Europe, leasing areas off the US West Coast, project proposals off Australia’s southeast coast, and South Korea make up the majority of the rest of the capacity.By the end of 2030, floating wind capacity could reach 11 GW in the UK, 31 GW in Europe and 41 GW globally, according to the report’s authors.Read more: California sets the largest offshore wind goal of any state in the USPhoto: Cobra GroupUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/10/12,"Global sustainable energy giant Hitachi Energy today announced that it will spend more than $37 million to expand and upgrade its power transformer factory in South Boston, Virginia. This is in response to soaring demand for power transformers from utility companies that are scrambling to accommodate the renewable energy boom after the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August. Hitachi Energy’s South Boston factory manufactures both distribution and power transformers for the US power grid, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities, as well as traction transformers for railway applications use.Power transformers are static machines used for transforming power from one circuit to another without changing the frequency. They adjust and stabilize the voltage of electricity to ensure an efficient, reliable power supply. Distribution transformers provide the final voltage transformation in the power distribution system, stepping down the voltage used in the distribution lines to the level used by the customer.Hitachi Energy will add 26,000 square feet of production space in the factory’s power transformer building to support the manufacturing of larger transformers specifically designed for utility and renewable energy markets.The South Boston factory, which has been in operation since 1968, is currently around 607,000 square feet in size. Around 450 employees work there, and Hitachi Energy says it’s now actively recruiting more people.Steve McKinney, senior VP and head of Hitachi Energy’s transformer business in North America, said:Demand for transformers is growing rapidly and we are continuing to invest in our local footprint here in North America to keep pace.The company says it will also invest in automated equipment and changes in factory processes to reduce factory cycle times and improve operational performance. Hitachi notes that the process changes are “particularly critical in the face of current supply chain challenges brought on by the pandemic and other factors.”Hitachi Energy is also leveraging financial support from the Commonwealth of Virginia and Halifax County, where the South Boston factory is located. This is why we need good policy, people. The Inflation Reduction Act passed, and the private sector is hopping to it as a result of federal incentives and demand. This means that the long-overdue US grid upgrade is finally kicking off. That makes ramping up the manufacturing of power transformers sexy in my book, because energy resilience is non-negotiable in the face of geopolitical challenges and climate change.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

It will become the world’s largest offshore wind farm upon completion, with an installed capacity of 3.6 gigawatts (GW). And it looks likely that it will get a fourth phase, Dogger Bank D, making it even more massive.Dogger Bank, which is located between 78 and 180 miles (125 and 290 km) off the east coast of Yorkshire, is a joint venture between Norwegian energy giant Equinor (40%), British utility SSE Renewables (40%), and Italian energy company Eni Plenitude (20%). SEE Renewables and Equinor are looking into creating Dogger Bank D. A spokesperson told OffshoreWind.biz:SSE Renewables and Equinor are currently assessing seabed for the potential of expanding Dogger Bank Wind Farm, which is currently under construction, with an additional phase, Dogger Bank D. The potential project is supported by a grid connection for up to 1320 [megawatts] MW.Surveys on the potential Dogger Bank D site started in August and are expected to conclude at the end of November. A, B, and C alone will be capable of powering up to six million UK homes once it’s completed in 2026 – and there are approximately 28.1 million households in the country.If the fourth phase is carried out, the capacity of the world’s largest offshore wind farm would reach nearly 5 gigawatts.In May, Electrek reported that offshore construction work had officially started with the installation of the first length of HVDC export cable off the Yorkshire coast. Dogger Bank will be the first HVDC-connected wind farm in the UK.In December 2021, SSE and Equinor announced that they had secured financing to proceed with the construction of the $3.98 billion Dogger Bank C.GE Renewable Energy will provide 87 units of the enormous Haliade-X 14 MW wind turbines for Dogger Bank C.

It compares the first six months of 2022 to the first half of 2021 to show how the electricity transition has progressed.The report finds that global electricity demand grew by 389 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first half of 2022. Renewables – wind, solar, and hydro – increased by 416 TWh, slightly exceeding the rise in electricity demand.Wind and solar alone rose by 300 TWh, which was equal to 77% of the rise in global electricity demand. In China, the rise in wind and solar generation alone met 92% of its electricity demand rise. In the United States it was 81%, and in India it was 23%. As a result of the growth in renewables, fossil-fuel generation was almost unchanged (+5 TWh, +0.1%). Coal fell by 36 TWh (-1%) and gas by 1 TWh (-0.05%). This offset a slight rise in other fossil fuels (mainly oil) of 42 TWh. Consequently, global CO2 power sector emissions were unchanged in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year, despite the rise in electricity demand.Coal in the EU rose 15% only to cover a temporary shortfall in nuclear and hydro generation. Coal in India rose 10% because of a sharp rebound in electricity demand from lows early last year when the pandemic struck hardest. Globally, these rises were offset by coal-power falls of 3% in China and 7% in the United States.The growth in wind and solar prevented a 4% rise in fossil fuel electricity generation worldwide. In China, the growth in wind and solar enabled fossil fuel power to fall by 3%. Without this growth, fossil fuels would have risen by 1%. In India, fossil fuel power rose by 9%, but it would have been 12% without growth in wind and solar. In the United States, it slowed down the rise in fossil fuel power from 7% to just 1%. In the EU, fossil fuel power rose by 6%, but it would have been 16% without growth in wind and solar. Despite the halt in fossil-fuel generation in the first half of 2022, coal and gas generation increased in July and August. It leaves open the possibility that power sector emissions in 2022 may yet rise, following last year’s all-time high. Further, a new report from San Francisco-based NGO Global Energy Monitor found that approximately 89.6 gigawatts (GW) of gas plants in development globally, totaling 5,070 million metric tons of CO2e lifetime emissions if built, are coal-to-gas conversions or replacements.These conversions are proceeding despite data showing that gas projects are increasingly uncompetitive with renewables and are just as bad, if not worse, for the environment than coal.Wiatros-Motyka said:We can’t be sure if we’ve reached peak coal and gas in the power sector. Global power sector emissions are still pushing all-time highs when they need to be falling very quickly. And the same fossil fuels pushing us into a climate crisis are also causing the global energy crisis. We have a solution: Wind and solar are homegrown and cheap, and are already cutting both bills and emissions fast.Read more: Siemens Gamesa launches recyclable onshore wind turbine bladesUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/30,"Stockholm-headquartered renewable energy developer OX2 has signed letters of intent with Swedish edible seaweed companies Nordic SeaFarm and KOBB to explore the possibility of seaweed farming at one of OX2’s offshore wind farms.OX2’s Galatea-Galene huge 1.7 gigawatt offshore wind farm will be sited off Halland, a county on the western coast of Sweden. It’s named after two Greek sea nymphs, Galatea and Galene, and consists of two sub-areas around 15.5 miles (25 km) outside the cities of Falkenberg and Varberg.Galatea-Galene is expected to consist of up to 101 wind turbines and generate around 6 to 7 terawatt-hours of clean electricity per year. That’s the equivalent of the average annual electricity consumption of more than 1.2 million Swedish households. (There are 4.8 million households in Sweden, for perspective.)This offshore wind farm will be developed in a single phase. Construction is expected to commence in 2028 and enter into commercial operation in 2030.Simon Johansson, CEO of Nordic SeaFarm, and Benjamin Ajo, chairman of the board of KOBB, said in a joint statement [via Offshorewind.biz]:We see great opportunities, in collaboration with both the fishing industry and the wind power industry, to both maintain and create new jobs when we investigate the possibilities of creating a new industry in Sweden in the form of large-scale aquaculture.Developing the national food supply while [offshore wind] farms contribute to stopping the negative effects of climate change are more positive aspects.All seaweed needs to grow is saltwater and sunlight. It’s a superfood that’s rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, and particularly high in iodine, so it’s very nutritious. (Note that crispy seaweed in Chinese restaurants is actually cabbage.) It can be used to wrap sushi, in soups and salads, in snacks and instant noodles, and as livestock food.Seaweed also provides a source of food for marine life. In April, Electrek reported that a groundbreaking study found that the first US offshore wind farm has had no negative effect on fish and has even proven to be beneficial.Here’s a short video from Nordic SeaFarm that shows how the company grows and harvests seaweed for consumption:Pairing seaweed farms and offshore wind farms seems like an inspired idea.Seaweed’s ability to absorb toxins and other contaminants from the sea make it environmentally friendly, but that’s not what humans want to consume. That’s where seaweed growers come in: they test the seaweed for safety and quality.Any multipurpose sustainable use of an offshore wind farm, particularly one that provides both clean energy and nutritious food that doesn’t require either fertilizer or fresh water to grow, is a win. It’s also another example of innovation that the clean energy revolution is bringing about in the climate change fight.Read more: This new innovation boosts wind farm energy output yet costs nothingUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/29,"As Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida, Goal Zero, a Bluffdale, Utah-based portable clean energy company, released survey results that found 84% of Americans worry about power outages and 26% feel vulnerable to power outages. So here’s how Americans feel about mitigating blackouts with backup power.The online survey that polled 2,000 adults found that 61% of Americans wish they had a reliable source of backup power at their residence.Thirty-two percent said that their key motivator for having residential backup power is so they don’t suffer inconvenience during a blackout. Twenty-three percent wanted backup power because they have someone in their household who has vulnerable health, and 21% cited concern about the increasing number of natural disasters in their area.When the survey results were broken down regionally, residents in the South had the largest percentage of people polled – 66% – who wish they had home backup power. The West, the Midwest, and the Northeast all tied at 57%.However, only 15% of residents currently have backup power. The most common backup power sources in the United States are portable gas generators (25%), followed by standby generators (10%), solar generators (5%), and solar and installed storage (5%). Ultimately, a slim majority of Americans want sustainable backup power: 51% percent of Americans would be interested in a backup power source if it meant they could reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.When it comes to cost, 61% of Americans would be willing to pay 40% extra, on average, for sustainable backup power that doesn’t run on fossil fuels. Seventy-eight percent of Americans consider solar generators “green,” and 38% consider portable gas generators “dirty.” (Portable gas generators are dirty. They’re one of the leading causes of deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning during power outages.)Goal Zero’s general manager, Bill Harmon, told Electrek:With our increasing dependence on electronics and power, combined with the rise in natural disasters happening every year, consumers’ access to reliable backup power has gone from a nice-to-have to a necessity. Recent innovations in solar generators and battery storage have created affordable, clean, energy storage options that can give those affected by events like Hurricane Ian some peace of mind, knowing they can stay safe and connected with their family and friends despite the weather conditions. With natural disasters impacting large swaths of the country, there’s a laundry list of things that are out of people’s control — access to backup power shouldn’t be one of them.Some of you may recall that I used to live in St. Petersburg, Florida, as my “read more” post below indicates My former neighborhood has had a very rough time this week, and they did indeed lose power. The people of South Carolina will also lose power when Ian strikes again. This is why I am militant about the importance of solar and storage and would have tapped my solar-powered portable battery today, had I still lived in St. Pete. I am currently with Sunrun now to install solar panels and Tesla Powerwalls at my Vermont home. Before they’re installed, we will need to increase the amperage of our home. Besides my desire for backup power, I am also deliberately test driving the whole installation process so that I can share my experience of upgrading my electrical system and installing solar and storage with Electrek readers.

2022/09/28,"Italian startup Energy Dome yesterday announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Danish wind giant Ørsted. Together, they will run a feasibility study on the deployment of a 20 megawatt (MW)/200 MWh energy storage facility using Energy Dome’s CO2 Battery technology at one or more Ørsted sites.The partnership’s aim is to use long-duration energy storage to provide baseload renewable energy to Ørsted’s end-use customers in order to provide grid stability. The feasibility study will dispatch renewable energy over periods of 10 hours or longer.According to Energy Dome, construction could potentially begin on Ørsted’s first 20 MW project, which will be sited in Europe, during the second half of 2024. The MoU includes an option for Energy Dome to develop additional CO2 Battery energy storage facilities for Ørsted. Kieran White, VP Europe Onshore at Ørsted, said: We consider the CO2 Battery solution to be a really promising alternative for long-duration energy storage. This technology could potentially help us decarbonize electrical grids by making renewable energy dispatchable.At the end of June, Energy Dome commenced commercialization when it announced an MoU with Italian utility A2A.Energy Dome has raised a total of nearly $25 million since the company emerged from stealth mode in February 2020. Its series B round is planned for later in 2022.Energy Dome sited its debut CO2 Battery in Sardinia to favor speed to market and ease of execution, as it’s in an industrial area with an existing electrical connection. Sardinia currently uses coal, but the fossil fuel will be phased out by 2025. The battery can be paired with both wind and solar.CO2 is one of the few gases that can be condensed and stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature, so, as Energy Dome states on its website, it’s the perfect fluid to store energy cost-effectively in a closed thermodynamic process. It allows for high-density energy storage without the need to go to extremely low temperatures.Energy Dome founder and CEO Claudio Spadacini explained how it works to Bloomberg in May:To charge the battery, we take CO2 at near atmospheric temperature and pressure and we compress it. The heat that is generated during compression is stored. When we exchange the thermal energy with the atmosphere, the CO2 gas becomes liquid.To generate and dispatch electricity, the liquid CO2 is heated up and converted back into a gas that powers a turbine, which generates power. The CO2 gas is always contained and the entire system is sealed.We don’t use any exotic materials. The technology uses steel, CO2 and water. So there is no dependency on rare earth materials like cobalt or lithium. This makes our technology geopolitically independent. It can be produced everywhere and it can be used everywhere.Energy Dome made a short video last year demonstrating how its CO2 energy storage works:Read more: The world’s largest offshore wind farm is now fully operationalPhoto: Energy Dome",solar
2022/09/27,"Queensland, which has the highest dependence on coal of any Australian state, has announced that it will spend AU $776 million (US $500 million) to build Australia’s largest publicly owned wind farm.The Tarong West wind farm will be sited in Ironpot, 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southwest of Kingaroy, in the South Burnett Region. It’s within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone, which is one of three regions designated by the state to accelerate renewables projects.The 500-megawatt project will feature up to 150 wind turbines and could generate enough clean electricity to power up to 230,000 homes. The Queensland government has a $2 billion Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund, which will pay for the project. The state-owned Stanwell Corporation will build and manage Tarong West. The government wants approvals completed by 2024, and aims for the wind farm to be operational by 2026.As the Sydney Morning Herald points out in a 2018 article, Stanwell Corporation was ranked No. 3 in the country for worst carbon emissions in Australia:Stanwell Corp runs the Stanwell and Tarong coal-fired power station, accounting for nearly half of all of Queensland’s coal-fired generating capacity.The Queensland government’s State of the Environment Report 2020 states:In 2018, Queensland contributed more GHG emissions than any other Australian state and territory, responsible for 32% of the nation’s total of 537.4 [metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent]. On a per capita basis, Queensland is the third highest emitting jurisdiction (34.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per person) behind the Northern Territory (64.7 tCO2e per person) and Western Australia (35.2 tCO2e per person) and above the national average (21.5 tCO2e per person).Queensland, which is Australia’s second-largest and third-most populous state, has a population of 5.2 million. The state has a 50% clean energy target by 2030 and a 30% emissions reduction below 2005 levels target by 2030. The latter target is the weakest emissions reduction target of any Australian state. The Queensland government website states:Queensland has already achieved 20% of our renewable energy target by 2020.We are almost two-thirds to reaching our 2030 emissions reduction target having reduced emissions by 19% since 2005 based on the latest 2020 data.Jason Lyddieth, a Brisbane-based clean energy and climate campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, told the Guardian:Queensland is Australia’s highest emitting state and one of the biggest jurisdictions for per-capita emissions anywhere. Only Alberta in Canada and Qatar are worse.The state is also going hell for leather with new mines and gas fields. The government needs to get serious and have a plan to get off fossil fuels.Having a 2030 target of just 30% when the federal government has a 43% target is completely untenable.Read more: Construction officially starts on the largest wind farm in AustraliaPhoto: Leonard Low, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia CommonsUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/26,"The UK’s power sector can bring natural gas generation down to just 1% of electricity by 2030, which would avoid £93 billion ($99.6 billion) in gas costs in the same period, according to new modeling from London-based independent energy think tank Ember.UK wholesale gas prices have skyrocketed in the last year, making the generation of electricity from natural gas extremely expensive compared to wind and solar power. At the end of August, Ember reports, it cost over four times more to produce electricity from a combined-cycle gas plant in the UK (£420/MWh) compared to the same period last year (£100/MWh). The last offshore wind auction had an average price of just £48/MWh – that’s nine times cheaper than the current cost of running gas-fired power stations.The UK currently generates around 40% of electricity from natural gas. In October 2021, the British government said it would decarbonize its electricity system by 2035, but Ember’s newly released model shows it’s possible to move away from gas even faster. By 2030, the UK could generate 99% of electricity from clean domestic sources, even in adverse weather conditions. Wind and solar would provide 70% of electricity in this scenario.There are currently 6.4 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar projects under construction in the UK. When those projects are completed, they’ll save the UK £15.7 billion in additional avoided natural gas costs between now and 2030. So far this year, the UK has brought 2.3 GW of offshore wind online. That’s more than the country added in the last two years combined. Over the next four years, the UK has sufficient wind and solar capacity planned and under way to put it on track for a 2030 clean power target, if all these projects are approved and constructed. To phase out gas by 2030, Ember’s model shows that the UK will need to add 90 GW of wind and solar capacity, alongside investment into the transmission grid. In March, Electrek reported that the total pipeline of UK offshore wind projects alone had reached 86 gigawatts.On Friday, the British government significantly announced that it will relax onshore wind planning rules that have been in place since 2015 in order to allow onshore wind power to be more easily deployed.Phil MacDonald, Ember’s chief operating officer, said:To see that gas is a dead end, just look at the spiraling energy bills of the last year. Right now the UK is highly exposed to the punishing costs and geopolitical risks that come with depending on gas for heating and electricity. But with abundant and cheap offshore wind resources, the UK doesn’t have to be stuck with gas.The UK has an opportunity to bring down bills and spur economic growth by focusing on its world-leading clean power sector. The quicker this happens, the quicker the UK can get to safe, stable, and affordable power for good.Prime Minister Liz Truss also disappointingly lifted a moratorium on fracking in England, and she also approved a new oil and gas licensing round in the North Sea. Fracking involves drilling into the earth and injecting a high-pressure mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into shale rock to open existing fissures and release gas and oil. Fracking causes earth tremors.Ami McCarthy, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian:Motorways, power stations, and airports – love them or hate them, they are nationally important infrastructure. A hole in a muddy field which may produce a very small amount of expensive gas, but probably won’t, is not nationally important infrastructure.Read more: British government invests £32M in floating offshore wind to cut natural gas dependencyPhoto: “Early Morning Cornwall” by Tony Armstrong-Sly is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0",solar
2022/09/23,"After getting the world’s first offshore wind turbine with recyclable blades up and spinning in August, Siemens Gamesa has just launched its RecyclableBlade for onshore wind power projects.The Siemens Gamesa RecyclableBlade for offshore was launched in September 2021 and installed at the 342 megawatt Kaskasi offshore wind farm in Germany in July 2022. Siemens Gamesa has not yet said which sizes the recyclable onshore blades will be available in or when, nor how many recyclable onshore blades it’s produced so far.The Spanish-German wind engineering giant calls its recyclable blade technology RecyclableBlade. Wind turbine blades are made of a number of materials embedded in resin. Siemens Gamesa explains:Separating the resin, fiberglass, and wood, among others, is achieved through using a mild acid solution. The materials can then go into the circular economy, creating new products like suitcases or flat-screen casings without the need to call on more raw resources. Siemens Gamesa says it plans to make all of its wind turbine blades fully recyclable by 2030, and all of its wind turbines fully recyclable by 2040. This technology needs to be rolled out quickly as wind power ramps up globally: According to a 2021 study by Aubryn Cooperman, a wind energy analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and colleagues called “Wind turbine blade material in the United States: Quantities, costs, and end-of-life options”:Assuming a 20-year turbine lifetime, the cumulative blade waste in 2050 is approximately 2.2 million tons. This value represents approximately 1% of remaining landfill capacity by volume, or 0.2% by mass.In Europe, Siemens Gamesa is working with industry body WindEurope and other major industry players to call for a Europe-wide ban on landfill for blades.Read more: The world’s largest offshore wind farm is now fully operationalUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/09/22,"A global renewable energy employment report released today by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) reveals which countries are leading the world in wind and solar manufacturing and installation.“Renewable Energy and Jobs: Annual Review 2022” shows that the number of people working in the renewable energy sector has continued to grow. In 2021, there was a global increase of 700,000 new renewable energy jobs, which brought worldwide renewable energy employment to 12.7 million, despite the pandemic and the growing energy crisis. The report’s authors noted that the pandemic is directly contributing to domestic job creation:The lingering impact of the COVID-19 crisis has put a spotlight on the viability of far-flung supply chains. Rising concerns in the context of additional supply chain disruptions, trade disputes and geopolitical rivalries are reinforcing interest in localization of supply chains, to enhance resilience, domestic value, and job creation.By 2030, under an ambitious energy transition scenario, the number of worldwide renewable energy jobs could rise to 38.2 million.Solar, which accounts for more than one-third of the total renewable energy workforce, is the fastest-growing renewables sector. China is the leading maker and installer of solar PV panels, and its number of offshore wind jobs is growing. Southeast Asian countries are becoming major solar PV manufacturing hubs and biofuels producers.India, which added more than 10 GW of solar PV, has created many installation jobs, but it remains heavily dependent on imported solar panels.European countries now account for around 40% of the world’s wind manufacturing output, and combined, they’re the most important exporters of wind power equipment. Europe is also trying to reconstitute its solar PV manufacturing industry.Mexico is the leading supplier of wind turbine blades in the Western Hemisphere. Brazil remains the leading employer in biofuels, and it’s also adding many jobs in wind and solar installations. The United States is beginning to build a domestic industrial base for its budding offshore wind sector.The role of African countries is currently limited, but the report points out that there are growing job opportunities in decentralized renewables, especially in support of local commerce, agriculture, and other economic activities.Read more: This new innovation boosts wind farm energy output yet costs nothingUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/21,"The Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE), a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line, will deliver 1,250 megawatts of clean electricity from Canada’s Hydro-Québec, the fourth-largest hydropower producer in the world, to New York City.HVDC energy transmission transmits power over long distances more efficiently than alternating current (AC) transmission.The CHPE, which is permitted and expected to be fully operational in spring 2026, will be completely buried. It will transmit electricity for more than 372 miles (600 km). It will run from the Hertel substation in La Prairie, Canada, to an interconnection point in the Richelieu River. It will then run through Lake Champlain and the Hudson River to an HVDC converter station in Astoria, Queens, where it will be connected into the Con Edison grid. The project will utilize waterways, existing roads, and railroad rights of way. The cables will be monitored on a continuous basis. Unless damage is detected, they will be virtually maintenance-free.Yesterday, the CHPE announced that it has finalized contracts with three companies to oversee major construction operations:The CHPE is expected to decrease emissions by an average of 3.9 million metric tons per year. That’s the equivalent of removing 44% of passenger vehicles from New York City.

2022/09/20,"San Rafael, California-based Ojjo, whose solar foundations will hold the photovoltaic panels on one of the largest solar farms in the United States, just closed a $40 million Series C funding round.Ojjo’s Earth Truss system will be an essential part of the $1.2 billion, 690 megawatt (MW) + 380 MW battery energy storage Gemini Solar project. The huge solar farm will sit on around 6,000 acres of federal land in the Mojave Desert, 30 miles northeast of Las Vegas. It will generate enough clean energy to power 400,000 homes, and it’s expected to be commissioned next year.Ojjo’s patented Earth Truss combines its hardware with a drilling machine, the Truss Driver. Ojjo claims that the Earth Truss is one of the industry’s fastest-to-install solar foundations, and says it typically requires 50% less steel volume and labor than a conventional pile system. The Earth Truss system has been contracted or constructed in over 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of solar projects to date.Ojjo’s Series C funding round was led by NGP ETP, the energy transition investing platform of NGP, and Ajax Strategies also participated. The new funding will speed up Ojjo’s growth and execution on its 9 GW active project pipeline.James Wallis, a partner at NGP, said:Solar foundations represent a major untapped opportunity in the industry. We believe that Ojjo’s experienced team is perfectly positioned to deliver innovation, automation, and cost savings at a time when the industry needs it mostSolar farm discussions (and media coverage) tend to focus on photovoltaic panels and their power output. But something’s got to hold up those panels effectively for 25+ years – foundations are an essential part of every solar project (if you really want to geek out about solar).Ojjo’s Earth Truss is clearly a standout product, as it’s attracting significant funding. This solar foundation product is going to play an important role in the Gemini Solar project, which is massive and will ultimately provide an enormous amount of clean energy and feature in many more solar farms.

2022/09/19,"LONGi Green Energy, the world’s largest solar company, is going to launch solar panels into space to test whether they can successfully work in orbit and transmit power back to Earth.The Xi’an, China-based solar giant’s newly announced project is called the LONGi Green Energy Future Energy Space Laboratory. It aims to “promote the integrated development of aerospace technology and new energy.” The company is also going to test its products in similar environments on Earth in order to assess whether they’re suitable for space.So what’s the point of launching solar panels into space? Unrestricted exposure to the sun while they’re in orbit.Wu Zhijian, president of the China Space Foundation, a government-backed agency under the China National Space Administration, said [translated]:The earliest applications of photovoltaics were in the aerospace field. The development of photovoltaics and aerospace are inseparable. Photovoltaics have always been the main producer of space power. I am very happy to see LONGi taking the first step in aerospace and connecting In the future space power station, aerospace commercialization, and other fields. I also look forward to LONGi and China’s photovoltaic enterprises speeding up their pace and moving forward hand in hand with China Aerospace.In June, Chinese scientists at Xidian University in Shaanxi province announced that they had successfully tested a full-system model (pictured above) that could wirelessly transmit solar power from space to Earth. Bloomberg summarized how it works:[It] captures sunlight high above the ground and converts it into microwave beams. It then transmits through the air to a receiver station on the ground, where it can be converted back to electricity. While the model only sends the energy 55 meters through the air, the researchers hope the technology could one day be expanded to send power from orbiting solar panels to Earth.I write about solar a couple times a week, but solar from space? It was time to talk to the space experts. I asked the writers at Electrek‘s sister site, Space Explored, what they thought of this initiative, and they weren’t overly enthused. Seth Kurkowski said: We already have a problem with too much space debris and large constellations in orbit. Regulations don’t exist to ensure operators of satellites cooperate in avoiding each other, and adding more isn’t going to help the situation.It’s a great idea in theory, but I think the additional problems it will create will outweigh the benefit it will bring. But the technology LONGi could create out of these tests could be useful for future space exploration on the Moon or Mars when we have less congestion in our orbit.And Derek Wise added:Continuing to explore and improve solar panel tech for space flight will continue to improve that same tech down here on earth, and in other space applications. But the idea of “space-based power stations” is a very … optimistic take. I just can’t see it happening. If LONGi is getting double the power, or even triple the power, due to lack of clouds and darkness, I see no way that can make up for tens of millions of dollars per launch.A [SpaceX] Falcon 9 can launch (very roughly) 20,000 lbs to low earth orbit, and that would be less for sun synchronous orbit. Solar panels made for space could be lighter, but would have faster degradation than on Earth. And if the company is paying $35-45 million per 20,000 lbs of solar panels … that’s a ton of extra solar panels and batteries you could buy here on Earth.Read more: SpaceX Dragon delivers solar arrays to the International Space StationPhoto: Xidian UniversityUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/16,"Equally important as adopting renewables is ensuring the buildings they power are also sustainable. Electrek spoke with Breana Wheeler, US director of operations at BREEAM, the world’s first green building certification program, about what the ideal decarbonized building looks like and how US real estate investors should see climate change as an opportunity.Electrek: What does BREEAM do, and what does the ideal decarbonized building look like?Breana Wheeler: BREEAM was the first green building certification program in the world when it launched in 1990, and it has been recognized and adopted in more than 89 countries. It’s owned by BRE – a profit-for-purpose organization with over 100 years of building science and research background.An ideal decarbonized building is one that has a highly efficient building envelope, is fully electrified, and can operate entirely on renewable energy – such as solar or wind – generated onsite. It would also have a low embodied carbon footprint, measured and managed through the materials and construction processes throughout its life cycle. BREEAM helps clients measure and manage carbon emissions through all stages of decarbonization.Electrek: To what extent do you think the EPA vs. West Virginia Supreme Court ruling – which sharply curtailed the authority of the EPA to regulate emissions that cause climate change – will negatively impact the path to the decarbonization of buildings?Breana Wheeler: The EPA vs. West Virginia Supreme Court ruling has elicited a strong response from industry leaders across markets, as the federal government is an important enabler in tackling climate change. However, I am confident that cities and states will continue to take the lead and fill in gaps left by the federal government in this area, whether through Building Performance Standards, building codes, or public utility commissions. Further, public knowledge and understanding of climate risk continues to grow each day. Investors, the business community, and municipalities have demonstrated an acute understanding of the potential ramifications should climate change go unchecked. These people and organizations are continuing to drive climate-related performance improvements and are well-aligned in trajectory, regardless of this ruling.Electrek: How can state and local governments fill gaps left by the Supreme Court ruling?Breana Wheeler: There are many local governments developing and executing climate action plans. With buildings making up large portions of most city footprints, we’re seeing many local jurisdictions consider how they can use their policy levers to fight climate change. Energy benchmarking ordinances, which require buildings to measure and report their energy usage, are an important first step. Transparency often pushes buildings to begin to manage the performance they are reporting when they see how they are comparing to their peer buildings. Building Performance Standards, which require measuring and reporting as well as certain levels of performance with the threat of penalty if not met, go one step further. In cities like New York, Boston, and St. Louis, we’ve seen Building Performance Standards ensure that the cost of poor performance is clear.  Cities have divested pension funds from fossil fuels, and states such as California have enacted programs such as the Climate Change Scoping Plan, which encourages local governments to set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below 1990 levels by 2020, 40% below 1990 levels in 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.Thirty states, Washington, D.C., and two US territories have active renewable or clean energy requirements, and an additional three states and one territory have set voluntary renewable energy goals. New York, California, and Illinois have policies that require a large portion of their power to come from renewables within the next few decades. I expect these efforts to be tightened and fortified following the ruling with increased urgency as the effects of climate change continue to be felt.Electrek: If state or local governments choose not to pursue the decarbonization path, can the private sector make a difference?Breana Wheeler: Arguably, it’s the private sector that has been leading on climate change in the US. Investors in the private sector are increasingly aware that climate change poses a significant financial risk to their assets. A built environment that is not resilient results in an interrupted economy, threatens public health, and can damage the long-term value of real estate. If change is not implemented now, investors run the risk of reduced returns and potentially stranded assets. The most forward-thinking investors see climate change not only as a threat but also as an opportunity. Consequently, they have invested $31 billion into climate mutual funds and exchange-traded funds by the end of 2021, a 45% increase from roughly $22 billion the year prior, according to a Morningstar report.There is great financial opportunity in facilitating a more equitable, sustainable decarbonized future, and investors are pursuing strategies to fund climate change solutions while maintaining competitiveness in global markets.Electrek: To what extent do you think the general public is embracing and acting on the need for the decarbonization of buildings within the context of the climate crisis?Breana Wheeler: Climate change is a crisis that will affect, and already has affected, individuals on a global scale – aggregating social issues such as food scarcity, poverty, and inequality. In the US, the scale of the damage is growing: As of July, there were nine disasters costing over $1 billion just this year, and the impacts of the extreme heatwaves have yet to be fully measured. In recent years, we have seen the vast majority of Americans calling on both federal and local governments to step up and enact policies to mitigate the effects of climate change. The science is clear – we must act to avoid the worst impacts within the next decade. The real estate sector has a responsibility to address the impacts. We’re excited to be working with many organizations who have recognized climate change risks and want to manage them and turn them into opportunities.Read more: The US Supreme Court EPA ruling is really bad, but here’s why all is not lostPhoto by Scott Webb on Pexels.comBreana Wheeler became the US director of operations in 2016 for the Building Research Establishment (BRE), a 100-year-old building science research organization focused on delivering better, healthier buildings for people and for the environment.

2022/09/15,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) yesterday released a study stating that 80% of US coal power plant sites could be converted to nuclear power plant sites in order to help the US achieve net zero by 2050.Out of 157 retired coal plant sites and 237 operating coal plant sites that the study team identified, 80% have the potential to host advanced reactors smaller than the gigawatt scale. (Smaller nuclear reactors are cheaper and considered to be safer.) The study, which was conducted by Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory and sponsored by the Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy, states:For the recently retired plant sites evaluated, this represents a capacity potential of 64.8 GWe to be backfit at 125 sites. For the operating plant sites evaluated, this represents a capacity potential of 198.5 GWe to be backfit at 190 sites.Based on the study’s hypothetical case study, which the authors say only informs at a “general level,” it notes that “nuclear overnight costs of capital could decrease by 15% to 35% when compared to a greenfield construction project” if the infrastructure of a coal plant of 1,200 MWe generation capacity was reused, depending on nuclear technology choices and sizes. The report continues:Nuclear replacement designs can have a lower capacity size because nuclear power plants run at higher capacity factors than coal power plants. In the case study replacing coal capacity with 924 MWe of nuclear capacity, the study team found regional economic activity could increase by as much as $275 million and add 650 new, permanent jobs to the region of analysis.The DOE says that “coal-to-nuclear transitions could save millions of dollars by reusing the coal plant’s electrical equipment (e.g., transmission lines, switchyards), cooling ponds or towers, and civil infrastructure such as roads and office buildings.” Further, the study found that emissions in a (hypothetical) region could fall by 86% if nuclear power plants replace large coal plants, which is the equivalent of removing more than 500,000 gas cars off the road. The US is a leading polluter, and it needs to reduce emissions now. Just this week, a new multi-agency report called United in Science (which the World Meteorological Organization coordinated) revealed that 2030 emissions reduction pledges need to be seven times higher in order to align with the 1.5C Paris Agreement goal. UN Secretary-General António Guterres cited the summer’s global weather disasters and said, “There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters. They are the price of humanity’s fossil fuel addiction.” Reuters notes that US power companies plan to retire or convert over 14,500 megawatts of coal-fired plants to natural gas in 2022, according to US Energy Information Administration and Thomson Reuters data. It’s pointless and destructive to spend millions to move from one fossil fuel to another.But nuclear also has some big drawbacks. Nuclear meltdowns are catastrophes, and reactors are often placed on coasts for easy access to water for cooling, and that’s where tsunamis and earthquakes occur. But nuclear plants are clean to run unlike fossil fuel plants, they’re more reliable than coal and gas, and they’re not an intermittent source of power.And nuclear reactors do not produce emissions while they’re operating.As my colleague Jameson Dow recently wrote, “Environmentalists are of two minds about nuclear power. On the one hand, it is highly energetic and produces zero carbon emissions; but on the other hand, it is costly and there is no permanent solution for radioactive waste.”We at Electrek cannot stress enough that we are first and foremost in favor of wind and solar renewable energy, and those renewables should be prioritized. But we are in a climate emergency, and the US, as a major emitter, needs to do whatever it takes to get off of fossil fuels quickly. Nuclear also takes a ton of time to bring online, so if the DOE can figure out a way to do that more quickly, then we want to hear what its strategy is.Read more: California sets 2045 net-zero goal, keeps nuke plant open, and moreUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/07,"Installation of all 80 offshore wind turbines off the west coast of France has been completed, with France’s first offshore wind farm scheduled to be up and running by the end of the year. The Saint Nazaire site will produce enough power to cover 20% of total electricity consumption of the Loire-Atlantic, or around 700,000 people.  In a bid to promote renewable energy, French president Emmanuel Macron was set to visit the site this Monday, but it has been pushed back due to driving rain and rough seas this week. Back in February, Macron announced the government’s plan to have around 40 GW of offshore wind capacity up and running by 2050, or about 50 offshore wind farms off the country’s coasts. And now he is working to urgently push a new bill that will increase the amount of land where wind turbines can be constructed as well as provide some compensation for residents living near wind farm sites. France heavily relies on nuclear energy, which accounts for around 75% of total production, while renewable and fossil fuels make up around 18%, and the bulk of renewable energy comes from hydroelectricity. While France has been slow to adopt offshore wind power, the country is making a strong push from its reliance on fossil fuels, and by 2030 wind is expected to outpace hydropower in the country. In addition, Russia’s war with Ukraine has put further tensions on the situation with steep price hikes on electricity and potential cutoffs from gas supplies, should Russia decide to do so. However, offshore wind turbines are hotly debated in France, with pushback from environmental groups and fishing industries, who make solid claims on the high stakes of the game, and of course the residents and tourism industries, who want a nice view. This project, which was originally approved by the government back in 2012, has been beset with local opposition and governmental delays, and like all renewable infrastructure of this scale, fraught with competing interests.  Back in April, the project’s first wind turbine was set in place, and is now ahead of schedule and set to be fully operational by the end of this year. Developed by the renewables arm of France’s EDF and Enbridge, the wind farm will have a capacity of 480 MW and uses Haliade 150-6 MW turbines. With nearby Nantes Saint-Nazaire as the project’s hub, Jan De Nul’s jack-up vessel Vole au vent installed the turbines in sets of four, where the 1,500-tonne main crane of the vessel mounted them on top of monopile foundations, which were placed anywhere from 12 km to 20 km off the coast. Installing one turbine took about 24 hours, with each installation trip taking around five days. This summer, the French government also solidified two zones for offshore wind farms off the coast of the Atlantic following a massive public debate involving 15,000 participants, with environmental protection being the top concern on the table, particularly the risk to migrating birds in the region, some of them already endangered. The first wind farm is targeted off the island of Oléron, more than 35 km off the coast of La Rochelle, with a capacity of around 1,000 MW. The second wind farm will likely be located farther out at sea, and be either floating or a fixed-bottom foundation, depending on the results of ongoing ecological studies on both locations. The two wind farms would together produce the equivalent to the electricity consumption of 1.6 million people.",solar
2022/09/06,"London-based SolarBotanic Trees officially launched its “solar tree” prototype today, and the company wants to use it to power EV charging stations first.The SolarBotanic energy tree, which features what the company says is the “world’s first” 3-D leaf-shaped photovoltaic nanotechnology, utilizes thin-film solar cells and has a power generation capacity of 5 kilowatts.SolarBotanic developed its energy trees with Co-Innovate, which is a London-based small-to-medium enterprise business support program that taps into academic and innovation resources at Brunel University London, the Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC) in Coventry, and the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre’s Design and Prototyping Group. Sheffield University’s center will test SolarBotanic’s solar tree prototype.The company has designed the solar trees to feed harvested power into an AI-driven energy storage and management system (EMS). That EMS will regulate and release the power. So in a nutshell, it’s a solar and storage system shaped like a tree. SolarBotanic Trees says its first-generation solar tree will be available in early 2023, and the company asserts that it will be affordable once it’s mass produced. SolarBotanic’s website states its funding strategy:A further funding round is planned in H1/2023 to fund the commercial production startup and scale to commercial volumes over the following 36 months.  Discussions are ongoing with key supply chain partners covering manufacture, installation logistics, and in service support.The company’s target market will first be “rapid electric vehicle charging market for homes, businesses, and commercial car parks.” The solar tree can be linked and can form part of a local grid, or it can feed into the main grid.So … what’s the unique selling point of this ground-mounted solar tree? There’s already another “botanical” solar array on the market shaped like a giant daisy called the Smartflower. The Smartflower is a ground-mounted solar array that is comparable to a 4 kW system. It’s so cool looking that my husband and I were ready to order one until we found out that it’s expensive, has limited output, and it also has a short system warranty of just five years. I think of the Smartflower as the Smeg retro refrigerator of solar options: It’s just not a practical choice, no matter how cute it is, so we wistfully had to walk away from both.So, if SolarBotanic Trees manages to achieve affordability for both commercial and residential, and has a longer system warranty along with its fantastic aesthetics, then there could be solar trees taking root all over the place within a couple years.Read more: These rooftop solar vacuum tubes that make both electricity and heat are US-boundUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/05,"Five of Asia’s biggest economies are expected to see exponential growth of solar, positioning the region to become a global hub of solar power, according to independent energy think tank Ember.Ember analyzed existing national power sector development plans across China, Japan, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. It found that solar capacity is expected to grow an average of 22% annually across the five economies. Of the five, the fastest solar capacity growth rates are expected in Indonesia – 41.81% – and the Philippines – 34.64%:Indonesia plans to add 4.68 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity by 2030. If implemented, this would mean that Indonesia would have built 25 times more capacity than its current level  of 180 MW. But Indonesia’s share of solar electricity generation is less than 0.2% – the lowest rate of G20 countries – and that’s far beneath what the country is capable of. For context, Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous nation and the 10th largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, according to the World Bank.China doesn’t have an isolated goal for its future solar capacity additions, but for perspective, China’s goal is to install 1,200 GW of both wind and solar by 2030. Ember notes that solar power has accounted for a 50% share of China’s capacity additions on average between 2012 and 2021.Ember’s Muyi Yang, Asia senior electricity policy analyst, said: China could reach a total capacity of at least 600 GW of solar by 2030. We believe this to be a cautious estimate, as some analysts estimate that China could reach its 1,200 GW wind and solar goals as soon as 2026.The Philippines legislated in 2019 that it would add 18 GW of solar by 2030, and the country’s largest solar company, Solar Philippines, is working to surpass the 10 GW mark by 2025. If achieved, the 2030 mark would be almost 12 times more than the country’s current level of 1,370 MW.Ember asserts that the Philippines’ new administration also seems set on reviewing several key energy systems planning and management policies. That will be crucial for both the rapid construction of solar farms and grid preparation.Isabella Suarez, Southeast Asian energy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said:The Philippines is certainly on track to meet its target with all 18 GW of its 2030 target already accounted for in the proposed project pipeline.India is planning to achieve 300 GW of solar by 2030, a sixfold increase on current levels. If the country meets its goal, it would have one of the largest solar fleets by the end of the decade. According to Ember’s state-by-state analysis conducted in April, India added a record 14 GW of new solar capacity in the 12 months leading up to March 2022, beating its previous record of 9.4 GW installed in 2018. One of India’s key challenges for managing its solar growth includes investing in the stabilization of its grid and comprehensive policy reform to accommodate the expansion of rooftop solar.In 2021, solar accounted for 9.3% of Japan’s annual electricity generation, up from 8.5% the previous year. Japan has a forecast of between 154 and 180 GW of installed solar by 2030, according to Japanese PV industry consulting company RTS Corporation, but Ember puts it at just over 100 GW. Japan increased its renewable power generation target overall from the previous 22-24% to 36-38% by 2030. Renewables are forecast to account for 34.6% of Japan’s generation mix in 2030, falling just short of its goal.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/09/02,"UK-based solar tech developer Naked Energy’s rooftop solar vacuum tubes, which produce both electricity and heat, will soon be sold in the United States.Peoria, Illinois-headquartered ELM Companies, a US energy storage and microgrid specialist, is funding Naked Energy, along with banking giant Barclays and US venture capital firm Big Sky Partners. ELM Solar, ELM Companies’ new division, will distribute Naked Energy’s solar thermal and PV thermal products, which are called Virtu (pronounced “virtue”). ELM Solar will also distribute Virtu products through ELM Companies’ large dealer network and partnerships across the United States.ELM has also announced, following the US Senate passing the Biden Administrations’s climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, a couple weeks ago, that it will build a factory in Texas to assemble Naked Energy’s Virtu product line domestically. The Inflation Reduction Act has spurred on a race in the United States to manufacture renewables domestically.Solar vacuum tubes are made up of two layers of glass with a vacuum in between, kind of like a Thermos. Naked Energy claims that its Virtu products are three to four times more efficient than traditional PV solar panels, and ELM calls Naked Energy a developer of the “world’s highest energy density solar technology” in its news announcement.Naked Energy says its Virtu products’ vacuum tube minimizes thermal losses to the atmosphere, resulting in high efficiency, even in cold weather. Absorber ​plates in the tubes​ are ​tilted to an optimum angle so that they can be used on flat or pitched roofs, and also vertical facades.Virtu products are fully modular, so they have a low installation cost. They also have a low-profile design that reduces wind shear. Naked Energy says that its Virtu products are best suited to buildings with high heat demand, such as multi-dwelling residential, manufacturing plants, and hotels.The VirtuHOT product heats water only, up to 90C (194F), from solar power. But the VirtuPVT product combines solar PV and solar thermal technology to generate both electricity and heat from a single solar collector. Of course, VirtuPVT’s tubes require less space than if there were separate thermal and PV systems being used.This video demonstrates how VirtuPVT works:Lee C Graves, chairman and founder of ELM said:We’ve seen a significant uptick in interest for renewable energy solutions across the United States. In the face of rising energy prices, we’re pleased to be working with Naked Energy to provide the country with renewable alternatives.When we were introduced to Naked Energy and the Virtu product range it was a no-brainer for us to work with them. Naked Energy’s Virtu products are versatile and efficient, and the VirtuPVT is especially attention grabbing. What’s not to like about heat and electricity coming from a single tube?Solar vacuum tubes have always been more efficient than solar panels, but they were also more expensive. But solar manufacturing costs and new manufacturing innovations have brought the cost of solar vacuum tubes down. Naked Energy’s spec sheets don’t state the cost of these, and I suspect they’re still a bit too pricey for individual households. But these could be a real game changer for bigger properties like hotels and hospitals, and maybe in the future, with further innovation and price drops, they’ll become the default choice for household solar.

2022/09/01,"US shipments of solar panels – including imports, exports, and domestically produced and shipped panels – rose to a record electricity-generating capacity of 28.8 million peak kilowatts (kW) in 2021, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). That was up from 21.8 million peak kW in 2020.In 2021, about 80% of US solar panel module shipments were imports, and they primarily came from Asia.The EIA notes of its data reporting:US solar panel shipments closely track domestic solar capacity additions; differences between the two usually result from the lag time between shipment and installation. We categorize solar capacity additions as either utility-scale (facilities with 1 megawatt of capacity or more) or small-scale (largely residential solar installations).The United States added 13.2 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar capacity in 2021. That was an annual record, and it was 25% more than the 10.6 GW of utility-scale solar added in 2020.Small-scale solar capacity installations in the United States increased by 5.4 GW in 2021, up 23% from 2020, which saw 4.4 GW added. Residential installations made up more than 3.9 GW of small-scale installations in 2021, compared with 2.9 GW in 2020.As Electrek reported on August 29, Bloomberg NEF (BNEF) reported that US homeowners are expected to install a record 5.6 GW of residential solar in 2022. BNEF predicts that residential solar will outpace commercial solar every year to 2030.In 2021, five states accounted for 46% of all US solar panel shipments. The top five states were:To state the obvious, solar is only going to keep growing in the United States, and there are a number of reasons for this. Electricity costs and fossil fuel prices are surging, and they’re not expected to drop. Contrast this with the declining cost of solar panels, which dropped 11% from 2020 to 2021. And that’s despite project delays and supply chain problems and things like the US Department of Commerce investigation into solar manufacturing in Southeast Asia.When homeowners buy a solar plus battery storage system, the payments are set over the course of whatever number of years they choose to pay it off, if they don’t pay cash up front. And those payments won’t go up – unlike the cost of electricity or fuels like propane or oil. (This, plus my desire to reduce our emissions, is one of the reasons why I’m about to put solar panels on my roof, along with two Tesla Powerwalls.)And, the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act is expected to create a clean energy boom. Just yesterday, we reported that First Solar, the largest US solar panel maker, announced that it will invest up to $1.2 billion to ramp up production of US-made solar panels. The company’s CEO cited the Inflation Reduction Act as a catalyst for the announcement. Many more new domestic clean energy manufacturing initiatives are bound to follow from other companies.We look forward to EIA’s report on solar panel shipments in 2021 this time next year. It will undoubtedly set a new record.Read more: Here’s how the US climate act will lower household energy billsPhoto by Pixabay on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/31,"The UK’s Hornsea 2, the world’s largest single offshore wind farm, is now fully operational.August 31 update: On August 17, Electrek reported that Hornsea 2 was expected to be fully commissioned before the end of August. Ørsted just slid into home plate today, the last day of the month: Hornsea 2 is now completely powered up. Electrek’s Take: This is a major milestone, not just in the UK, but globally, for offshore wind power and renewables in general. And it’s just the start, as Ørsted alone – not counting other offshore wind developers around the globe – has 8.9 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind in operation, around 2.2 GW under construction, and another approximately 11 GW of awarded capacity under development. Ørsted’s goal is to install 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 on a global scale. Now that the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act has passed, major offshore wind projects will line up even faster in the US, too, in new areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Maine, and off the California coast. We are already seeing alarming evidence of global warming. The offshore wind revolution can’t happen fast enough in order to prevent it from getting worse, so it’s heartening to see big projects like this come online.The 1.32 GW Hornsea 2 has dethroned the 1.2 GW Hornsea 1 as the largest operating offshore wind farm in the world. It’s 462 square kilometers (178 square miles) in size, and it can power more than 1.3 million homes. Together, Hornsea 1 and 2 are capable of powering 2.5 million homes. The 2.8 GW Hornsea 3, pictured on the map above, will follow in future, as it was awarded a contract for difference by the British government earlier in 2022. The Hornsea projects are off the east coast of England. Hornsea 2 features 165 Siemens Gamesa 8 megawatt (MW) turbines; most of the wind turbines’ blades were manufactured at Siemens Gamesa’s factory in Hull. Just one revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for a full 24 hours.Hornsea 2 features the world’s largest AC offshore substation, and it also has a Reactive Compensation Station (RCS). An RCS is required because of cable length, so it will compensate for reactive power losses in order to ensure power transmission efficiency. As Electrek reported on December 16, 2021, Hornsea 2 produced its first electricity that month. But according to Ørsted’s 2021 annual report: For Hornsea 2, we saw progress according to plan up until mid-December. However, the accelerating Omicron variant infection rates meant that it was not possible to man the vessels used for commissioning work according to plan.As a result, the ramp-up of the huge offshore wind farm was delayed until now.There are other big offshore wind projects in the pipeline globally, such as Ørsted’s Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, which is also expected to be commissioned this year.Equinor’s and SSE’s 4.8 GW Dogger Bank, off the Yorkshire coast in the UK, is expected to become the world’s largest offshore wind farm in 2026.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/29,"American homeowners are expected to install a record 5.6 gigawatts of residential solar in 2022, according to a new analysis from Bloomberg NEF (BNEF).BNEF found that 2022’s record US residential solar installations will be nearly three times that of the 1.9 GW of commercial solar installations expected this year. Both residential and commercial solar installations are predicted to grow steadily through 2030, and with residential solar outpacing commercial solar every year. BNEF predicts that 2030 will see 8.3 GW of residential and 4.3 GW of commercial solar installed.In May, Electrek noted that, according to a poll, American residential solar was installed for the following reasons:BNEF cites surging electricity prices and Inflation Reduction Act tax credit extensions as the reasons for accelerating residential solar adoption.Residential solar tax credits are currently at 26%, and they rise to 30% for solar equipment placed in service after January 1, 2023. The 30% applies to projects placed in service in 2022 as well. The tax credit then falls to 26% for 2033 and 22% for 2034.Americans are opting for rooftop solar and battery storage because, despite inflation and supply chain problems, solar and storage comes out cheaper than paying utility companies, especially as electricity bills rise. They also want to reduce reliance on the grid in the face of extreme weather.Read more: Here’s how Americans feel about rooftop solar and how it affects their house valuesPhoto: VCU Capital News Service/FlickrUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/26,"In March 2021, Electrek reported that scientists published a feasibility study about the benefits of erecting solar panels over canals. That study is about to become a reality when a pilot project breaks ground in California.August 26 update: Project Nexus in the Turlock Irrigation District, a $20 million project funded by the State of California, will break ground in mid-October at two locations: Josh Weimer, Turlock Water & Power’s external affairs manager, said [via Reuters]:If this is something that works on these first two miles of Project Nexus that we’re doing, there’s the potential that this could scale to multiple locations.If all 4,000 miles of California’s canals were covered with solar panels, that could produce 13 gigawatts of renewable power. A gigawatt is enough to power 750,000 homes, so that would be enough power for 9.75 million households. For perspective, as of July 2021, there were 13.1 million households in California.March 1: The California Department of Water Resources, utility company Turlock Irrigation District (TID), Marin County, California-based water and energy project developer Solar AquaGrid, and The University of California, Merced, are partnering on Project Nexus – a “nod to the water-energy nexus paradigm gaining attention among public utilities.”India already has solar panels over canals, but the mile-long Project Nexus in California’s San Joaquin Valley will be the first of its kind in the US. TID explains what the pilot is:Project Nexus includes the installation of solar panel canopies over various sections of Turlock Irrigation District’s (TID) irrigation canals. Project Nexus will serve as a Proof of Concept to pilot and further study solar over canal design, deployment, and co-benefits on behalf of the State of California using TID infrastructure and electrical grid access.The project is anticipated to break ground in fall 2022 and be complete by the end of 2024.Project Nexus will provide the opportunity to see whether the solar panels reduce water evaporation as the result of midday shade and wind mitigation; create improvements to water quality throughreduced vegetative growth; reduce canal maintenance as a result of reduced vegetative growth; andof course, generate renewable electricity.Roger Bales, distinguished professor of engineering at the University of California, Merced, who is working on this project, wrote in the Conversation:Most of California’s rain and snow falls north of Sacramento during the winter, while 80% of its water use occurs in Southern California, mostly in summer. That’s why canals snake across the state – it’s the largest such system in the world. We estimate that about 1-2% of the water they carry is lost to evaporation under the hot California sun.In a 2021 study, we showed that covering all 4,000 miles of California’s canals with solar panels would save more than 65 billion gallons of water annually by reducing evaporation. That’s enough to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or meet the residential water needs of more than 2 million people. By concentrating solar installations on land that is already being used, instead of building them on undeveloped land, this approach would help California meet its sustainable management goals for both water and land resources.Read more: Solar panels and California’s canals could make a winning pairPhoto: Robin Raj, Citizen Group & Solar AquagridUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/25,"Renewables provided more than 25% of electrical generation in the United States during the first half of 2022, according to new data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).The latest issue of the EIA’s “Electric Power Monthly” report released yesterday, which contains data through June 30, 2022, shows that in the first half of 2022, renewables – biomass, geothermal, hydropower, wind, and solar, including small-scale solar such as rooftop solar – increased their electrical output by 18.45% compared to the first half of 2021. On August 16, the EIA projected that renewables will provide 22% of US electrical output in 2022. That projection was surpassed halfway through the year, as renewables have already provided 25.23% of total US electrical generation.For the six-month period to June 30, electrical generation by wind increased by 24.67% and provided 11.55% of total electrical generation. Meanwhile, solar sources grew by 27.72% and provided 4.94% of US electrical output. Renewables outproduced both coal and nuclear power by 28.76% and 38.81%, respectively. The combination of just wind and solar generated almost as much as the United States’ nuclear power plants: 344,685 gigawatt hours vs. 379,927 gigawatt hours.Ken Bossong, executive director of the SUN DAY Campaign, who reviewed the EIA data, said: Now providing one-quarter of the [US’s] electrical output, it is conceivable that with the incentives provided by the new Inflation Reduction Act, wind, solar, and other renewables will reach the one-third point within the next few years and dominate electrical generation thereafter.However, S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that in the second quarter of 2022, wind developers connected 945 megawatts of new capacity to US grids – a 77% drop from the same quarter in 2021. (Keep in mind that connecting new capacity is distinct from electrical generation.) S&P writes:The decline in additions occurred as the US wind industry was waiting to see if Congress would reinstate production tax credits for new onshore wind farms, with wind equipment manufacturers experiencing delays in orders amid policy uncertainty, supply chain disruptions and rising prices.But with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act last week, that drop is expected to be reversed. S&P continues:Looking ahead, the US has a strong wind project development pipeline, with 73.4 GW through 2026, according to Market Intelligence data. Of that total, 31% is in advanced development or under construction. For 2022, 13 GW is in various stages of development, with almost 6.2 GW, or 48%, under construction and another nearly 1.5 GW, or 11%, in advanced development.Read more: US hits a record 20% of electricity from wind and solar in AprilPhoto: Amol Mande on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/23,"Seagreen offshore wind farm, 16.7 miles (27 km) off the coast of Angus in eastern Scotland, has generated its first power. The £3 billion ($3.54 billion) project will be Scotland’s largest offshore wind farm. It will also be the world’s deepest fixed-bottom offshore wind farm, as it’s being sited in water depths of up to 194 feet (59 meters).The first of Seagreen’s offshore wind turbines was commissioned yesterday morning. It is one of 114 Vestas turbines that were installed starting in December 2021 — and it was the first 10 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbine installed in Europe.The 1,075 MW farm is expected to be fully operational in the first half of 2023.Seagreen is owned by French energy giant TotalEnergies and UK clean energy developer SSE Renewables. TotalEnergies acquired a 51% stake in Seagreen in June 2020, and SSE Renewables will operate Seagreen for its expected 25-year life span.Once it’s fully operational, Seagreen will produce around 5 terawatt hours (TWh) of clean electricity annually, which is enough to power more than 1.6 million UK households. Or in other words, the equivalent of around two-thirds of all households in Scotland.Paul Cooley, director of offshore Wind at SSE Renewables, said:We often talk about key milestones along a project’s journey, and Seagreen has had a number to date, but to see this turbine turning in the North Sea and to have reached first power safely, is a fantastic achievement for everyone connected to the project. The project has already brought several benefits to the local community, the UK supply chain and, once completed, Seagreen will make a significant contribution to Scotland and the UK’s ambitious renewable energy targets.Read more: The world’s most powerful wind turbine will make its debut in ScotlandUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/22,"Denver-based Guzman Energy almost didn’t get approval for a solar farm it’s going to build in western Colorado, but when the wholesale power provider agreed to add irrigation to support 1,000 sheep and possibly host beehives, it then gained unanimous approval from Delta County, Colorado’s commissioners.When Guzman Energy’s 80-megawatt (MW) Garnet Mesa Solar Project is complete, it will become Colorado’s largest agrivoltaic installation. The $80 million solar farm will sit on 383 acres and generate more than 194,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity annually, which is enough to power 18,000 homes. No construction date has yet been provided.Electric cooperative Delta-Montrose Electric Association (DMEA) will directly purchase a portion of the energy produced by the solar farm, and Guzman Energy will offtake the rest as power supply to serve additional wholesale customers. It will enable DMEA to reach 20% local generation.Agrivoltaics is defined as the use of land for solar power and agriculture together. An Oregon State University study published in 2019 found that “if less than 1% of agricultural land was converted to solar panels, it would be sufficient to fulfill global electric energy demand.” And the two things can indeed peacefully coexist.The Denver Post notes:Guzman Energy, which is working with Citra Power to build the solar farm, plans to spend about $1.5 million on landscaping and irrigation. Preliminary plans call for planting 590 trees and 1,440 shrubs.Sheep and solar panels paired together are a win-win because the solar panels provide shade and shelter for the sheep, and the sheep keep the grass trimmed, so the solar farm owners don’t have to maintain the grass. Also, the sheep get to eat for free. (It’s a bit trickier with cows, though, because they’re bigger, so solar arrays would need to be taller and sturdier.)Further, the shade the solar panels create reduces heat and light underneath, thus helping to save water. In the drought-hit US West, that’s another win.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office are running an ongoing agrivoltaics research project called Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE), and it’s just completed its second phase of research.Jordan Macknick, NREL’s lead energy-water-land analyst and principal investigator for the InSPIRE project, said in an August 18 NREL article:Through our work, which spans multiple regions, configurations, and agricultural activities, we’ve seen so many initial promising results. Now, our challenge is to figure out how to scale up and replicate these successes.Photo: SolsticeUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/19,"US President Joe Biden signed the big climate bill – the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – earlier this week. Electrek spoke with Dan Gayer, JD, CPA, a senior manager in the tax practice at Baker Newman Noyes, about how homeowners can claim tax credits and rebates as they work to achieve energy efficiency and lower their energy bills.Changes to the former Nonbusiness Energy Property credit, now renamed the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, will take effect on January 1, 2023.The old credit was worth 10% of the costs of installing insulation, windows, doors, roofing, and other energy-saving improvements. The old $500 lifetime limitation still applies for the rest of 2022. From 2023, a $1,200 annual tax credit limit will replace the old $500 lifetime limit. The tax credit will be equal to 30% of the costs for all eligible home improvements made during the year. It has also been expanded to cover things such as biomass stoves and boilers, electric panels, and home energy audits.Beginning in 2023, annual limits for particular types of qualifying alterations were improved. For example, it’s $250 for an exterior door, or $500 for all exterior doors; $600 for exterior windows and skylights; and $2,000 for heat pump and heat pump hot water heaters for homeowners who don’t qualify for the rebate due to higher household income – see below. (The latter $2,000 is the exception to the $1,200 annual limit.)The Residential Clean Energy Credit, which is now extended through 2034, was previously called the Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit.The credit amount for installing clean household energy such as solar, wind, or geothermal has been raised from 26% to 30% from 2022 to 2032. It then falls to 26% for 2033 and 22% for 2034.Gayer says of the timing of household solar tax credits:On the solar credits, both the residential credits and business investment tax credits are back to 30% effective for solar equipment placed in service any time after January 1, 2022.  Editor’s note: We updated the year from 2023 to 2022 on the above quote about household solar on September 8 to reflect changes.Gayer went on to explain how homeowners can secure tax credits for both the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit under the IRA umbrella:The mechanics of claiming this credit appear to be the same in 2022 and 2023 as they were in the past – the credit is claimed on the purchaser’s individual income tax return. The purchaser does not need to submit specific documentation with the tax return, but should retain documentation as part of their tax records so they can prove they purchased eligible property in the event of an IRS audit. Vendors should be able to provide purchasers with this type of documentation. In 2024 and future years, manufacturers need to create a specific product identification number for each qualifying product they sell, and purchasers must include this number on their tax returns to claim the credit.August 20 update: Some readers have asked for battery storage clarification, and quite rightly so. Here’s the lowdown: Before the IRA, it was 26% tax credit for battery storage charged with onsite solar only. Under the IRA, it follows the same timeline as solar, starting at 30% tax credit from January 1, 2022 (see above). But the big change is that the tax credit will now be available from 2023 for storage batteries with a capacity of at least 3 kWh, regardless of energy source.The IRA’s $4.28 billion High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program will provide an upfront rebate of up to $8,000 to install heat pumps that can both heat and cool homes. It also provides a rebate of up to $1,750 for heat pump water heaters.There’s also a rebate of up to $840 to offset the cost of a heat-pump clothes dryer or an electric stove, including induction ranges. If a home needs an electrical panel upgrade to support new electrical appliances, then there’s up to a $4,000 rebate to help with that. There’s also a rebate of up to $2,500 for electrical wiring improvements. And for one of the most cost-efficient and quickest ways to make a home more energy-efficient – insulation and sealing – there’s a rebate of up to $1,600. Homeowners will be able to collect a maximum of $14,000 total in rebates. Household income cannot exceed 150% of the area median income as calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to qualify. (Here’s an Area Median Income Lookup Tool from Fannie Mae to see what your limit is.) According to the bill itself, rebates start after December 31, 2022.Gayer elaborated on the details of how the rebates will work:The Inflation Reduction Act does not give specifics on how this rebate will be administered – the details here are left to the Treasury Department to issue general guidelines and then provide grants to state governments, who are the ones charged with actually implementing the program and giving out the rebates.The intent here is to provide rebates to qualified purchasers at the point of sale, so this will be a direct discount on the purchase price rather than a credit claimed on a tax return.Given how much still needs to happen at both the federal and state levels to write more detailed rules and get the necessary administrative procedures set up, it seems unlikely that this rebate program will be up and running until sometime in 2023, and the exact details of the program may be different in every state.The rebate program will run through September 30, 2031, and the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit will run through 2032.Photo: “Three pigeons on a roof” by Dunnock_D is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0Read more: If the big US climate bill passes, here’s how it could turbocharge solar and windUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/18,"Electric utility FirstEnergy Corp., which serves most of northern West Virginia, is going to repurpose a former coal ash landfill for a utility-scale solar farm.The Natural Resources Defense Council explains what coal ash is, and notes that it’s the US’s second-largest waste stream behind household trash:Coal ash is a general term – it refers to whatever waste is leftover after coal is combusted, usually in a coal-fired power plant. It contains arsenic, mercury, lead, and many other heavy metals. Coal ash is commonly divided into two subcategories based on particle size.Perhaps one of the reasons for coal ash’s relatively low profile is that it goes by so many names: coal ash, fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag. The coal ash landfill, which sits on 26 acres in Marlowe, Berkeley County, West Virginia, is located across the Potomac River from the R. Paul Smith Power Station in Maryland (pictured above), which closed in 2012. In June, FirstEnergy subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company was approved by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to end environmental monitoring at the coal ash landfill after removing all regulated materials and permanently closing the site. Coal ash from the site was used in cement manufacturing for 20 years.Another FirstEnergy subsidiary, electric company Mon Power, will build a 6 megawatt (MW) solar farm on the coal ash landfill site. That solar farm is part of a new West Virginia solar program to build five utility-scale solar farms that, combined, will have 50 MW of power generation.Of the five, one solar farm will be located on a 27-acre retired ash disposal site in Marion County, and another will be sited on a 44-acre reclaimed strip mine property in Tucker County.Mon Power and electric company Potomac Edison are currently accepting West Virginia customer subscriptions to purchase power from the five solar farms through solar renewable energy credits. Mon Power serves about 395,000 customers in 34 West Virginia counties, and Potomac Edison serves about 275,000 customers in seven counties in Maryland and 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.FirstEnergy explains what solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) are (and click on the link for more details):SRECs are certificates that represent the environmental attributes of solar power and prove solar energy was generated on the purchasers’ behalf. For every megawatt hour of solar renewable electricity generated, one SREC is produced. When fully operational, the five projects planned by Mon Power and Potomac Edison are expected to create more than 87,000 SRECs per year.Read more: West Virginia’s largest solar farm will sit on a former coal mining sitePhoto: WikimediaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/16,"US President Joe Biden today signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, and that’s going to give the transition of the United States to clean energy a big boost. According to the American Clean Power Association, the new law could add up to an additional 550 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from wind, solar, and other clean energy sources. Electrek spoke with Enrico Viale, head of renewable energy company Enel North America, about the challenges that states face as they move away from fossil fuels and how Enel is working with states to help them deploy clean energy, distributed energy resources, and energy storage.Electrek: What do you think are the biggest hurdles that states must overcome in order to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest? Enrico Viale: The global climate crisis is the most pressing challenge of our lifetimes, and the next decade will be crucial to achieving decarbonization targets set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. It is imperative that we transition from a reliance on fossil fuels to a sustainable, electrified economy powered by clean energy sources. Luckily, most of the solutions we need to decarbonize our economy already exist today. So, the challenge for states is scaling – building more projects and developing their clean energy workforce.In order to achieve a low-carbon future in the US, first, we must decarbonize the energy supply. This means states need to continue to encourage large, utility-scale clean energy projects like solar and wind to replace carbon-emitting energy sources like fossil fuel power plants. Second, we must modernize our energy infrastructure, which is aging and outdated. It’s critical we build out transmission and modernize the electric grid to work as a resilient, distributed, smart system delivering clean electricity to every corner of the US. That also includes participating in regional transmission organizations. Third, we must electrify our economy. Today, it’s technologically possible for industries and residents to electrify much of their operations and needs. We can replace gas cars with electric cars, gas furnaces with heat pumps, and diesel generators with renewable energy paired with a battery storage system. We also have demand response and demand management technologies to reduce energy use during times of high demand. The best option is no longer to burn fossil fuels onsite. We need to plug in.Together, these moves will allow states to decarbonize the electricity supply feeding our power grids, modernize the energy infrastructure carrying this electricity, and clean up the demand for energy by electrifying the economy to run on clean power. Electrek: What specific projects is Enel North America working on right now to help states transition to clean energy? Enrico Viale: In the past few months, we’ve launched several innovative projects that are moving the industry forward. First, we are focused on pairing large-scale renewable energy projects with battery storage. For North America and the rest of the world, reaching renewable energy targets depends on “hybrid power plants,” which often combine an energy source with battery storage. In Texas, we recently brought our first global large-scale wind and storage project online, Azure Sky wind + storage. The 350 megawatt wind project joins five other hybrid power plants we have in operation or under construction in the state, helping to increase resiliency in the ERCOT grid. The second is innovation in microgrids. Near our headquarters in Massachusetts, we recently launched a first-of-its-kind service station microgrid, which incorporates rooftop solar arrays, battery storage, and EV charging. The microgrid delivers an integrated power supply for the service station and a DC fast charger behind one utility meter. The goal of this microgrid is to build layers of resiliency to help the facility save money on energy bills and provide critical support to first responders and utility crews during a weather emergency. Finally, we’re continuing strong partnerships with utilities across the country to increase EV adoption supported by managed EV charging. Enel’s smart home charger can automatically charge an EV during off-peak hours, reducing strain on the grid and lowering energy costs for the consumer. Within the last few months, our team has partnered with several utilities, including Salt River Project [in Arizona], to bring EV charging infrastructure to consumers at a low cost. Electrek: Let’s look at Texas as a state case study. Texas is a clean energy leader, yet it’s having trouble with its grid due to extreme temperatures. What do you think Texas needs to do in order to stabilize its grid and better support its clean energy transition? Enrico Viale: Texas has an ever-growing population and increasingly hot summers, both of which are factors that have contributed to a significant increase in electricity demand that the state has experienced over the past year. An increase in demand at that rate would be a challenge for any state.Enel has more than 3.5 GW of renewable energy projects in operation or under construction there, so we’re playing an important role in Texas’ clean energy transition and understand what it will take to build a resilient grid. Right now, renewable energy projects are concentrated in western Texas, but the majority of the population, and therefore the majority of energy demand, is concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the state. As such, energy must travel across the state, on aging transmission infrastructure, to reach where it’s needed most. Ensuring power plants are distributed across the state and supported by a modern energy grid will ensure a more resilient energy supply. Texas also needs to further diversify its portfolio of resources and increase and accelerate battery storage deployments. Diversification provides some insulation against significant loss of generation either by type or geography. So, if there’s geographic and technological diversification in generation sources, the potential for large outages is limited. And, battery storage can fill the gaps when wind and solar are not generating enough to support the grid. Lastly, the cheapest, cleanest, and most resilient kilowatt-hour of electricity is the one you don’t use. Enel manages more than 100 MW of demand response in Texas, and time and time again we see the benefits of paying businesses to curb their energy usage. The Texas Public Utility Commission recognizes the value of demand response and recently approved a budget increase of $75 million for Emergency Response Service. As demand for electricity increases in ERCOT, encouraging more customer participation in demand response programs will be a critical component for grid resiliency.Read more: Rhode Island sets fastest timeline of any US state to reach 100% renewable electricityPhoto: Enel North AmericaEnrico Viale was appointed head of North America at Enel Group in July 2019.

2022/08/15,"Clean energy accounted for more than two-thirds of the new US electrical generating capacity added during the first six months of 2022, according to data recently released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).Wind (5,722 megawatts) and solar (3,895 MW) provided 67.01% of the 14,352 MW in utility-scale (that is, greater than 1 MW) capacity that came online during the first half of 2022. Additional capacity was provided by geothermal (26 MW), hydropower (7 MW), and biomass (2 MW). The balance came from natural gas (4,695 MW) and oil (5 MW). No new capacity was reported for 2022 from either nuclear power or coal.This brings clean energy’s share of total US available installed generating capacity up to 26.74%. To put that in perspective, five years ago, clean energy’s share was 19.7%. Ten years ago, it was 14.76%. FERC reports that there may be as much as 192,507 MW of new solar capacity on the way, with 66,315 MW classified as “high-probability” additions and no offsetting “retirements.” The “high-probability” additions alone would nearly double utility-scale solar’s current installed capacity of 74,530 MW, while successful completion of all expected projects would nearly quadruple it. Notably, FERC’s forecast predates President Joe Biden signing into law the Inflation Reduction Act, and that will likely ramp up solar growth even more. In addition, new wind capacity by June 2025 could total 70,393 MW, with 17,383 MW being “high probability” and only 158 MW of retirements expected. Thus, installed wind capacity could grow by at least 12%.“High-probability” generation capacity additions for utility-scale solar and wind combined, minus anticipated retirements, reflect a projected net increase of 83,540 MW over the next three years, or over 2,300 MW per month. That figure does not include new distributed, small-scale solar capacity or additions by hydropower, geothermal, and biomass.  SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong, who reviewed and reported on the data, said in an emailed statement:With each new monthly Infrastructure report from FERC, the prospects for renewable sources, especially solar and wind, brighten while those for natural gas, coal, and nuclear power continue to slide.By the end of this decade, the mix of renewable energy sources should constitute the largest share of the nation’s electrical generating capacity.Read more: Here’s how the US climate act will lower household energy billsPhoto by Kindel Media on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/12,"Scientists have come up with a way to make wind farms more energy efficient, and it doesn’t require new investment.Wind turbines are controlled as freestanding units and only maximize their own power production, but the wake of each wind turbine impacts each other. MIT’s Esther and Harold E. Edgerton assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering Michael F. Howland explains:Essentially all existing utility-scale turbines are controlled ‘greedily’ and independently.From a flow-physics standpoint, putting wind turbines close together in wind farms is often the worst thing you could do. The ideal approach to maximize total energy production would be to put them as far apart as possible.But if wind turbines are spread out, that increases associated costs, so it’s not a practical solution.Howland led a team of scientists supported by MIT and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy who published a new study yesterday in the journal Nature Energy. The researchers found – based on real-world tests at a utility-scale wind farm in India – that a wind farm’s energy output can be increased if individual turbines are optimized and the wind flow is modeled collectively.MIT News explains the team’s findings:Today, each turbine constantly senses the incoming wind direction and speed and uses its internal control software to adjust its yaw (vertical axis) angle position to align as closely as possible to the wind. But in the new system, for example, the team has found that by turning one turbine just slightly away from its own maximum output position — perhaps 20 degrees away from its individual peak output angle — the resulting increase in power output from one or more downwind units will more than make up for the slight reduction in output from the first unit. By using a centralized control system that takes all of these interactions into account, the collection of turbines was operated at power output levels that were as much as 32% higher under some conditions.Howland estimates that, translated to the world’s existing fleet of wind turbines, a 1.2% overall energy improvement would produce more than 31 terawatt-hours of additional electricity per year, approximately equivalent to installing an extra 3,600 wind turbines at no cost. This would translate into some $950 million in extra revenue for the wind farm operators per year, he says.The algorithm has the potential to be useful in any geographical location, and new hardware installation is not required to implement this efficiency improvement; it just requires making a software change. And reducing wake losses means turbines can be clustered even more closely together, thus saving on land or sea footprints. Varun Sivaram, who made the real-world test in India possible because he was then chief technology officer of ReNew Power, India’s largest renewable energy company (and he’s now senior adviser to US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, said [via the California Institute of Technology]:At the end, everyone was blown away by the magnitude of what was accomplished: an improvement in performance that costs nothing in terms of infrastructure investment to achieve.ReNew Power is now using the study’s findings to optimize its other wind farms, and the research team is now going to turn its attention to offshore wind farms, which have a whole new set of challenges and opportunities.Read more: If the big US climate bill passes, here’s how it could turbocharge solar and windUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/11,"Despite pushback from residents, the Supreme Court of Ohio yesterday approved a permit for the construction of North America’s first freshwater offshore wind farm, which will be sited in Lake Erie, around eight miles north of Cleveland.Residents of Bratenahl, a village in Ohio’s Cuyahoga County on the southern shore of Lake Erie, sued to stop the Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation’s (LEEDCo) Icebreaker Wind, a six-turbine, 20.7-megawatt (MW) offshore wind demonstration project, which will test offshore wind viability in the Great Lakes.LEEDCo wrote:Lake Erie is an ideal location for offshore wind, with ample available interconnect capacity, large load centers along the coast, growing energy demand due to existing plant retirements, a strong manufacturing base, and limited other sources of renewable energy.The Bratenahl residents objected to the project on the basis of it not having enough evidence that it wouldn’t harm birds and bats, and that the project would not serve the public interest as defined by Ohio law. They also don’t want further wind farms to be installed in Lake Erie.The Supreme Court of Ohio ruled 6-1 in favor of Icebreaker Wind. It stated that the Ohio Power Siting Board provided multiple studies that demonstrated a low impact on birds and bats, and that the wind farm would have “minimal impact” on the public’s enjoyment of Lake Erie.Justice Jennifer Brunner wrote on page 13:Rather than requiring Icebreaker to resolve those matters before issuing the certificate, the board determined that the conditions on its grant of the certificate were sufficient to protect birds and bats and to ensure that the facility represented the minimum adverse environmental impact.Icebreaker Wind will interconnect with the Cleveland Public Power transmission system at the Lake Road 138kV substation. LEEDCo asserts that “the Great Lakes hold enough energy potential to power the entire country. The winds of Lake Erie alone could meet over 10% of our electricity needs by 2030.”Read more: Biden to expand offshore wind power in the Gulf of MexicoPhoto: LEEDCo SimulationUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/10,"The California Energy Commission (CEC) today set a goal to deploy 25 gigawatts (GW) of offshore floating wind power generation by 2045 after adopting a report that establishes offshore wind goals.California’s AB 525, signed into law in 2021, directed the CEC to “evaluate and quantify the maximum feasible capacity of offshore wind” and set a statewide goal. Preliminary findings in the report set planning goals of 3,000-5,000 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind by 2030 and 25 GW by 2045. The 2030 target is enough electricity to power 3.75 million homes, and the 2045 target is enough electricity to power 25 million. (For perspective, the latest US Census Bureau statistics show that there are 14.5 million housing units in California.)The CEC explained next steps for implementation in today’s announcement:CEC staff will next study the economic benefits of offshore wind in relation to seaport investments and workforce development needs. Staff will also create a roadmap to develop a permitting process for offshore wind energy facilities and associated electricity and transmission infrastructure. The entire plan must be submitted to the Legislature by June 2023. The Business Network for Offshore Wind points out that “California’s goal is both the largest and furthest reaching offshore wind goal of any state – and is the first Pacific Coast state to set a tangible target.”Liz Burdock, CEO and president of the Business Network for Offshore Wind said in a statement:A new clean energy industry is born as California’s new offshore wind target will unlock affordable power for tens of millions of homes in need of reliable energy. The CEC’s approval of a robust Offshore Wind Planning goal of up to 25 GW by 2045 ​is the action the industry has pushed for more than five years. It also marks a significant moment in the path to develop a national floating offshore wind industry. The long-term certainty of a 2045 goal will ​help build investor confidence and attract investments in ports, vessels, and offshore wind manufacturing facilities along the Pacific coast.I applaud [California] Governor [Gavin] Newsom for calling for bold action and commend the CEC for its work delivering a powerful first implementation report.On July 26, Electrek reported that Newsom had called for California to bump up its offshore wind target to at least 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2045, accelerating its 20 GW target by five years. And the federal government has opened up the CA coast to offshore wind and is planning a big offshore wind lease auction which should happen later this year.Before today, the state’s offshore wind targets were 15 GW of installed capacity by 2045 and 20 GW by 2050.Photo: “Morro Bay Power Plant” by Maxinux40k is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/08/08,"The Democrats passed the big climate bill – the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – in the US Senate on Sunday, 51-50. It’s expected to pass in the House of Representatives this week, and President Joe Biden says he’ll sign it as soon as it lands on his desk. Here’s how the IRA helps homeowners achieve energy efficiency and lower their energy bills.Rebates and tax credits are included in the IRA for homeowners who replace oil or gas-powered furnaces, boilers, water heaters, and stoves with high-efficiency electric appliances.Electrification nonprofit Rewiring America writes in an August 5 brief, “IRA Benefits to Disadvantaged Communities”:A household with an efficient electric heat pump for space heating and cooling, a heat pump water heater, one electric vehicle, and solar panels would save $1,800 a year today.These savings will be reflected in lower monthly energy bills, reduced bill volatility, and a lessening of disproportionately high energy burdens within disadvantaged communities. Importantly, these savings add up — so much so that if a household invests their energy bill savings from electrifying their home appliances, these savings will grow to over $30,000 after 10 years and $140,000 after 25 years.The $4.28 billion High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program, which is baked into the IRA, will provide an upfront rebate of up to $8,000 to install heat pumps, which can both heat and cool homes. It also provides a rebate of up to $1,750 for heat-pump water heaters. (Editor’s note: We just installed an air source heat pump hot water heater in our house. It costs a miniscule $108 a year to run.)There’s also a rebate of up to $840 to offset the cost of a heat-pump clothes dryer or an electric stove, including induction ranges. If a home needs an electrical panel upgrade to support new electrical appliances, then there’s up to a $4,000 rebate to help with that. There’s also a rebate of up to $2,500 for electrical wiring improvements. And for one of the most cost-efficient and quickest ways to make a home more energy-efficient – insulation and sealing – there’s a rebate of up to $1,600. The IRA provides a tax credit of up to $2,000 to install heat pumps for homeowners who don’t qualify for the rebate, and installing an induction stove or new energy-efficient windows and doors qualifies for tax credits of up to $1,200 annually.Homeowners will be able to collect a maximum of $14,000 total in rebates. Household income cannot exceed 150% of the area median income as calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to qualify. (Here’s a handy Area Median Income Lookup Tool from Fannie Mae to see what your limit is.) It looks as though, according to the bill itself, rebates and tax credits start after December 31, 2022.The program will be administered by states and will run through September 30, 2031.Read more: If the big US climate bill passes, here’s how it could turbocharge solar and windUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/05,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a now fully supported Democratic bill that addresses climate change and contains wind and solar spending, is expected to be introduced tomorrow in the US Senate. Here’s what its potential impact is, should it become law.Princeton University yesterday released a Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) in collaboration with Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research, and Carbon Impact Consulting that outlines what effects the IRA might have. The Act would nearly double investment in wind power and solar PV to $321 billion in 2030, versus $177 billion under current policy.Further, according to REPEAT, it could spur record-setting US wind and solar growth, with annual additions increasing from 15 gigawatts (GW) of wind and 10 GW of utility-scale solar PV in 2020 to an average of 39 GW per year of wind additions in 2025-26 – more than two times the 2020 pace – and 49 GW per year of solar – more than five times the 2020 pace – with solar growth rates increasing thereafter.Further, REPEAT reports that the IRA would lower annual US energy expenditures by at least 4% in 2030, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses, and industry. That translates into hundreds of dollars in annual energy cost savings for US households.Tax credits, rebates, and federal investments in the IRA would shift costs from energy bills to the progressive federal tax base. For example, it provides a long-term extension for the US solar investment tax credit at 30% and $30 billion in production tax credits for clean energy and battery storage manufacturing.As for its impact on fossil fuels, the report notes:These savings do not include the additional downward pressure the Act will put on prices for oil and natural gas by driving lower consumption of these commodities, which will further reduce US energy costs.Read more: Why US community solar is forecast to more than double by 2027Photo by Kindel Media on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/03,"There are currently 4.9 gigawatts (GW) of community solar installed in the US through the second quarter of 2022, and at least 7 gigawatts of community solar are expected to come online in the US in the next five years, according to new research released by Wood Mackenzie in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).When households or businesses don’t have access to rooftop solar, they can subscribe to shared local solar facilities and receive credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced. As the Solar Energy Industries Association explained:Community solar allows for equal access to the economic and environmental benefits of solar energy generation regardless of the physical attributes or ownership of an individual’s home or business. In other words, if you can’t install solar directly on your property, community solar can be a good option for accessing the savings and other benefits solar provides.Forty-one states plus Washington, DC, currently have at least one community solar project online. The Biden Administration wants community solar to reach 5 million households by 2025 and create $1 billion in energy bill savings.The SEIA, as of June 7, forecasts the addition of more than 4.3 GW of total US community solar capacity, but Wood Mackenzie has increased its 2022-2026 forecast by 477 MW, an 11% uptick compared to previous forecasts, and extended its outlook to 2027. Wood Mackenzie’s increase is due to the addition of new community solar markets such as New Mexico and Delaware, and adjustments to existing state forecasts as state-level programs are expanded and rules are updated. Illinois and New York are responsible for the largest changes to the forecast at the state level. New York, with 1.3 GW forecast to come online between now and 2027, is projected to continue to lead the US among states when it comes to community solar.Jeff Cramer, CEO of CCSA, said:There continue to be significant tailwinds for the community solar industry as legislators in existing and new states look to community solar as a way to achieve energy policy goals.The numbers released by Wood Mackenzie represent a conservative forecast of what’s in the pipeline for the next few years.If The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 becomes law, it would reinstate the solar investment tax credit to 30%, so community solar forecasts would likely be revised to reflect growth.Read more: New Jersey achieves milestone of 4 GW of installed solar powerPhoto: NavisunUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/02,"The 900 megawatt (MW) Nant de Drance pumped storage power plant in Valais, Switzerland, came online in July after 14 years of challenging construction and testing. The gigantic “water battery” is capable of storing enough hydroelectric energy to power as many as 900,000 homes.The Nant de Drance “water battery” has a storage capacity of 20 million kWh of electricity. It will help stabilize Switzerland’s and Europe’s electrical grids by both reducing the chances of a grid overload when demand is high, and providing more power when it’s needed.It took up to 650 construction workers working on the site at once, and around 60 companies working together to complete the project.Six underground turbines are located 600 meters (1,968 feet) underground in a cavern between the Emosson and Vieux Emosson reservoirs in Valais, southern Switzerland.Emosson, the lower reservoir, is the second-largest reservoir in Switzerland, and its 180-meter-high (590-feet-high) dam is the fifth tallest in the country.The upper reservoir of Vieux Emosson holds 25 million cubic meters of water, which represents a storage capacity of 20 million kWh. It was raised by 21.5 m (70.5 feet) in order to double its capacity.Each underground turbine has a capacity of 150 MW. The turbines can switch from pumping at full power to turbining at full power in less than five minutes, and it takes them less than 10 minutes to switch from turbine mode to pump mode. Three hundred sixty cubic meters of water per second passes through the turbines.When there’s too much electricity in the grid, water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the higher reservoir, and the surplus energy is stored in the upper reservoir.When power is needed, water flows from the upper reservoir and through the six underground turbines into the lower reservoir in order to generate electricity.This animation illustrates how it works:Nant de Drance SA and its shareholders Alpiq, SFR , IWB, and FMV will inaugurate the power plant in September.Read more: Eco Wave Power will construct Spain’s first wave-energy power plantPhotos: Nant de DranceUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/02,"Siemens Gamesa’s first recyclable blades are spinning on a wind turbine at the Kaskasi offshore wind farm in Germany. It’s the first commercial installation of recyclable wind turbine technology.The Spanish-German wind engineering giant calls its recyclable blade technology RecyclableBlade. Wind turbine blades are made of a number of materials embedded in resin. Siemens Gamesa explains how it reclaims the blade’s components at the end of the blade’s lifespan:Separating the resin, fiberglass, and wood, among others, is achieved through using a mild acid solution. The materials can then go into the circular economy, creating new products like suitcases or flat-screen casings without the need to call on more raw resources. The RecyclableBlade technology was developed in Aalborg, Denmark, and the blades were manufactured in Hull in the UK (pictured above). The nacelles were produced and installed in Cuxhaven, Germany. Siemens Gamesa has a plan to make all of its wind turbine blades fully recyclable by 2030 and all of its wind turbines fully recyclable by 2040.Marc Becker, CEO of the Siemens Gamesa Offshore Business Unit, said:We’ve brought the Siemens Gamesa RecyclableBlade technology to market in only 10 months: from launch in September 2021 to installation at RWE’s Kaskasi project in July 2022. This is impressive and underlines the pace at which we all need to move to provide enough generating capacity to combat the global climate emergency.The 342 megawatt (MW) Kaskasi offshore wind farm is owned by German energy company RWE. It’s 35 km (21.7 miles) north of the island of Helgoland in the German North Sea. Siemens Gamesa doesn’t specify how many of the offshore wind farm’s 38 SG 8.0-167 DD wind turbines will feature the RecyclableBlade; it just says that “a number of turbines” will be recyclable. Those turbines that do feature them will have “handcrafted Siemens Gamesa B81 RecyclableBlades, each with a length of 81 meters [266 feet].”Read more: Siemens Gamesa launches recyclable onshore wind turbine bladesUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/08/01,"Birmingham, UK-headquartered housing developer St. Modwen plans to build up to 350 fully electric homes in Birmingham – on the MG Rover site that was once home to the MINI – and the development will pioneer smart grid technology.The Longbridge, South Birmingham, homes will be powered by a smart grid, which is being developed with SNRG, a developer, installer, and operator of smart grid networks in the UK. SNRG was formed in 2018 with backing from Centrica, an energy services and solutions provider.As SNRG explains, it “offers customers a ‘one-stop-shop’ for smart grid solutions comprising grid connections, distribution networks, solar PV panels, batteries, heat pumps, and community EV charging.”St. Modwen asserts that this is the first time a major housing developer has used this particular smart grid approach with a fully electric housing development. The company expects to build the first new homes in Longbridge this fall.The West Midlands Combined Authority, which is made up of 12 local authorities and three Local Enterprise Partnerships, provided a £20 million ($24.5 million) infrastructure investment for the fully electric site.St. Modwen has already built its first sustainable housing units. Earlier in 2022, it launched two new carbon negative trial homes in Copthorne, West Sussex. The highly insulated homes there are designed to produce more energy than they consume and could reduce a household’s total energy bills by more than 50% when compared with a standard newly built home.The Copthorne, West Sussex. trial homes are fitted with solar panels, a battery, an EV charger, an air-source heat pump, a smart hot water tank, heat recovery ventilation, and a wastewater heat recovery unit.Read more: Tesla is still looking to make a new smart HVAC system for homesUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/26,"Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has called for California to bump up its offshore wind target to at least 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2045, accelerating its 20 GW target by five years. The state’s current offshore wind targets are 15 GW of installed capacity by 2045 and 20 GW by 2050.And to put that into a national context, the Biden administration set a target of 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 for the entire US.In a July 22 letter to the chair of the California Air Resources Board, Newsom wrote about the deployment of offshore wind:California is home to one of the world’s best offshore wind resources in the world and I am confident that this clean, domestic source of electricity can play an important role in meeting our state’s growing need for clean energy. The challenges of our time demand bold action today and rigorous and inclusive planning to maximize our potential over the long-term. That is why I am asking the California Energy Commission to establish a planning goal of at least 20 GW by 2045 in the AB 525 process and to work with our federal partners to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind and account for the needs of all those who use and care about California’s precious coastal resources. Together we can build a vibrant offshore wind industry in California that will help reduce air pollution, increase energy independence, and provide new economic opportunities to Californians while protecting the natural legacy of our coastline.Newsom called for the revised goal to be established through the California Energy Commission. The letter also called for clean buildings, moving away from fossil fuels, tackling methane leaks, and carbon removal.He also announced the launch of a new climate dashboard that tracks state climate action and progress toward key targets. It states that in 2020, 59% of California’s total electricity generation came from non-fossil-fuel sources such as wind, solar, hydropower, and nuclear.California law requires the procurement of 60% of all state electricity from clean energy sources by 2030 and 100% from carbon-free sources by 2045.In May 2021, the Biden administration announced that the US Pacific Coast would be open to commercial-scale offshore clean energy projects for the first time. Floating offshore wind technology will need to be utilized off the California coast because the continental shelf falls away quickly, into deep waters.Read more: Biden administration opens up the US Pacific coast to offshore windPhoto: “Morro Bay Power Plant” by Maxinux40k is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/26,"Solar energy jobs were up in 47 states and increased 9% percent across the United States from 2020 to 2021, reaching a total of 255,037 solar workers, reports the independent nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).According to IREC’s annual National Solar Jobs Census released today, this job growth took place in a year of record solar installations. Overall, the solar industry added 21,563 jobs in 2021, with more than two-thirds of these new jobs (14,350) at installation and project development firms. Larry Sherwood, president and CEO at IREC, said:America’s solar industry came back strong from the pandemic to expand the clean energy  workforce across all regions of the country.The future remains uncertain in light of the supply chain disruptions, trade issues, and stalled  federal policy in the first part of 2022. There is potential for unprecedented job growth in the  coming years if federal, state, and local leaders take action to expand clean energy use and  address climate change.Over the past decade, US solar employment has more than doubled from 105,145 jobs in 2011 to 255,037 jobs in 2021. The most significant growth has taken place in the installation and project development sector, where employment more than tripled since 2011 to reach 168,960 jobs in 2021. When it comes to the total number of solar jobs at the state level, California continues to lead with 75,712  jobs as of 2021, followed by Florida (11,761 jobs), Massachusetts (10,548 jobs), New York  (10,524 jobs), and Texas (10,346 jobs). Those states are followed by Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Ohio, each with 7,000 to 9,000 jobs.California also led for the number of jobs added in 2021 (7,035 new jobs), followed by  Massachusetts (+1,053 jobs), Nevada (+1,019 jobs), and Arizona (+932 jobs). Other strong growth states were Ohio, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Georgia, each with 800 to 900 new jobs.The solar industry needs to up its game when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The report found that women made up just under 30% of the solar workforce in 2021, while Black employees made up 8% of the workforce, Latino or Hispanic workers made up 20%, and Asian workers made up 9%. Fewer than one-third of solar firms reported strategies to increase female, ethnic or racial minority, or LGBTQ+ hires.And in a year with a tight labor market, 89% of firms reported difficulty finding qualified applicants, and 35% said it was “very difficult.” Only 31% of entry-level solar jobs require a bachelor’s degree, while 65% of firms provide on-the-job training.According to the 2022 US Energy and Employment Report, clean energy jobs are growing in every sector, and jobs in net-zero emissions aligned areas made up approximately 40% of total energy jobs in 2021.Read more: GAF Energy to build second US nailable solar shingle factory to meet growing demandPhoto: “Solar Installation at Washington County Landfill (Closed)” by MN Pollution Control Agency is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/20,"US President Joe Biden today announced that his administration will pursue the development of offshore wind energy in the Gulf of Mexico, which is already a hub for oil and gas production.Biden made the announcement at a former coal-fired power plant in Brayton Point, Massachusetts, that will host a cable manufacturing facility to support offshore wind.The Wind Energy Areas in the Gulf of Mexico cover 700,000 acres and have the potential to power over 3 million homes. One area is off Galveston, Texas, and the other area is near Lake Charles, Louisiana.The Department of the Interior will also pursue wind energy development in the waters off the mid- and southern Atlantic Coast and Florida’s Gulf Coast.This announcement follows Biden’s launch of a new Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership that brought together 11 East Coast governors to deliver more clean, affordable energy and new jobs.Biden previously announced an ambitious leasing strategy for the Department of the Interior to hold up to seven offshore wind auctions by 2025, and two were already held this this year.The expansion of the US offshore wind industry is a key part of Biden’s plan to decarbonize the electricity sector by 2035. That plan has been put into jeopardy by Senator Joe Manchin’s refusal to engage in climate talks.Liz Burdock, CEO and founder of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, said:President Biden’s actions today will help drive development of the emerging offshore wind supply chain by unlocking much-needed workforce expertise, resources, and infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and giving traditional energy workers opportunities to transition to new, good-paying jobs.John Bowman, managing director of government affairs for Natural Resources Defense Council, said:Today’s action… advances a key part of the solution, tapping into the vast potential for clean, renewable power from offshore wind turbines. What’s important now is to build on this momentum with climate action that meets the moment. Congress still has work to do – starting with passing badly needed clean energy incentives. And Biden must make sure every part of the government is part of the climate fix – not the problem.Diane Hoskins, climate and energy campaign director at Oceana, said:Advancing offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico will lower energy costs, create jobs, and increase domestic energy production all while fighting climate change. Responsible offshore wind stands in stark contrast to dirty and dangerous offshore drilling which shuts down local economies after disastrous oil spills. Our oceans can be a part of the energy solution and provide jobs for transitioning oil and gas workers. Oceana applauds President Biden for his leadership on advancing offshore wind production in the United States. Now it’s time for President Biden to follow through on his campaign commitment to protect our oceans and coasts from dirty and dangerous offshore drilling by including no new leases in the final Five-Year Plan.Read more: The real reason Joe Manchin is sabotaging the US clean energy plan [update]Photo: “Gulf of Mexico” by Calsidyrose is licensed under CC BY 2.0.",solar
2022/07/20,"New Jersey recently surpassed 4 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar power, enough to provide electricity to over 500,000 households annually, according to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.New Jersey, which has 3.27 million households and is in the top 10 states for solar, now has more than 157,000 solar installations statewide, and it expects to double its solar capacity in the next four years.In order to keep its solar growth momentum going, the state will this year implement a permanent Community Solar Energy Program following a successful two-year pilot program. Community solar projects approved during the pilot have the cumulative capacity to serve around 24,000 low to moderate income (LMI) subscribers.As Electrek reported in August 2021, New Jersey is the No. 1 state in the US for installed solar capacity per square mile and has the most planned community solar capacity serving LMI households.The state’s Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) Program for grid supply and large net-metered solar will be launched later in 2022. It will provide competitively set incentive values for grid supply projects and net metered non-residential projects greater than 5 MW.It’s also working to develop and launch a Dual-Use solar pilot program – that’s when agricultural production and solar panels share the same land parcel.Further, the Garden State has plans under way to modernize its grid.New Jersey was the nation’s sixth-largest producer of electricity from solar energy in 2020 and ranked third in generation from small-scale solar generating systems, such as rooftop solar panels. Overall, solar power accounted for 6.5% of in-state electricity.In 2020, natural gas and nuclear power accounted for 90% of New Jersey’s total electricity net generation.

2022/07/19,"GAF Energy, the sister company of GAF, the largest roofing and waterproofing company in North America, will build a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Georgetown, Texas, to meet growing demand for its “world’s first” nailable solar shingle, the Timberline Solar Energy Shingle, which launched in January.The new factory, which will be GAF Energy’s second, will increase the company’s capacity by 500% and bring total production of its solar shingle to 300 megawatts annually. That will make GAF Energy the largest solar roofing producer in the world.The Georgetown factory, which will be north of Austin and is expected to be up and running next year, will create hundreds of clean energy manufacturing jobs. GAF Energy’s first factory, in San Jose, California, was completed and began production in 2021.Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy, said:We launched Timberline Solar because we believed that more consumers would choose solar if they had a more reliable, durable, and attractive option. The market has confirmed our belief – now we’re turning that belief into reality and building the future of clean energy here in the US. On January 6, a GAF Energy representative told Electrek about the cost, efficiency, and specs of its Timberline Solar Energy Shingle. On cost:Timberline Solar is cost competitive with rack mounted systems and is more affordable than other solar roofs. It’s about half the cost of the Tesla Solar Roof.The most affordable time to go solar is when you’re in the market for a new roof, by turning two home improvement projects into one. Plus, the solar helps pay for the roof by reducing your monthly utility bill.GAF Energy president Martin DeBono says that replacing a $15,000 roof (not including solar) would probably cost $30,000 (before subsidies) with Timberline solar.GAF Energy’s roofing partners do the pricing directly for the consumer and it depends a lot on the roof, shading, and a number of other factors.On efficiency:The mono passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) we use are, on average, 22.6% efficient. That’s going to be the most reliable number if you’re looking for a number, given that our shingle technology is ahead of the curve on standardized efficiency testing (geared toward large, rigid panels).  Based on our internal tests, GAF Energy’s custom diode layout allows for the system to outperform rack-mounted systems in real-world conditions without bulky additional electronics and the associated extra labor. Lastly, the flexible shingle form factor allows GAF Energy to fit more solar in areas where a traditional 5-by-3-foot panel simply will not fit, providing more options for customers unable to go solar before.  A Timberline Solar Energy Shingle weighs 10.1 pounds (4.58 kg), and its dimensions are 64 1/4″ x 17 1/8″ x 1″ (1,632 x 435 x 26 mm). Allowed roof pitch is 2:12 or greater, and maximum installation altitude is 13,123 ft. (4,000 m). Average ambient temperature range is -40F to 122F (-40C to 50C).Wind classification is ASTM D3161 Class F – that means shingles passed wind testing at 110 mph. Regarding impact resistance, shingles are rated Class 1 through 4, with Class 4 shingles having the highest resistance. The energy shingle is rated UL 2218 Class 1.Read more: GAF Energy moves its solar manufacturing from Asia to the USUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/15,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced $56 million in funding to boost US solar manufacturing and recycling. Of those funds, $10 million will come from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That money should provide a much-needed boost to the US solar manufacturing industry as around 90% of US solar panels are currently made overseas. The US solar industry has experienced difficulties due to supply chain problems, disruptions resulting from the US Department of Commerce investigation into whether Southeast Asian solar cell manufacturers are using parts made in China that would normally be subject to a tariff, and now Senator Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) opposition to expanding solar incentives.At the beginning of June, Biden authorized the Defense Production Act to spur US solar manufacturing. He also announced a two-year suspension of tariffs on Southeast Asian solar panels, thus allowing the DOC investigation to continue yet avoiding the investigation bringing the US solar industry to a halt.The $56 million in funding opportunities will be broken down into two general categories:Garrett Nilsen, acting director for DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, said [via Reuters]:It’s necessary that we take the steps to ensure that we can be as self-sufficient as possible.Not only for hitting decarbonization goals, but also just to make sure that we are as insulated as possible from any other global trade disruptions that might take place.The Biden administration also approved the 125-mile (200 km) Ten West Link transmission line between Tonopah, Arizona, and Blythe, California.

2022/07/14,"Coal investor and US Senator Joe Manchin III (D-WV) opposes his own political party’s clean energy program. And since not a single Republican will support the infrastructure bill that contains the program, Manchin has disproportionate power to sink the US plan to decarbonize in order to slow global warming and meet the Paris Agreement target of net-zero by 2050. Why does he oppose it?July 14, 2022 update: Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said Thursday that he would not support funding for climate or clean energy programs, thus, along with the Republican Party, effectively torpedoing chances of addressing the climate emergency under this current government.Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, just released the following statement:The House did its job. The Senate failed because Joe Manchin and the Republicans blocked Senate action. The consequences will be profound – at home and abroad.The climate crisis is inflicting rising costs and mounting dangers across this country and around the world. Seven in ten Americans expect our government to act. This was a squandered chance to respond with strategic investment to confront the climate crisis in a way that would strengthen the economy, create a more equitable society and make the country more secure.President Biden must immediately use the full scope of his executive powers to address climate chaos, starting by declaring a climateemergency.https://t.co/v1F3yMOLNuAnd Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said on Friday, July 15:The news that significant climate policy will not be part of a budget reconciliation bill is crushing to so many people, particularly in light of the devastating effects of climate change and inflation now adversely affecting every American.As of today, we hold out hope, however slim, that members of Congress will see the urgency of this moment and do what needs to be done to pass meaningful climate and clean energy legislation this year.This apparent defeat is a serious blow to the American workers, to American manufacturers, to national security and to the potentially massive clean energy economy. Clean energy policy also fights inflation. Recent testimony by the Rhodium Group revealed that the clean energy tax credit package and other clean energy investments in the reconciliation package can serve as a strong foundation for cutting energy costs.December 20, 2021, update: Manchin announced on Fox News Sunday on December 19 that he will not vote for the Build Back Better Framework, which contains crucial climate change provisions, citing concerns for inflation and the deficit:""This is a no on this legislation"" — On Fox News Sunday, Manchin announces he won't vote for the Build Back Better bill. Game over. pic.twitter.com/p0rCu4kl7MManchin’s sudden public announcement has gone down very badly with everyone apart from Republicans. The White House issued a statement that debunked Manchin’s two excuses for not supporting the bill. On inflation:Senator Manchin claims that this change of position is related to inflation, but the think tank he often cites on Build Back Better — the Penn Wharton Budget Institute — issued a report less than 48 hours ago that noted the Build Back Better Act will have virtually no impact on inflation in the short term, and, in the long run, the policies it includes will ease inflationary pressures. Many leading economists with whom Senator Manchin frequently consults also support Build Back Better.And on the deficit:Senator Manchin cited deficit concerns in his statement. But the plan is fully paid for, is the most fiscally responsible major bill that Congress has considered in years, and reduces the deficit in the long run. The Congressional Budget Office report that the Senator cites analyzed an unfunded extension of Build Back Better. That’s not what the President has proposed, not the bill the Senate would vote on, and not what the President would support. Senator Manchin knows that: The President has told him that repeatedly, including this week, face to face.Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) stated on CNN that Manchin should ask the people of West Virginia what they want:Sen. Joe Manchin should explain to the people of West Virginia why he doesn’t have the courage to stand up to special interests. pic.twitter.com/TDRhGKnQHLAccording to today’s front-page story in West Virginia’s Charleston Gazette-Mail, headlined: “We need this so bad”: Build Back Better backers say bill would protect WV’s most vulnerable as Manchin Resists,” West Virginia citizen advocacy groups held many events last week urging quick passage of the legislation. The Gazette-Mail writes:A September report by the independent economics consulting firm Analysis Group found a clean electricity payment program would result in an increase of 7.7 million jobs, a $907 billion economic boost and $154 billion more in increased tax revenue for federal, state and local governments by 2031.Sanders also made the point about Manchin’s contradictory behavior about deficit concerns:I also find it amusing that Sen. Manchin indicates his worry about the deficit after voting just this week for a military budget of $778 billion, four times greater than Build Back Better over 10 years and $25 billion more than the president requested.Electrek’s Take: Manchin’s comments on Fox News contradict everything he’s said to the White House and to his own Democratic Party colleagues. At the very least, it’s bad politics to broadside your own party, and at most, he is putting the entire world’s efforts to fight the climate crisis in peril for his own selfish reasons.Manchin brings to mind Gavrilo Princip, the Bosnian Serb student who ignited World War I by assassinating Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife. One man’s actions created a devastating war that still resonates more than a hundred years later. And Manchin, in one Fox News interview, unless he reverses course yet again, could damn future generations to lifetimes of environmental misery. Shame on him.The $150 billion clean electricity program is a carrot and stick approach. It would reward utilities that switched from burning fossil fuels to clean energy, and penalize those that don’t.Sam Runyon, Manchin’s spokesperson, wrote in an email to the New York Times:Senator Manchin has clearly expressed his concerns about using taxpayer dollars to pay private companies to do things they’re already doing. He continues to support efforts to combat climate change while protecting American energy independence and ensuring our energy reliability.Manchin’s reason via his spokesperson is nonsensical. Most US utilities are doing very little when it comes to transitioning to clean energy. They need both the carrot and stick. In January, Electrek reported:Sierra Club analysts examined plans for 79 operating companies owned by 50 parent companies and assigned a score to every utility based on its plans to retire coal, stop constructing new gas plants, and aggressively build out new clean energy by 2030.Sierra Club then provides a map of the US so you can see who’s succeeding and failing, and a search function to look up your utility.Spoiler! There are a lot more D and F grades than A or B grades.Read more: What’s your utility company doing (or not) to adopt clean energy?So what in the heck is going on with Manchin? Is he worried, as his fellow West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said, that the program is “designed to ultimately eliminate coal and natural gas from our electricity mix, and would be absolutely devastating for my state”?Not quite. Yes, the program is designed to eliminate coal and natural gas. But I really don’t think it’s because Manchin is mainly worried about job elimination. As I wrote in April:I watched Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Cecil Roberts, president of US coal’s largest union, the United Mine Workers of America, discuss a possible transition from coal to renewables in Appalachia with the National Press Club yesterday. (You can watch the full discussion here.) It was an important and intriguing conversation. Coal workers are rightly concerned about future work and training as their industry declines, but I didn’t hear about any concrete road maps out of coal from Manchin.Surely Manchin, of all people – the chair of the US Energy and Natural Resources Committee – should be able to speak definitively and comprehensively about renewable adoption and job creation, rather than vaguely repeating himself about the possibilities of carbon capture and sequestration. Even Roberts called for federal support for wind turbines and solar panels to be manufactured in Appalachia, and spells out a plan in the union’s new report (although it still leans heavily on coal).And everyone knows – even Roberts – that coal is gasping its last hacking breath. Even Roberts is willing to transition to clean energy jobs! West Virginia voters support many provisions in the Build Back Better plan, including clean energy.Read more: Jim Cramer on Chevron and Exxon declines: ‘I’m done with fossil fuels. They’re done… This is the other side of Tesla’The real reason why Manchin won’t back clean energy?Greed.Manchin gets a lot of money from fossil fuel companies that aren’t even in West Virginia. They own him.The Charleston Gazette-Mail sums it up:Employees and political action committees for out-of-state oil and gas companies — most of which are based in Texas — dwarfed contributions from in-state [West Virginia] individuals and political action committees by more than tenfold, according to the senator’s newly filed quarterly campaign finance report.You can read the full list of examples reported by energy and environment reporter Mike Tony of the Gazette-Mail, but here are a couple of standout examples:Manchin for West Virginia, the senator’s campaign committee, reported drawing just under $1.6 million in contributions in the quarter, leaving it with $5.38 million in cash on hand.More than a quarter of that roughly $1.6 million came from the oil and gas industry. Just over $30,000 came from individuals and political action committees in West Virginia.…Manchin has made $4.35 million since 2012 from stock he owns in Enersystems Inc., the Fairmont-based coal brokerage he founded in 1988, according to his U.S. Senate financial disclosures. He has denied that his vested coal interests have influenced his policymaking that affects the coal industry. But he has declined to divest his holdings, saying his ownership is held in a blind trust and, therefore, avoids a conflict of interest.So, that’s $400,000 coming from fossil fuels in just one quarter. And guess who the top recipient is overall of oil and gas, mining, and coal money, not just in the Senate, but in all of Congress? Manchin. (He’s No. 2 for utilities.)I am mad as hell about this, and more than just a little bit scared. I don’t want to be dramatic, but it’s not good. Let’s drill it down a bit (no pun intended): We are in the midst of a global climate emergency. China may be the No. 1 polluter overall, but the US is No. 2, and each person in America emits twice as much carbon as each person in China. Plus, the US has emitted more carbon than any other country – so this is the US’s problem to solve.When Biden was elected, he immediately signed an executive order to have the US rejoin the Paris Agreement. He has stressed the importance of decarbonizing and has a plan. He vowed that the US will cut its emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2030.Hope sprung from those declarations for those of us who know that the future of humanity is hanging in the balance. The infrastructure bill has me holding my breath. It’s hard for me to even look at the negotiation process.The Biden clean energy program is fundamental to that plan. The whole world, not just the US, needs it. We can wait no longer.And just weeks before the do-or-die COP26 summit in Glasgow, that plan is about to be derailed by one man.One man’s greed is going to hurt the world’s entire population of 7.75 billion people. That’s not hyperbole: The respected medical journal the Lancet says “climate change is the greatest global health threat facing the world in the 21st century.”Hope for a miracle.

2022/07/14,"Sodium-ion batteries have great promise. They’re energy dense, nonflammable, and operate well in colder temperatures, and sodium is cheap and abundant. Plus, sodium-based batteries will be more environmentally friendly and even less expensive than lithium-ion batteries are becoming now. Sodium-ion battery performance has been limited because of poor durability, but this is about to change for the better. A research team from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed a sodium-ion battery with greatly extended longevity. The findings, published in the journal Nature Energy, provide a promising recipe for a battery that may one day power electric vehicles and store solar energy.The researchers shifted the ingredients that make up the battery’s liquid core. That shift prevents performance issues that have caused trouble for previous sodium-based batteries. PNNL lead author Jiguang (Jason) Zhang, a battery technologies pioneer with more than 23 patented inventions in energy storage technology, said:Here, we have shown in principle that sodium-ion batteries have the potential to be a long-lasting and environmentally friendly battery technology.As PNNL explains, in batteries, the electrolyte is the circulating “blood” that keeps the energy flowing. The electrolyte forms by dissolving salts in solvents, resulting in charged ions that flow between the positive and negative electrodes. Over time, the electrochemical reactions that keep the energy flowing get sluggish, and the battery can no longer recharge. In current sodium-ion battery technologies, this process happens much faster than in lithium-ion batteries.The PNNL team attacked that problem by switching out the liquid solution and the type of salt flowing through it to create a new electrolyte recipe. For the first time ever, scientists greatly extended the number of charging cycles (300 or more) with minimal loss of capacity (>90% retained) in a coin-sized battery in lab tests.As PNNL explains, the current electrolyte recipe for sodium-ion batteries results in the protective film on the negative end (the anode) dissolving over time. This film is critical because it allows sodium ions to pass through while preserving battery life. The PNNL-designed technology works by stabilizing this protective film. The new electrolyte also generates an ultrathin protective layer on the positive pole (the cathode) that contributes to additional stability of the entire unit.The PNNL researchers’ newly developed sodium-ion technology uses a naturally fire-extinguishing solution that is also impervious to temperature changes and can operate at high voltages. One key to this feature is the ultrathin protective layer that forms on the anode. This ultrathin layer remains stable once formed, providing the long cycle life reported in the research article.Sodium-ion technology still currently lags behind lithium when it comes to energy density. But it still has its own unique advantages, such as temperature-change resistance, stability, and a long cycle life. Those advantages will prove to be valuable for applications of certain light-duty electric vehicles and even grid energy storage in the future.Photo: PNNLRead more: CATL introduces first-gen sodium-ion battery and AB lithium-sodium packUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/13,"In 2020, 26% of US households – that’s 32.25 million out of 123.53 million homes – used electricity as their only source of energy, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But what the EIA doesn’t note is what fuels that “electricity as the only source of energy.”Inversely, that means 74% of US homes used electricity and directly used at least one other fuel, such as natural gas, fuel oil, propane, or wood, in 2020. The most common fuel combination was natural gas and electricity, which were used exclusively in 55% of US households.Florida and Hawaii led the pack on using electricity for energy. A whopping 77% of Floridian homes (6.2 million) are on electricity only, and 72% of homes in Hawaii are all-electric, with a considerably smaller number of 0.34 million. So that would mean, for example, only paying an electric bill; not paying a natural gas and electric bill.When you look at the map below, you see the north-south energy consumption pattern. With the exception of Washington State, which is undergoing a major push to move homes to all-electric – in May, it became the first state to require all-electric heating in new buildings, for example – the majority of electric-only households are in the south.In colder states, space and water heating equipment tend to run on natural gas, oil, or propane. However, expect to see this tendency shift as more people switch from fossil-fuel-powered hot water heaters to air source heat pump water heaters and space heaters. There are state and federal incentives for households to make that shift, and natural gas, propane, and oil are really expensive right now. Just search “heat pump incentives,” for example, and the whole page becomes populated with incentives, particularly in Northeastern states. My heat pump hot water heater technician here in Vermont told me they’re installing heat pumps like crazy.First and foremost, I need to emphasize the fact that direct use of electricity often means indirect use of fossil fuels, since it depends on what your utility uses as a source of power.Case in point: When we lived in Florida, we were fully electric. We had an HVAC system – doesn’t everyone in Florida? – cooked on an an electric hob, and had electric instant water heaters. We switched to Arcadia Energy as a stopgap solution for our electric, because Duke Energy sucks when it comes to using fossil fuels: Wind and solar power generation across the entire company in 2021 was just over a pathetic 5%. Had we stayed in Florida, we would have installed rooftop solar.The natural gas company put signs around our neighborhood encouraging people to use their “clean” energy. That was an outright lie.Now we live in Vermont. We moved into a propane-fueled house. So we quickly swapped out the ancient propane water heater for an air source heat pump water heater – a Rheem, and it’s a thing of beauty. It costs $104 a year to run, so we will quickly make back what we paid for it. Our utility is now Green Mountain Power, which says it’s 100% carbon free – mostly hydro and nuclear – and more than 68% renewable.Our next step is to super-insulate this house, switch to a heat pump, and install solar. (I’m waiting for solar quotes now, and yes, heat pumps work in New England. My awesome Vermonter electrician just installed one.) We inherited a Vermont Radiance propane stove that is meant to be used as heat backup in power outages. We want to swap it for a wood stove, and there are state and federal incentives to do so. In fact, Vermont has all kinds of clean energy state incentives. Florida had… none.If your home is already 100% electric but your utility company is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, then the positive effect of eliminating direct use of fossil fuels is reduced. Find out what your utility uses as a source of power, and actively lobby it to move toward using renewables.Directly switching off direct use of fossil fuels helps your wallet, your health, and the environment. It’s a really important step in the right direction.Read more: The heat pump market will more than double to $13B in cold climates by 2031UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/12,"Plans in Europe to place a small number of coal plants on temporary standby would only add 1.3% to EU emissions annually, even in the worst-case scenario where they run at the highest levels, according to London-based energy think tank Ember. Germany, Austria, France, and the Netherlands have recently announced plans to enable increased coal power generation in the event that Russian gas supplies suddenly stop. Ember’s analysis finds that 14 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired plants have been placed on standby, adding 1.5% to the EU’s total installed power generation capacity (920 GW). The majority are in Germany, which approved 8 GW of reserve capacity as part of its Replacement Power Plant Provision Act adopted on July 8.Even in the worst-case scenario where these reserve coal plants run throughout 2023 on a load factor of 65%, they would only generate 60 TWh of coal-fired electricity, which is enough to power Europe for about one week.From a climate perspective, the net additional CO2 emissions in 2023 would be approximately 30 million tonnes, representing only 1.3% of total 2021 EU CO2 emissions and 4% of annual power sector emissions. No European country has reversed its commitment to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest. In fact, the current crisis has acted as a catalyst for an accelerated European clean energy transition.In May, the European Commission published its updated REPowerEU Plan in which it had already incorporated an increase in coal power (+105 TWh) and falling gas power (-240 TWh) without derailing EU climate objectives. Based on the RePowerEU targets, renewables would account for 69% of electricity production by 2030, according to Ember.Ember senior analyst Sarah Brown said:Europe finds itself in this urgent situation due to past energy policy mistakes. Despite numerous warning signs, EU member states ignored the risks of overreliance on imported gas and neglected the need to rapidly replace this with domestic renewables. Consequently, it now faces the difficult, emergency decision of temporarily relying on coal while substantially ramping up its clean energy deployment. [These are] mistakes Asia cannot afford to repeat.Read more: Portugal closes its last remaining coal plantPhoto: “Coal power plant” by eutrophication&hypoxia is licensed under CC BY 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/12,"Eleven US East Coast states have already committed to procuring nearly 40 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power. But increasingly powerful Atlantic hurricanes will be a threat to those future offshore wind farms. A team of scientists investigated how to make offshore wind turbines more resilient – they found that when they turned an offshore wind turbine around, it was better able to withstand violent storms. As explained on CU Boulder Today, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Virginia, the University of Texas at Dallas, the Colorado School of Mines, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) think the way turbines can withstand high winds is to face them downwind:Traditional upwind turbines face the incoming wind, and to avoid being blown into the tower, their blades must be sufficiently stiff. It requires a lot of material to build these relatively thick and massive blades, which drives up their cost. Turbine blades on downwind rotors, however, face away from the wind, so there’s less risk of them hitting the tower when the winds pick up. This means they can be lighter and more flexible, which requires less material and therefore less money to make. These downwind blades can also then bend instead of break in the face of strong winds — much like palm trees.Lucy Pao, Palmer Endowed Chair in the Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at CU Boulder, said:We are very much bio-inspired by palm trees, which can survive these hurricane conditions.The research team built a 53.38-kilowatt turbine known as SUMR-D – Segmented Ultralight Morphing Rotor demonstrator. Their turbine features two light and flexible blades and a downwind rotor. It was tested in a four-year study at the NREL Flatirons Campus south of Boulder.The SUMR-D features an improved controller, the “brain of the system,” which determines when to ramp up or down when it’s producing power:The yaw controller makes sure the turbine is facing the correct direction, the blade pitch controller determines the direction of the blades (dependent on the wind speeds), and the generator torque controller decides how much power to pull off the turbine and onto the grid. While it controls physical components of the turbine, these controllers are essentially a software algorithm that tells the motors what to do. SUMR-D turbine performed consistently and efficiently in high winds. The researchers also think that their control algorithms could apply to traditional three-bladed upwind turbines too.Read more: Carolina Long Bay offshore wind auction secures $315M in high bidsPhoto: CU BoulderUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/05,"Danish wind turbine maker Vestas has installed the first wind turbine at Japan’s Akita Noshiro offshore wind farm. Akita Noshiro will feature 33 V117-4.2 megawatt (MW) wind turbines.Japan already operates several demonstration offshore wind turbines, but Akita Noshiro is its first commercial offshore wind farm.Twenty wind turbines will be installed off the Port of Noshiro, and 13 will be installed off the Port of Akita, in the northeast of Honshu, Japan’s main island. All 33 of the turbines’ monopiles were installed by September of last year.The Akita Offshore Wind Corporation is developing the 140 MW offshore wind farm. It will provide electricity to Tohoku Electric Power, which has a 20-year power purchase agreement for the entire output of the wind farm. Tohoku Electric Power services 7.6 million individual and corporate customers in six prefectures in Tohoku region, plus the Niigata Prefecture, in Honshu.The entire offshore wind farm is expected to become fully operational this year.Japan is aiming to deploy 10 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and between 30 and 45 GW by 2040, including floating wind, as part of its net zero by 2050 target.Currently, 25% of Japan’s electricity comes from clean energy. It has a plan to bump that percentage up to 38% by 2030, but that’s short of where the International Energy Agency says G7 members need to be. (For comparison, about 21% of US primary energy consumption came from fuel sources other than fossil fuels in 2021.)At the end of May, for the first time and joining the other six member states of G7, Japan pledged to end public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022.Read more: EU renewables plan spotlights Japan’s weak targets as G7 energy meeting kicks offPhoto: VestasUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/07/01,"Rhode Island has passed a law requiring all of the state’s electricity to be offset by renewable energy by 2033 – the fastest timeline of any state in the US.July 1 update: Governor Daniel McKee (D-RI) has now signed historic legislation into law that will require all of the state’s electricity to be offset by renewable energy by 2033. It’s the most aggressive renewable energy standard among any US state.Representative Deborah Ruggiero (D-Dist. 74, Jamestown, Middletown) said:This bill supports renewable energy growth, and is consistent with the Act on Climate’s goal of reducing carbon emissions by to net-zero by 2050. In addition to reducing emissions and our reliance on fossil fuels that must be brought to Rhode Island from other places, creating renewable energy supports the green industry, creating thousands of good paying jobs right here in Rhode Island. We’ve seen a 74% increase in green jobs since 2014, and that trend is going to continue as we deepen our commitment to renewables.H277/S2274 systematizes (and slightly delays) an executive order issued in January 2020 by then-Governor Gina Raimondo (now US secretary of commerce) that committed Rhode Island to meet its electricity needs with 100% renewable electricity by 2030.Rhode Island will be offsetting its fossil fuel-powered electricity while it moves toward establishing its own renewable sources of power. It’s currently heavily dependent on natural gas: As of 2020, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), natural gas fueled 89% of the state’s electricity net generation, the largest share of any state. Further, around 3 out of 10 Rhode Island households use heating oil as their primary source of home heating, which is six times more than the US average. The new legislation encourages the construction of new renewables projects.Rhode Island utilities will buy renewable energy certificates in a regional marketplace called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cooperative effort among 11 states to reduce emissions. So that means renewable electricity providers in the RGGI will generate renewable energy equivalent to 100% of the energy produced by Rhode Island utilities.  Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy for Environment America, said of the approved legislation:Rhode Island is poised to leap to the front of the line of states leading us toward a clean energy-powered future. This forward-looking commitment marks another milestone in America’s clean energy journey.Rhode Island’s solar outlook isn’t bright. It’s currently ranked 31st in the US for solar by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), with 575 MW installed. So 9% of the state’s electricity is currently powered by solar. It’s also expected to drop 10 places on the SEIA state rankings to 41st in the next five years, with a growth projection of 443 MW.However, the state is working to significantly grow large-scale offshore wind power. Rhode Island, which is home to Block Island (pictured), the US’s first offshore wind farm, has plans for a 600 megawatt (MW) procurement of new offshore wind capacity – equivalent to powering around 340,000 homes annually. As of July 2021, according to the US Census Bureau, there were 484,902 housing units in the state.The governor’s website noted:Including the 30 MW Block Island Wind farm and the planned 400 MW Revolution Wind project, offshore wind would cover 50% of the state’s projected energy needs.On June 23, McKee joined a coalition of governors from 11 East Coast states and the Biden administration to launch a federal-state Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership, which will accelerate the states’ offshore wind industries.The Rhode Island government website explains how the partnership will work:[It] will facilitate state and federal cooperation in building a strong, US-based supply chain for offshore wind, growing a skilled workforce for the industry, and addressing important regional matters such as transmission, fishing, and other ocean use issues.The Partnership will also commit to collaborating on supply chain strengthening, advancing the national offshore wind supply chain road map, and prioritizing financing for offshore wind vessels.Rhode Island, with a population of just under 1.1 million people, consumes less energy on a per capita basis than any other state. Its emissions are also the second-lowest among the states, after Vermont.Read more: The first US offshore wind farm has had no negative effect on fish, finds groundbreaking studyPhoto: “Block Island Wind Farm” by cementley is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/06/30,"The US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling this morning, “sharply curtailed” the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) options to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants – the second-largest source of emissions in the US. Greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change.In 2007, the Supreme Court recognized EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act, which is defined as follows:The Clean Air Act (CAA) is the comprehensive federal law that regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources. Among other things, this law authorizes EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and public welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants. Carbon dioxide causes climate change, which means it is a hazardous air pollutant.The Supreme Court sharply curtails the authority of the EPA to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change. In a 6-3 ruling, the court sides with conservative states and fossil-fuel companies in adopting a narrow reading of the Clean Air Act.In the West Virginia v. EPA ruling today, the court said that the current Clean Air Act can only directly regulate coal plants. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority:Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible “solution to the crisis of the day.” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 187 (1992).But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme in Section 111(d).A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Justice Elena Kagan countered:Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change.And let’s say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions.The Court appoints itself — instead of Congress or the expert agency — the decision maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.Once again: The Clean Air Act regulates hazardous air pollutants, of which carbon dioxide is one. The court majority is explicitly wrong here.The ruling recognizes the EPA’s authority to limit emissions from the power plants, but it means that the EPA and other federal agencies’ options for doing so are reduced.It also means a setback for the Biden administration’s goal of running US electricity on clean energy by 2035 — and the US reaching net zero by 2050 to comply with the Paris Agreement, which calls on the world’s nations to keep global warming significantly below 2C (3.6F) and to strive to limit the increase to 1.5C (2.7F). These targets are necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and the further they are missed, the more costly and disruptive climate change will be.A large number of reactions to this ruling landed in my inbox this morning. Not one celebrated this decision. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) said in an emailed statement:Congress must not only support the EPA’s longstanding, life-saving efforts to protect climate and public health in the face of this decision, but Congress must also do its job and pass meaningful climate and clean energy funding to protect our communities and our future. I call on my colleagues to take seriously the threat this illegitimate, far-right Supreme Court poses to preventing the federal government from acting as Congress intended. We must expand the Court to restore balance to the bench, and we must pass the climate justice and clean energy package that will enable our urgent efforts to address the climate crisis.The American Medical Association issued the following statement:The American Medical Association is deeply disappointed with today’s US Supreme Court opinion restricting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate the carbon emissions that cause climate change and harm public health.Regulating and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is critical for combating the climate crisis and its major health implications, impacting the respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems of the US population, with minoritized populations disproportionately impacted. The AMA has declared climate change a public health crisis that threatens the health and well-being of all people and supports policies that reduce US greenhouse gas emissions aimed at carbon neutrality by 2050.The National Audubon Society’s chief conservation officer Marshall Johnson said:Birds are telling us that the climate is changing and more action is needed. Stripping agencies like the EPA of their ability to respond to these real and urgent threats puts our communities, birds, and other wildlife at greater risk.In a 6-3 ruling the United States Supreme Court today severely curtailed the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon pollution and respond to the threat of climate change. The case in question pertained to a rule no longer in effect and offers an unprecedented “advisory ruling” on future regulatory action by the agency. Today’s ruling could also be interpreted to limit the ability of other federal agencies to issue and enforce similar regulations. The EPA must be able to regulate and enforce guidelines to conserve our natural resources and ensure that we all have clean water to drink and fresh air to breatheMatthew Mayers, executive director of Green Workers Alliance, said:Today’s outrageous decision in West Virginia v. EPA is the culmination of a long-running campaign by the fossil fuel industry and investor-owned utilities to take away the government’s abilities to regulate their dangerous emissions.Workers, consumers, and everyday citizens must shift our attention to Big Utility companies and demand they dramatically increase their renewable energy use and set higher labor standards for their renewable energy contractors. Labor, community, and environmental groups must coordinate pressure and hold utilities accountable in the fight for climate justice. With power from the grassroots, we will fight corporate greed and build a power sector that is good for the environment, workers, and utility customers.This is an awful ruling. Justice Kagan said it best above. It had also been expected that the court might issue an opinion on something called “Chevron deference,” but they didn’t mention it at all. That’s the doctrine, set up in Chevron v. NRDC, that government should defer to the decisions of administrative agencies like the EPA as to how to implement legislative priorities set up by Congress. Chevron v. NRDC said that Congress, which is not staffed by scientists, doesn’t need to make every tiny decision about pollution regulations, but that EPA scientists can take care of that. It has been a long-term plan of Justice Neil Gorsuch to eliminate this, and that would have incapacitated most government agencies. So we can breathe a slight sigh of relief that the court at least was not that crazy today.As Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council noted in an emailed statement:Under the Court’s decision, the EPA can still write standards that require these plants to operate more cleanly. The agency can and must set standards to cut carbon pollution from power plants that burn coal or gas.There are also things we, in both the private and public sectors are doing now and can do, despite this mess of a ruling, to reduce emissions.The Biden administration will have to fight hard to accelerate the move to renewables. If there is less to no coal to regulate, then it becomes less damaging. Congress must also immediately codify environmental protection laws and the ability of federal agencies to enforce them. The ruling also does not limit state or federal policymakers from passing legislation designed to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, the private sector is in the midst of an electrification revolution. This court ruling might slow that momentum, but it won’t stop it. Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said:Solar will continue to grow, because customers want clean power and solar is the most cost-effective source of clean energy. The Supreme Court has added unnecessary barriers that will only slow clean energy deployment when we should be focused on addressing the climate crisis. Every day I write about new superlatives. New inventions. New record-breaking occurrences in clean energy and the EV industry in both the private and public sectors.Look at my links from just this past last week. It’s always like this:The financial sector is pouring money into clean energy, and technological innovations are happening at lightning speed. Renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels, and there simply is no advantage or incentive to sticking with coal, gas, and oil. Peter Davidson, the CEO of Aligned Climate Capital, which manages $1.8 billion in assets, affirmed that in an emailed statement:As an investor, I know that the solutions to climate change are market-tested and ready to scale. Last year, more than $920 billion was invested globally in climate solutions like renewable energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, US investment continues to lag behind China and the EU and today’s decision will make it even harder for us to compete with them. This is a race we cannot afford to lose, yet the Supreme Court has just tied weights to our feet.It is time for the private sector and the States to step up and do what the Supreme Court has refused to do – acknowledge reality and lean into what we believe is the greatest economic opportunity of our generation. One that will create jobs, prosperity, and protect our communities.So while bad things happen like this ruling, the good things are happening faster. No one can stop the movement away from fossil fuels: Not high gas prices, not the pandemic. Nothing.Photo: PNAS",solar
2022/06/29,"Stockholm-based wind farm and solar developer OX2 has applied for a permit to build a massive 5.5 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea. If approved, it will be the largest single offshore wind farm in the world.Ørsted’s Hornsea in the North Sea has 7.5 GW of total capacity, but it’s made up of four separate offshore wind farms. The Swedish offshore wind farm, which will be called Aurora, will be bigger than the 4.8 GW Dogger Bank, which is off the Yorkshire coast in the UK and due to be completed in 2026.Aurora will be sited in the Swedish Economic Zone, about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the island of Gotland and 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the island of Öland. The $18 billion offshore wind farm will feature up to 370 wind turbines with a maximum height of 370 meters (1,213 feet). For perspective, the Empire State Building is 381 meters, or 1,250 feet tall.OX2 does not indicate which wind turbines it will use in its announcement. The tallest turbines currently available are 242 meters (794 feet) high and made by MingYang Smart Energy.Here’s where it gets mind-blowing: Aurora’s electricity production will be about 24 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year. That’s enough power for around 5 million households, or about 17% of the total electricity consumption in Sweden. (This is why I’m an offshore wind geek.)The wind farm’s first phase of construction is expected to begin in 2028. Aurora is expected to start producing energy in 2030.OX2 notes that it has previously applied for a Natura 2000 permit for Aurora. As the European Commission’s website explains, “Natura 2000 sites have been designated specifically to protect core areas for a subset of species or habitat types listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives.”As of the end of first quarter 2022, OX2 has 11.7 GW of renewable electricity projects in development in Sweden.Photo: Joakim Lagercrantz/OX2UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/06/28,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) today released the 2022 US Energy and Employment Report (USEER), which reveals that 2021 saw electric vehicle jobs increase by a whopping 26.2%, or 21,961, new jobs.The 2022 USEER report shows that the energy sector – with the exception of fossil fuels – experienced positive job growth. Overall, the sector rose by 4% from 2020 to 2021, outpacing overall US employment, which grew 2.8% in the same period. The energy sector added more than 300,000 jobs, increasing the total number of energy jobs from 7.5 million in 2020 to more than 7.8 million in 2021.In addition to the huge job growth in the full battery electric vehicle sector mentioned above, other vehicle sectors saw notable job growth as well:Fossil fuel jobs accounted for most of the fuel jobs lost: But, biofuels, including renewable diesel fuels, biodiesel fuels, and waste fuels, grew by 6.7%, adding 1,180 jobs.When it came to electric power generation, renewables grew, and fossil fuel energy for electric power generation jobs either declined or grew at a slower pace than renewable energy jobs:Sierra Club Director of Labor and Economic Justice Program Derrick Figures issued the following statement in response to the report’s findings:Time and again, we’re reminded of the near limitless potential of the clean energy industry – potential that will only be realized by bold investments that ensures equitable growth. Today’s Department of Energy report is perhaps the most detailed reminder yet of what this sector could become when Congress passes bold investments in clean energy.The numbers tell the story. When organic demand is combined with support from the financial sector and government policy that supports EVs and clean energy, growth happens, despite the challenges of the pandemic and supply chain issues.Demand will continue to grow, but we’ll see what federal policy brings, as November elections may bring changes both at the federal and state levels.Read more: US Dept of Energy announces $3 billion toward EV battery manufacturing and supply chainUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/06/28,"Italian startup Energy Dome has now begun to commercialize the world’s first CO2 Battery, which was launched earlier this month in Sardinia, Italy. The battery uses carbon dioxide to store renewable energy on the grid, and Energy Dome says the technology can be quickly deployed anywhere in the world.June 28 update: Energy Dome today announced that it has secured $11 million in bridge funding, which will enable it to buy equipment for a 20-megawatt/200-megawatt-hour/10-hour duration facility for Italian utility A2A, with which it has a memorandum of understanding. The Evolution Fund of asset management company CDP Venture Capital Sgr, together with existing investor Barclays, led the convertible funding. Swiss family office Novum Capital Partners, an existing shareholder in Energy Dome, also joined the round. With the closing of this latest convertible round, Energy Dome has now raised a total of nearly $25 million since the company emerged from stealth mode in February 2020. Its series B round is planned for later in 2022.Energy Dome sited the CO2 Battery in Sardinia to favor speed to market and ease of execution, as it’s in an industrial area with an existing electrical connection. Further, Sardinia currently uses coal, but the fossil fuel will be phased out by 2025. The battery can be paired with both wind and solar.Energy Dome began its operations in February 2020 and has progressed from a concept to full testing at multimegawatt scale in just over two years. Energy Dome Founder and CEO Claudio Spadacini said:The CO2 Battery is now commercially available to make cost-effective renewable energy dispatchable on a global scale.Energy Dome asserted that its CO2 Battery facility in Sardinia uses off-the-shelf equipment available from a globally established supply chain, and said that rapid global deployment of the CO2 Battery is now possible without bottlenecks. The company has secured multiple commercial agreements, including one with Italian utility A2A for the construction of the first 20 MW-5h facility. Earlier this year, Energy Dome also signed a nonexclusive license agreement with Ansaldo Energia, a power generation plant and component provider, to build long-duration energy storage projects in Italy, Germany, the Middle East, and Africa.Energy Dome’s plan is backed by investors that include European deep tech venture capital firm 360 Capital, Barclays, Novum Capital Partners, and Third Derivative. CO2 is one of the few gases that can be condensed and stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature, so, as Energy Dome states on its website, it’s the perfect fluid to store energy cost-effectively in a closed thermodynamic process. It allows for high-density energy storage without the need to go to extremely low temperatures.Spadacini explained how it works to Bloomberg in May:To charge the battery, we take CO2 at near atmospheric temperature and pressure and we compress it. The heat that is generated during compression is stored. When we exchange the thermal energy with the atmosphere, the CO2 gas becomes liquid.To generate and dispatch electricity, the liquid CO2 is heated up and converted back into a gas that powers a turbine, which generates power. The CO2 gas is always contained and the entire system is sealed.We don’t use any exotic materials. The technology uses steel, CO2 and water. So there is no dependency on rare earth materials like cobalt or lithium. This makes our technology geopolitically independent. It can be produced everywhere and it can be used everywhere.Energy Dome made a short video last year demonstrating how its CO2 energy storage works:June 28 update: This is an extremely exciting innovation, and the fact that Energy Dome now has the funds to deploy its commercial product for A2A is a very big deal. We can’t wait to see what comes next.This is certainly one to watch, as a CO2 battery doesn’t use rare earth materials, and that’s a very big deal. It seems cost-effective and downright democratic. This battery has great potential, and we look forward to seeing whether it deploys quickly on a global scale.Read more: Solar and battery storage make up 60% of planned new US electric generation capacityPhoto and videos: Energy DomeUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/06/24,"Spanish-German wind giant Siemens Gamesa has been awarded a firm order for 60 of its SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbines, which will be installed at the 882-MW Moray West offshore wind farm in Scotland. It will be the first installation of the world’s most powerful wind turbine, which has 14.7 megawatts (MW) of capacity.A service agreement is also included in the order for the offshore wind farm, which will be located in Scotland’s Moray Firth. All 180 Siemens Gamesa B108 IntegralBlades – that’s 60 turbines x 3 108-meter-long blades each – will be produced at the company’s offshore blade factory in Hull, England. Each SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbine will feature a rotor diameter of 222 meters. To get an idea of the wind turbine’s size, have a look at the prototype of the SG 14-222 DD in this short video:A rapid deployment timeline targets installation of the first machines in 2024, with first power expected to be produced in 2024.As Electrek reported in December 2021, the SG 14-222 DD’s prototype offshore wind turbine produced its first electricity and delivered it to the grid at the test center in Østerild, Denmark.It’s likely that Siemens Gamesa’s 14.7-MW turbines won’t hold the “most powerful” title for long. In February 2021, as Electrek reported, Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas announced the launch of its new offshore wind turbine – the V236-15.0MW. On June 7, Vestas announced that it had secured a conditional order agreement to supply 64 V235-15.0 MW wind turbines for EnBW’s 900 MW He Dreiht offshore wind farm in Germany in 2025.Read more: Siemens Gamesa’s massive 14 MW offshore wind turbine produces its first electricityPhoto: Siemens GamesaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/06/23,"Here’s where the world’s seven largest economies stand in their clean energy transitions ahead of the 48th G7 Leaders’ Summit next week in Germany.The G7 is made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.A G7 commitment to “predominantly decarbonize” electricity by 2035 means ending coal power by 2030. They must also, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), scale up wind and solar from around 75 gigawatts (GW) in 2020 to 230 GW by 2030.The EU said yesterday that it would temporarily shift back to burning coal to cope with reduced Russian gas supply, but it asserts that its climate goals won’t be undermined by that decision. EU officials did not provide a timeline for its temporary plan to use coal.Here’s an overview of every G7 country’s transition:Canada: According to an Ember update in March, Canada has committed to phasing out coal for electricity by 2030. More than two-thirds of Canada’s electricity generation is already net zero, thanks to hydro power. However, Canada has been slow to abandon fossil fuels, with its share falling only from 20% to 17% between 2015 and 2021. Canada has lagged in cutting coal use and ramping up wind and solar, and it needs to adopt ambitious measures now.France, Germany, and Italy: EU countries are aiming to generate 63% of their electricity from clean energy by 2030. This is up from 55% in previous commitments. This latest ambition puts the EU on track to achieve a net zero electricity system by 2035. Ember has previously reported that the EU can meet that target “at no extra cost” above stated plans and “without compromising security of supply.” Japan: Currently, 25% of Japan’s electricity comes from clean energy. It currently has a plan to bump that percentage up to 38% by 2030, but that’s short of where the IEA says G7 members need to be. According to a recent Ember analysis, Japan could expand its clean energy capacity with offshore wind and nascent rooftop solar.UK: The UK plans to generate ​​95% of its electricity from low carbon sources by 2030. This includes plans to expand offshore wind to ​​50 GW by 2030, and increase solar capacity by up to five times by 2035. This puts the UK in a great position to meet the clean power by 2035 ambition.US: President Joe Biden has committed to moving the US toward 100% clean power by 2035, including a near-term target for 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030. Recent months have been challenging, with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) opposing his own political party’s clean energy program, and thus making it impossible for the Democrats to pass ambitious clean energy laws due to a 50/50 party split in the Senate. But, Biden has recently invoked the ​​Defense Production Act to increase solar panel production, building insulation, and other equipment. He said in a press gaggle on June 20 that the US has a chance to make a “fundamental turn toward renewable energy.” Read more: New clean energy is reducing US electricity generation from natural gas, coalUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

The company claims it can be set up by a single person.Depending on the model, as the nanogrid is modular and customizable, Sesame Solar’s turnkey nanogrids can produce between 3 and 20 kW of solar power, with total battery storage of 15 to 150 kWh. It’s designed to meet peak and average use and provide uninterrupted sustainable power. The company says the nanogrids are shipped within 45 days after the order is placed and claims they’re good for 20 years. The average cost is around $150,000.The nanogrids range in length from 10 to 40 feet and can be moved by just about anything, from forklift to cargo plane to helicopter, making them great for emergency response.The nanogrid features a level 2 charger that can provide up to 250 miles of range per day to the truck. It can also charge electric bikes and scooters.Sesame Solar explains how the green hydrogen system works on its website:Hydrogen gas is produced inside our Nanogrids using electrolyzers, which decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The hydrogen is “green” because it is made using solar power. The green hydrogen gas is stored in solid state storage tanks on the outside of the Nanogrid at low pressure (less than 300 psi) making it safe to transport. The oxygen gas is safely vented. When the batteries are discharged to 35%, the onboard Hydrogen Fuel cell starts charging the batteries using the stored, green hydrogen gas. When the batteries are recharged, the Hydrogen Fuel cell shuts off. Electrolysis continues to produce hydrogen gas until the storage tanks are full, then it shuts off and the batteries are again charged using solar power. This system provides a clean energy loop.The company says the ideal use cases for its nanogrid include medical response, emergency response, electric vehicle charging, and powering water purification within power outage situations.Sesame Solar CEO Lauren Flanagan, an early SaaS pioneer who worked with Steve Jobs at NeXT as a software developer, said:Our nanogrids are changing the trajectory of the effects of climate change while providing communities in distress with the power they need to access critical resources.While we can’t stop hurricanes or wildfires from happening, we can create solutions that help communities recover efficiently without causing further damage to the environment.Nanogrids like these are going to become increasingly needed in the face of weather disasters.

2022/06/14,"West Lafayette, Indiana-based Purdue Research Foundation recently completed a licensing agreement with an international energy company – the name of which was not disclosed – for the commercialization of a new process discovered at Purdue University Northwest (PNW) for the biological production of green hydrogen from food waste. A second licensing agreement with a company in Indiana is under negotiation.Researchers say that this new process, which uses food waste to biologically produce hydrogen, can be used as a clean energy source for producing electricity, as well as for chemical and industrial processes or as a transportation fuel.Robert Kramer, professor of physics at PNW and principal investigator for the research, says that more than 30% of all food, amounting to $48 billion, is wasted in the United States each year. That waste could be used to create hydrogen, a sustainable energy source. When hydrogen is combusted, the only byproduct is water vapor.Kramer said:The developed process has a high production rate and can be implemented quickly. The process is robust, reliable, and economically viable for local energy production and processes.The research team has received five grants from the US Department of Energy and the Purdue Research Foundation totaling around $800,000 over the last eight years to develop the science and technology that led to this process. Two patents have been issued, and a third patent is currently in the final stages of approval. Over the next nine months, a scale-up test will be conducted. Based upon test results, it is anticipated that construction could start on the first commercial prototype within a year.Last week, a facility designed to turn non-recyclable plastics into green hydrogen was approved in the UK. It is the second facility of its kind there.Read more: UK’s NHS unveils new hydrogen-electric ambulances at COP26Photo: Ray Piedra on Pexels.comUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/06/13,"The US Army has launched the largest floating solar farm in the Southeast. It’s also the first project of its kind for the US Department of Defense.A ribbon cutting took place on June 10 for the floating solar, which is on Big Muddy Lake at Camp Mackall on Fort Bragg, North Carolina.Fort Bragg is the largest military installation by population in the Army, with around 49,000 military personnel, 11,000 civilian employees, and 23,000 family members. It’s the home of Airborne and Special Operations forces.The 1.1-megawatt (MW) floating solar farm includes 2 MW/2 megawatt-hour of battery energy storage.The floating solar farm is a collaboration between Fort Bragg, utility Duke Energy, and Framingham, Massachusetts-based renewable energy company Ameresco. The US Army’s announcement explains:This utility energy service contract project will provide carbon-free onsite generation, supplement power to the local grid, and provide backup power for Camp Mackall during electricity outages.The system also features an electronic recloser, which detects and interrupts momentary faults.Rachel Jacobson, assistant secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, said:This project fulfills the commitment made in our Army Climate Strategy to increase resilience while delivering clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.When we collaborate with local utilities and industry to promote energy resilience while powering the local grid, it is a winning solution across the board.To reiterate what Jacobson said: The US Army has a climate-change strategy. The 20-page document can be accessed here.The US Army has a goal of slashing its emissions 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. It also wants to “proactively consider the security implications of climate change in strategy, planning, acquisition, supply chain, and programming documents and processes.”This is significant because the US Army is a major pollluter. Since 2001, the military has produced more than 1.2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases – more than entire countries like Denmark or Portugal. Further, the Department of Defense accounts for nearly 80% of the federal government’s fuel consumption, according to Neta C. Crawford, a political science professor at Boston University,.The US Army also officially recognizes that climate change is a real threat. The first line of its climate strategy states:Climate change threatens America’s security and is altering the geostrategic landscapeas we know it.So it’s good news that such a large polluter recognizes its problem and is taking steps to rectify that problem.It also demonstrates nonpartisan climate change action in a currently polarized country. There is a tendency among climate change deniers to attribute the movement to adopt renewables as some sort of a left-wing plot. (Just read some of our comments on Facebook.) So when someone starts to shout about the liberal plot to install “useless solar,” and wind turbines killing birds, send them a link to the Army Climate Strategy.

2022/06/07,"The first of 11 8.6 megawatt (MW) turbines has been installed at the world’s largest floating wind farm, off the Norwegian coast. Hywind Tampen is also Norway’s first offshore wind farm – and it will power offshore oil and gas platforms.Four wind turbines have been fully assembled by Norwegian power giant Equinor, which is developing and will operate Hywind Tampen. It’s located around 140 km (87 miles) off the Norwegian coast in a water depth of between 260 and 300 meters (853 to 984 feet).The substructures are cast in concrete and are 107.5 meters (353 feet) tall. Equinor writes:With the turbine installed on top, 90 meters [295 feet] will be under water; the rotor has a diameter of 167 meters [548 feet] and the blades are 81.5 meters [267 feet] long.It will also be the world’s first floating wind farm to power offshore oil and gas platforms. The 94.6 MW, €488 million ($522 million) floating offshore wind farm will provide electricity for the Snorre and Gullfaks oil and gas fields in the Norwegian North Sea. It will cover around 35% of the five platforms’ annual power needs.Equinor asserts that the wind farm will reduce the need for locally produced gas power and “thus reduce annual emissions from the fields by about 200,000 tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to emissions from 100,000 vehicles.”Hywind Tampen is scheduled to start producing power in the third quarter of 2022.While this is a wind farm with a lot of superlatives – Norway’s first offshore wind farm, the world’s largest offshore floating wind farm, the first world’s first floating wind farm to power offshore oil and gas platforms – it’s tarnished by its purpose.I initially got very excited about this news, and then felt deflated when I remembered what it’s going to do. Norway is the world leader in the most electric cars per capita; it’s planning planning 30 GW of offshore wind by 2040. But it’s also Western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer. The petroleum sector makes up around 40% of Norway’s exports and 14% of its gross domestic product.The Norwegian government says it will work to cut the country’s net emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. That’s aligned with EU targets. But unlike its EU neighbors, Norway says its move to clean energy will be gradual and has no intention of giving up oil and gas exploration.Norway says it will honor a plan to raise the country’s carbon tax to 2,000 Norwegian kroner ($230) per metric ton. But in April, the WWF rightly called for Norway to stop all oil and gas exploration. WWF secretary-general Karoline Andaur said:Norway must immediately stop all new exploration for oil and gas, formulate a plan to reduce production from existing fields, and ensure that all choices made are in the best interests of the climate.As the world’s seventh-largest exporter of CO2 emissions, we stand at a historic crossroads. Now is the time to take our rightful responsibility and contribute to emissions cuts.The WWF is right. Norway can and must do better.Read more: Four EU countries set a massive offshore wind target of 65 GW by 2030Photo: Jan Arne Wold/Woldcam for EquinorUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/06/06,"President Joe Biden will today waive tariffs for 24 months on solar panels made in Southeast Asia in response to a Department of Commerce (DOC) investigation that is destabilizing the US solar industry. Biden’s action comes in response to a DOC probe into whether Southeast Asian solar cell manufacturers are using parts made in China that would normally be subject to a tariff. The US solar industry relies on solar module imports to meet growing demand. As Electrek reported on May 16:The vast majority of the US solar industry asserts that the DOC investigation, which launched on April 1, will devastate solar businesses and want it to be dismissed. Most also don’t think the investigation – the result of a petition filed by a single US solar crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell manufacturer who is incapable of supplying the entire US solar industry – should have been launched to begin with.Reuters also reported in an exclusive yesterday that “Biden also will invoke the Defense Production Act to drive US manufacturing of solar panels and other clean energy technologies in the future, with the support of loans and grants, the sources said.”The Biden administration is working to spur the rapid growth of domestic manufacturing of solar components, but does not want to interfere with the DOC inquiry.Biden’s waiver will apply to Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam and run parallel to the investigation.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement today:We applaud President Biden’s thoughtful approach to addressing the current crisis of the paralyzed solar supply chain…While the Department of Commerce investigation will continue as required by statute, and we remain confident that a review of the facts will result in a negative determination, the president’s action is a much-needed reprieve from this industry-crushing probe. During the two-year tariff suspension window, the US solar industry can return to rapid deployment while the Defense Production Act helps grow American solar manufacturing.Thank you @POTUS and all who worked tirelessly to find a thoughtful solution.

2022/06/03,"Southwest Airlines announced this week that it’s investing in SAFFiRE Renewables as part of a Department of Energy (DOE)-backed project to develop and produce scalable, sustainable aviation fuel. SAFFIRE is a company formed by D3MAX. Both are based in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Here’s what D3MAX does:In 2021, the DOE awarded D3MAX the only pilot-scale grant for sustainable aviation fuel production, with a goal of eventual commercialization. The NREL believes that this could produce significant quantities of cost-competitive sustainable aviation fuel that could provide an 84% reduction in carbon intensity compared to conventional jet fuel on a life cycle basis.  SAFFiRE is an acronym for Sustainable Aviation Fuel From Renewable Ethanol. The company, which was formed this year, uses technology developed by the DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to convert waste biomass like corn stover – the leaves, stalks, and cobs of maize plants left over after harvest – into renewable ethanol that will then be upgraded into sustainable aviation fuel. Corn stover is widely available in the United States.SAFFIRE is funded with a DOE grant that Southwest Airlines is matching, and that money supports phase one of the project, which is expected to include technology validation, preliminary design, and a business plan for a sustainable aviation fuel pilot plant.If the first phase is successful, DOE and Southwest will be able to fund a second phase for the design, fabrication, installation, and operation of a pilot plant that produces renewable ethanol using technology developed by D3MAX and NREL. In the second phase, Deerfield, Illinois-based sustainable fuels technology company LanzaJet is expected to upgrade renewable ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel at its biorefinery, which is currently under construction in Soperton, Georgia.SAFFIRE’s CEO says that if it is successful in developing and commercializing the sustainable aviation fuel, the company projects that its technology can produce 7.5 billion gallons per year by 2040.US Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk said:The Department of Energy is committed to turning our ambitious aviation decarbonization goals into realities through strong partnerships across the airline industry.Moving cutting-edge technology advances in sustainable aviation to production scale will save money, reduce carbon emissions, and reshape the future of the airline travel for the benefit of American consumers.Read more: Is the first fossil-free jet fuel made from CO2 viable?

2022/06/03,"Contrary to popular belief, air-source heat pumps can work very well in cold climates. They’re now the best choice for energy efficiency and reducing heating bills, and that’s why their adoption is going to grow quickly in colder countries.Even when it’s below zero, there is still heat in the air, so during colder months, heat pumps extract outdoor air and move it to the inside of a home. In warmer months, the heat pump acts like an air conditioner, removing heat from the air inside a home and transferring it outside. A regular heat pump running on electricity may lose efficiency and performance when the outside temperature is below freezing, but a cold-climate heat pump achieves better heating performance than a conventional one. (A heat pump installer here in Vermont told me that they work efficiently to -15F.)However, no clear guidelines or standards exist for cold-climate heat pumps, and many installers are not yet fully aware of the distinction between a regular heat pump and a cold-climate heat pump. So, the generic heat pump is still being installed in colder areas. This gives the cold-climate heat pump substantial growth potential, and manufacturers will need to take advantage of market opportunities by educating stakeholders.According to a new report from Guidehouse Insights, a market intelligence and advisory firm that covers the global energy transformation, the heat pump market in cold climates in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific for both regular and cold-climate heat pumps is expected to grow from $6.57 billion in 2022 to $13.11 billion in 2031 at a compound annual growth rate of 8%.The researchers write in the report’s executive summary:Northern Europe’s cold-climate regions are expected to lead market growth, expanding from $2.51 billion in 2022 to $5.93 billion in 2031 at a CAGR of 10%. North America is expected to follow. As electrification trends move forward there, the HP market is anticipated to grow from $1.46 billion in 2022 to $3.31 billion in 2031 at a CAGR of 9.6%. Although the cold-climate regions in Asia Pacific have the largest market size in 2022, the HP market there shows the lowest growth rate, so the European market is expected to outpace it by 2031. The Asia Pacific HP market is expected to grow from $2.60 billion in 2022 to $3.86 billion in 2031 at a CAGR of 4.5%.The executive summary notes that “market drivers include policy support, clean heating, high efficiency in certain conditions, technology innovation, utilization during heat waves, and increasedrenewable power generation.”It also says that “market barriers include high electricity prices, a heating culture that rejectsthe technology, technological limits, lack of clear cold-climate heat pump guidelines, a shortage of experts and a lack of awareness, and a lack of product type in certain regions.”Check out this guide from Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships to learn more about heat pumps.Read more: These new, affordable electric heat pumps can easily replace gas boilersPhoto: yourlocalsparky/flickrUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

On average, the [Bureau of Land Management] expects rents and fees to decrease by over 50% due to lower acreage rents and a standard megawatt fee that promotes more efficient wind and solar or hybrid projects on public lands.  The DOI is working to permit 25 gigawatts of clean energy on public lands by 2025 – enough to power around 4.75 million homes.In 2021, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) permitted 2.89 gigawatts (GW), up 35% from 2020.The DOI will also establish Renewable Energy Coordination Offices in BLM offices in western states in order to increase staff numbers to process renewable energy environmental reviews and permit applications. The Renewable Energy Coordination Offices are expected to facilitate increased engagement between the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Energy, and Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency.The BLM’s website states:Across the 245 million acres of public land it manages, the BLM has prioritized a combined total of roughly 870,000 acres for solar energy development within its land use plans. Under a scenario where 8.5 acres is needed to generate 1 megawatt of electricity from photovoltaic solar panels, these prioritized areas could support more than 100 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 29 million homes.Read more: US announces the first offshore wind lease sale off the CarolinasUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/05/27,"The G7, made up of the world’s largest economies, today agreed to “predominantly decarbonized electricity sectors by 2035.” The G7 also agreed to end government financing for international coal-fired power generation and speed up the phase-out of unabated coal plants by 2035.“Unabated” refers to electricity generation that doesn’t use technology to capture emissions. The G7 is made up of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the UK. The statement the group released today says on page 32:Recalling our agreement in the 2021 Climate and Environment communique, we further commit to a goal of achieving predominantly decarbonized electricity sectors by 2035, prioritizing, consistent with our 2030 NDCs, our power sector transition commitments and our respective net zero commitments, concrete and timely steps towards the goal of an eventual phase-out of domestic unabated coal power generation. To this end, we will rapidly scale up the necessary technologies and policies for the clean energy transition.The coal phase-out is a particularly big deal for Japan, which got 32% of its electricity from coal in 2019. As of February 2022, coal made up nearly 22% of US electricity generation. The Biden administration set a goal of carbon-free electricity by 2030 in December.The movement away from fossil fuels has been sped up by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the urgent need to stop buying fossil fuels from Russia as a result.The G7 ministers also said that new road vehicles in their respective countries would be “predominantly” zero-emissions vehicles by 2030.CNN notes:[The G7’s] decisions on energy and climate are often pitched to the wider G20 group, which together produce 80% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. The G20 will meet in Bali in November.Environmental nonprofit think tank Ember‘s COO Phil MacDonald said of the G7 announcement:The G7 have just changed the game for the global energy transition. The science shows that decarbonizing electricity by 2035 is the quickest and cheapest way to net zero. The past few years have made abundantly clear the many benefits of moving away from fossil fuels, and the G7 are now in agreement that this ambitious target is achievable and desirable.

2022/05/25,"The EU plans to transition to renewables more than twice as fast as Japan by 2030, according to new analysis released by global energy think tank Ember ahead of the G7 environment, climate, and energy ministers meeting, which kicks off today in Berlin. The ministers will decide whether and how G7 countries will commit to clean power by 2035. Over the next eight years, the EU is planning to shift 32% of its total electricity production to renewables, while Japan is planning to shift only 13% of its own electricity supply. Europe’s shift will allow it to save €100 billion each year on gas, oil, and coal imports and cut Russian gas usage by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Rooftop solar, the foundation of the EU’s plan, will make up over half of its total solar capacity by 2030. This is thanks to new legislation seeking to make solar panels mandatory for all public and new residential buildings by 2025 and 2029, respectively. In total, the EU is planning an additional 750 gigawatts GW of solar electricity by 2030. In Japan, solar power has seen significant growth over the last decade, but rooftop solar made up only 10% of the country’s solar installations last year. That highlights not only a key difference between the two energy plans, but also an opportunity for Japan to further expand rooftop solar capacity. When it comes to offshore wind energy, the International Energy Agency’s executive director Fatih Birol believes that Japan could become a “global leader” in the offshore wind industry, but its current plan is to develop only 10 GW by 2030. This is in stark contrast to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands, which just last week announced an offshore wind target of 65 GW by 2030, and the UK alone is planning to develop 50 GW by 2030. Read more: Four EU countries set a massive offshore wind target of 65 GW by 2030Combined, that’s more than 10 times Japan’s current 10 GW target that it announced in 2020.The EU currently generates 19% of its electricity from wind and solar. Thanks to the REpowerEU plan, the EU is forecast to move an additional one-third (32%) of its total electricity production to renewables. This will enable the EU to reach a more than 80% clean electricity system by 2030 and put it well on track to achieving a 100% clean electricity system by 2035. In contrast, Japan currently generates 11% of its electricity from renewables and is planning to shift only an additional 13% of its electricity to renewables over the next eight years. Dave Jones, global programs lead at Ember, said:Solar and wind are currently playing cameo roles in Japan’s electricity system, but they are ready to step up to take the lead role. Record fossil fuel prices and the need to reduce imports from Russia should be a wake-up call. Japan needs more homegrown clean energy; Japan needs more ambition on solar and wind.Photo: “Solar Panels at Sunset” by kaeru.my is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar
2022/05/23,"St. Petersburg, Florida-based Climate First Bank, which claims to be the world’s first FDIC-insured community bank founded to fight the climate crisis, today launched an online solar lending platform for Florida residents.Homeowners in Florida can now apply online for solar energy financing with no dealer fee. It consists of a simplified online application process and real-time approvals. Climate First Bank claims that most applicants can get approved for up to 100% financing with no money down in less than 48 business hours. In addition to a low monthly payment option, customers can fully prepay their loan at any time with no prepayment penalty or fee and keep their 26% tax credit. Any payments made in addition to the contractual monthly payment will be applied toward a reduction in the principal balance of the loan.Climate First Bank is offering a special promotion – 3.99% APR for 25 years with zero dealer fee – for the first 100 loans via its platform. Its example is based on a 25-year, $50,000 loan financed with four interest-only payments and 296 principal and interest payments of $265.84 with a 3.94% simple interest rate. Solar energy loan financiers often try to attract clients with low interest-rate loans with very low payments. Climate First Bank says there’s a catch – undisclosed dealer fees that amount to more than 25% of the total cost of the system. Those hidden fees are charged to the solar panel installer and then passed down to the consumer, resulting in a larger total cost. For example, a $30,000 solar energy system could mean up to $7,500 in undisclosed fees. This means a $30,000 system could cost $37,500. Not only does this negatively impact the client, but it affects the whole solar loan industry.Climate First Bank President Lex Ford said:Our robust tool is the next step forward for sustainable lending, making it easy for anyone who wants to stick a solar panel on top of their roof. Thanks to our transparent solar financing, consumers can purchase a solar energy system with no undisclosed surcharges or fees. Clients, installers, and the planet alike all win with this new platform.Florida residents can apply for the solar loan here. Climate First’s spokesperson says it will extend its online solar loan service to other states.This is a genuinely good deal for Florida residents who want to install rooftop solar. And it’s good news on top of good news, as Florida’s governor vetoed a bad bill in April that would have denied homeowners net metering.If I still lived in Florida, I would be completing my application today for this financing deal.

2022/05/19,"Four EU countries – Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands – jointly announced yesterday that they have set an offshore wind target of at least 65 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and then intend to more than double that combined total to 150 GW by 2050.For perspective, according to the Global Wind Energy Council, as of September 2021, there were 35.3 GW of global offshore wind capacity.That giant offshore wind push by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands will deliver at least half the capacity needed for the EU to reach net zero by 2050.The EU has set an overall target of generating 300 GW of offshore wind by 2050, which is up from the current 16 GW installed.Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen said that the four EU countries that will build the offshore wind farms off their North Sea coasts “want to increase our total offshore wind capacity fourfold by 2030 and tenfold by 2050.”The goal is to provide clean energy from offshore wind to 230 million EU homes and also provide clean energy to make green hydrogen and green fuels for heavy industries and transportation.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said:The North Sea is the place where, with the offshore wind parks, we can produce electricity on a large scale, in the large quantities we need — and can already do [that] today in a way that it is economical.The announcement from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands followed the unveiling earlier in the day yesterday of the RePowerEU Plan, the European Commission‘s “response to the hardships and global energy market disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The EU imported around 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil from Russia last year, and it’s working to end the EU’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels “well in advance of 2030” and fight climate change. An EU ban on Russian coal is expected to start in August.The RePowerEU Plan is a three-pronged plan: faster adoption of clean energy, a boost in energy-saving efforts, and more non-Russian natural gas imports.Reuters notes of the natural gas imports:The Commission said some investments in fossil fuel infrastructure would be required – €10 billion for a dozen gas and liquefied natural gas projects, and up to €2 billion for oil, targeting land-locked Central and Eastern European countries that lack access to non-Russian supply.The European Commission said new gas infrastructure would be able to carry green hydrogen in the future.The plan will cost cost up to €300 billion ($316 billion) and will require an additional investment of €210 billion between now and 2027 by the public and private sectors at national, cross-border, and EU levels. It asserts that “cutting Russian fossil fuel imports can also save us almost €100 billion per year.”The European Commission also proposed a higher legally binding target of sourcing 45% of EU energy from cleaning energy sources by 2030 – a jump up from its current 40% proposal.Clean energy initiatives in the RePowerEU Plan include:Read more: Renewables will break another global record in 2022 despite supply chain problems – IEAUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/05/18,"GE Renewable Energy yesterday announced the 3 megawatt (MW) Sierra, its newest onshore wind turbine platform that will only be sold in North America.The 3 MW Sierra is, according to GE,  “built on the legacy of GE’s bestselling 2 MW platform, which recently surpassed 30 GW of installed base globally. The Sierra platform launched with two prototypes, one in Lubbock, Texas, and one in Kamataka, India, with more than a year of successful run time on each.”The 3.0–3.4 MW turbine features a larger 140-meter rotor “to unlock value at lower wind speeds” and is offered with a variety of hub heights, including a greater-than-500-foot option. A wind turbine’s hub height is the distance from the ground to the middle of the turbine’s rotor.Sierra also includes GE’s 68.7-meter, two-piece blade, which improves logistics, installation, and serviceability. Two-piece blades significantly drive down logistical costs by enabling blade assembly onsite and reducing costs for permitting equipment and road work required for transporting longer blades.The Sierra’s two-piece blades are manufactured by both Danish LM Wind Power – a multinational wind turbine rotor blades manufacturer a GE subsidiary – and Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered wind blade manufacturer TPI. The Sierra turbines will be manufactured at GE’s Pensacola, Florida, manufacturing facility, and a large portion of its components will be manufactured in North America.When we asked the GE company spokesperson what made this turbine uniquely useful in the North American market, he said that it’s easy to transport, easy to install, and easy to operate. For example, the Sierra requires more standard-size cranes instead of large ones. The GE company spokesperson further explained:This is a high-capacity factor turbine designed and optimized for US-specific logistics and balance of plant constraints, and a strong domestic supply chain to de-risk project execution and policy uncertainty.GE says it has so far received more than 1 GW of orders for the turbine platform, but its spokesperson wouldn’t identify who placed those orders.What he did say, however, was what we at Electrek say regularly, when I asked him what he felt the clean energy sector needs in order to continue to grow:It needs policy certainty and production tax credit in order to grow the onshore wind industry.You can read more about the Sierra onshore wind turbine’s specifications here.Read more: GE’s huge Haliade-X 14 MW offshore wind turbine is now operationalPhoto: GE Renewable EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/05/16,"A US Department of Commerce (DOC) probe — investigating whether Southeast Asian solar cell manufacturers are using parts made in China that would normally be subject to a tariff — is destabilizing the US solar industry, which relies on solar module imports to meet growing demand. Bipartisan lawmakers wanted answers from US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo at a hearing last week, but she basically responded that the inquiry is beyond her control.The vast majority of the US solar industry asserts that the DOC investigation, which launched on April 1, will devastate solar businesses and want it to be dismissed. Most also don’t think the investigation – the result of a petition filed by a single US solar crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell manufacturer who is incapable of supplying the entire US solar industry – should have been launched to begin with.According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are being cut by 46% as a result of the DOC investigation. The case will result in a drop of 24 gigawatts of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021.Read more: Here’s how a new US protectionist move is backfiring badly on the US solar industryThe International Energy Agency echoed those concerns last week when it reported that US solar growth is now “clouded by uncertainty” due to “trade actions against solar PV imports from China and Southeast Asia.”Last Wednesday, Raimondo testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies about President Joe Biden’s budget request for fiscal year 2023. There, senators probed Raimondo about the solar investigation. She demurred:I personally am not, I don’t have discretion or ability to weigh in on their fact-finding process.She said that her department would move “as fast as possible” on the investigation, which will likely last until the end of August. She added, “If we can do better than August, we certainly will.”  According to the Washington Post, Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) “mused about crafting legislation that would require a certain percentage of solar developers to sign off on such probes in the future. He said to Raimondo:Why is there no industry-supported threshold to initiate this anti-circumvention inquiry? Would legislation be helpful?When I’ve asked you this question, I think the answer has been, ‘Our hands are tied.’ I’m trying to figure out how to untie your hands.Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) told Raimondo:You do have the discretion to get a little more personally engaged. It doesn’t jeopardize the independence of the investigation.The DOC investigation is a serious threat to Biden’s goal of the electricity sector reaching net zero by 2035. US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last Thursday [via the Washington Post]:At stake is the complete smothering of the investment and the jobs and the independence we would be seeking as a nation to get our fuel from our own generation sources.I am deeply concerned about being able to get to the goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 if this is not resolved quickly.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA, said in an official statement:The American solar industry needs clarity from the Commerce Department, not further obfuscation and tumult.I’ve been following this story since it first broke. This latest development with Raimondo flew under my radar last week (sorry, folks, I’m just one person on the clean energy beat), but Ross Hopper told me about it when I saw her Saturday morning at the Dartmouth Innovation & Technology Festival. When I asked the sustainability panel Ross Hopper sat on about how they thought this investigation could be resolved quickly in order to avert this potential disaster, her diplomatic and logical answer was that legislators should pass the Build Back Better bill. (As an aside, Representative Annie McLane Kuster (D-NH) was also on the panel, and she also used diplomacy when she touched upon West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin‘s obstruction of that bill. She tried to plant seeds of hope that Manchin will eventually play ball. I did not come away inspired.)But when Hopper and I spoke afterward, she made it clear, as she has to other press, that she is angry about Raimondo’s inertia. Her anger is justified.I get that Raimondo is trying to avoid political interference in the DOC’s investigation. But surely there is an ethical and legal way to resolve this quickly and efficiently. Energy secretary Granholm sounding the alarm, if nothing else, should be a signal to Raimondo that she doesn’t have to sit back and do nothing in order to behave ethically. There’s too much at stake to be caught up in bureaucratic process. Raimondo must choose to actively problem-solve and not pass the buck.Photo: “Solar Installation at Washington County Landfill (Closed)” by MN Pollution Control Agency is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.",solar
2022/05/13,"IKEA announced yesterday that it’s partnering with residential energy services provider SunPower, a 35-year solar veteran, to sell home solar panels to US customers. The Swedish-based multinational company wants to make solar more easily accessible for consumers.Home Solar with IKEA is expected to launch in select California markets in fall of 2022, and then gradually expand across the US.Javier Quiñones, CEO and chief sustainability officer at IKEA US said:We’re proud to collaborate with SunPower to bring this service to the US and enable our customers to make individual choices aimed at reducing their overall climate footprint.The launch of Home Solar with IKEA will allow more people to take greater control of their energy needs, and our goal is to offer the clean energy service at additional IKEA locations in the future.The flat-pack furniture giant already sells solar panels in 11 other markets. Customers in those markets can track their usage with an app, and they can also sell surplus electricity back to IKEA.As for the specific details of how the IKEA solar offering will work for customers, a SunPower spokesperson told Electrek:SunPower is creating solar offerings exclusively for IKEA US, and information about the products and services will be available to customers in-store and online. The program will launch this fall in select California stores to members of the IKEA Family customer loyalty program.As Fast Company pointed out about IKEA’s clean energy initiatives in August 2021:In 2016, [IKEA] pledged to generate more renewable electricity than it uses by 2020, and exceeded its target by investing in two solar parks in the United States and one wind farm in Romania. After investing $2.8 billion in green energy, the company also installed more than 920,000 solar panels on 370 of its stores (or just under 90% of its total number of stores) and warehouses across the world.In the US, IKEA has a clean energy portfolio that includes two wind farms, two solar farms, two geothermal systems, seven biogas-fuel cells, and rooftop solar arrays on 90% of IKEA locations.Read more: IKEA is now selling clean energy to Swedish households (no Allen key needed)UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/05/12,"In order to understand the impacts of adopting rooftop solar in the United States, customer review and consumer news platform ConsumerAffairs polled 1,000 US homeowners about their views on and overall experience with solar panels. Here’s what the homeowners said.Homeowners who have installed solar panels explained their top reasons for doing so, as well as how much they spent:Homeowners who adopted solar spent $11,735, on average, and it took seven years to see a return on investment.And, those who haven’t made the switch to rooftop solar shared their top deterrents:St. Petersburg, Florida, and Knoxville, Tennessee, saw the two largest percentage increases in home sale prices for putting solar panels on roofs. Homeowners with solar in those two cities were able to sell for a staggering 159% and 149% more than others, respectively. California, which is regularly at the forefront of green initiatives and legislation, had 11 of the top 75 cities with the highest price increases in clean energy home sales. New York had the highest number of clean energy homes listed for sale.Even the four cities at the very bottom of the percentage value bump – Seattle; Columbus, Ohio; Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Anaheim, California – saw a 1% rise in selling price on houses with solar panels.70% of homeowners polled were pleased by the substantial increase in home value after installation.Homeowners can make a significant amount of money from adopting solar, especially after the initial cost of installation is paid off. On average, US solar homes reported an average annual savings of $1,587 just from energy costs alone.

2022/05/12,"New capacity for generating electricity from renewables such as solar, wind, and other clean energy increased to a record level worldwide in 2021. And clean energy will continue to grow in 2022, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA).The world added a record 295 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power capacity in 2021, overcoming supply chain challenges, construction delays, and high raw material prices, according to the IEA’s latest Renewable Energy Market Update. Global capacity additions are expected to rise 25 GW this year to 320 GW. That’s the equivalent of meeting the entire electricity demand of Germany, or matching the EU’s total electricity generation from natural gas. Solar is on track to account for 60% of global renewable power growth in 2022, followed by wind and hydropower.In the European Union, annual additions jumped by almost 30% to 36 gigawatts in 2021. Europe’s renewable capacity is set to grow more in 2022 and 2023, as Brussels aims to launch a “European Solar Rooftops Initiative” to help cut gas-fueled power and heating in domestic and commercial buildings and move away from Russian fossil fuels, according to a draft seen by Reuters, which is expected to be published next week.Euronews explains how the initiative would work:The scheme would require the EU and national governments to take action this year to limit permitting times to three months for rooftop installations. It would push countries to use EU funding and launch support programs for rooftop panels, and install solar energy in all suitable public buildings by 2025.The IEA points out that fast renewable growth is being boosted by strong policy support in China, the European Union, and Latin America. But as for the US, it explains:The US outlook is clouded by uncertainty over new incentives for wind and solar and by trade actions against solar PV imports from China and Southeast Asia.Read more: Here’s how a new US protectionist move is backfiring badly on the US solar industryIEA executive director Fatih Birol said:Cutting red tape, accelerating permitting, and providing the right incentives for faster deployment of renewables are some of the most important actions governments can take to address today’s energy security and market challenges, while keeping alive the possibility of reaching our international climate goals.However, 2023 could see a plateau in renewable power capacity due to a 40% decline in hydropower expansion and little change in wind power additions, so new and stronger policies are needed globally to keep up the momentum.As for supply chain problems due to the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, renewables are still competitive, because prices for fossil fuels have risen much faster.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

Up to 16 prequalified bidders competed for lease rights for 110,091 acres off North Carolina’s and South Carolina’s shores. Together, they will result in at least 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes.  At 4:56 p.m. BOEM announced the provisional winners:BREAKING NEWS: With $315 million in high bids, the provisional winners of the #CarolinaLongBay wind energy auction have been announced. 🌊 110K+ acres for development🔌 1.3GW clean energy potential🏠 500K+ homes supplied💰 $42M for domestic supply chain + workforce training pic.twitter.com/hgFynfeMzjAfter 18 rounds, OCS-A 0545 went to French multinational TotalEnergies Renewables USA for $160 million, and OCS-A 0546 went to Duke Energy Renewables Wind for $155 million.The Carolina Long Bay offshore wind auction included a new 20% credit for bidders that committed to a monetary contribution to programs or initiatives that support workforce training programs for the offshore wind industry, development of a US domestic supply chain for the offshore wind energy industry, or both. This credit will result in $42 million for these critical programs or initiatives.White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy tweeted:President Biden keeps delivering on the opportunities of clean energy. Today’s offshore wind auction brought in $315 million for Carolina Long Bay areas with the potential to power 500,000 homes. And more offshore wind means more jobs for American workers! https://t.co/EDLx2GVOhZLiz Burdock, CEO and founder of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, issued the following statement:Today, America’s offshore wind industry and its supply chain took another significant step forward with the successful Wilmington East lease auction. For the first time, the federal government used an auction system designed to spark investment directly into US manufacturers, small businesses, shipbuilders, and new workforce training, accelerating development of the already-emerging domestic supply chain. With global demand for offshore wind soaring, the US must seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity and develop a robust domestic supply chain to secure our energy future.And Anthony Allard, head of North America for Hitachi Energy, said in an emailed statement to Electrek:Not only is the sale a major milestone for our clean energy future, but the United States’ growing offshore wind energy industry presents a $109 billion revenue opportunity to businesses in the supply chain over the next decade.BOEM says that the two lease blocks within the area have similar acreage, distance to shore, and wind resource potential.BOEM reported on LinkedIn yesterday that it conducted environmental reviews and issued a finding of no significant impact. It also worked with the commercial fishing industry, tribes, partnering agencies, key stakeholders, and the public to reduce conflicts with ocean users and minimize environmental impacts. The agency said it will continue to engage with stakeholders as the development process unfolds.In regards to bird flight patterns near wind turbines, BOEM reported:We are including a stipulation, at the recommendation of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, requiring the use of Motus telemetry tracking stations on meteorological buoys to help address information gaps on offshore movements of birds and bats, including ESA-listed species. Read more: The first US offshore wind farm has had no negative effect on fish, finds groundbreaking studyPhoto: BOEM",solar
2022/05/10,"The US achieved a new record in April 2022 – for the first time, the US generated 20% of its electricity from wind and solar power, according to new data released today from global energy think tank Ember.The record is being predominantly driven by a wind boom in the Great Plains and the Midwest, across states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.As Electrek reported on April 28, in March, the US generated 18% of its electricity from wind and solar (59 TWh) for the first time. That beat the previous record set in March 2021 (53 TWh).US wind and solar adoption is escalating. In 2015, the US generated 5.7% of its electricity from wind and solar (229.8 TWh). By 2021, it had more than doubled to reach 13% of its electricity from wind and solar (543.5 TWh).  According to Deloitte US’s 2022 renewable energy industry outlook, “Wind and solar capacity additions of 13.8 GW in the first eight months of 2021 were up 28% over the same period in 2020.”Wind and solar were the fastest-growing forms of electricity worldwide for the 17th year in a row in 2021.Globally, wind and solar energy have doubled since 2015 to deliver a record 10% of global electricity in 2021, according to Ember’s Global Electricity Review. The International Energy Agency stated that in order to reach the Paris Agreement net-zero by the 2050 target, wind and solar need to reach 20% of global electricity by 2025 and 70% by 2050.Many European countries have already produced more than 25% of their electricity from wind and solar in 2021, including Germany, Spain, and the UK. This is helping to rapidly reduce their reliance on imported fossil fuels from Russia.Ember’s COO, Phil MacDonald, said: Wind and solar are breaking records around the world. The process that will reshape the existing energy system has begun. Wind and solar provide a solution to the “trilemma” of achieving a sustainable, affordable and secure energy supply.

2022/05/09,"Europe’s largest floating solar farm – which is on the Alqueva hydroelectric dam’s reservoir in Portugal – is ready to produce power in July.The Alqueva reservoir is Western Europe’s largest artificial lake, and the Alqueva Dam is on the Guadiana River, one of the longest in the Iberian Peninsula. The dam is in Alentejo, which is in southern Portugal, near the Spanish border.The floating solar farm, the size of four soccer fields, is made up of 12,000 solar panels that will generate 7.5 gigawatt-hours annually and will also be paired with lithium batteries that can store 2 GWh. It will be able to power around 1,500 households. EDP, Portugal’s main utility company, built the floating solar farm.The cool thing about floating solar farms on hydropower reservoirs is that they can be connected to existing links to the power grid. And as Reuters points out, “Excess power generated on sunny days can pump water up into the lake to be stored for use on cloudy days or at night.”The Alqueva floating solar farm is furthering EDP’s plan to reach net zero by 2030. Renewables, including hydropower, now make up 78% of EDP’s 25.6 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity.EDP will expand the Alqueva floating solar farm because, last month, it secured the right to build a second, 70-MW installed capacity floating farm there.In 2017, EDP installed an 840-panel pilot floating solar farm on the Alto Rabagão Dam. It was the first project in Europe that tested the pairing of hydro and solar power.Portugal currently relies on Russia for around 10% of its natural gas, and this new floating solar farm will reduce that dependency.Read more: Portugal brings forward 80% clean energy target to 2026 from 2030Photo: EDPUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/05/06,"UK-headquartered multinational mining company Anglo American today launched a a prototype of the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mine haul truck in South Africa. The 2 megawatt (MW) hydrogen-battery hybrid truck generates more power than its diesel predecessor and is capable of carrying a 290-tonne (320-ton) payload. The truck includes a 1.2 MWh battery pack, as the haul truck system uses multiple fuel cells, which deliver up to 800kW of power.It’s designed to operate in everyday mining conditions at its Mogalakwena PGMs mine in northeast South Africa. The mine is the world’s largest open-pit platinum group metals mine. Anglo American intends to replace a fleet of 40 trucks there that use around a million liters of diesel annually.The truck is part of Anglo American’s nuGen Zero Emission Haulage Solution (ZEHS), a green hydrogen system at the mine site. The system will draw power from a solar farm to supply a hydrogen electrolyzer to split water, which will then provide the trucks with green hydrogen fuel.The ZEHS project is expected to be fully up and running by 2026. It’s the first step in making eight of the company’s mines carbon neutral by 2030. The global mining company has set a target of getting all of its operations to net zero by 2040.News24 reports:“People told us three years ago this is not going to happen, this is not a good idea. They are now beginning to take real notice,” Soles said at a presentation in the South African city of Polokwane. “The vision for us is to see this rolled out across our business and the mining industry. It’s Anglo’s choice whether to commercialize this.”Read more: UK’s NHS unveils new hydrogen-electric ambulances at COP26UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/05/04,"US Department of Energy-funded solar marketplace EnergySage and nonprofit accreditation body The North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) just released the results of the 2021 Solar Installer Survey, which polled more than 500 residential and commercial solar installers across 43 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC. Here’s what they said.Local, regional, and national solar installers were polled, and three standout insights emerged:Supply chain snarls hurt solar sales in 2021. Three out of five solar installers reported that their businesses were hurt by supply chain problems in 2021. Shipping delays made it harder to obtain solar panels and battery storage. More than half – 57% – of installers said it was harder to purchase and obtain the solar equipment they needed in order to sell it.There’s a shortage of trained labor, and that’s stunting industry growth. For the first time – and this is the seventh survey conducted by EnergySage and NABCEP – respondents said that a lack of trained labor was the largest barrier to growing their businesses. This proved to be more of a hindrance than both customer acquisition and equipment availability.A 10-year investment tax credit extension would immediately create more jobs. Half of survey respondents said they would hire more people if Congress extended the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for 10 years. Further, 70% of installers said the introduction of a direct-pay option for the ITC – an upfront cash rebate as opposed to a tax credit post-installation – would result in a growth of consumer demand for solar.So what can we conclude? First, that Congress most definitely needs to extend the ITC. And the industry is right about direct pay: It would boost consumer confidence in investing in solar and make it more accessible, cost-wise.Secondly, the US Department of Commerce needs to conclude their investigation into whether Southeast Asian solar cell manufacturers are using parts made in China that would normally be subject to a tariff … like, now. Because it’s doing serious damage to the US solar industry, which simply isn’t capable of manufacturing its own components yet at scale. (You can read more about that here.)And thirdly, it sounds like NABCEP needs to ramp up their accredited training program opportunities even more as the industry grows. People interested in working in the solar industry need to be able to find training opportunities and job opportunities quickly. A little more PR investment into promoting solar career opportunities would also probably go a long way.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/05/04,"Offshore construction work has officially started for the UK’s Dogger Bank, which will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm, with the installation of the first length of HVDC export cable off the Yorkshire coast. Dogger Bank will also be the first HVDC-connected wind farm in the UK.Dogger Bank Wind Farm, a joint venture between Norwegian energy giant Equinor (40%), British utility SSE Renewables (40%), and Italian energy company Eni Plenitude (20%), will be developed in three phases: A, B, and C. It will become the largest offshore wind farm in the world upon completion, with an installed capacity of 3.6 gigawatts (GW). Each phase will be 1.2 GW.Denmark-headquartered cable supplier NKT will supply and install the onshore and offshore HVDC cable for all three phases of the project. The company will use its cable-laying vessel NKT Victoria to install the 320kV DC subsea cable system in the North Sea.The campaign will continue during 2022, with work starting on the export cables for Dogger Bank B in East Riding and Dogger Bank C on Teesside in the consecutive years.Dogger Bank Wind Farm project director Steve Wilson, said:This is an exciting time for everyone involved in this project as we celebrate installing the first nearshore HVDC export cable safely and on time.With the first foundations due to be installed later this year and the first turbines scheduled for installation in 2023, we’re now well on our way to achieving first power from this unrivaled global renewable energy asset.The wind farm will be capable of powering up to 6 million UK homes once it’s completed in 2026 – and there are approximately 28.1 million households in the country.At the beginning of December 2021, SSE and Equinor announced that they had secured financing to proceed with the construction of the $3.98 billion Dogger Bank C.GE Renewable Energy will provide 87 units of the enormous Haliade-X 14 MW wind turbines for Dogger Bank C. As Electrek previously reported, “According to GE, one turbine can generate up to 74 GWh of gross annual energy production, saving up to 52,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of the emissions from 11,000 vehicles in one year.”Photo: GEUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

Pemex, which is a state-owned petroleum company managed and operated by the Mexican government, is one of the world’s most-indebted oil companies. López Obrador also wants to strengthen the control of state power utility Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) over the power market, because he feels it was skewed in favor of private capital in the past. But last month, opposition parties united to vote down a constitutional overhaul of the power market, saying dependency on Pemex is causing dependency on failing fossil fuels. As Reuters explains:The president’s plan sought to tighten CFE control of the market at the expense of private companies. That caused friction with investors in solar and wind power generation as well as manufacturers with commitments to use more clean energy.So the center-right National Action Party (PAN) says, as it ramps up for six gubernatorial elections in June and the 2024 elections, that it would have CFE and the Mexican government put solar panels on all houses free of charge. Marko Cortes, PAN’s leader, said the program would start with “the poorest,” according to Reuters.Cortes posted on Twitter about clean energy, EVs, and solar. He wrote (translated into English):We challenge Morena and @lopezobrador_ to create real savings in the pockets of families with our legislative proposal to place free solar panels on the roofs of Mexican homes. Let’s go for a sustainable Mexico!And he says in the video:People wouldn’t pay anything, or would pay a lot less for their electricity bill.Retamos a Morena y @lopezobrador_ a crear un verdadero ahorro en el bolsillo de las familias con nuestra propuesta legislativa de colocar de manera gratuita paneles solares en los techos de los hogares de los mexicanos.¡Vamos por un México sustentable!pic.twitter.com/UGb2rqFxfEReuters continues:Cortes said the solar panels would be paid for by a subsidy currently going to CFE, and be free for people in the lowest energy consumption bracket. The first phase of the initiative aimed to reach around 5 million households, he said.High electricity prices and power shortages are driving Mexican homeowners toward rooftop solar.

2022/05/02,"The US Department of Commerce (DOC) is investigating whether Southeast Asian solar cell manufacturers are using parts made in China that would normally be subject to a tariff. A group of bipartisan senators today joined most of the US solar industry in asserting that the DOC investigation will devastate solar businesses, as they rely on solar module imports to meet growing demand.May 2: Twenty-two senators today released a letter to President Joe Biden that calls on him to expedite the DOC’s investigation into solar panels and cells imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. The bipartisan group wrote:Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues.We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.The full letter can be read here.April 27: According to new analysis, conducted last week and released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are being cut by 46% due to the DOC investigation. The case will result in a drop of 24 gigawatts (GW) of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021.SEIA has also collected more than 700 survey responses to capture project-level data and the impact felt by companies.Four-fifths of survey respondents – 83% – that purchase or use photovoltaic modules reported canceled or delayed module supply.318 utility-scale projects that account for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being canceled or delayed. $52 billion of utility-scale investment is at risk. SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said:This case is destroying clean energy, and needlessly taking down American businesses and workers in its wake.April 5: The DOC’s investigation of the assembly of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells in four Southeast Asian countries could take up to a year, and suppliers have indicated they may stop shipments from those countries to the US until a final ruling is issued.Auxin Solar, a California-based solar panel manufacturer whose website states that it’s the “longest-running CSPV producer in the USA,” petitioned the US Department of Commerce in February to conduct an anti-dumping circumvention investigation of solar cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Auxin claims that tariffs on solar imports would boost domestic manufacturing. But the majority of US solar companies, as well as the SEIA, oppose this investigation, because the US is dependent on solar module imports to meet growing demand.So SEIA put out a survey to solar companies to measure the impact of the DOC’s investigation on their businesses.As of 8 a.m. ET today, 74% of 200 companies surveyed reported that their panel deliveries have already been canceled or delayed. According to the SEIA, 84% of all US solar moduleimports come from the four countries being investigated, and there is insufficient non-Chinese capacity elsewhere to cost-effectively supply US demand.Further, all solar companies surveyed anticipated damage across the value chain, and 100% of domestic manufacturers in particular are expecting the Southeast Asian investigation to have severe or devastating impacts.The results of this survey come as the industry experiences unprecedented supply chain challenges and price increases. In 2021, solar equipment costs increased by 18%, and the threat of previous trade actions caused project delays and cancellations, according to a report released by SEIA and Wood Mackenzie.A subsequent report by Wood Mackenzie found that the circumvention petitions could eliminate 16 gigawatts of panels from the US supply chain, which is two-thirds of all the panels the US installed in 2021. SEIA estimates that as a result of this petition, the solar industry will lose 70,000 out of its 231,000 jobs.Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO, said today in an emailed statement:We urge the administration to expedite this investigation and end this unnecessary roadblock to our clean energy future.We’ve said that tariffs are not the right way to incentivize manufacturing, and that it is going to take time and policy commitment to move manufacturing into the United States at the scale that’s needed.The countries named in the petition have been reliable trading partners, and we need their products, in the near term at least, while we fight to establish a sustained and powerful manufacturing presence here in America.This DOC investigation is well intended and poorly executed. A US tariff on products made abroad isn’t going to do any good if enough of those products to supply demand aren’t made domestically.It’s great that Auxin Solar manufactures CSPV cells, but can it make enough for every single solar company in the US that needs them?US manufacturing of solar cells and panels needs to be kickstarted, but it’s a major and significant operation that will take years to establish.And as a result, the much-needed solar industry growth could come to a screeching halt, and then everyone loses.The Biden administration needs to reconsider this investigation, as it’s shooting its own climate change goals in the foot and kneecapping the vital solar industry.Read more: Wind, solar, EVs, can prevent catastrophic climate change, says new IPCC report UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

The rest came from wind, geothermal, and other renewable sources. The milestone lasted almost 15 minutes before edging back down to about 97% renewables.Environment California state director Laura Deehan said in an emailed statement:California has shown that, for one brief and shining moment, we could do it! Now we need to get our state running on 100% clean energy for the whole day, the whole week, and the whole year. It’s time to move to 100% clean energy, 100% of the time.California has a mandated clean energy target of 100% clean electricity by 2045. In 2020, California surpassed 81% clean energy, so Saturday’s milestone demonstrates that the state is making progress. Hydropower is becoming less reliable due to the severe drought situation in the West, and California is shutting down its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant by 2025.California is of course still running natural gas plants, and as Canary Media pointed out today, it still burned enough gas to meet about 15% of demand while it had enough non-hydro clean energy production to meet 97% of demand. The excess natural gas was exported to other states. Saturday’s milestone is worth celebrating, but California still has a lot of work to do to run on 100% clean energy year-round.

The practice reduces strain on the grid and diversifies energy sources, benefiting all energy consumers, not only those with rooftop solar.Justin Vandenbroeck, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association, said:[DeSantis’] decision to veto this bill will allow our industry to continue growing and give more homeowners in our state the chance to lower their electric bills with solar.Electrek’s Take: This is a huge surprise, and I am happy to admit my prediction that DeSantis would sign this was wrong. Solar in Florida is vital, and homeowners need this incentive to continue to adopt it. I don’t care what DeSantis’ motive is, he had the sense to pay attention to the fact that nearly 90% of the state’s population didn’t want net metering discarded, regardless of political affiliation.DeSantis will now sends the bill back to the House, where it will be available for consideration until the end of the current session. It takes two-thirds of the members voting in each house to override a veto in Florida. It initially passed in the House by a combined vote of  83-31, with five abstaining in the House, and 24-15 in the Senate. Will the legislature override DeSantis? We’ll see. We hope not.March 10: As the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) explains: Net metering allows residential and commercial customers who generate their own electricity from solar power to sell the electricity they aren’t using back into the grid. Legislation HB 741/SB 1024 would make solar electricity more expensive by effectively ending net metering.The bill, which cleared the legislature after being promoted almost entirely by monopoly utilities, would put rooftop solar out of reach for most Floridians. E&E News pointed out on Tuesday:Documents obtained by Floodlight in conjunction with the Miami Herald and The Guardian showed the bill (HB 741/SB1024) had significant influence from Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), the state’s largest electric company and a powerful player at the state Capitol.It is common for lobbyists to write pieces of legislation, but the story led FPL to create a website taking aim at the newspaper article. FPL is owned by NextEra Energy Inc., the world’s largest renewable energy developer.The supporters of the bill argue that net metering causes non-solar customers to subsidize the solar customers. But here’s the catch: There’s no evidence that such a subsidy exists or is burdening non-solar customers.E&E also notes that some Republicans, which hold the majority in both houses, oppose this bill. Florida state Senator Jeff Brandes (R), who isn’t running for re-election due to term limits, “criticized the measure because he said it lacked input from industry experts, data from the [Public Service Commission] that showed subsidies, and evidence from FPL that it needed to raise rates because of rooftop solar.” Brandes said:If the war in Ukraine has taught us nothing, it is that America needs to take control of its energy. It has to be energy independent.In the military, we have ready, aim, fire. This bill is fire, ready, aim.Senator Gary Farmer (D) said [via Florida Politics]:The fact that there is no study or vetted data to establish the veracity of these supposed costs is just simply unbelievable to me.The rooftop solar industry in Florida supports more than 40,000 jobs across the state, and experience in other states, according to the SEIA, indicates that the legislation would threaten upwards of 9,000 of those jobs.Ben Millar, CEO of Tampa-based solar sales, service, and installation company Sun Harvest Energy, said:The legislation would allow utility companies to reap profits from energy generated by homeowners who have made the investment into rooftop solar. It would allow utilities to charge excessive fees on over 100,000 solar customers around Florida, which effectively creates a new tax on energy.Ultimately, this bill would rid Floridians of their energy choices, create new fees and taxes, and destroy jobs.A recent poll shows that 84% of Florida voters support net metering. However, if this bill is signed by DeSantis, the changes will negate much of the cost savings associated with customers’ investments in solar while making it difficult for homeowners and businesses to afford a transition to solar. This will lead to less energy freedom and higher utility bills in Florida.The SEIA points out that other states have attempted similar net metering policy changes, resulting in a bad deal for their residents. After Nevada gutted its net metering program, it experienced a significant loss of jobs and businesses. The SEIA reports that two weeks after Nevada enacted its legislation, for example, a major rooftop solar company announced it would cease operations in the state and eliminate 550 jobs. The following year, the Nevada legislature voted to reinstate net metering due to the significant loss in jobs and economic impact, along with immense public outcry.Will Giese, southeast regional director for the SEIA, said in a statement on its website:This bill is a nightmare for anyone who believes in energy freedom and the rights of people to choose the energy that works for them and their families. Net metering has helped over 100,000 Florida homeowners make that choice, and utilities are now banking on the state government to strip those rights away and pad their monopoly hold on electricity.Strengthening our energy independence at the national, local, and individual level is more important now than ever before. In the last few years, Florida has seen its solar industry grow to employ 11,000 people and generate over $10 billion of economic activity. States that enact bad legislation like this will see much of that business growth disappear, and we’re urging Governor DeSantis to veto the bill and maintain Florida’s place as a national energy leader. This is a simple choice between helping monopolies or helping the people.DeSantis will sign this bill into law. For those of you who’ve ever looked at my bio, I was, until last month, a resident of St. Petersburg, Florida. (We’re moving to Vermont, where solar incentives are alive and well.) And this horrible bill is a real tragedy for a state that has an abundance of sunshine, and is guaranteed to suffer from sea-level rise due to climate change. This bill is not only masochistic, it’s suicidal. But that’s what DeSantis does: He likes to roll things back. He calls it “freedom,” and then puts in restrictions, like cutting net metering, or an array of other things. (But what he really means is, “freedom” for what he and his supporters believe.) Just search “DeSantis ban” and watch your page populate with dozens of stories. It’s pretty stupid to alienate 84% of your state’s population with a bill that has no study to back up its assertions.Read more: Florida legislators want to kill solar net metering, and hundreds rallied in protestPhoto: SunPower",solar
2022/04/22,"All 10 offshore wind turbines have now been installed by Dutch maritime company Van Oord off Italy’s Puglia coast – the heel of Italy’s boot. It’s Italy’s first offshore wind farm, and the first in the Mediterranean Sea.April 22 update: Italy’s first offshore wind farm is now officially online. The Taranto offshore wind farm’s developer, Renexia, and its partners yesterday held a ceremony in the Port of Taranto to celebrate its commissioning and inauguration. The first wind turbine was installed in February.March 16: The Taranto offshore wind farm is near Taranto harbor, and it’s the first offshore wind farm in the Mediterranean Sea. It will have a capacity of 30 megawatts (MW) and estimated output of 58,000 MWh per year. It will be capable of powering 21,000 homes and is scheduled to come online this year.The Taranto offshore wind farm will feature MySE3.0-135 wind turbines, which are made and delivered by China’s MingYang Smart Energy.Italian offshore wind development company Renexia SpA is its owner and developer, and Van Oord’s MPI Offshore is running its construction.Taranto features bottom-fixed turbines, but going forward, offshore developers are looking to floating offshore wind farms for the Mediterranean because it’s very deep. Italy’s national wind energy association Anev has set a target of 5 GW of floating offshore wind for the country by 2040.And as AFP points out today, “France recently held the world’s first auction for a commercial-sized floating offshore wind farm, and other Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Spain are also planning auctions for large-scale projects, according to the WindEurope association.”Read more: A Swedish company wants to kick-start Italy’s floating offshore wind market with its dual tilted turbinesPhoto: MingYang Smart EnergyUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/04/21,"The Biden administration set a goal of permitting 25 gigawatts (GW) of solar, onshore wind, and geothermal energy on public lands by 2025. It’s well on its way to exceeding that goal.In January 2022, the White House reported that since President Joe Biden took office, his administration had approved 18 onshore projects totaling 4.175 GW (including eight located on public lands and 10 with interconnection lines on public lands) and initiated processing of another 54 priority projects with the potential to add at least 27.5 GW of clean energy. In a report released yesterday that was submitted to Congress, the US Department of the Interior forecasts that it’s now on track to approve 48 wind, solar, and geothermal energy projects with the capacity to produce around 31.827 GW of electricity by the end of the fiscal 2025 budget cycle. Solar leads with 29.6 GW of that electricity. (That’s all on page nine of the report.)That’s enough electricity to power around 9.5 million households. E&E News notes:The report estimates that the Bureau of Land Management will approve projects capable of producing 11,409 MW of electricity by the end of 2023. That amount alone would nearly double the 12,000 MW [12 GW] of electricity from the 35 solar, 36 wind, and 48 geothermal power projects that have already been approved on federal lands to date.Principal deputy assistant secretary of land and minerals management Laura Daniel-Davis said in a statement:Our nation’s leaders have asked for timely action on renewables, and the Biden-Harris administration is delivering.The Bureau of Land Management’s energy experts understand the demand and the need to ensure environmentally sound development of renewable energy on these lands. We’re on the path to build upon the extraordinary work already being done.The report identified some challenges: This is a very big deal. Why is it not making more headlines? It’s relevant to everyone in the United States, and even the world, seeing as how the United States is one of the biggest emitters internationally.Assuming this progress is not somehow undermined by another administration in 2024, the Biden administration is going to not only deliver, but exceed its clean energy goal of 25 GW by 2025. Climate change is the biggest challenge humanity is facing right now, so this is great news. It appears as though the Biden administration needs to do more to publicize its progress on clean energy. The news seems to have been buried, and it’s crucial that people know about this progress.Read more: Biden administration, DOE announce $3 billion in new funding to support US EV battery manufacturing and recyclingPhoto: BLMUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/04/21,"A 10.5 gigawatt (GW) solar and wind farm will be built in Morocco’s Guelmim-Oued Noun region, and it will supply the UK with clean energy via subsea cables. The twin 1.8 GW high voltage direct current (HVDC) subsea cables will be the world’s longest.April 21, 2022, update: Subsea cable manufacturer XLCC is going to build a factory in Hunterston, Scotland, and its first output will be for the Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project. It will supply four 2,361-mile-long (3,800 km) subsea cables, with the first phase between 2025-2027 connecting wind and solar power generated in Morocco to Alverdiscott, North Devon.This initiative is going to nearly double the world’s current production of HVDC cable manufacturing.The world’s longest undersea cables will need 90,000 metric tons of steel, and XLCC signed the UK Steel Charter at Parliament this week, in which it committed to using British steel.UK-based renewables company Xlinks is the project’s developer. The Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project, as it’s known, will cover an area of around 579 square miles (1,500 square kilometers) in Morocco and will be connected exclusively to the UK via 2,361 miles (3,800 km) of HVDC subsea cables. They’ll follow the shallow water route from Morocco to the UK, past Spain, Portugal, and France.The project will cost $21.9 billion. Xlinks will construct 7 GW of solar and 3.5 GW of wind, along with onsite 20GWh/5GW battery storage, in Morocco. The transmission cable will consist of four cables. The first cable will be active in early 2027, and the other three are slated to launch in 2029. An agreement has been reached with the National Grid for two 1.8GW connections at Alverdiscott in Devon.Xlinks says that the Morocco-UK Power Project will be capable of powering a whopping 7 million UK homes by 2030. Once complete, the project will be capable of supplying 8% of Britain’s electricity needs.Why go all the way to North Africa for power in the UK? In a word, resilience. Xlinks explains:Morocco benefits from ideal solar and wind resources, required to develop renewable projects that could guarantee suitable power production throughout the year. It has the third highest Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) in North Africa, which is 20% greater than Spain’s GHI and over twice that of the UK. Furthermore, the shortest winter day still offers more than 10 hours of sunlight. This helps in providing production profiles that address the needs of the UK power market, especially during periods of low offshore wind production.Remote generation and interconnection between distant geographic regions with inversely correlated weather systems will be more effective at addressing imbalances of supply and demand over longer time periods.Xlinks notes that solar panels generate about three times more power in Morocco than they would in the UK. Further, solar panels in Morocco will generate as much as five times more power from January to March than those in the UK.The project is expected to create nearly 10,000 jobs in Morocco, and 2,000 of those positions will be permanent.Read more: Morocco gets Africa’s first fully solar villagePhoto: “Fort Bou-Jerif – Aroussi, Guelmim-Oued Noun, Marruecos” by Antonio Marín Segovia is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/04/18,"Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island is the United States’ first offshore wind farm. The 30-megawatt, five-turbine offshore wind farm began commercial operations in December 2016 and generates enough energy to power 17,000 homes. And it turns out, it’s perfectly safe, and sometimes even beneficial, for fish.A seven-year-long study, the first of its kind in the United States, titled, “Demersal fish and invertebrate catches relative to construction and operation of North America’s first offshore wind farm,” was published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science on March 29. The study was paid for by the wind farm developers because Rhode Island coastal regulators mandated it.The ICES Journal of Marine Science is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering oceanography and marine biology. It’s published by Oxford University Press for the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, of which it is the official journal.Researchers examined data collected between 2012 and 2019 from monthly trips to the offshore wind farm in a commercial trawler that navigated easily between the turbines. Block Island’s wind turbines are a half nautical mile apart, and the US East Coast projects in the pipeline will be a full nautical mile apart. Nearly 664,000 fish representing 61 species were collected during the study.The researchers found that there was no significant negative effect on fish that live near the bottom of the sea – demersal fish – and invertebrate populations during Block Island’s construction and operation. In fact, the researchers found that the turbines had positive effects. The Boston Globe explains:The only meaningful effect they found by the wind turbines was positive: a lot more black sea bass were congregating around the Block Island wind farm, probably because they like to hang out near physical structures like wind turbine foundations. Scientists also found more Atlantic cod there, but not often enough to draw any firm conclusions.The study not only looked at what fish were caught, but also what sort of condition they were in and what was in their stomachs. Some were eating more mussels, which indicated they were feeding off of mussels growing on the turbines themselves.The study’s abstract notes:Results from this first North American OSW [offshore wind] fisheries monitoring study provide valuable information for future OSW development on the northeastern US coastline.This study, which was designed by scientists and commercial fishermen at INSPIRE International, has the potential to help remove obstacles for the young offshore wind industry in the United States. In the summer of 2021, for example, Maine state legislators permanently banned offshore wind in state waters, citing the protection of the fishing and lobstering industries. Some of those legislators work in the fishing and lobstering industries.Perhaps Maine might reconsider its offshore wind ban in state waters as the result of this study. We now know that fish aren’t negatively impacted by offshore wind turbines. However, they do suffer from global warming as a result of burning and drilling for fossil fuels. And if we don’t stop burning and offshore drilling for fossil fuels, then that will kill the fish population – and the fishing industry.Read more: Maine governor permanently bans offshore wind in state waters",solar

More updates to come as we continue the installation.#FutureofEnergy pic.twitter.com/0RutJpe7hTLuxembourg-based maritime infrastructure company Jan De Nul is installing the wind farm’s turbines in the northern part of the Bay of Biscay, off France’s western coast. Its vessel, the Vole au Vent, will transport and install 80 GE Haliade 150-6MW wind turbines.By the end of March, 60 monopile foundations and 22 inter-array cables were installed.Offshore Engineer explains how the installation will work:In sets of four, the turbines will be loaded on board of the Vole au Vent and transported 12 km offshore, where the 1,500-tonnes main crane of the vessel will mount them on top of monopile foundations. The installation of one turbine takes approximately 24 hours, depending on the weather conditions, so each installation trip will take about five days. The very last turbine is scheduled to be mounted in autumn 2022, Jan De Nul said Thursday.The 480-MW wind farm will be sited between 12 and 20 km (7 and 12.4 miles) off the coast of the Guérande peninsula. It’s owned and being developed by Eolien Maritime France (EMF), a consortium of EDF Renouvelables, Enbridge, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.It took an entire decade – the French government approved St. Nazaire in 2012 – to launch the country’s first offshore wind project as a result of local opposition and legal challenges.

2022/04/13,"First Solar, the largest US-owned solar panel manufacturer, today announced that it’s going to provide 260 megawatts (MW)DC of Ohio-made solar modules to Nevada Gold Mines, the single largest gold-producing complex in the world. Nevada Gold Mines is operated by Barrick Gold Corporation and is a joint venture between Barrick (61.5%) and Newmont (38.5%) that combined their significant assets across Nevada in 2019.The company will invest in building a 200 MW solar farm, which will be deployed in the second quarter of 2023, as part of a broader effort to reduce its emissions. The completed solar farm will be able to power 17% of the gold-producing operation.Barrick has committed to a 30% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030, with the goal of net-zero operations by 2050. Nevada Gold Mines will support Barrick’s targets and has set an intermediate goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2025, compared to its 2018 baseline.Nevada Gold Mines says it expects to achieve its goals with the solar farm and the conversion of its “coal-fired power plant to cleaner burning natural gas.” (Editor’s note: Natural gas is never clean. Nevada Gold Mines, take note, and figure out another way.)In June 2021, Wood Mackenzie reported on gold mining emissions reduction progress:For the purpose of our analysis, we looked at 339 large-scale gold mines, or 60% of total gold supply.[G]old miners look broadly on track to align with the 2C climate target – which limits the rise in global temperatures since pre-industrial times to 2C by the end of this century.

All six projects are scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of 2022.Half of the six projects use solar trackers, and the other half use fixed-tilt racking. All six solar farms feature bifacial modules.Electrek explained bifacial solar on April 8:Bifacial, or double-sided, solar panels collect light on both sides. They can produce one-third more energy than monofacial solar panels. They are slim and need special racking in order to gain maximum exposure to the sun. The side of the panels not aimed toward the sun – the backsheet – can use light reflected off the ground or another material, and the lighter the surface – like sand – the more effective it is for the solar panel. Due to cost and the fact that they need to be mounted on the ground, bifacial panels are best for commercial or utility-scale use.The six solar farms in this portfolio will generate enough clean energy to power 8,700 homes per year.Onondaga County, where three of the farms are sited, will get a solar capacity boost of nearly 50%, with 15 MW in total, enough for 2,200 more homes annually. And that’s just the start: Onandaga has at least 29 large solar projects on the drawing board, totaling 190 megawatts.They will also support New York State in achieving its goal to have 70% of the state’s energy produced from renewables by 2030.

2022/04/11,"Eco Wave Power, which produces clean electricity from ocean and sea waves, today announced that it has entered an official agreement with Port Adriano, Spain, to build Spain’s first wave-energy power plant.Port Adriano, which is on the south coast of the island of Mallorca, will assign a potentially suitable location for Eco Wave Power’s wave-energy power plant for a period of 20 years. Eco Wave Power, a Swedish company founded in Israel, will secure all the licenses; construct and commission the power plants; and then sell the generated electricity in accordance with an approved production quota to be determined for the site. The 2 megawatt (MW) power plant will be constructed and commissioned in two stages and will be capable of powering around 400 households at full capacity.Antonio Zaforteza, CEO of OCIBAR, the company that owns the Port of Adriano, said: We believe that Eco Wave Power is a perfect fit to the innovation and sustainability vision of Port Adriano, creating a new way of generating renewable energy, that will help our port and our country to meet its ambitious goals to address the climate crisis. We are looking forward to welcoming this innovative project.Eco Wave Power’s floaters – the blue dinghy-like things in the water in the photo above – convert the rising and falling motion of the waves into a clean energy generation process. The movement of the floaters compresses and decompresses the connected hydraulic pistons that transmit biodegradable hydraulic fluid into accumulators on land, where pressure builds. The pressure rotates a hydraulic motor, which rotates the generator, and then electricity is transferred into the grid via an inverter. After decompression, the fluid flows back into the hydraulic fluid tank, where it’s then reused by the pistons, creating a closed circular system.The system starts electricity production from wave heights of just 0.5 meters (1.64 feet). If the waves are too high for the system to handle, due to a storm, for example, the floaters automatically rise above the water level and stay in an upward position until the storm passes. Once the bad weather passes, the floaters return to operation mode.The whole wave-energy power plant is controlled and monitored by a smart automation system.The company already has projects up and running in Israel and Gibraltar, and additional projects are planned or under way already in Portugal and California.What do you think about this method of clean power generation?

2022/04/11,"Danish wind giant Ørsted and Danish offshore wind service and support company ESVAGT announced on Friday that they will invest in the world’s first service operation vessel (SOV) that can operate on green fuels.Ørsted reports that batteries and dual fuel engines capable of sailing on renewable e-methanol produced from wind energy and biogenic carbon will power the SOV. The company says that will lead to a yearly CO2 emissions reduction of around 4,500 metric tons.What’s the difference between biogenic carbon and fossil-fuel emissions? IEA Bioenergy explains:Burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been locked up in the ground for millions of years, while burning biomass emits carbon that is part of the biogenic carbon cycle.In other words, fossil fuel use increases the total amount of carbon in the biosphere-atmosphere system while bioenergy systems operates within this system; biomass combustion simply returns to the atmosphere the carbon that was absorbed as the plants grew.The ship will have the following specs:Offshore wind service technicians are usually at sea for weeks at a time. The SOV will host an onboard workshop and much of the equipment and spare parts needed for them to service offshore wind farms.The SOV will be equipped with a helipad for fast access and transfers from shore. It will provide safe transfer of technicians at the wind farm via a motion-compensated gangway and transfer boats as well as a crane to lift heavy spare parts.

The solar farm is the first phase of the project.The 250-megawatt solar farm is being developed by Kansas City, Missouri-based solar and storage project development company Savion Energy. (It’s a Shell portfolio company.) SEVA WV is the principal developer of the SunPark project, and it will be led by SEVA WV’s Devanna Corley, who said [via WV News]:I am inspired by the blank canvas presented in Boone and Lincoln counties. There is a real opportunity to bring new business, grow population, develop tourism, and teach our children about the importance of renewable energy.Like Senator [Joe] Manchin [D-WV], SEVA supports a diversity of energy policies. This includes renewables such as solar and wind, as well as coal and natural gas, which West Virginia markets on a global scale.SunPark is due to be completed no later than 2024. The solar farm is an approximately $320 million investment and is expected to create between 250-300 construction jobs that will pay an average wage of $30 an hour.In February 2020, Electrek reported that West Virginia lawmakers unanimously passed a bill to increase solar in the state overall.April 8 correction: SEVA-WV is the principal developer of the Sun Park development project. Savion is the solar developer that has been selected to develop the solar portion of the project.Read more: West Virginia may install solar on former coal sitesI was feeling pretty happy about this news, until I read Corley’s quote. Corley, who is director of business development for development group The Thrasher Group, said SEVA WV, like Manchin, also supports a “diversity of energy policies,” including coal and natural gas.We know why Manchin backs fossil fuels – they’re a cash cow for him. But why does Corley back fossil fuels? Does she truly believe that energy diversity is the answer, or is she playing politics?Read more: The real reason Joe Manchin is sabotaging the US clean energy planWest Virginia governor Jim Justice said that “Corley and her team have been relentless in their efforts to make this project a reality.” Why would SEVA WV even need to be “relentless” about the SunPark project? The coal industry is on the verge of becoming obsolete. That’s why this solar farm is being built on the site of a big shuttered coal mine that subjects its surrounding low-income populations to air and water pollution. Shouldn’t state legislators be rushing to make it as easy as possible for solar initiatives like this to move forward?This is a great first for West Virginia, but as usual, its legislators continue to cling to fossil fuels. Heck, even the person who spearheaded this big solar farm says she still supports coal and natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that West Virginia actually dropped from 45th in the country in 2021, to 48th in national rankings of states for solar.

On the other hand, Russia’s invasion shows how important it is to phase out fossil fuels and promote the expansion of renewables.Germany aims to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.As for Germany’s dependence on Russian natural gas, Spiegel today describes the German government’s scramble to prepare for a possible natural gas cut-off from Russia in an article titled, “German Industry Prepares for Worst-Case Scenario”:Around 25% of the energy needs of industry in the country are supplied by natural gas. And around 55% of the country’s natural gas imports come from Russia.…Behind the scenes, people are now working under intense pressure to think and plan the unthinkable. Three working groups, each staffed by a dozen experts from key companies and industry associations are developing criteria that could be used to limit or cut off gas supplies to various factories. Legal, technical and financial issues have been placed on the table, and thousands of companies, countless products and millions of jobs are at stake. The issue is so complicated that it will take weeks to come up with a reasonably manageable set of criteria, fears one source involved in the talks. The source describes a “feverish tension” in the talks.The package introduced today, which was accelerated due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Germany’s precarious dependence on Russian oil, is called the Renewable Energy Sources Act, and it will come into effect on July 1. It contains a clause that identifies clean energy as in the interest of public security.It also sets a goal for offshore wind to reach at least 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and at least 70 GW by 2045. Its current total offshore wind capacity is 7.7 GW, so that’s a huge increase. Offshore wind made up 4.3% of Germany’s power mix in 2021. Onshore wind made up 15.8%, and solar 8.8%.Europe’s biggest economy is also expected to make further legislative changes this year to improve energy efficiency in buildings and reduce the transport sector’s emissions, Reuters reports.Read more: Portugal brings forward 80% clean energy target to 2026 from 2030",solar
2022/04/05,"Portugal’s new Socialist Party-majority government has moved its target of reaching 80% clean energy in electricity production forward to 2026, four years earlier than previously planned.Members of Portugal’s center-left Socialist Party captured 120 seats in the 230-seat parliament in a landslide election in January. The new government was sworn into office last Wednesday and released its new clean energy plan last Friday. The new government says that its plans should result in more than €25 billion of both private and public investment in the next 10 years.Portugal is currently one of Europe’s clean energy leaders, as it currently gets 60% of its electricity from renewables.Cabinet Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva told a news conference [via Reuters]:Portugal has already taken very significant measures in the energy transition, but the evolution and duration of the war in Ukraine must necessarily imply new measures.Portugal mainly imports liquefied natural gas from the US and Nigeria and does not rely on Russian natural gas pipelines. It stopped importing Russian crude in 2020.The country has 7.3 GW of hydroelectric capacity and 5.6 GW of onshore wind farms, which together represent 83% of its total installed capacity.Further, according to PV Tech:According to figures from trade association SolarPower Europe, Portugal had around 1.5GW of deployed solar as of 2021, a figure the country will aim to increase to at least 9 GW by 2030.Environmental impact assessments for projects with a capacity of under 50 MW will no longer be required, according to the country’s secretary of state for energy, João Galamba.In November 2021, Portugal closed its last remaining coal plant.Read more: Portugal closes its last remaining coal plantPhoto: Parque eólico, Serra da Lousã, Portugal/CorreiaPM/WikimediaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/04/04,"In the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released today, there’s good news and bad news. We’re spotlighting the good news: EVs and clean energy can help us limit climate change.The bad news is that we are on the brink of missing the opportunity to avoid catastrophic climate change. The report states that global emissions must peak by 2025 for the chance to limit temperature increases to the 1.5C goal set out in the Paris Agreement. Global emissions must then fall by 43% by 2030, as well as a reduction in methane emissions of around 33%, from 2019 levels.But the good news is that we already have the technology and financial ability globally to slash emissions by 2030.The IPCC Working Group III Sixth Assessment Report, which was approved by 195 member governments of the IPCC, is, at 3,675 pages, a huge and comprehensive report. Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, said:This report is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction. It shows that climate change is a grave and mounting threat to our well-being and a healthy planet. Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.We at Electrek, and no doubt you, if you read about climate change, EVs, and clean energy in general, already know that. But this particular report isn’t just doom and gloom. It “combines strategies to adapt to climate change with actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to support sustainable development for everyone.” And that’s what we’re highlighting today.It asserts that building wind and solar is the most impactful and cheapest way to keep temperatures to 1.5C. BusinessGreen points out:Since 2010, there have been sustained decreases of up to 85% in the costs of solar and wind energy, as well as sharp falls in the cost of batteries for storage and electric vehicles (EVs), while an increasing range of policies has helped tackle deforestation, boost energy efficiency, and accelerate the rollout of renewable energy sources, the report points out.Key IPCC report takeaways that environmental nonprofit think tank Ember highlighted include:Further, when it comes to coal, it’s a big fat “ditch it now.”In global modeled pathways that limit warming to 2C, “in 2050 almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources, combined with increased electrification of energy demand.” (2C isn’t good enough, so we will need to reach 100% renewables earlier.) Seeing how 10% of the world’s electricity is currently from wind and solar (see the story below), it’s clear that wind and solar can and must be the backbone of a future electrified world.Read more: In a world first, solar and wind generated 10% of power for 50 countries in 2021UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

We’ve long known that coal power must collapse this decade, but the latest IPCC report makes it crystal clear. A massive global effort to ramp up clean electricity this decade puts the power sector on track for 1.5 degrees. UN Environment Programme executive director Inger Andersen said in an emailed statement:The first two IPCC reports told us that climate change is here, now, and causing huge disruption to the natural world and human well-being. This report tells us that we are still not doing enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions, confirming the findings of UNEP’s 2021 Emissions Gap Report.…The IPCC tells us that we have the knowledge and technology to get it done. Through a rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewables and alternative fuels. Through moving from deforestation to restoration. Through backing nature in our landscapes, oceans, and cities. Through transforming our cities into green and clean spaces. And through behavior change to address the demand side of the equation. Manish Bapna, president and CEO of Natural Resources Defense Council, made the following statement: The good news is that we have the climate solutions needed, and they work. While the fossil industry tries to exploit the crisis in Ukraine and lock us in to decades more dependency, this report affirms tremendous gains, here at home and abroad, in clean energy – in wind and solar power and battery storage – and foresees little future for fossil fuels. But we simply have to move much faster.This landmark report, as I wrote above, reinforces what we at Electrek already know, and this is why we focus on clean energy and electric vehicles. None of the IPCC’s findings were a surprise to us.But it’s good to have an impactful global report reiterate this message. To repeat ourselves, the world must step up right now and implement renewables as quickly as possible, as well as ditch fossil fuels. ",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/03/31,"President Joe Biden will today authorize the use of Title III of the Korean War-era Defense Production Act (DPA) to rapidly step up US production of minerals for electric vehicle and storage batteries.As the FEMA website explains:The Defense Production Act [of 1950] is the primary source of presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of materials and services from the US industrial base needed to promote the national defense. FEMA also explains Title III, “Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply”:Title III of the DPA provides various financial measures, such as loans, loan guarantees, purchases, and purchase commitments, to improve, expand, and maintain domestic production capabilities needed to support national defense and homeland security procurement requirements.In other words, companies are required to prioritize federal contracts for goods and materials. Civil transportation and energy are included under the “national defense” umbrella.According to a White House fact sheet released today:The President will issue a directive, authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act to secure American production of critical materials to bolster our clean energy economy by reducing our reliance on China and other countries for the minerals and materials that will power our clean energy future.  Specifically, the DPA will be authorized to support the production and processing of minerals and materials used for large capacity batteries–such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese—and the Department of Defense will implement this authority using strong environmental, labor, community, and tribal consultation standards. The Biden administration has invoked the act in response to escalating energy prices, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its goal of achieving a clean power grid by 2035.In July 2021, Electrek wrote:The US relies entirely on imports for 17 mineral commodities, 14 of which are identified as critical minerals, according to the US Geological Survey.Resources in the US are small compared with countries such as Canada… and the US lacks the smelters to refine the materials from ore and existing mine tailings.The US has cobalt assets in Missouri, Minnesota, and Idaho, but production trails other sources because the US permitting process takes years.Read more: The US has to mine more minerals to meet EV, clean energy demandsHere’s the part we’re not excited about (because we are an EV and clean energy website, after all):The President will announce the largest release of oil reserves in history, putting 1 million additional barrels on the market per day on average – every day – for the next six months.  We at Electrek know that everyone is paying through the nose for gas and heating right now. We also get the need for US energy independence; many countries are feeling that too in the face of Russian aggression. Vladimir Putin is threatening to cut gas supply to “unfriendly countries” from tomorrow if they don’t pay in rubles.But as my colleague Jameson Dow noted in a team discussion, “We are sitting here in the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced, and everyone thinks the solution is to burn more oil. There’s always some short-term thing that means we can’t act on the problem we needed to act on a half-century ago.”The White House fact sheet states that the goal is to speed the transition to clean energy made in the US. (It also mentions it’s “seeking additional opportunities to ramp up the deployment of heat pumps” – yes, please, and hurry.) It’s also right to push for energy efficiency and electrification upgrades, and it’s updating old mining laws to promote responsible mining under strong social, environmental, and labor standards. As Bobby McEnaney, senior lands analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, just stated in an email statement sent to Electrek:What’s important now is ensuring that supplies of the minerals needed to manufacture those batteries be secured in ways that are reliable, durable, and sustainable.Rather than just digging up or importing more, we should start with improved recovery and waste reduction throughout supply chains. We must reclaim and recycle these materials in a way that ensures they stay in circulation and honors our commitment to protect the environment, public health and vulnerable communities.Read more: Here’s what the future of battery recycling is going to look like for EV ownersThe transition to clean energy can’t happen in a day, but it has to be prioritized. So if the Biden administration is serious about fighting climate change, both it and manufacturers – electric car, battery, solar, wind, any and all clean energy component manufacturers – need to work overtime so that this major ramp-up of releasing oil is kept as short as possible, and the US can then focus on transitioning to clean energy and transport.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/03/30,"Wind and solar, the fastest-growing sources of electricity, reached a record 10% of global electricity in 50 countries in 2021, according to a report released today by independent energy think tank Ember. Overall, clean sources generated 38% of the world’s electricity in 2021, beating coal, at 36%. If the 10-year average compound growth rate of 20% can be maintained to 2030, solar and wind could grow enough to limit global warming to 1.5C, reports Ember’s third annual “Global Electricity Review.” The report covers electricity generation for 209 countries from 2000 to 2020, with the latest data for 2021 for 75 countries representing 93% of global power demand.Globally, the share of wind and solar has doubled since 2015 when the Paris Agreement was signed.Fifty countries generated more than one-tenth of their electricity from wind and solar in 2021, including all five of the world’s largest economies – the US, China, Japan, Germany, and the UK. Seven new countries passed the landmark for the first time in 2021: China, Japan, Mongolia, Vietnam, Argentina, Hungary, and El Salvador. The Netherlands, Australia, and Vietnam have adopted wind and solar the fastest, with around one-tenth of electricity demand switching from fossil fuels to wind and solar in the last two years. Ten countries generated more than 25% of their electricity from wind and solar in 2021, led by Denmark, Luxembourg, and Uruguay at 52%, 43%, and 47%, respectively.Ember’s global lead Dave Jones said:We’re getting closer to that break-even where wind and solar can cover new electricity demand, but we are still not quite there. If we maintain those growth rates we see, we will be there shortly.However, electricity demand has rebounded to the largest-ever annual increase in 2021 (+1,414 TWh), the equivalent of adding a new India to the world’s electricity demand. And that’s driven up use of fossil fuels, particularly coal. In 2021, coal power saw the fastest growth since at least 1985 (+9%), rising to a new all-time high of 10,042 TWh. The record rise in coal was not matched by global gas generation, which increased by only 1% in 2021. The increase in fossil fuels pushed global power sector emissions to an all-time high, beating the previous record in 2018 by 3%. It’s also noteworthy that despite net zero by 2050 promises, no oil major has emissions reduction targets for 2030 in line with the Paris Agreement, concludes ClimateAction100+, the world’s largest alliance of investors, in their Net Zero Company Benchmark released today.This hopeful report demonstrates that we are at an inflection point with both renewables and fossil fuels. Countries must surge ahead with renewables, thus shedding the need for fossil fuels, and they need to be embraced on a massive scale. Renewable leader Denmark has demonstrated that renewables can be successfully integrated into a grid.But as the world adapts to living with COVID-19, power demand has surged, and with it, the use of coal. Ultimately, coal-fired power must be phased out in advanced economies by 2030, and globally by 2040.There can also be no new oil and gas exploration and production if we are going to limit global warming to less than 1.5C.Read more: Solar and battery storage make up 60% of planned new US electric generation capacityUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2022/03/28,"As UK prime minister Boris Johnson is due to unveil his energy plan this week, a British cabinet minister made a suggestion yesterday on a news program that he thinks would win the support of communities who live near onshore wind farms. Could it work?Onshore wind farms are expected to play a key role in Johnson’s energy plan. The wind farms would result in cheaper electricity for households, but as is usually the case with all new renewables, there is opposition from people near intended sites who claim the clean energy farms would be unsightly. They’re often known as NIMBYs, or “not in my backyard.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi supports more onshore wind farms but says they need the backing of local people. Speaking yesterday on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday program, Zahawi said:I would say that if we are going to make sure that we carry the will of local people, whether it’s onshore wind or nuclear, we have to learn from how it’s done well in other countries.The way you do that is to make sure the local community has a real say. But also we’ve seen great examples of other people where if they build a nuclear power station, within a certain radius of that power station they get free power. So it’s right to look at innovation to make sure we wean ourselves off hydrocarbons, we have to do that, we have to do that well, part of that is making sure we look after the will of the local people.It’s a simple idea: Gain the support of households that are located near proposed renewable sites with free electricity.If I found out that a wind farm was going to be built near my house, and that I was going to get free electricity as a result, I’d be ecstatic. (Disclosure: I’d be happy to live near a wind farm, even if I wasn’t going to get free electricity. Nuclear? Not so much.)At a time when energy costs are high, not only in the UK but just about everywhere, surely providing a carrot in the form of a financial incentive would quickly escalate support for renewables and quash any opposition over “ruining the view.” Farmers have happily signed up to lease out their land to solar and wind farms because it makes them money. And are people who live near fossil fuel plants and breathing in harmful particulate matter getting free electricity? I doubt it. Do you think Zahawi’s idea is a good one?

2022/03/25,"The US Department of the Interior today announced that it has now completed its environmental review and will hold its first offshore wind energy lease sale off the Carolinas on May 11.The lease areas include 110,091 acres in the Carolina Long Bay area off North Carolina and South Carolina. Built wind farms there could result in at least 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said. The sale notice includes a 20% credit to bidders to encourage direct investment in domestic US supply chain development or workforce training programs – a first for the US government.Offshore wind developers will be able to bid on on one or both of the lease areas, OCS-A 0545 and OCS-A 0546, as seen below:On February 25, BOEM completed an offshore wind energy auction for more than 488,000 acres in the New York Bight. The auction achieved $4.37 billion in bids. It was the first offshore wind lease sale in over three years, and the first under the Biden administration.The Business Network for Offshore Wind found that $2.2 billion was invested into US factories, ports, and suppliers in 2021, including nine new facilities that will manufacture and assemble the foundations, towers, blades, and cables of offshore wind farms. Liz Burdock, CEO and founder of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, said in an emailed statement:A resilient domestic supply chain is absolutely critical to the success of a US offshore wind industry. The Network is encouraged that BOEM will use the Carolina Long Bay leasing process to spur direct investment into the supply chain. With demand for US offshore wind leases at an all-time high, this credit could result in a hundred million dollars directly invested into domestic factories, local small businesses and suppliers, and workforce training. That means thousands of new jobs for construction workers, welders, electricians, ship captains and mates, engineers, and dozens of other professions.And Oceana senior field representative in North Carolina Randy Sturgill said in an email to Electrek:Today’s announcement is a victory for the people of North Carolina. My heartfelt thanks goes out to President Biden, Governor Cooper, Secretary Haaland, and all who were involved in this process. It’s critical that we transition away from fossil fuels that are causing climate change and toward clean energy like offshore wind, and our oceans can play an important role in that shift. Never has there been a more important moment to develop clean offshore wind than right now as we’re dealing with the climate crisis and a need for energy independence. Oceana is thrilled about the jobs and clean energy that Carolina Long Bay will provide North Carolinians for decades to come.The Biden administration has set a goal of installing at least 30 GW of offshore wind generation by 2030, and as Electrek reported on February 18, the US is currently on track to achieve that goal. The US has 30.7 GW of offshore wind projects in the pipeline, excluding today’s Carolinas announcement.Read more: US offshore wind auction for NY Bight is final, attracts a record $4.37B in bidsUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

It’s also the largest combined onshore wind project in GE’s history.North Central Energy Facilities’ three wind farms will provide 1,484 MW of clean energy and will save customers an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years.American Electric Power says that it is on track to reach an 80% reduction in emissions from 2000 levels by 2030. Nicholas K. Akins, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:AEP is investing $8.2 billion in regulated renewables and nearly $25 billion in the transmission and distribution systems through 2026 to modernize the grid, enhance reliability and resilience, and deliver more emissions-free energy to our customers. Including North Central, we plan to add approximately 16,000 MW of wind and solar in our regulated states by 2030 as part of our goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.In April 2021, Electrek reported that the Public Utilities Commission of Texas chose not to partake in the huge wind project.

2022/03/23,"As the global energy crunch deepens, thanks to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, new analysis from the nonprofit think tank Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) looks at how home insulation and heat pumps could reduce the UK’s need for Russian gas. The approach could certainly be applied in other countries, too.March 23 update: Following on from a scheme announced in October 2021, the UK government today announced that from April, it will provide £5,000 – which would cover between 75% and 50% of the cost – for households to install air source heat pumps.It also announced that it will provide £6,000 – which would cover between 50% and 30% of the cost of the units, respectively – for ground source heat pumps or water-source heat pumps. The cost of installation could be significantly higher, though.The government has set aside £450 million to install a maximum of 90,000 boilers in England and Wales. For perspective, there were an estimated 27.8 million households in the UK in 2020 (including Northern Ireland and Scotland). So, that’s 0.3% of households in the UK who will get subsidized heat pumps. Hmmm.VAT will also be scrapped on heat pumps for five years.More information about the Boiler Upgrade Scheme can be found here. On March 8, Electrek spotlighted an article by environmentalist and author, Bill McKibben, in which he called for the US to manufacture heat pumps and send them to Europe in order to help Europe curb its dependency on Russian fossil fuels.Similarly, ECIU also puts forward what it calls “common sense solutions at risk of being overlooked.” That means:The simplest solution is to use less gas – through better energy efficiency such as insulation, and through moving away from gas altogether for example by switching to heat pumps for homes and renewables for power generation.Homes in the UK are given energy performance ratings, with A being the best and G being the worst.In regards to insulation, the ECIU brings up its previous analysis, in which it envisaged “upgrading 1 million homes each year from the current average [energy performance certificate] rating of band D to the Government’s ambition of band C – this gives an average cut in gas demand of 20% per home.”It rightly points out that savings from insulation are permanent:The cumulative savings across the years soon become enormous – within 12 years, we’d have saved the equivalent of a year’s worth of current housing gas demand.And a study from the Committee on Climate Change points out that “63% of homes need spend no more than £1,000 on retrofitting energy efficiency measures.”The British government has set a goal to install 600,000 heat pumps per year by 2028, up from about 67,000 in 2021. ECIU writes:Heat pumps for heating and hot water remove end-use gas consumption entirely, and will be £260 a year cheaper to run than gas boilers under the April price cap. These cost savings are due to heat pumps’ high efficiency and their use of electricity that is increasingly generated by cheap North Sea offshore wind farms.Our model suggests that an average band C home would see an 80% cut in gas use at present – it’s not 100% because the current grid mix includes about 40% gas-powered generation, which is included by factoring in the efficiencies of gas power stations, gas boilers, and heat pumps.And if both insulation and heat pumps are combined in houses, “the UK could reduce gas demand by the equivalent of its imports from Russia by as early as 2027.”Bottom line, the ECIU points out that more gas isn’t going to cut energy bills. And Electrek agrees with its summary:More insulation and heat pumps will cut bills, but are now also a matter of national security. They can be installed to start cutting demand and imports right away and a concerted deployment campaign would see those savings build into a major contribution to ending our gas dependency, cutting Putin’s power and the vulnerability of our poorest households to the volatile gas market.This is a UK-based study for the UK, but this model should be adopted by any and all countries looking to get off Russian gas, or indeed, just gas. Heck, everyone should be getting off gas. (US, we’re looking at you.) Insulation isn’t sexy, but it sure is a no-brainer.The ECIU plan reduces energy costs for homeowners. It reduces emissions. It increases national security. It makes homes warmer. It’s a sustainable plan on many fronts.I am about to buy a house in Vermont and will be taking steps to install a heat pump in order to get off its existing propane heating system, as well as boost insulation where needed. I’ll report back on how that process rolls out.

2022/03/14,"Dust on solar panels reduces their output significantly, so they need to be kept clean. But what’s the best way to do that? Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they have a solution.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.One of the most common ways to clean dust off solar panels is to spray them with water. But that’s a huge waste of water, especially in desert settings, where there are a lot of solar farms. The MIT scientists note in their new study, which is published in Science Advances:At a global PV capacity above 500 GW, we estimate on the basis of reports that up to 10 billion gallons of water are being consumed every year worldwide for solar panel cleaning purposes, which can otherwise satisfy the annual water needs of up to two million people in developing and underdeveloped countries. Further, dry scrubbing damages solar panels.According to the researchers, static electricity can keep dust off solar panels, and is a much more sustainable solution. And that’s important, because as the researchers note, for example, “Dust accumulation of 5 mg/cm2 corresponds to almost 50% loss in power output.”The researchers achieved this by using “adsorbed moisture-assisted charge induction.” Adsorption is when moisture in the air attaches to a dust particle’s surface. Cosmos concisely explains how it works:The new technique works by passing a simple electrode – a conductor of electricity, which could be a simple metal bar – just above the surface of the solar panel. The electric field produced by the electrode causes the dust particles to become electrically charged as well.The same charge the dust holds is then applied to the solar panel’s surface through a conductive layer a few nanometers thick. The researchers have calculated the voltage range to apply to overcome the pull of gravity and adhesion forces, so the dust particles are pushed from the surface until they fall off.…In real-world scale and practice, the authors suggest that every solar panel could be fitted with railings on each side, with an electrode spanning across the panel. A small electric motor, perhaps even using electricity output from the panel itself, could then drive a belt system to move the electrode back and forth.This method works in environments where the ambient humidity is at 30% or greater, and most deserts can achieve humidity of around 30%.What do you think about this proposed solar panel cleaning method?

2022/03/08,"Environmentalist, author, and journalist Bill McKibben wrote about an innovative idea that would help curb Europe’s dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and the Biden administration might actually implement the plan.March 8 update: The Washington Post reports that as the Biden administration has announced a ban on imports of oil and natural gas from Russia, the heat pump idea is getting serious consideration in the White House:White House aides… have studied plans to dramatically scale up US production of energy-efficient heat pumps that they hoped could be used in Europe if European leaders decided to cut its imports of Russian oil, said three people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Biden officials have weighed whether these heat pumps could be produced through the Defense Production Act, an emergency national defense law, or through procurement programs at the Department of Defense, the people said. Some advocates close to the effort have compared the idea to the “Lend-Lease Act” program through which the US sent critical supplies to the Allied nations that had been invaded by Germany in World War II.Here’s what McKibben suggested on his Substack, titled “Heat Pumps for Peace and Freedom”:President [Joe] Biden should immediately invoke the Defense Production Act to get American manufacturers to start producing electric heat pumps in quantity, so we can ship them to Europe where they can be installed in time to dramatically lessen [Vladimir] Putin’s power. He points out that as of July 2021, the European electricity grid could handle 50 million heat pumps, according to the CEOs of major energy groups [via Euractiv]. McKibben says that the US couldn’t ship that many heat pumps over in just a year, but it could certainly ramp up and get going. (If you’re unfamiliar with how heat pumps work, manufacturer Carrier explains them here.)According to the FEMA website, the Defense Production Act “is the primary source of presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of materials and services from the US industrial base needed to promote the national defense.” The shoe definitely fits, in this case.Donald Trump used the Defense Production Act when the pandemic occurred to mandate production of ventilators, and Biden used it to mandate production of masks.McKibben goes on to explain that US manufacturers could ramp up production quickly with guaranteed federal contracts, and heat pumps could be provided at or below cost to Europeans. He goes on to write:If America did this, it would jump start our own capacity — which means, as one expert put it, “what you do in Montenegro this year helps in Minnesota two years out,” as we try to wean American[s] from expensive and dirty fossil fuels. I’m writing this in a house warmed (during a snow squall this afternoon) by a heat pump connected to the solar panels in the yard and the battery in the basement. It’s good stuff.McKibben lives in Vermont (and our snow squall here yesterday was impressive).And it would of course benefit European countries, too, since that’s the driver of his suggestion. For example, according to a government draft paper obtained by Reuters today, “Germany aims to fulfill all of its electricity needs with supplies from renewable sources by 2035,” which would make it less dependent on imported Russian fossil fuel energy.Reuters writes:According to the paper, the corresponding amendment to the country’s Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) is ready and the share of wind or solar power should reach 80% by 2030.By then, Germany’s onshore wind energy capacity should double to up to 110 gigawatts (GW), offshore wind energy should reach 30 GW – arithmetically the capacity of 10 nuclear plants – and solar energy would more than triple to 200 GW, the paper showed.German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: Renewable energies free us from dependencies. They are therefore freedom energies.This post is, of course, an oversimplified summary of the current geopolitical situation between Europe and Russia (and the potential of heat pumps), but overall, we think McKibben is onto something good. (You can read Bill McKibben’s entire article here.)The US would benefit from domestic manufacturing of heat pumps, as that would create jobs, and also provide heat pumps that could also be used domestically once Europe gets what they need in the current crisis. Those heat pumps would set up European countries for more energy self-sufficiency, and thus stability. And it would in turn help weaken Russia’s power over Europe that it wields with its oil and gas exports. It’s economic warfare, and it beats the hell out of actual warfare. It’s also a much-needed battle against climate change.What do you think?

This was due to tax credits and falling technology costs, especially for batteries, according to the EIA.Utility-scale solar accounts for 41 GW (48%) of planned capacity in the United States during the next two years. More utility-scale solar capacity was added (24 GW) to the US power grid than natural gas (12 GW) between 2020 and 2021, and the EIA expects that trend to continue over the next two years.In 2022, power plant developers and operators expect to add 22 GW of solar capacity to the grid, which is a lot more than the 13 GW added in 2021. The increase is due to the falling costs of solar and the 2020 extension of the solar investment tax credit: 26% in 2021 and 2022, 22% in 2023, and 10% in 2024 and after.In the next two years, power plant developers and operators expect to add 10 GW of battery storage capacity. More than 60% of this capacity will be paired with solar. In 2021, 3.1 GW of battery storage capacity was added in the United States, a 200% increase. This uptick was due to declining costs for battery storage along with favorable economics when the technology is deployed with wind and solar.More than half of the 51 GW of planned solar and battery storage within the next two years will be in just three states: Texas with 12 GW (23%), California with 11 GW (21%), and New York with 4 GW (7%).Read more: In a US first, California will pilot solar-panel canopies over canalsPhoto: Dennis Schroeder/NREL",solar

2022/03/04,"Ford Motor Company and University of Michigan researchers explored what light-duty vehicle electrification means for the decarbonization of the transportation industry in a study that was published online on March 1 in the journal Environmental Research Letters.Light-duty vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, are currently responsible for 58% of US transportation sector emissions.With a focus on evaluating greenhouse gas emissions, researchers looked at three different model year 2020 powertrain options — internal-combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles, hybrid-electric vehicles, and battery-electric vehicles — for midsize sedans, midsize SUVs, and full-size pickup trucks. They accounted for differences in fuel economy, annual mileage, vehicle production, and vehicle lifetime across vehicle classes. Study senior author Greg Keoleian, a professor at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability and director of the U-M Center for Sustainable Systems, said of the study:This is an important study to inform and encourage climate action. Our research clearly shows substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions that can be achieved from transitioning to electrified powertrains across all vehicle classes.This study expands upon previous studies that have focused on comparing battery-electric vehicle sedans to their internal-combustion-engine or hybrid counterparts. We report emissions for vehicle production, use, and end-of-life stages on a per-mile basis and over the total vehicle lifetime. In addition, we analyzed the regional variation in emissions considering differences in electricity grid mixes and ambient temperatures, and we also explored the effects of the rate of grid decarbonization on emission reduction.Researchers found that light-duty EVs have approximately 64% lower cradle-to-grave life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than ICE vehicles on average across the United States.Researchers also found that switching an ICE vehicle to an EV results in greater total tonnage of emissions reductions as the vehicle size increases, due to the greater fuel consumption of larger vehicles. In other words, a driver who switches from, say, a Ford F-150 to a Ford F-150 Lightning Electric Truck will make a greater impact than someone who drives a Mini Cooper and switches to a Mini Cooper Electric.Researchers also found that EVs have larger greenhouse gas emissions than gas vehicles during manufacturing due to battery production, but that’s offset by savings in their operation. The study developed maps to show the lifetime grams of CO2 equivalent per mile for each powertrain and vehicle type by county across the United States. Researchers found that concerns about EVs having higher emissions than ICE vehicles or hybrids are largely unfounded, as EVs outperform hybrids in 95% to 96% of counties, while EVs outperform ICE vehicles in 98% to 99% of counties, even assuming only modest progress toward grid decarbonization. Study first author and Center for Sustainable Systems Research Specialist Max Woody said:Deployment of electric vehicles and expansion of renewable energy resources like solar and wind should be done at the same time; the benefit of each is increased by the development of the other.Read more: Polestar shares its EV carbon impact data to offer transparency, build consumer trustPhoto: Ford",solar
2022/03/03,"2021 was a record-breaking year for investment in and deployment of clean energy, battery storage, and EVs in the US, according to the “2022 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook” published today by BloombergNEF (BNEF) and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE).UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

We saw record volumes of new capital deployed to support the transition to a lower-carbon economy, a record number of electric vehicles sold, and record contributions to the power grid from zero-carbon renewable sources of power. Still, there are plenty of open questions about future demand that clearer signals from Washington could resolve.Here are three standout things that happened in 2021 for EVs, clean energy, and battery storage:US electric vehicle sales doubled in 2021, but the US still lags globally. Thanks to lower battery costs, growing consumer acceptance, and the rollout of new models, EV sales saw 657,000 units sold in the US in 2021, which is more than double the 325,000 cars sold in 2020. Tesla continued to account for the largest share of EV sales in 2021, at 50%. While the overall market expanded 34%, the market for non-Tesla electric cars grew 83%. However, EVs made up just 4.4% of total US passenger vehicle sales in 2021. The US EV market is one-third the size of the European Union’s and one-fifth of China’s. The US market is not yet growing fast enough to satisfy either US climate ambitions, or to establish the US as an industrial leader in the EV sector.In order for the US to meet its 2030 nationally determined contribution on emissions, EVs must make up at least 30% of vehicles on the road by that year. There’s still a very long way to go to meet that target.Read more: Global market share of electric cars more than doubled in 2021 as the EV revolution gains steamPrivate investment in clean energy in the US is accelerating. Investment of $105 billion in new private capital in the US energy transition in 2021 is an 11% year-on-year increase, and a 70% increase over the past five years. The 2021 total included $47 billion in clean energy (45%), $35 billion in electrified transport (34%), and a doubling of hydrogen investments to $200 million in 2021.Large corporations continued to drive clean energy demand in the US, signing contracts to procure a record 17 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy in 2021. 351 companies pledged to procure 100% clean energy.Further, private sector investment will be leveraged by the US federal government’s unprecedented $80 billion pledge to support the energy transition with the enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.And private investment in renewables is on an upward trajectory. For example, just today, Schenectady, New York-based clean energy company DSD Renewables announced it has secured a $200 million preferred equity investment from alternative investment manager Ares Management Corporation.Read more: A Hawaiian macadamia nut farm gets solar and storage, achieving 100% renewable powerClean energy and battery storage grew, but natural gas is still the leader for electricity generation. More than 45 GW of new power generation capacity was commissioned in 2021 – the largest capacity in nearly two decades. Clean energy dominated, adding 37 GW. Solar had its largest build year ever at 24.2 GW of new capacity, and wind followed at 13 GW, its third best year to date.Further, close to 4.2 GW of battery capacity was added to the US grid in 2021, more than in all preceding years combined. This was due to the growing need for batteries created by the growth of clean energy, particularly solar, in certain markets, particularly California.Overall, natural gas, at 38% is the largest source of US electricity generation. However, natural gas contributed 3.1% less than in 2020, due primarily to higher gas prices.Clean energy provided 21%, with wind and solar representing 14% of this. Nuclear provided 19%, and coal provided 22%. Coal is down nearly 40% from a decade ago due to weak demand, coal plant retirements, and competition from cleaner sources. While coal use rose in 2021 for the first time since 2014, that is widely believed to be a temporary surge.Read more: Clean energy was the No. 2 source of electricity in the US in 2020BNEF/BCSE’s new 2021 study can be found here.",solar

The three-and-a-half-year-long project will boost the reliability and resiliency of 9,000 miles of Evergy’s power transmission system by creating a digital inventory of its assets, accelerating image analysis capabilities, and improving inspection accuracy by using virtual inspections and AI. This is all expected to result in a significant reduction of costs for inspections, maintenance, and repairs.eSmart Systems will use Grid Vision, which, as the company explains on its website, “tracks the performance of ongoing inspection work, provides instant insight of the location and severity of verified high-priority defects, and provides utility managers and analysts a deep and flexible framework for further asset intelligence.”Riad Habib, senior vice president of energy and industry at Bureau Veritas North America, a global testing, inspection, and certification company headquartered in France, said about the use of AI for power transmission systems to Electrek:We continue to see the need for a dynamic energy infrastructure to account for more efficient, safe, and reliable operations. AI and machine learning have been critical aspects to integrate into our high voltage transmission lines, supporting operators and improving reliability to the end users. AI also plays an important role in the shift of generation sources feeding our electric infrastructure, allowing for better balancing of the grid covering variable (solar, wind) sources as well as more fixed (hydro, nuclear) sources.This is a very smart move on Evergy’s part. Extreme weather will become increasingly challenging for grid operators, and more electric cars will be used as renewable systems will be added to electric grids, so utilities must optimize their systems. As Argonne National Laboratory, which is conducting AI grid studies with funding from the US Department of Energy, pointed out in a 2019 article titled, “Artificial intelligence can make the US electric grid smarter”:In a region with 1,000 electric power assets, such as generators and transformers, an outage of just three assets can produce nearly a billion scenarios of potential failure. Which of those possibilities will merit the most attention?AI is going to help pinpoint problems and allow utilities to resolve them quickly. Now if Evergy could just up its game when it comes to shuttering coal plants and adopting renewables at a faster pace, it’d be in good shape.Read more: Kansas is a US wind power leader, but a senator wants to destroy that with a new billPhoto: Evergy",solar

It’s a huge leap forward for the fledgling US offshore wind industryFebruary 25 update: The offshore wind auction began on Wednesday and stretched into Friday afternoon. Here are the winners, followed by the map:Haaland said:This week’s offshore wind sale makes one thing clear: The enthusiasm for the clean energy economy is undeniable and it’s here to stay. The investments we are seeing today will play an important role in delivering on the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to tackle the climate crisis and create thousands of good-paying, union jobs across the nation.Liz Burdock, CEO of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, the only nonprofit focused solely on growing the US offshore wind industry and its supply chain, said in an emailed statement:Gains here today will go a long way to achieve the Biden Administration’s goal of 30 GW by 2030 and will play a critical role in the formation of a domestic supply chain. We look forward to the administration conducting planned auctions in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico over the next few years, which will build off of this week’s momentum.February 24: This is the first offshore wind lease sale in over three years, and is the first offshore wind energy auction under the Biden-Harris Administration.BOEM is providing round-by-round updates on the online auction throughout the day. Once the auction ends, the Department of the Interior will announce the provisional winners for each of the six lease areas.The New York Bight extends northeasterly from Cape May Inlet in New Jersey to Montauk Point on the eastern tip of Long Island.Just before noon ET today, BOEM was on round 30 of the auction, where combined live bids for the six leases stood at $2 billion. Reuters points out:That easily topped the US offshore wind auction record of $405 million set in 2018. It was also far more than recent oil and gas auctions in US federal waters. A sale of drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico late last year, for instance, attracted $191.7 million in high bids.There are 25 eligible bidders.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

The system, which was developed by Schenectady, New York-based solar and storage company DSD Renewables and Maui-based renewable energy developer No Ka Oi Energy, is expected to generate 1.55 million kWh of solar energy annually, avoiding over 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year. No Ka Oi Energy brought the project to DSD, which will be the long-term owner and manager of the solar and storage system.The solar farm features 2,916 solar panels that sit on three acres on Mauna Loa’s macadamia nut farm.Mauna Loa’s Hawaiian crop of macadamias are grown with rainwater, making the macadamia one of the most sustainable nut varieties. The company also uses the whole nut during its production process, cleanly burning the shells to create renewable energy and composting the nut husks to enrich the local community’s soil.Ed Schultz, president and CEO of Hawaiian Host Group, the parent company of Mauna Loa said:This project nicely complements Mauna Loa’s on-site water and wastewater system, and with the addition of the renewable power system, our Kea‘au facility can now be 100% self-sustained. We will continue to learn and take action to minimize our environmental impact as much as possible and care for our ʻāina [land].Nuts are tasty and nutritious (as long as you don’t have a nut allergy). But a lot of nuts, such as almonds, cashews, and pistachios, aren’t very sustainable, because they require a lot of water to produce. Macadamias, as we previously mentioned, are much more sustainable when it comes to water needs, and Mauna Loa getting onto 100% clean energy makes the tasty but costly nut even more sustainable. Now if the company could just figure out how to eliminate the flight emissions produced as the nuts are shipped out of Hawaii to retailers, even better, but this shift to clean energy production certainly doesn’t hurt.Read more: Hawaii’s Big Island is getting one of its first utility-scale solar farmsPhoto: DSD Renewables",solar

2022/02/15,"Most of the materials required for batteries and other clean energy technology are dirty to mine. They’re also mostly controlled by China. Can a recycling technology startup change that?Electrek spoke with Megan O’Connor, cofounder and CEO of Nth Cycle, a Beverly, Massachusetts-based developer of a recycling technology that extracts critical metals from batteries for a second life, about how to enable a clean, domestic, and streamlined supply of critical minerals for the clean energy transition. Nth Cycle’s technology was developed at Harvard and Yale universities.In April, Nth Cycle received $3.2 million in seed funding led by Boston-based clean energy venture capital company Clean Energy Ventures.February 15, 2022, update: Nth Cycle today announced the closing of its $12.5 million Series A financing,  co-led by the investment arm of Frankstahl, one of the largest privately held steel distribution companies in Europe, and  Volo Earth, a Colorado-based venture firm that focuses on climate solutions. In less than 12 months, the company has scaled its technology by 100x from bench-scale to a full commercial demonstration, which will be deployed by April 2022.Electrek: What does Nth Cycle do? Megan O’Connor: Nth Cycle is a metal processing and recycling technology company. We work with recyclers and miners to recover the critical minerals essential to clean energy technologies such as batteries and wind turbines. Our customizable and clean electro-extraction technology installs onsite to recover critical minerals from separated e-waste and low-grade mine tailings. We are the heart of metals processing – the crucial step that profitably separates critical minerals from other elements, transforming them into production-grade feedstocks for the energy transition.Electrek: How does your new battery recycling technology work? Megan O’Connor: Existing technologies that recover critical minerals from e-waste and mining are dirty and inefficient. The main two technologies, pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, are both problematic. Pyrometallurgy is what it sounds like: It uses large, dirty furnaces to superheat materials for recycling. Pyrometallurgy consumes excessive energy and emits greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Hydrometallurgy uses liquid for a similar result. Hydrometallurgy uses harmful acids and solvents that create tons of environmentally toxic chemical waste. Both processes were invented over 50 years ago.At Nth Cycle, we’re taking a different approach to expanding the supply of critical minerals for the clean energy revolution. We leverage the power of electro-extraction: clean and modular technology for reliably recovering critical minerals from e-waste and low-grade mine tailings using only electricity. Our electro extraction technology is clean, customizable, consistent, and mobile.Electrek: How often can materials be recycled? Megan O’Connor: In theory, the number is unlimited. It’s a big part of why I believe that all the critical minerals needed for the energy transition are already in circulation today. We just didn’t have a clean, profitable way of retrieving them until now. We know that demand for critical minerals to power the energy transition is growing exponentially. Yet, we know mining deeper and broader, and building landfills higher and wider works against our fight to save the planet. Additionally, we cannot allow either supply chain issues or China’s dominance in critical minerals to slow the clean energy transition. Recycling and better domestic mining offer our best path forward.Electrek: How are you working with mining companies to help them extract more valuable material from mining waste? Megan O’Connor: Our technology is mobile and scalable so we can work with mining companies in a variety of ways. Primarily we work with them at the front end of their process. We can go to the mining site with our electro extraction technology and work with them on site. This may be surprising to your readers, but the US has some significant potential for domestic mining of critical minerals. If we can access and extract those minerals cleanly, efficiently, and economically,  it’ll pay substantial dividends for our clean energy industries – Nth Cycle’s technology can make that possible.Electrek: How do you intend to scale up, and what does that road map look like? Megan O’Connor: The opportunity is nearly limitless. The demand curve for critical minerals looks like a ski jump – it’s straight up. Earlier this year, we received seed funding from investors led by Clean Energy Ventures (CEV). Recently the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, through their InnovateMass program, awarded us a $250,000 grant. We expect to be able to discuss more about some exciting upcoming partnerships and projects later this year. The growth is exciting and can make a significant impact. Part of the reason CEV decided to fund us was that their carbon impact calculator estimated that we could cut 3.8 gigatons of emissions by 2050. We’re still at an early stage, but the opportunity is obviously exciting. Electrek: Zambia has a new president who wants to scale up mining, as the country has valuable copper, nickel, and cobalt. Will this improve the supply chain and human-rights challenges, and does Nth Cycle have any plans to engage in Zambia? Megan O’Connor: The mining of many of our clean energy minerals in Africa is horribly dirty, exploitative, and polluting. At Nth Cycle, we see this challenge as an opportunity. An opportunity to draw the resources needed for the energy transition from more efficient mines. A chance to make recovery processes more sustainable while improving profits at the same time. The tools required to mine cobalt, nickel, and manganese (critical for our clean energy future) exist today. The technologies needed to break down old cell phones, magnets, and electric vehicles into their component parts exist today. But, the incumbent processes that transform these harvests into production-grade critical minerals for new manufacturing are old, dirty, and expensive. We’re at the early stages of this company – and the clean energy transition as a whole. Right now, we’re laser-focused on scaling up domestically, but there is no doubt that working to clean up the mining process in Africa is important – one step at a time. Read more: These energy storage startups just got a big cash injectionMegan O’Connor is cofounder and CEO of Nth Cycle. She leverages years of experience working on sustainable technology in many of the US’s top research labs, where she helped develop the electro-extraction processes she and her team are commercializing at Nth Cycle. Prior to founding Nth Cycle, O’Connor was an entrepreneurial fellow in the Innovation Crossroads program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was a visiting researcher at Yale University’s Center for Green Chemistry & Green Engineering. O’Connor received her PhD in environmental engineering from Duke University and was recognized by Forbes on its “30 under 30” energy list in 2019. Nth Cycle is supported by investors including Clean Energy Ventures, the Department of Energy, and Creative Destruction Lab.Photo: Nth Cycle",solar
2022/02/11,"A year on from the big Texas freeze that knocked out the state’s power system and caused at least 246 deaths, new research released yesterday found that rooftop solar could have supplied more than enough electricity to meet the shortfall on all but two of the 13 days when power production fell short of forecasted demand.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.According to the paper from Environment America Research & Policy Center, Environment Texas Research & Policy Center, and Frontier Group, titled “Rooftop solar and the 2021 Texas power crisis,” even on the two days when the divide between supply and demand was greatest (February 15-16, 2021), rooftop solar could still have made up approximately 40-60% of that gap by substantially reducing the need for electricity from centralized power plants.Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said in an emailed statement:Even as millions of Texans, including my family, shivered in the cold last February, the sun was shining over our heads.We have this inexhaustible energy source above us that could have kept the heat on and we’re barely using it, that just doesn’t make sense. Solar is clean, more affordable than ever, and primed to help build a more resilient electric grid.The paper contrasts the role that solar played during the freeze with the role that it could play in lessening the impact to the electric system in future extreme weather events. The authors used data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to estimate how much power rooftop solar could have been generated in Texas during the 2021 storm if every suitable rooftop across the state had been fitted with solar panels. Solar power has grown 123-fold in Texas over the last decade – Texas is a solar leader in the US – and the state’s solar capacity has increased substantially in the last year alone. Because of that growth, Texas would now produce about 70% more solar power than it did a year ago under the same conditions as the February 2021 freeze event, according to the research. However, most rooftops that are suitable for solar remain unused. If those roofs were utilized for solar, Texas could install 97,800 megawatts of additional clean power generating capacity – enough to meet about one-third of the state’s electricity 2020 needs and more than 15 times the total operating capacity at the time of the 2021 power crisis.The paper acknowledges that rooftop solar alone cannot solve Texas’s energy challenges. To make its power grid more resilient, the state also needs energy storage, increased electricity transmission capacity, and greater energy efficiency.Environment America Research & Policy Center 100% Renewable Campaign director Emma Searson said in an emailed statement:The energy system of today is vulnerable and that puts all of us at risk.But the good news is that we have an amazing, abundant clean energy source shining down on our homes and businesses that can help us fix it. Rooftop solar is a win-win for people and the planet, and it has the potential to be a foundational building block of the resilient, renewable grid of tomorrow – in Texas and across the country.Read more: Why is Texas’s grid failing in the state’s big freeze?Photo: Texas Power Guide",solar
2022/02/09,"State legislators in Florida have approved Florida SB 1024 and HB 741, which would require future rooftop solar panel owners to pay higher rates and curb net metering. Yesterday, solar workers traveled to Tallahassee and let legislators know what a terrible idea they think these bills are.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.The Senate Regulated Industries Committee approved SB 1024 with a 7-2 vote on January 11. The House Tourism, Infrastructure and Energy Subcommittee voted for the companion bill, HB 741, 13-3 last week.Net metering means that energy that a household’s solar panels produce and isn’t used is credited back to the customer, so the solar customer is only billed for net energy usage. The credits help solar owners offset the costs of installing solar, and of course the adoption of clean energy helps to reduce emissions. But Florida utilities are yet again arguing that non-solar customers have to shoulder the costs of maintaining the grid.As the Miami Herald‘s editorial board explained on Monday: Senate Bill 1024’s solution is to allow utilities to lower the credits solar customers receive and charge them additional costs such as minimum monthly payments, grid access fees and facility charges.The result, though, would likely be that it would stop making financial sense for consumers to invest in solar power at all.And, voila, [Florida Power & Light] FPL then can monopolize solar-power generation and distribution.In November, after Senator Jennifer Bradley (R) filed Florida SB 1024 (and Florida Power & Light’s parent company then made a $20,000 campaign donation’s to Bradley’s political committee), Will Giese, southeast regional director for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), issued the following statement in response:This is a tired tactic that utilities have used to maintain their monopoly grip on electricity markets. Net metering is a popular program that gives people the right to choose the energy that works for them, provides benefits to all ratepayers, and creates thousands of energy jobs across Florida. The bill is another of a long line of cynical efforts carried out in the state of Florida at the behest of monopoly utilities to the detriment of Florida residents.Stripping Floridians of their right to choose solar is simply bad policy. The bill does not consider the many benefits that solar provides to all ratepayers and it will weaken one of the fastest-growing sectors in Florida’s economy. Florida has the second-largest solar workforce in the country and ranks third among states for installed solar capacity. The state is poised to maintain its solar leadership in the years ahead, but this bill would stamp out that economic growth just as it is ramping up.Yesterday, advocacy group Solar United Neighbors held a rally in Florida’s state capital, Tallahassee, which was well attended hundreds of household owners and solar workers from as far away as Miami:Impromptu chants to #SaveOurSolar #SaveSolarFL pic.twitter.com/1sty6XNLY5@AaronPBean @SenAudrey2eet #saveoursolar pic.twitter.com/dzERa8fQuHRepresentative Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando) spoke at the rally:I was so proud to rally with hundreds of my fellow Floridians at the #SaveOurSolar Rally as we push back against efforts by FPL to end net metering, squash competition and decimate 40,000+ jobs! We won’t let it happen in the Sunshine State! ☀️ pic.twitter.com/Ou912RhZ9eThe Miami Herald made the following point about the legislation:If [utilities’] real intent is to protect non-solar customers from paying exorbitant subsidies, they must also say whether those same customers will see a break in their monthly bills if this legislation becomes law. That’s only fair, given the potential impact this would have on solar users and companies.Of course, we at Electrek think this legislation is a terrible idea. The only group that would win would be the utilities.On February 3, consumer reviews website SolarReviews sent a survey to 254 Florida homeowners who requested solar quotes through the SolarReviews website within the last two years. SolarReviews yesterday reported that 74% of respondents would no longer consider going solar in Florida if the proposal is passed that will pay net metering customers at the avoided cost rate versus the retail rate.93% of respondents would no longer consider solar if Florida changed to an avoided cost rate plan and implemented a monthly grid participation charge.Florida is the Sunshine State. It’s also vulnerable to sea level rise. For a state government that is shouting a whole lot lately about “freedom,” they sure seem to want to restrict a lot of freedom of choice, and solar isn’t going to be spared. We hope legislators pause and take notice of the pretty big pro-solar turnout at yesterday’s rally in Tallahassee.These bills are bad for solar customers, bad for solar workers, and bad for the environment.Read more: Elon Musk says California proposal to cut solar incentives is a ‘bizarre anti-environment move’ and California NEM 3.0 delayed indefinitelyPhoto: “Thin Film Flexible Solar PV Installation 2” by ken fields is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 ",solar

Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.The authors of the peer-reviewed study from the University of Surrey in the UK point out that even if no other argument, such as fighting climate change, is accepted for the switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then economics should be reason enough to embrace clean energy. The editorial states: In October the International Energy Agency [IEA] published its latest World Energy Outlook in which [it] states, “In most markets, solar PV or wind now represents the cheapest available source of new electricity generation.”Note the IEA, which was established during the 1970s oil crisis to provide statistics on the oil market, has been criticized in the past for “underplay[ing] the speed at which the world could switch to renewable sources of energy.” Hence the IEA’s promotion of renewable energy, not on environmental grounds but simply on the basis of cost has added weight. The IEA report goes on to state that “the low costs of wind and solar PV mean that more than half of the additional emissions reductions could be gained at no cost to electricity consumers.”In some cases, it is even cheaper to build a new solar PV plant than to continue operating an existing coal or natural gas-fired plant. IRENA estimates that 61% of coal capacity in the United States costs more to operate than building new renewable energy plants. Retiring these coal plants and replacing them with renewables would save USD $5.6 billion in costs and 332 million tonnes of CO2 per year.Note, this cost competitiveness is not the result of government subsidy. IRENA notes that “offshore wind can now compete with price levels seen in the wholesale electricity market, without financial support.” Additionally, “74% of all new solar PV projects commissioned over the next two years that have been competitively procured through auctions and tenders will have an award price lower than new coal power.”Ravi Silva, director of the Advanced Technology Institute at the University of Surrey and co-author of the study, said:COP26 was big news last year but it’s meaningless unless we maintain momentum and deliver on our carbon reduction targets. Solar is a crucial part of the solution and one which is more cost-effective than people believe. It’s crazy that installing new solar energy plants can cost less than continuing to operate coal-fired power stations, yet changes aren’t being made. Retiring all the uneconomic coal plants around the world and replacing them with renewables would save US $32 billion and 3 gigatons of CO2 annually, 9% of the mankind’s energy-related emissions. Is not this a worthwhile legacy for COP26?Of course, solar needs to be balanced with other sources of clean energy, such as wind and hydro, and battery storage is an essential part of the mix to regulate supply and demand.But what’s overwhelmingly clear is that coal – and indeed, fossil fuels in general – are not only bad for the environment, they’re also a terrible financial choice. That’s the main thrust of this study, and it’s a powerful argument.

2022/02/04,"Kansas state senator Mike Thompson (R-Shawnee), a former meteorologist, is not a supporter of clean energy.

But here’s the problem with that proposal in Kansas: Half of the state’s 105 counties are unzoned, so clean energy advocates say the bill could effectively bring wind energy growth to a halt. And counties that want clean energy that have chosen not to be zoned would then be forced to be zoned as industrial. So this bill could have a very negative impact in Kansas, as it ranks No. 2 in the US for wind power. “In 2020, wind energy accounted for 43% of Kansas’s electricity net generation, which was the second-highest share of wind power for any state after Iowa,” according to the US Energy Information Administration.Kimberly Svaty, a public policy consultant for the Kansas Power Alliance, which represents the state’s clean energy industry, said [via the Kansas City Star]:It would be sending a message…that, well perhaps Oklahoma, or Missouri, or Nebraska, or Texas, or Iowa would be a better and more stable state in which to invest dollars.The Kansas City Star adds:[Wind] is the least expensive energy source in Kansas and has created 22,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state, according to an 2020 economic impact report by the Kansas City-based Polsinelli law firm.So what’s Thompson’s beef with renewables? He explains it in his own words in an April 2, 2021, opinion piece in the Topeka Capital-Journal. You can read his two cents by clicking this link, in which he throws everything he’s got at wind power, from rural residents’ rights to turbine blade landfill, but here’s an excerpt:One only needs to take a drive through most of Kansas to understand the excesses caused by an unchecked industry propped up by government. The staggering number of wind turbines (over 40 fields in total) has destroyed much of the beautiful Kansas landscape. Wildlife is being chased away, and birds, bats, and even beneficial insects are being wiped out. Stray voltage has negative impacts on dairy cattle.Once you cut through all the reasons given for why solar and wind shouldn’t be allowed, it always, always comes down to a couple of things for anti-clean energy folks. One, they have a connection to fossil fuels – and it’s fossil fuels that are destroying the planet – or two, they just don’t want to look at them. (Because fossil fuel plants are so picturesque.)

2022/02/03,"The European Commission wants to label some natural gas and nuclear power plants as sustainable, calling them “transitional” sources of energy in rules proposed yesterday.

A requirement in a previous draft, for plants to start switching in 2026, was dropped.New nuclear plants must receive construction permits before 2045 to get a green investment label, and be located in a country with a plan and funds to safely dispose of radioactive waste by 2050.EU countries’ responses to this European Commission nuclear and gas proposal have unsurprisingly been all over the map. France, which sources around 70% of its electricity from nuclear, is leading Team Nuclear, which includes Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.On the other hand, Germany will shut down its three remaining nuclear plants by the end of this year. It’s going to rely on natural gas, a polluting fossil fuel, instead, and the country calls it a “bridge technology.” Germany says it will replace natural gas with non-polluting alternatives such as hydrogen by 2045, which is its net zero target date. Poland and Bulgaria are also on Team Natural Gas.Belgium plans to be nuclear free by 2045, and Switzerland also intends to phase out its nuclear power plants. Denmark and Luxembourg are anti-nuclear, and Austria yesterday repeated its threat to take legal action over nuclear’s potential label as renewable energy.Reuters continues:EU countries and the European Parliament have four months to potentially block the rules, which could be done by a super-majority of 20 out of the 27 EU countries – a threshold seen as unlikely – or a majority of lawmakers.Green EU lawmakers said on Wednesday they would campaign for the 353 votes needed to block the proposal, and already had roughly 250.If approved, the gas and nuclear rules would apply from Jan. 2023.Greenpeace’s EU sustainable finance campaigner Ariadna Rodrigo made the following statement yesterday in response to the nuclear and natural gas proposal:This anti-science plan represents the biggest greenwashing exercise of all time. It makes a mockery of the EU’s claims to global leadership on climate and the environment. The inclusion of gas and nuclear in the taxonomy is increasingly difficult to explain as anything other than a giveaway to two desperate industries with powerful political friends.Denmark, Ireland, and other countries say labeling natural gas, a polluting fossil fuel, as “green” would undermine the EU’s leadership in fighting climate change. We at Electrek agree with this viewpoint, and with Greenpeace’s take. Nuclear has a huge radioactive waste problem, but in the short term, should be the last non-renewable power generation that is closed down.If the European Union got member states to significantly expand their clean energy production, as wind and solar are increasingly cost effective in Europe, then investors wouldn’t be interested in natural gas or nuclear.Let us know your take in the comments below.Read more: European Commission budgets €1 trillion for European Green DealPhoto: “France’s Nuclear Energy” by Gretchen Mahan is licensed under Creative Commons",solar
2022/02/02,"In 2021, there were about 108,000 public charging ports in the US. That’s nearly one port for every gas station in the US, of which there is an estimated 111,000 to 150,000 – a whole lot more EV charging ports are needed.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.There are more than 2 million EVs currently registered in the US. The ideal ratio of EVs to charging stations is 40 Level 2 charging ports and 3.4 DC fast chargers (DCFC) per 1,000 EVs, according to a report from the US Department of Energy. (A DCFC charger usually has three ports.) Currently, there are 41 Level 2 charging ports and 5.7 DCFC charging ports per 1,000 EVs, respectively, or about 21 EVs for every charging port.On the other hand, there are 2,514 gas cars per gas station, but the ratio works, as internal combustion engine cars currently have a wider range than EVs.But the range of electric cars is increasing quickly. As car insurance comparison website Jerry points out, for example, “newer EV models like the Tesla Model S can go as high as 405 miles on a full battery, and earlier this year, Mercedes unveiled an all-electric Vision EQXX concept car at the Consumer Electronics Show that gets a 648-mile range per charge.” Lucid’s Air does over 500 miles on a single charge. According to new research from Jerry, with a projected 35 million EVs on roads by 2030, the US will need to install around 478 charging ports every day for the next eight years to build the necessary infrastructure to support them. 90+% of EV owners charge at home, but more public charging points are still needed for city and apartment/condo dwellers as well as long trips that go beyond the range of a car’s battery. Lakshmi Iyengar, data scientist at Jerry, explained to Electrek why they compared charging ports to gas stations rather than pumps: Considering the ratio of EVs to ICE vehicles on the road, we believe the port number is a better comparison. Further, the majority of EV owners have access to home charging, while ICE vehicle owners cannot fuel at home.In addition to the federal push for EV chargers – the Biden Infrastructure Law targets 500,000 stations by 2030 – there is also a push on the corporate side for an increase in charging stations. So EV charging ports will surpass the number of gas stations, which has been steadily declining for the last 20 years.For example, EOS Linx, which provides solar-supported stations with EV chargers, today announced a collaboration with Choice Hotels International – one of the largest hotel chains in the world that has more than 6,000 US franchised hotels such as EconoLodge and Quality Inn – to install EOS Charge Stations at select properties. The first set of EOS Charge Stations will be installed at select hotels in Atlanta, Chattanooga, and Nashville during the first quarter of this year. EOS Linx provides Level 2 chargers and fast chargers with varying capabilities and uses the universal J1772 charging standard system.Further, convenience store chain 7-Eleven has also promised to install 500 DCFC charging ports by the end of 2022. It currently only has 22 charging stations at 14 stores in four states.Photo: EVGo",solar
2022/02/01,"A federal appeals court yesterday ruled that Arizona utility Salt River Project, which services most of the Phoenix metropolitan area, can be held liable for violating antitrust laws because it charged customers who own rooftop solar panels higher electricity rates.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that, according to Tucson.com, “there is sufficient evidence that could show the price structure was designed to deter the competitive threat of solar energy systems and to force consumers to exclusively purchase electricity” from Salt River Project.The case will go back to a trial judge, who will determine what the damages are to Salt River Project rooftop solar customers.Salt River Project used to offer a net metering system that gave rooftop solar owners credit for excess power they generated. But in 2014, the utility adopted a new pricing plan that said “solar customers who still need to be hooked up to the utility for times when solar is not available can be charged up to 65% more than under prior plans. Yet at the same time, rates for non-solar customers went up about 3.9%.”Judge Eric Miller for the appellate panel wrote in “Ellis v. Salt River Project”:In February 2015, the [Salt River Project] board of directors approved the new pricing scheme. At the same time, it adopted a rate increase for its non-solar customers of only about 3.9%. After adopting the new pricing scheme, SRP undertook a $1.7 million advertising campaign to promote its increased rates for solar customers. Not surprisingly, applications for solar-energy systems in [Salt River Project] territory decreased by between 50 and 96%.“[C]oercive activity that prevents its victims from making free choices between market alternatives” gives rise to antitrust injury.[T]he plaintiff need only show that diminished consumer choices and increased prices are the result of a less competitive market due to either artificial restraints or predatory and exclusionary conduct.Jean Su, director of the energy justice program for the Center for Biological Diversity, said:This is a game changer in the struggle to defend rooftop solar against utilities’ all-out war on clean, affordable, climate-resilient energy.For the first time, a federal court has said utilities can be liable under antitrust laws if they attack rooftop solar.The future for renewable energy just got a light [sic] brighter.As Jean Su said, this ruling is a game changer, and not just for Arizona. Americans generally do not have a choice in which utility they use for electricity, and what Salt River Project did to its rooftop solar customers was completely unfair. Salt River Project’s homepage features a banner that proclaims, “We’re building a sustainable future in Arizona.” Are you, Salt River Project? Or is that just more greenwashing that has become so common among utilities and big corporations? Rooftop solar customers are sick of having to battle for the right to use clean energy without being penalized for doing so.

2022/01/28,"Electrek‘s Michelle Lewis spoke with head of Enel North America Enrico Viale about why clean energy is better and cheaper than fossil fuels, and why modernizing the grid and battery storage are vital for EV charging and renewables implementation.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.Electrek: Apart from urgently aiming to reduce emissions, why do you think clean energy is a better alternative to fossil fuels? How does clean energy compare to fossil fuels in terms of cost, speed and ease of bringing to market, and profitability?Enrico Viale: In the traditional, centralized energy model, consumers don’t play an active role – they simply pay utility companies for electricity – and it primarily leverages fossil fuels, which are finite resources, emit massive amounts of CO2, and are becoming increasingly expensive to operate and manage. This model is costly and fails to account for the shift happening among consumers who are demanding a decarbonized power source. As the only way to address the dramatically worsening climate crisis will be to achieve 100% clean electricity, consumers will progressively move their energy consumption toward renewable sources over the next 10 years and take a more participatory role in managing their energy, ultimately shifting from consumers into prosumers.  The initial infrastructure needed for renewable energy is an investment, but once it’s established, renewable energy prices are driven down as demand increases and deployment is scaled. This means that as adoption grows exponentially in the coming years and we continue to leverage flexible technologies to drive the transition, prices will continue to drop, and time to market will continue to speed up. Renewables are also faster to market and less expensive than fossil fuels in almost any geography. In 2020, an analysis by BloombergNEF found that solar photovoltaic and onshore wind are now the cheapest sources of new-build generation for about two-thirds of the global population. Simply put, renewable energy is the cheapest source of energy available, and those who fail to pivot away from fossil fuels in favor of a more flexible, electrified approach run the risk of becoming obsolete.Electrek: What is Enel doing to make the switch to renewables, and what is the long-term plan to get to net zero?Enrico Viale: If the previous decade was focused on renewable energy discovery, the next decade will be about electrification. As part of the strategy rolled out at our recent Capital Markets Day, we accelerated Enel’s net zero commitment by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040. This includes direct and indirect emissions, exiting the production and sale of gas by 2040, and reaffirming our coal exit by 2027. To support this, Enel will also be directly investing €170 billion ($191 billion) and mobilizing an additional €40 billion ($45 billion) through third parties to drive renewable growth, decarbonize the electric supply, and scale infrastructure globally. While this is an aggressive timeline, this type of transformative commitment from all utilities will be crucial to achieving the decarbonization targets set by the Paris Agreement in 2015.To help major companies and governments reach their broader sustainability goals, rather than only focusing on certain aspects at a given time, such as renewable energy procurement or electrified fleets, we’re also adopting a more integrated offering to simplify decarbonization and electrification for our customers. The energy industry too often takes a piecemeal approach to the energy transition, but more integrated solutions can enable customers to holistically approach their goals and provide more opportunity to extract value from their investments.Electrek: Why, and to what extent, is grid-connected EV charging going to matter to utilities and consumers in 2022?Enrico Viale: Twenty years ago, telecommunications companies were primarily focused on landlines until the introduction of cell phones presented a new revenue stream through their role as a network operator. In the coming years, a similar situation will exist for utilities surrounding grid-connected EV charging, particularly as consumer demand for EVs increases and major automakers around the world execute on their EV commitments. To remain competitive in a growing market, more utilities must start to position themselves not only as energy suppliers and network operators, but also as service providers to enable the transition to a 100% electric transportation future. Ownership and management of EV charging infrastructure and consumer incentive programs presents a significant opportunity for utilities and will allow them to better manage increased electricity demand via smart EV charging and demand response. For electric car owners, smart EV charging provides additional income opportunities through rebate programs and cost savings around electricity costs.Electrek: What role will battery storage play in the modernization of the US grid, and what steps will utilities need to take to implement battery storage?Enrico Viale: A modernized grid is smart, flexible, and able to quickly respond to surges in demand, but a major barrier to scaling adoption of renewables and meeting fluctuating demand is intermittency. Our current energy system was designed around the technology available decades ago, so during demand spikes and network disturbances, utilities, and network operators typically respond by firing up fossil fuel “peaker” plants to maintain the balance the electricity system requires. While these plants are exceedingly costly to operate in the current environment and release significant polluting emissions, it’s difficult to replace them with intermittent renewable energy resources. Some forms of renewable energy, like solar or wind, can only be sourced at certain times of day, meaning we must capture excess energy during those time periods and deploy it as needed. Herein lies the gap that battery storage can fill.By storing surplus energy generated at times of low demand, utility-scale batteries can make renewable energy resources available 24 hours a day. This allows the grid to more effectively respond to periods of high demand and increase overall reliability. To leverage the full power of renewable energy in 2022 and beyond, utilities will need to make significant investments in storage to scale the necessary technology. This will be an ongoing priority for Enel as well. In Texas alone, Enel Green Power has five projects under construction, representing an additional 550 MW of battery storage. To put that number into perspective, Texas had just over 100 MW of operational utility scale battery storage at the end of 2020.What will an updated grid look like, and when do you think the US will be realistically able to achieve that?Enrico Viale: An updated grid needs to be decentralized, digitized, and able to effectively leverage distributed energy resources (DERs). As we saw this past winter and summer, extreme weather brought on by climate change can have a devastating impact on electric grids. And while there is some movement around updating the US electricity grid, major shifts like transmission infrastructure build-out and large capacity additions will not happen overnight. To meet rapidly increasing demand and withstand extreme weather events we’re dealing with today, grid operators need to increase reliability and resiliency now by connecting DERs, like small-scale solar and battery storage, to the grid, while simultaneously strengthening the grid for the future through investments in infrastructure and renewable capacity expansions. With nearly six million miles of local distribution lines linking thousands of generating plants to factories, homes, and businesses, there is tremendous opportunity to transform the US distribution network systems and modernize the grid over the next decade, and this will remain a key priority for Enel. Enrico Viale was appointed head of Enel North America in July 2019.

They’ll provide reliable grid stability services and power management across central Scotland, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.The portfolio, which got planning consent from the Scottish government on January 5, is expected to come online in April 2024 and will be comprised of two 400 MW battery facilities, each providing 800 MWh of energy storage capacity.On January 17, Electrek reported that Crown Estate Scotland, which held Scotland’s largest-ever auction of offshore wind permits, chose 17 projects in its ScotWind Leasing round with a massive 25 GW of capacity. So large-scale energy storage that can shift power and provide grid stability services is now even more critical. The Scottish Green Battery Complex will enable up to 1,750 GWh per year of additional clean energy to be generated in Scotland and transported to other regions of the UK, equivalent to enabling approximately 500 MW of new offshore wind deployments.The Hunterston and Kincardine projects will also take part in the National Grid’s Scottish Stability Pathfinder phase 2 tender, which seeks to address voltage and stability issues faced by the UK electricity grid. National Grid ESO writes:As traditional coal and gas plants are phased out from Britain’s energy system, the transmission system short circuit levels are falling. Renewable generators like wind and solar connect to the grid in a different way, which doesn’t give us the same stabilizing properties. So we need to find new providers to help support the system.The Scottish Green Battery Complex will deploy grid-forming inverter technology alongside two new synchronous condenser installations that adjust conditions on the grid.This is smart, because not only is clean energy needed, but battery storage and energy regulation are also needed.

It’s 3,000 feet (915 m) long, 20 feet (6 m) tall, and is constructed of reinforced concrete. The retrofit PV system capacity is expected to be 637.5 kW DC, and 802,000 kWh will be generated annually. This represents the equivalent of supplying 120 homes per year with electricity.Ko-Solar is particularly interested in transportation structure, so it’s developing a pilot project with MassDOT to put solar panels on a half-mile stretch of sound barriers on Interstate 95, near Boston.Metal grids will be attached to the sides of 160 concrete sound barriers on the southbound side of I-95, and solar panels will be mounted at an angle. The panels will face the road.Massachusetts-based Solect Energy will own the installation, and the MassDOT will buy the power the solar panels generate at a few cents per kilowatt-hour cheaper than the basic utility rate. The pilot project is expected to produce 800 megawatt-hours of power annually. That’s enough to power around 100 households.The state will observe the installation for a couple of years, observing a number of things. It wants to ensure the metal grids don’t damage the sound barriers and also wants to know how weather affects the solar installation, how and whether the installation impacts the effectiveness of the sound barriers, and whether any glare occurs from the solar panels that could impact drivers.The pilot is participating in The Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, which offers incentives for residential and commercial solar projects throughout Massachusetts. Energy News Network points out:The installation qualifies for an extra 6 cents per kilowatt-hour under a provision that gives a boost to projects constructed over an area also used for transportation purposes. In September, the plan also received a $345,000 grant from the state Department of Energy Resources as part of a program that helps state agencies and colleges pursue clean energy projects. This installation will be the first of its kind in the US – MassDOT claims it’s the “first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere” – and construction is expected to begin in spring 2022.

But that space has potential to do so much more.To reach our clean energy goals, we need strong public policy and committed private action. Big-box stores can be big leaders on the road to a clean energy future.Putting solar on big-box retail roofs is one of my very favorite clean energy placement solutions. Big-box store roofs are expansive, flat, stable, wide-open spaces that generally aren’t used for anything other than covering the store. There also isn’t going to be any pushback from NIMBYs who complain that Walmart’s solar roof ruins their view. What could be a more perfect setting?I’d take it one step further and recommend that we cover warehouse and industrial park roofs with solar as well.

Looking back, the EIA notes:The amount of solar power generating capacity operated by the US electric power sector at the end of 2021 is 20 times more than it was at the end of 2011, and US wind power capacity is more than twice what it was 10 years ago.Inversely, the EIA forecasts that the share of generation from natural gas will fall from 37% in 2021 to 34% by 2023. Natural gas declined from 39% in 2020 to 37% in 2021. That’s because the cost of natural gas delivered to US electric generators in 2021 averaged $4.88 per million British thermal units – more than double the average cost in 2020.Natural gas is expected to decline, but operating costs of renewable generators will continue to be generally lower than natural gas-fired units.Meanwhile, the share of generation from coal rose for the first time since 2014 to average 23% last year, but the coal share will decline from 23% to 22% by 2023, and continue to decline.The EIA continues:We estimate that the electric power sector had 63 gigawatts (GW) of existing solar power generating capacity operating at the end of 2021. We forecast solar capacity will grow by about 21 GW in 2022 and by 25 GW in 2023. We expect that 7 GW of wind generating capacity will be added in 2022 and another 4 GW in 2023.

The state’s national solar ranking is 18th, jumping from 32nd in 2020. Its growth projection is 5,971 MW over the next five years, and it’s expected to move to the  number four spot in state rankings.It’s good that Indiana has a whole lot more clean energy planned because it’s also a serious fossil-fuel-consuming state.In 2020, Indiana ranked third in the US in total coal consumption and coal consumption for electricity generation, after Texas and Missouri. Coal fueled 53% of Indiana’s electricity net generation that year. The state hosts the largest inland oil refinery in the United States, and it also consumes a lot of natural gas.

NEM 3.0 would reduce the bill credit solar customers get for selling electricity back to the grid. As Electrek reported on January 3:The credit for energy that residential solar owners put back into the grid would be slashed to a wholesale rate of about $0.04 per kWh.On top of slashing net metering rates, the NEM 3.0 proposal adds a new fixed monthly charge for solar owners of $8 per kW installed on their roof.It means that someone with a 10 kW system has to pay $80 per month to their electric utility just to stay connected to the grid and send back electricity at a new lower rate.At a press conference on Monday, Newsom expressed concern about the proposal, which is backed by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric. All are investor-owned electric utilities. Bloomberg reported yesterday about that press conference:“I’ll say this about the plan, we still have some work to do,” Newsom said. He later added that he thinks changes will need to be made to the proposal that’s expected to be voted on later this month by state utility regulators. He didn’t say what those changes would be.In a statement released yesterday, the Environmental Working Group‘s president and California resident Ken Cook weighed in on Newsom’s statement:We welcome the governor’s comments and respectfully urge him to use his voice and full authority to stop the ill-conceived plan. It is clearly meant to increase profits for the utilities and crush the only competition they now face – the competition from Californians who are investing to install solar panels and, increasingly, battery storage on homes, businesses, schools and in communities.The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) stated in an email on December 13 that “this decision will deter many Californians from installing rooftop solar and storage and slow clean energy deployment, leaving the state’s grid vulnerable to blackouts and power outages, and harming California’s ability to reach its clean energy goals.”Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA, said then in a written statement:Only the wealthiest Californians will be able to afford rooftop solar, shutting out schools, small businesses, and the average family from our clean energy future.The only winners today are the utilities, which will make more profits at the expense of their ratepayers. We urge Governor Newsom to act quickly to change this decision — at risk are 65,000 solar jobs, the security of our electricity grid, and the health of California residents and our planet.We at Electrek advocate for clean energy, so of course we think NEM 3.0 is a terrible idea.

That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power.

Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix.

The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2022/01/11,"US electricity generator operators have scheduled 14.9 gigawatts (GW) of electric generating capacity to retire during 2022, and the vast majority of those scheduled retirements – 85% – are coal-fired power plants, reports the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today. UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.Natural gas (8%) and nuclear (5%) trail behind coal in planned retirements:After substantial retirements (11 GW per year on average) of US coal-fired electric generating capacity from 2015 to 2020, coal retirements in 2021 slowed to 4.6 GW.However, 12.6 GW of coal capacity is scheduled to retire in 2022. That’s 6% of the coal-fired generating capacity that was operating at the end of 2021.In a report released yesterday, independent research provider the Rhodium Group writes that coal made a comeback in 2021 – jumping 17% after the pandemic slump of 2020. That was the first annual increase in coal generation since 2014.Coal’s rebound was driven largely by a rise in natural gas prices. The report states:Prices rose as oil and gas producers ramped down new production in 2021 in response to the COVID oil price collapse and ensuing slow growth in demand …… Renewables continued their growth in 2021, with generation rising 4% (about half the rate of renewables growth in 2020), reaching 20% of US electricity generation for the first time.The EIA continues:Most of the plants making up the operating US coal fleet were built in the 1970s and 1980s. US coal plants are retiring as the coal fleet ages and as coal-fired generators face increasing competition from natural gas and renewables.The good news is that the 2021 coal rise was temporary in the US. As Electrek reported in October via the EIA:The electric power sector has retired about 30% of its generating capacity at coal plants since 2010, and no new coal-fired capacity has come online in the United States since 2013. In addition, coal stocks at US power plants are relatively low, and production at operating coal mines has not been increasing as rapidly as the recent increase in coal demand.Clean energy is going to be the leading source of all US electricity by 2030. Let’s just hope that’s fast enough.Read more:",solar
2022/01/10,"Offshore wind power needs energy storage and power regulation, and Ocean Grazer has invented an offshore energy storage system that will sit at the bottom of the sea and manage the flow of electricity through the power grid. The Dutch startup showcased their new product, Ocean Battery, at CES in Las Vegas last week.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.Ocean Grazer, a spin-off of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, asserts that Ocean Battery is “almost maintenance-free and even enhances marine life.”Ocean Battery is an energy storage system that is installed in the seabed and paired with offshore wind farms. It does not require rare earth materials and uses clean water as the energy carrier. The Ocean Battery allows utilities to transform offshore wind farms into dispatchable power generators using hydro dam technology. It can reduce local peak loads in the network and match supply and demand. Ocean Grazer explains how it works:Ocean Battery is based on hydro dam technology that can be deployed at the source ofpower generation. Excess wind power is routed toward the Ocean Battery that pumps waterfrom its underground reservoirs into the flexible bladders installed at the seabed. Wheneverthere is a demand for power, water is routed through hydro turbines to generate electricityback into the underground reservoirs.Check it out in this video:Ocean Grazer claims that Ocean Battery has an efficiency of around 80% and that it should be able to run unlimited cycles for more than 20 years. The company, which announced on January 6 that it has closed a deal with an angel investor, will deploy an onshore Ocean Battery in the Netherlands by 2023 and aims to have an offshore system in place by 2025.This is very new. It’s also clever. So will it be widely rolled out and adopted? We don’t yet know, but we hope it is. We also don’t scoff at new inventions – we’d rather discover and learn about them. People laughed at Thomas Edison and his lightbulb. Clean energy needs as much innovation as it can get, and we’ll keep an eye on Ocean Grazer’s development.Read more: The world’s largest wind farm will power up before end of 2021Photo: Ocean Grazer",solar
2022/01/05,"Fossil fuel heating is bad for the environment and super expensive right now: Three Democratic legislators wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today asking them to protect consumers from unfairly high energy costs. Geothermal heating is fantastic, but it’s not yet widely available – and it’s still financially out of reach for many. Enter Swedish energy giant Vattenfall with high-temperature heat pumps that can easily replace gas boilers.UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates. Tesla now offers price matching, so it’s important to shop for the best quotes. Click here to learn more and get your quotes. — *ad.Vattenfall and Dutch heating tech company Feenstra will roll out their electric heat pumps first in the Netherlands this year. Vattenfall plans to introduce them to other countries in the future, and is eyeing the UK for its next market.The heat pumps can be directly swapped with conventional gas boilers, which means that there is no additional costly retrofitting beyond the heat pump installation.Vattenfall explains why the new heat pumps are a good fit for houses in the Netherlands and the UK:Many homes in the UK and the Netherlands are currently heated using a central heating boiler that uses natural gas to heat the water, which then flows through a network of pipes and radiators. Alternatives such as an electric heat pump use electricity to pump heat in from the outside air.The drawback with these devices is the cooler water temperature, which usually sits between 45 and 55 degrees Celsius [113 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit]. To allow these heat pumps to work at their most efficient, houses need to have their insulation improved, underfloor heating fitted, or the radiators adapted. Gas boilers and the high temperature heat pump sit between 60 to 80 degrees Celsius [140 to 176 degrees Fahrenheit], meaning that these additional works are not required.…The price of the high-temperature heat pump will be comparable to current low and medium temperature heat pumps, but without the extra cost of retrospective insulation and/or underfloor heating.Mark Anderson, commercial and development director at Vattenfall Heat UK, said:There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to decarbonizing heating. Removing emissions from heating relies on us making better use of waste heat from all sources and installing the right technologies in the correct locations of the country, where they will be most effective and affordable.The UK has set a goal to end the installation of conventional gas boilers by 2035.This is a great solution for households that use gas boilers for heating – I’ve owned many a home in the UK with this system – but of course, the new heat pumps are not a one-size-fits-all solution. These heat pumps might work in US houses that have a radiator system, but some houses in rural New England, for example, run on oil-fueled furnaces that blow hot air through ductwork. So, this is a great step toward eliminating natural gas-fueled heating, but diverse solutions are still needed.Read more: 10 Questions: Geothermal with Dandelion Energy founder Kathy HannunPhoto: Vattenfall",solar
2022/01/04,"Clean energy made up 46% of Germany’s net public power generation in 2021. That was down from 50% in 2020, according to Fraunhofer ISE, the largest solar energy research institute in Europe. Solar PV generation was up 0.7 terawatt-hours (TWh), but the reason clean energy’s share of power declined in 2021 was due to lower wind energy production, at minus 16.1 TWh compared to 2020.Wind, at 113.5 TWh, still contributed the largest share to the public power supply overall in 2021:Lignite-fired (i.e., brown coal) power plants picked up the slack when wind wasn’t strong enough, thus putting it in second place at 99.1 TWh.Nuclear came in at 65.4 TWh – 13.3% of the power supply – but this will drop next year, as Germany shut down three of its last six nuclear power stations on December 31, and the country’s last three nuclear power plants will shut down by the end of 2022. Reuters explains:The [German] government decided to speed up the phasing out of nuclear power following Japan’s Fukushima reactor meltdown in 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami destroyed the coastal plant in the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.When it comes to natural gas, solar, and wind, Clean Energy Wire writes:Gas-fired plants were often pushed out of the market, due to the sharp rise in natural gas prices and had a share of 10.4%. While solar PV and wind – Germany’s two main providers of renewable electricity – complement each other when seen on a monthly basis over one year, the Fraunhofer ISE noted that there will be more solar PV capacity necessary to provide a balanced supply.Unlike other power mix data available, the Energy Charts specifically publish net public electricity generation, which Fraunhofer ISE says corresponds to the electricity mix that “comes out of the socket.” In contrast to gross electricity generation, it does not take into account industry facilities, which are largely fired with conventional power sources like gas and coal, and the power plants’ own consumption.

This large-scale floating wind project will support the existing industrial ecosystem in the Illawarra and facilitate the growth of new industries in the region, including green hydrogen for export and domestic markets such as mobility.Greater Gippsland Offshore Wind Project: A 1.3 GW project that will use bottom-fixed technology and will be located off the coast of the Gippsland region of Victoria, in the Bass Strait. This large-scale offshore wind project builds on the momentum for an accelerated retirement of brown coal projects in the La Trobe Valley and is intended to complement the existing and planned transmission infrastructure in Gippsland.Nick Sankey, BlueFloat Energy’s country manager in Australia, said: The timing of our announcement comes hot on the heels of Australia’s federal government passing legislation that provides a framework for developing offshore wind projects here. This is a pivotal step as the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill 2021 establishes a regulatory scaffold to enable the construction, installation, commissioning, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of offshore electricity infrastructure.The two companies did not indicate a timeline for the three offshore wind projects.Read more: Western Australia plans to build world’s largest clean energy hubPhoto: Emiliano Arano/BlueFloat Energy",solar

They will generate a total of up to 465 megawatts (MW) of electricity and include up to 400 MW of battery storage. The Department of the Interior writes:Together, these renewable energy projects will result in an estimated combined infrastructure investment of $689 million, $5.9 million in annual operational economic benefit and power approximately 132,000 homes. The BLM expects to imminently approve the third solar farm, the 500 MW Oberon, on 2,700 acres of public lands, which will be capable of powering nearly 142,000 homes. It will also be in Riverside County.The three solar farms are the first projects approved under the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) in the desert regions of seven California counties. The Department of the Interior’s website explains what the DRECP is:The DRECP is a collaborative effort between the [Bureau of Land Management], Fish and Wildlife Service, California Energy Commission, and California Department of Fish and Wildlife. To approve these sites for renewable energy projects, the Department and the BLM work with Tribal governments, local communities, state regulators, industry, and other federal agencies. The DRECP is focusing on 10.8 million acres of public lands in desert regions of seven California counties.The BLM also announced this week that it’s soliciting interest for utility-scale solar development on nearly 90,000 acres of public land in Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico.BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning said in a statement:Investing in clean and reliable renewable energy represents the BLM’s commitment for addressing climate change and supports Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025.The Biden administration’s push to put renewables such as solar, wind, and geothermal on federal land is going to boost clean energy advancement. It allows large solar and wind farms to sidestep NIMBYism and zoning laws.With the Build Back Better bill currently in limbo, thanks to fossil-fuel-money beholden senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), this is a productive way for the federal government to keep moving toward the goal of eliminating fossil-fuel emissions in the electricity sector by 2035.Read more: Biden just made more big announcements on energy and climatePhoto: “Solar on Palm Desert Walmart” by Walmart Corporate is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar
2021/12/21,"The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), the largest coal mining union in the US, issued a statement yesterday that said they were “disappointed” in Senator Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) announcement on Sunday that he would not vote in favor of the Build Back Better (BBB) legislation. UMWA International president Cecil E. Roberts urged Manchin to “pass something that will help keep coal miners working, and have a meaningful impact on our members, their families, and their communities.”Yesterday, Electrek reported that Manchin announced on Fox News Sunday that he won’t vote for the Build Back Better Framework, which contains crucial climate change provisions. In addition to expressing concern over inflation and the deficit – both unfounded concerns – he also said that if he can’t “go home and explain it to the people of West Virginia, I can’t vote for it.”So it just got complicated for Manchin – the top recipient overall of oil and gas, mining, and coal money, not just in the Senate, but in all of Congress – when his good friend, UMWA president Roberts, publicly disagreed with Manchin’s lack of support for BBB in a formal statement.""We urge Senator Manchin to revisit his opposition to this legislation and work with his colleagues to pass something that will help keep coal miners working, and have a meaningful impact on our members, their families, and their communities."" https://t.co/6egaNbJWPuLooks like Manchin didn’t explain “it” well enough to the UMWA.Just ponder that for a minute: The coal miners’ union wants Manchin – the chair of the US Energy and Natural Resources Committee – to vote for a bill that earmarked $555 billion for clean energy and transportation incentives over a decade. As in, ditch the coal.As Electrek wrote in April:Even Roberts called for federal support for wind turbines and solar panels to be manufactured in Appalachia, and spells out a plan in the union’s new report (although it still leans heavily on coal).There are items in that bill that benefit the members of the UMWA, and they want those things. Roberts’ statement highlights three items in the Build Back Better legislature that would benefit its members:The bill includes language that would extend the current fee paid by coal companies to fund benefits received by victims of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, or Black Lung. But now that fee will be cut in half, further shifting the burden of paying these benefits away from the coal companies and on to taxpayers.The bill includes language that will provide tax incentives to encourage manufacturers to build facilities in the coalfields that would employ thousands of coal miners who have lost their jobs. We support that and are ready to help supply those plants with a trained, professional workforce. But now the potential for those jobs is significantly threatened.The bill includes language that would, for the first time, financially penalize outlaw employers that deny workers their rights to form a union on the job. This language is critical to any long-term ability to restore the right to organize in America in the face of ramped-up union-busting by employers. But now there is no path forward for millions of workers to exercise their rights at work.Roberts knows that coal is on its way out. He wants to take care of his union members, and he is prepared, for the most part, to pragmatically accept the shift to renewables. He also wants to take care of coal miners who suffer from Black Lung.How ironic that his senator, a Democrat, can’t see the writing on the wall in the way that the coal workers can.West Virginia AFL-CIO president Josh Sword also stated yesterday:The West Virginia AFL-CIO knows, and Senator Manchin should know, how important those provisions are to West Virginians and that’s why he should get back to the table and continue to be part of the discussions.Manchin also apparently, according to the Huffington Post, “told his colleagues that he essentially doesn’t trust low-income people to spend government money wisely.”Maybe Joe Manchin should stop trying to explain things to West Virginians, start listening to his constituency a bit harder, and, let’s be honest: Stop worrying about his own hefty coal income.Read more: The real reason Joe Manchin is sabotaging the US clean energy planPhoto: “Inside Politics Press Breakfast – April 2013 featuring Sen.

2021/12/08,"California-headquartered SunPower (Nasdaq:SPWR) announced today that it’s launched SunPower Financial, which means that customers working with SunPower to buy rooftop solar and storage no longer need a third-party lender to obtain and manage financing.SunPower claims that it’s now the first and only solar provider to give US homeowners a one-stop shop for the purchase of solar and storage, including design, sales, installation, financing, and warranty. A key aim of the launch of its financial arm is to expand access to residential solar for lower-income customers.SunPower Financial enables homeowners to purchase solar with no down payment required, lower monthly payments, higher limits, and a faster application process. It also offers 0% APR for up to 25 years for qualified residential solar and storage customers in select regions.Key advantages for qualified customers include:SunPower’s new financial products are available from today for the purchase of the SunPower Equinox solar system and SunVault battery storage. SunPower Financial will become the primary provider of financing for SunPower’s dealer network, beginning in six states representing over 75% of SunPower’s US home solar market.No down payment, 0% APR. It’s kind of a no-brainer, isn’t it? A high upfront cost for rooftop solar installation is one of the leading reasons cited by homeowners for not going solar, and this plan makes solar more accessible to more people. SunPower’s in-house financing takes the confusion and complication out of going solar.Think of it as when one purchases or leases a car. When I leased my Tesla Model 3, I didn’t have to arrange external financing. It was all included in my leasing process, and that instilled confidence in me and made the whole experience so much easier.

The addition of new clean energy capacity is forecast to rise to 290 gigawatts (GW) in 2021.The IEA writes:By 2026, global renewable electricity capacity is forecast to rise more than 60% from 2020 levels to over 4,800 GW – equivalent to the current total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. Renewables are set to account for almost 95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026, with solar PV alone providing more than half. The amount of renewable capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50% higher than from 2015 to 2020. This is driven by stronger support from government policies and more ambitious clean energy goals announced before and during the COP26 Climate Change Conference.Rising costs of fossil fuels are also making clean energy more competitive.When it comes to solar and wind, the IEA reports:Solar PV remains the powerhouse of growth in renewable electricity, with its capacity additions forecast to increase by 17% in 2021 to a new record of almost 160 GW. In the same time frame, onshore wind additions are set to be almost one-quarter higher on average than during the 2015-20 period. Total offshore wind capacity is forecast to more than triple by 2026.In regards to the four markets that make up 80% of clean energy expansion worldwide:IEA executive director Fatih Birol said of India and China:The growth of renewables in India is outstanding, supporting the government’s newly announced goal of reaching 500 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030 and highlighting India’s broader potential to accelerate its clean energy transition.China continues to demonstrate its clean energy strengths, with the expansion of renewables suggesting the country could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030.The IEA then recommends how countries can spur further renewable growth, because despite record-breaking growth, it’s still not enough to meet Paris Agreement targets of net zero by 2050:Governments can further accelerate the growth of renewables by addressing key barriers, such as permitting and grid integration challenges, social acceptance issues, inconsistent policy approaches, and insufficient remuneration. High financing costs in the developing world are also a major obstacle. In the report’s accelerated case, which assumes some of these hurdles are overcome, average annual renewable capacity additions are one-quarter higher in the period to 2026 than is forecast in the main case.However, even this faster deployment would still fall well short of what would be needed in a global pathway to net zero emissions by mid-century. That would require renewable power capacity additions over the period 2021-26 to average almost double the rate of the report’s main case. It would also mean growth in biofuels demand averaging four times higher than in the main case, and renewable heat demand almost three times higher.Read more: IEA zero emissions roadmap’s bombshell: no new fossil-fuel investment beyond 2021",solar

2021/11/26,"Australia has the world’s highest uptake of rooftop solar, but it also has a huge dependency on coal. And the country just threw open the door to another clean energy source: offshore wind. On Thursday, its Parliament passed a law that establishes a regulatory framework for offshore wind power.The Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill 2021 allows the government to designate areas in commonwealth waters more than three miles offshore for wind energy development. And its companion bill, the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure (Regulatory Levies) Bill 2021, “imposes an offshore electricity infrastructure levy on offshore electricity infrastructure license holders or those engaging in offshore infrastructure activities prescribed by regulations.”These two new laws allow projects such as the 2.2 gigawatt offshore wind farm Star of the South off the coast of Victoria, which is expected to start construction in 2025, and Sun Cable, which will deliver solar power using an undersea cable from the Northern Territory to Singapore, to proceed. They also present a huge opportunity to launch further projects around Australia’s 16,000 miles of coastline.Star of the South CEO Casper Frost Thorhauge said in a statement:This bill is a major milestone in kick-starting a new industry, realizing Australia’s offshore wind potential and unlocking jobs and economic benefits for regional Australia.Australia’s Minister for Industry, Energy, and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said:This legislation will accelerate a number of key projects already under development – projects that include the Star of the South, Sun Cable, and the Marinus Link transmission line, which will connect the mainland to Tasmania’s Battery of the Nation project, strengthening reliability and helping to keep the lights on and energy prices low.Combined, these three proposals, Marinus Link, Star of the South, and Sun Cable, are estimated to be worth over $10 billion and create over 10,000 direct and indirect job opportunities.As Electrek reported on November 12, Australia earned the booby prize from Climate Action Network activists at COP26 – what the group called the “colossal fossil” award – for Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government’s climate inaction and support for fossil fuels. Australia currently gets 53% of its power from coal, 21% from gas, and 9% each from wind and solar. Hydro provides 6%, and 4% is other, according to Bloomberg NEF.It’s been the actions of individual households, not Morrison’s government, that have put the country in its leadership position for rooftop solar.And as climate scientist Michael Mann pointedly said to a government official on 60 Minutes Australia, “The cost of climate inaction far outweighs the modest cost of taking action.”Embracing offshore wind is great news out of Australia, but that has to be coupled with firm plans to phase out coal and natural gas. When we hear the Land Down Under is doing the latter, we’ll get excited.Read more: Australia to host the latest world’s largest solar farmPhoto: ØrstedUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

Farmington Solar LLC is a subsidiary of NextEra. The 300,000-panel solar farm sits on 500 acres of leased land on Route 2 in the town of Farmington. The land belongs to a dairy farmer, who, according to the Farmington Solar website, “lost his milk buyer, and has had to downsize his herd considerably. By leasing his land to the Farmington Solar Project, [the farmer] will be able to make up much of that lost income, putting his family in a much improved financial situation.”The project will net the town about $20 million in taxes during the course of the 30-year agreement.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/11/12,"The COP26, aka the United Nations Climate Change Conference UK 2021, has officially finished in Glasgow. But the final agreement has not yet been put in place, and that will likely come over the weekend. Here’s Electrek‘s daily roundup of the key happenings at the world’s most important summit ever.The COP26 summit is “officially” over, but in reality, this is the most vital stage. The 6 p.m. deadline for talks to finish has passed, which everyone expected, since there is not yet an agreement in place. The second draft wasn’t ambitious enough. Expect negotiations to continue until as late as Sunday.Coming up with more money for countries that are at greatest risk from climate change is key to securing a deal.COP26 president Alok Sharma said:We have come a long way over the past two weeks and now we need that final injection of that ‘can-do’ spirit, which is present at this COP, so we get this shared endeavor over the line.A leaflet lying outside the national delegation offices at #COP26. pic.twitter.com/KuI2ttIFjzClimate Action Network activists have awarded Australia the first-place “colossal fossil” award.  The organization wrote on its website:…at every turn, [Australian prime minister] Scott Morrison and his band of merry fossil fools either failed to sign up to a progressive phase-out pledge or made an announcement that was better suited to an oil, gas and coal convention.The ultimate🏆#FossiloftheDay Awards🏆 go to…🇦🇺Australia COLOSSAL FOSSIL for no ambition + fossil fuel expansion🇺🇸US – 2nd for domestic coal, oil & gas🇬🇧UK – 3rd for making #COP26 NOT ""the most inclusive COP ever""ALL: Ignored #LossandDamage financehttps://t.co/SL0ybtYZPA pic.twitter.com/XxLdQjEfzDUS climatologist Michael Mann detailed why Australia blew it on 60 Minutes Australia:Australia has been ranked last among 60 countries on climate change policy in the annual Climate Change Performance Index report. In the wake of the Black Summer bushfires, climatologist @MichaelEMann faced off with Barnaby Joyce on #60Mins over the government’s climate inaction. pic.twitter.com/ieSDJkUkt3And sadly, the US was ranked second due to its refusal to give up its own fossil fuel habit, and the UK –the COP26 host – came in third, for not being very inclusive.Hundreds of representatives of what the Guardian describes as “farmers, Indigenous people, youth, women, academics, trade unions, and environmental NGOs” walked out of Glasgow’s convention center this morning to protest what they feel has not been an inclusive summit.They carried red ribbons to symbolize the red lines crossed by COP26 negotiations.Negotiations continue among ministers representing nearly 200 countries. COP26 chairman Alok Sharma said, “There is still much more work to be done… negotiations on finance really need to accelerate. And they need to accelerate now.” (Don’t be surprised if the negotiations go beyond end-of-day tomorrow.)UN chief Antonio Guterres said today that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C was “is still in reach but on life support,” with COP26 talks so far not reaching any of the UN’s goals, which are: Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach; Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats; and [fully] Mobilize finance.The #ClimateAction struggle requires all hands on deck. It is everyone’s responsibility.  Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution must radically, credibly & verifiably reduce their emissions & decarbonize their portfolios starting now. #COP26Cities Day saw £27.5 million (€32 million) from the UK to “for the new Urban Climate Action Programme (UCAP) to support cities targeting net zero,” states the COP26 website. It continues: The program, funded through International Climate Finance, will support cities across Africa, Asia and Latin America to take climate action and create a sustainable future, by helping them implement innovative climate action plans to become carbon neutral by 2050 and prepare low-carbon infrastructure projects to reduce emissions. Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions, said:Climate change is a challenge that can’t be solved by federal governments alone.It will also take cities and states, businesses and universities, tribal nations and faith organisations, and everyone in between – because this is an all-hands-on-deck situation.Denmark and Costa Rica launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance to phase out fossil fuels. Or, in the group’s words, “to facilitate the managed phase-out of oil and gas production.”France, Greenland, Ireland, Quebec, Sweden, and Wales joined the alliance. There are also some fringe members who are classified as “associates” and “friends.” Meet the members of the #BeyondOilAndGasAlliance🌏. We are thrilled to announce the membership of Quebec, France🇫🇷, Sweden🇸🇪, Ireland🇮🇪, Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 & Greenland🇬🇱 as Core Members and California, Portugal🇵🇹 & New Zealand🇳🇿 as Associate Members and Italy🇮🇹 as Friends of #BOGA #COP26 pic.twitter.com/I6roWkAVQdRomain Ioualalen of Oil Change International said [via Euronews]:The creation of this alliance puts to shame claims of climate leadership among countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, all of which have yet to answer this simple question: Where is your plan to stop producing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis?If this alliance can convince more countries and regions to join, isolates laggards, and pushes its members towards more ambition, then it will be a success.As my colleague Fred Lambert wrote earlier today, “several major countries and automakers agreed to set a new goal to go all-electric by 2040.” But what’s notable and disappointing is who didn’t get on the bandwagon. As CNN points out:Germany, China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States did not sign the declaration. Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, and Nissan also refrained from signing.Here’s who did agree to the goal, as per CNN:Ford and General Motors agreed, as did Jaguar Land Rover Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. Among countries, US states, and cities that signed up were the UK, Canada, Poland, Kenya, India, Australian Capital Territory, Catalonia, Atlanta, San Diego, New York City, San Francisco, and Seoul.Just before the day ended, China and the US announced they would work together to address the climate crisis. This is very good news, since the two countries are the world’s top emitters.""A journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.""US Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry tells the COP26 summit the US and China will work together to lower greenhouse gas emissions because “cooperation is the only way to get this job done”. pic.twitter.com/jR6JIy4tGSYou can read the statement in full by clicking this US State Department link, but here’s an excerpt:The United States and China, alarmed by reports including the Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report released on August 9th, 2021, further recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis. They are committed to tackling it through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s, as well as through cooperation in multilateral processes, including the UNFCCC process, to avoid catastrophic impacts. The two sides intend to cooperate on: Regulatory frameworks and environmental standards related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the 2020s; Maximizing the societal benefits of the clean energy transition; Policies to encourage decarbonization and electrification of end-use sectors;  Key areas related to the circular economy, such as green design and renewable resource utilization; andDeployment and application of technology such as CCUS and direct air capture.The draft agreement, which is currently seven pages, is the most important document that will come out of COP26 and will contain decisions and resolutions that build on the Paris Agreement. The Guardian notes:The key aim for Cop26 is to “keep 1.5C alive”. There are a few notable victories in this text: a mention of phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies – the first time that has appeared in a COP decision – and strong language on the scientific imperative to stay within 1.5C of global heating. But whether this text is enough to achieve that overarching goal is still up for debate.Katie White, the executive director of campaigns at WWF, said: “It’s essential that we recognize this as the start line, not the finish. If we are to come close to reaching our 1.5C target in time, ambition and momentum need to accelerate across the board.”The Guardian’s environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, annotates the actual document here. As the headline states, she looks at “what it says and what it means.” Check it out.Because climate change disproportionately affects women and girls. According to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, women and children make up 80% of people displaced by climate change.The US notably pledged $14 million to the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund, and and $3 million investment to help women farmers in East Africa adapt to climate impacts. There were also actions to put gender at the forefront of climate action by Bolivia, Canada, Germany, Nigeria, the UK, and others, which you can read about here.Ministers have been paired up (one from a wealthy country and one from a developing country) to oversee negotiations on each topic that will form part of COP26’s cover deal. UK COP26 president Alok Sharma said:The transition to a resilient zero carbon economy is technologically possible, it is economically attractive and it is accelerating everywhere. And if we successfully manage this will deliver immense benefits for the world.Building on existing mechanisms; transparency and accountability must be at the heart of these commitments. So overnight the Presidency will publish the first draft of the Cover Decision. It will likely require negotiating teams to consult their leaders and capitals.We have an urgency to our negotiations so I ask ministers and negotiators to carry out these consultations expeditiously.The Guardian reported:COP26 delegates expressed unease about the lack of progress made in discussions, with only four days to go before the official end of the conference. “Everything is still to play for but there’s a long way to go,” said Tracy Carty, climate change policy and advocacy lead at Oxfam.A sobering report from Cologne-based think tank Climate Action Tracker states:Under current policies, we estimate end-of-century warming to be 2.7C. While this temperature estimate has fallen since our September 2020 assessment, major new policy developments are not the driving factor. The current 2030 targets (without long-term pledges) put us on track for a 2.4C temperature increase by the end of the century.CAT global update: Glasgow has a credibility gap between talk and action. If all govts met their 2030 targets, we would have 2.4˚C of warming in 2100. But right now, current policies put us at 2.7˚C. https://t.co/dkX4jAbo2f A Thread 🧵 pic.twitter.com/EdLlIfdhXtProfessor Niklas Hohne of the NewClimate Institute recommended at a press conference today that COP’s targets be reviewed annually instead of every five years.Ministers are arriving in Glasgow today to start very tough negotiations about issues such as deadlines, how to hold each other accountable, and international carbon markets. Around 200 countries must reach a consensus on the rules that will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Euronews points out:No deals have been made yet on the three main goals of the UN — pledges to cut emissions in half by 2030 to keep the Paris climate deal’s 1.5C temperature rise goal alive; the need for $100 billion annually in financial help from rich countries to poor ones; and the idea that half of that money goes to adapting to global warming’s worst effects.In a speech at #COP26, former U.S. President Barack Obama lambasted those who would play politics to avoid acting on climate change, calling out Russia and China in the same breath as Republican politicians back home https://t.co/ZYUn5n3E8q pic.twitter.com/3dHxJXVbHcFormer US president Barack Obama addressed the delegates at COP26. He said that while progress has been made:We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more.Obama criticized China and Russia for not attending COP26, and also stated that US Republicans have shown “active hostility” to climate science. He called for heads of state and activists to not give in to cynicism. (Around 100,000 protesters marched through Glasgow on Saturday.) Climate scientist Michael Mann made the point about cynicism on Friday on Twitter:Beware of the slippery slope from cynicism to nihilism. It leads to the same place as denialism: inaction.Which is precisely what polluters and those doing their bidding want.  #COP26 #ClimateAction #ConstructiveEngagementGlobally, the people who have polluted the least are impacted the most.On Adaptation and Loss and Damage Day, $232 million was committed to the Adaptation Fund, which was created in 2001 under the Kyoto protocol and helps developing countries build resilience and adapt to climate change. It’s the highest single mobilization to the fund and more than double the previous highest collective mobilization. Commitments came from from the US, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Italy, Qatar, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the Quebec and Flanders governments.88 countries are now covered by Adaptation Communications or National Adaptation Plans to increase preparedness to climate risks, with 38 published in the last year.Thousands of children, parents, and teachers took to the streets to demand that global leaders ramp up and implement their pledges to slow global warming and honor the Paris Agreement. It was organized by international climate movement Fridays for Future. Further, the views of more than 40,000 young climate leaders were presented to officials at a meeting today.#COP26 #Glasgow pic.twitter.com/UrUg0h4ee8Swedish activist Greta Thunberg isn’t impressed with what’s happened at COP26 this week. She called COP26 a “greenwash festival” and accused leaders of creating loopholes:Climate activist @GretaThunberg addresses crowd at #FridaysForFuture protest during #COP26 pic.twitter.com/2wpM9GN4ZMUS climate envoy John Kerry said the $100 billion promised by wealthy nations to developed nations will be delivered in 2022. That’s a year earlier than expected, but two years late overall. Better late than never? We’ll see.Kerry said:That means for 2022 we now have the full $100 billion we wanted to have, and $100 billion going forward, so we take that issue off the table and that changes the dynamics.Kerry also said today to the press:Let me emphasise as strongly as I can: Job not done. The first part of the job of codifying the urgency will hopefully be done. But that’s just the beginning. This is a decade-long race. We do know that we could have a critical mass of countries moving in a way that keeps [1.5 degrees] alive. This was never going to be done in one week.If – and only if – the week’s commitments were actually delivered, then it could result in 40% of the emissions cuts needed by 2030 to keep the world on track to 1.5C of global warming, ie, the Paris Agreement goal. That’s according to an initial analysis by the Energy Transition Commission.However, global emissions are on track to rise by 13.7% by 2030, according to an updated UN analysis. Damien Carrington of the Guardian pointed out:The glimmer of good news is that the projected rise in 2030 emissions is down from 16% two weeks ago, after 14 new national pledges were included.As former US vice president Al Gore rightly stated, “Much remains to be done,” but “much has been achieved already, some of it in the form of pledges,” and that it was job of COP26 officials to ensure the pledges were carried out.Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), announced on Twitter today that, according to IEA analysis, if all the new COP26 pledges by countries to cut emissions are implemented, along with 90 countries’ plans to reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030, then global temperature rise could be limited to 1.8C. (The goal is 1.5C.)Stress the word could. It’s based on actual implementation, and time will tell. Because, as expected, global emissions have shot back up to record levels before the pandemic.Higher climate targets are promising, but will the pledges be fully implemented on time?Proud that the UK @COP26 Presidency asked @IEA to lead the tracking of progress against these pledges, drawing on our years of policy expertiseOur new analysis 👉 https://t.co/um9CbJt9mb pic.twitter.com/H29cvgxPcW28 countries today made new commitments to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) in order to phase out coal power, bringing the total number of members to 165.Ukraine committed to end coal power by 2035, and that’s a really big deal, because it has the third-largest coal fleet in Europe after Germany and Poland. Singapore became the first country in Asia to join the PPCA, and Chile also joined.20 new countries, including Vietnam, Poland, and Morocco, committed to building no new coal-fired power plants. You can read PPCA’s full announcement here.Canada, the US, and 18 other countries today pledged to stop public financing for all fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022, and invest in clean energy instead. So that means not only coal, but also gas and oil.Reuters notes:Countries that signed the pledge together invested nearly $18 billion on average each year in international fossil fuel projects from 2016-2020, according to analysis by nonprofit Oil Change International.Enormous investment in green technologies is needed for the task. Bernstein analysts estimate the required low-carbon investments at roughly $2-4 trillion per year until 2050.China, Japan, and South Korea committed to stop overseas funding for coal in a pledge earlier this year made by all G20 countries, but the three Asian countries were not part of the group of 20 who pledged today to stop financing for oil and gas as well. The world’s largest banks and pension funds – over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion – committed to a pledge known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). The pledge states that by 2050, all assets managed by the institutions will be aligned with net zero emissions. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak today announced new requirements for firms to publish net zero transition plans setting out how they will decarbonize through 2050. (Not sure how he’s going to enforce that.)Steve Trent, founder and CEO of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said in an email:Sunak’s net-zero disclosure rules for financial institutions are a first step towards turning off the tap on climate chaos, but they contain some deeply worrying loopholes.We need rules which force financial institutions to stop funding fossil fuels completely, we can’t keep kicking the can down the road on fossil fuel divestment. It’s not enough to publish ‘net zero by 2050’ plans if those plans rely on creative carbon accounting over real decarbonization across the whole of our economies.GFANZ says it “can deliver the estimated $100 trillion of finance needed for net zero over the next three decades.” As per usual, and rightfully so, everyone wants to see GFANZ put their money where their mouth is. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who is leading GFANZ, tweeted:Make no mistake: the 💰 is now there if the 🌎 truly wants to arrest the #climatecrisis Today, through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero #GFANZ, over $130 trillion of capital from 450+ firms across 45 countries is committed to transforming the economy #COP26Researchers at the University of Melbourne found that if COP26 emissions reduction plans are actually carried out, then it would limit global temperature rises to below 2C – the first time the world has gone in the right direction. India’s and China’s recent pledges, even though they miss the 2050 target, would actually make a huge difference. The authors wrote:For the first time in history, the aggregate effect of the combined pledges by 194 countries might bring the world to below 2 degrees warming with more than a 50% chance.So, COP26 delegates, doing what you say you’re gonna do thing is kind of important.Ed Miliband, shadow business secretary for the UK’s Labour party, said [to and via the Guardian]:Any progress is welcome but we need extreme caution about declaring success on the basis of vague and often vacuous net zero targets three or more decades hence. For example Australia has a 2050 net zero target but its 2030 plans are in line with 4 degrees of warming. There is a reason for the focus on halving emissions this decisive decade. It reflects the urgency, clarity, and specificity we need to keep 1.5C alive. We cannot allow political leaders to shift the goalposts.Leading an alliance of 90 countries including Brazil for the first time, US president Joe Biden unveiled a plan to cut global methane emissions 30% by 2030. The Guardian notes:The alliance includes two-thirds of the global economy and half of the top 30 major methane emitter countries. China, India, and Russia have not joined the pact known as the Global Methane Pledge.The pledge was first announced in September but Biden’s officials have since been working hard to increase the number of signatories and the momentum behind the pledge. The detailed US proposals may prove to be one of the lasting successes of the Cop26 climate conference being held in Glasgow.The US also rejoined the High Ambition Coalition, the group of countries that ensured the 1.5C goal was a key part of the Paris Agreement.More than 100 nations pledged to cut methane gas emissions as part of efforts to contain global warming, U.S. President Joe Biden told delegates at the U.N. #COP26 climate conference https://t.co/tTNojcEoFs pic.twitter.com/KxZAXUpksK110 world leaders have unveiled a major deal that aims to stop and reverse global deforestation. That included Brazil, which has a terrible track record of Amazon deforestation in recent years.The countries who have signed the pledge also include Canada, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK. Together, that includes around 85% of the world’s forests.The pledge includes more than $19 billion of public and private funds. The announcement was welcomed, but experts, environmental groups, and – well, pretty much everyone – want to see real action, not just talk. Here’s a profile of deforestation in Madagascar, which has lost 40% of its forest cover as the result of poverty:African countries say they will spend at least $6 billion a year from tax revenues to adapt to the impacts of climate change. They are calling on wealthy countries to provide $2.5 billion a year for the next five years to help them to meet their goals. Nigeria, Africa’s largest crude oil producer, pledged to reach net zero by 2060. Africa is responsible for just 3% of global emissions, yet is seen as the most vulnerable region to climate change. Reuters writes:“The world promised $100 billion. The world promised more money for adaptation.

The Guardian rounded up highlights of those speeches in one video:Biden reiterated that the US will reduce carbon emissions by 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. Biden’s big Build Back Better bill, which contains climate change actions, has not yet been passed though the US Congress.We will demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of our example.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gave a pre-recorded speech (he wasn’t in attendance) in which what he said completely contradicted the country’s recent actions:Brazil is a green powerhouse. When it comes to fighting climate change, we have always been part of the solution, not the problem.Yet Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions rose 9.5% in 2020, and deforestation hit a 12-year high in Brazil’s Amazon in 2020.Brazil’s environment minister Joaquim Leite said the country would cut its emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, which is boosted from 43%. Leite also said that Brazil would formalize a commitment to become climate neutral by 2050 during COP26.AlJazeera notes, “Advocacy group Climate Observatory said that a 50% reduction was still weaker than the 43% commitment using the pre-Bolsonaro baseline, meaning Brazil had not, in reality, increased its ambition.”Environmentalists see Bolsonaro’s speech as a greenwash.One notable absence at #COP26 this week is Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro who instead spoke in a pre-recorded video saying Brazil is part of the solution, not the problem when it comes to climate change. https://t.co/VP0aI9CbF5India prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India will meet a target of net zero by 2070.

2021/11/12,"A consortium of Belgian dredging company Deme Group and Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian Group has been awarded a $1.1 billion contract by Dominion Energy Virginia to help build what will be the largest offshore wind farm in the US, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project.Prysmian in particular has secured the largest-ever awarded submarine cable contract in the US, and the consortium agreement is the largest offshore wind installation contract awarded in the US to date. Upon expected completion in 2026, the 176-turbine, 2.6-gigawatt CVOW will be one of the largest offshore wind farms in the world. It will be capable of providing energy for 660,000 households and will reduce carbon emissions by over two million tons per year.Here’s what Deme’s role will be:DEME Offshore’s CVOW BoP contract includes the transport and installation of 176 monopile transition piece foundations, three offshore substations, scour protection and the supply and installation of export and inter-array submarine cable systems. DEME Offshore will oversee the complete offshore installation works for the foundations, substations, infield cables, as well as part of the export cables. And this is what Prysmian’s role will be:Prysmian Group will provide three 3-core 220kV HVAC export cables measuring approximately 62 km each, with XLPE insulation and single-wire armoring, for a total of approximately 560 km. The Company will also supply 320 km of 3-core 66kV offshore inter-array cables with XLPE insulation.The export cables will be produced in Arco Felice, Italy, and Pikkala, Finland, while the inter-array cables will be manufactured in Nordenham, Germany. Last week, Dominion Energy disclosed that CVOW is going to cost more than they originally anticipated. In 2019, the utility said it’d cost around $8 billion. Now it says it will cost a bit closer to $10 billion.Bob Blue, president and CEO of Dominion Energy, said, “The cost increase can be attributed to, among other things, commodity and general cost pressures as seems to be the case across a number of industries right now.”CVOW is the only US offshore wind farm that’s owned by a “state-regulated utility that plans to place the cost burden on its ratepayers, as well as earn a profit from the regulated return on the investment,” according to E&E News.Read more: The US is getting its first offshore wind blade factoryPhoto: Deme GroupUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/11/11,"On November 2, Republicans won elections in Virginia for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and the GOP has likely just squeaked past Democrats to take control of the House of Delegates. Does that mean that the majority of Virginians align with the Republican Party’s disinterest in transitioning to clean energy and electric vehicles?A new report released today by Charlottesville-based clean energy nonprofit Generation180, “Virginia Drives Electric 2021,” found that most Virginians support a transition to clean energy sources and investing in modernizing and electrifying Virginia’s transportation sector. And support is growing.The report’s findings are consistent with national opinion polling:  According to a Yale survey, 70% of Americans support the US economy moving away from fossil fuels to 100% clean energy by 2050.The representative statewide survey of 1,211 Virginians found that: Despite support from the majority of Virginians, will Virginia’s current clean energy plan be derailed by fossil-fuel supporter Glenn Youngkin, the incumbent governor? E&E News reports, “[A]t a recent TV appearance, [Youngkin] wouldn’t say whether human activity has caused climate change, has said he wants to slow down the energy plan, and warned at a debate it would lead to “blackouts and brownouts and an unreliable energy grid.”Stuart Gardner, director of Generation180’s Electrify Your Ride campaign, told Electrek:Our recent statewide survey indicates Virginians widely support clean energy and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, transportation modernization was not a key topic during the recent governor’s race.  However, I’m optimistic the Commonwealth can continue the momentum, because regardless of your politics, clean energy and EVs make sense for Virginia. Revitalizing the Commonwealth’s transportation sector ensures Virginia is making the investments necessary to attract economic investment, protect the public’s health, and preserve our climate.  William Shobe, director of the Energy Transition Initiative at the University of Virginia, told E&E News:In the time frame available for the next governor, I don’t see huge changes.Virginia is on its way to decarbonizing and that’s unlikely to change, at least in the short run.

2021/11/05,"Norwegian wind giant Equinor is not only pulling out of what would be the Atlantic’s first floating offshore wind farm, it’s also pulling out of doing business in Ireland altogether.In 2019, Equinor partnered with the Irish utility Electricity Supply Board (ESB). In April, they jointly announced they would build a €2 billion ($2.3 billion) 1.4-GW floating offshore wind farm off the Clare and Kerry coasts, the Atlantic Ocean’s first offshore wind farm, as Electrek reported. The plan was to turn Moneypoint coal power station in Clare – Ireland’s only coal-fired power station – into a multibillion-euro green energy hub. It was expected to be online within the next 10 years and would supply power to more than 1.6 million Irish homes, according to ESB.But Equinor has pulled out of the project, and out of Ireland. According to the Irish Examiner, Equinor has abandoned wind plans in Ireland due to “dissatisfaction with the regulatory and planning regime.” In other words, red tape.An Equinor spokesperson told the Examiner, “We won’t comment in detail on how much the regulatory process was involved in the company decision.” The Examiner called Equinor’s departure a “major blow” for offshore wind energy production.Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath told Irish radio station Newstalk:There is a need to change the regulatory and the planning system. We are doing that. We have legislation going through the Oireachtas [legislature] at the moment – The Maritime Area Planning Bill, which for the first time will have a dedicated system in place to address planning issues in respect of all maritime matters, including offshore renewable energy.We will be backing that up with investment. We will have a renewable energy auction next year in this area and we do expect by 2025 we will see actual offshore renewable developments in place.McGrath shrugged off Equinor’s departure, saying, “I wouldn’t be too perturbed by that particular development,” because he asserted that there are many companies eager to get into the Irish wind market.Irish wind industry representative body Wind Energy Ireland CEO Noel Cunniffe said [via the Examiner]:We are sorry to see one of the world’s leading energy companies pulling out of Ireland, but it is important to remember we still have some of the best offshore wind energy resources in the world and a growing pipeline of projects.But this decision simply underlines what we have been saying for some time. We are not reforming Ireland’s planning and regulatory framework quickly enough to develop the offshore wind we will need to meet the targets in the Climate Action Plan.This is leading to a lack of confidence in the industry and our international supply chain that Government must address.Ireland’s goal is to source 80% of its electricity from clean energy by 2030. UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/11/03,"SolarReviews, a US-based independent comparison website for solar panel brands and installations, has released its first solar manufacturer ranking system. Here are the top 10 solar panel manufacturers in 2021.The scoring methodology was developed by a committee of industry experts to rate the 20 most popular solar panel brands in the US in 2021, based on SolarReviews.com consumer reviews. The scoring methodology’s aim is to provide consumers with a long-term outlook of solar panel brand performance and value. It recognizes that some solar panels have 25-year warranties, yet consumer reviews are often created within the first year of installation.The Solar Panel Manufacturer Scoring System analyzed hundreds of data points drawn from solar panel spec sheets, company financial statements, and state-level government statistics to score each solar panel brand. The rankings take the following factors into account:Value (30%). Solar panels’ high upfront cost deters many homeowners from switching to solar, so cost is a significant factor.Module quality (20%). The spec sheet performance of each company’s top residential solar panel, specifically its efficiency rating and temperature coefficients, was assessed. Panels that take up less space and perform more consistently in different environmental conditions earned a higher score.Financial visibility and strength (20%). The financial health of the solar panel manufacturer serves as the best indicator of whether the company will be in existence to honor warranty claims that may arise.Warranty (10%). Both the product and performance warranty were considered. The product warranty reflects the reliability of the module, and the performance warranty assessment evaluates how panel performance will hold up with each passing year.US investment (10%). How committed each brand is to the US market.Dealer network (10%): The availability of the brand among solar installers, thus ensuring availability for US customers.Andy Sendy, founder and president of SolarReviews.com, said:The US solar market is made up of hundreds of solar panel brands of varying price points and value. Consumers are often faced with the challenging task of balancing the upfront cost of panels and the longevity of the solar system to ensure long-term savings are realized. The “Best Solar Manufacturers of 2021” list was developed to help consumers understand the solar panels with the best value and performance for the long run. We hope the ranking equips those who turn to solar to shop smarter, and ultimately get the solar system that works best for them.SolarReviews is independent, and putting solar panels on your roof is a smart yet big investment. So this guide is extremely helpful for those folks who are sitting down with their installer rep and deciding on which solar panels to choose.We are personally waiting to see what the outcome of the infrastructure bill is before we push forward on solar panels (we’re currently on community wind with Arcadia), but have already had our consultation.LG Solar being No. 1 was not a huge surprise to me, and based on the above factors, was already in our own household’s No. 1 spot.Read more: Here’s why solar and storage are the perfect pairPhoto: “Three pigeons on a roof” by Dunnock_D is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/11/02,"Norway-headquartered energy giant Equinor has a new floating wind turbine foundation design, and it wants to launch it in a one-gigawatt (GW) Scottish offshore wind farm project.If Equinor is successful in its bid for ScotWind, which is an offshore wind program that will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments up to 10 GW, then it will use its new floating wind turbine foundation design there.Its new design is called the Wind Semi. Equinor says it’s suitable for rough waters, like those off the Scottish coast, and it can “maximize the opportunities for the Scottish supply chain.” Equinor asserts the following about the Wind Semi:Sonja C. Indrebø, Equinor’s vice president of floating offshore wind, said:We are ready to develop the next generation, large-scale commercial floating offshore wind in Scotland. By leveraging our 20 years of floating offshore wind experience and innovations, we plan to develop GW-size floating projects in one single phase. Implementing large scale projects will accelerate Scotland’s energy transition to net zero. At 1GW, this project would be over 30 times bigger than Hywind Scotland, the UK’s and Equinor’s first floating project and have the potential to not only position Scotland as a leader in deep water technology, but also create opportunities for both existing suppliers and new entrants to the offshore wind sector.Hywind Scotland was Equinor’s and the UK’s first floating offshore wind farm, at 30 MW.

2021/10/29,"The Biden administration yesterday released a $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Framework. Despite the cuts that were made to the original $3.5 trillion proposal, it still includes significant investments in clean energy policy. Here’s what’s still in there.Investments in clean energy and fighting climate change include $320 billion for clean energy tax credits, $105 billion for resilience investments, $110 billion for clean energy technology, manufacturing, and supply chain investments and incentives, and $20 billion for clean energy procurement. So that’s a total of $555 billion.After a whole lot of horse-trading in Washington (and it ain’t over til it’s over), the White House website stated, “President Biden is confident this is a framework that can pass both houses of Congress, and he looks forward to signing it into law.” (We at Electrek will believe it when we see it – and we want to see it.)The White House website gives an overview of what will happen for clean energy if Congress passes the bill in the Framework:Deliver substantial consumer rebates and ensure middle-class families save money as they shift to clean energy and electrification. The consumer rebates and credits included in the Build Back Better framework will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs.  These measures include enhancement and expansion of existing home energy and efficiency tax credits, as well as the creation of a new, electrification-focused rebate program.  The framework will cut the cost of installing rooftop solar for a home by around 30%, shortening the payback period by around 5 years… In addition, the framework will help rural communities tap into the clean energy opportunity through targeted grants and loans through the Department of Agriculture.Ensure clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States with American made steel and other materials, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home. The Build Back Better legislation will target incentives to grow domestic supply chains in solar, wind, and other critical industries in communities on the frontlines of the energy transition. In addition, the framework will boost the competitiveness of existing industries, like steel, cement, and aluminum, through grants, loans, tax credits, and procurement to drive capital investment in the decarbonization and revitalization of American manufacturing.Environment America’s Washington Legislative Office executive director Lisa Frank said:The proposed Build Back Better Act would be a game-changer in tackling the climate crisis. It clears the way for our country to more easily tap abundant clean energy from the sun and wind and will usher in a decade of clean energy growth by making renewables less expensive for consumers and businesses. It’s a win-win for Americans and our environment. President Biden and the many, many members of Congress who advocated for clean energy can be very proud of this framework.We urge Congress to move forward as soon as possible with both the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which makes complementary investments in the power grid, clean air, clean water, and electric vehicle infrastructure.Very exciting news! https://t.co/vhfHzGldqGAbigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said:The Build Back Better framework contains the most ambitious and transformational clean energy policies we’ve ever seen from Congress. Climate action cannot wait and it’s time for lawmakers to pass policies that drive clean energy deployment. The plan, which allocates over 30% of the total price tag to climate and clean energy, is the right vehicle for lawmakers to act on.Solar is a job-creator, and the long-term tax incentives for solar, storage and domestic manufacturing will put us on a path to decarbonize the electric grid, reach the President’s 2035 clean energy target, and create hundreds of thousands of quality career opportunities in every community. For the sake of our climate, the economy and American workers, the solar industry is urging Congress to come together and pass this momentous legislation as soon as possible.But North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) took a slightly difference stance. It wants Congress to quit messing around and pass this bill. NABTU president Sean McGarvey said:We as union members and leaders know well that principled negotiations can be difficult but fruitful.  We also know there comes a time to make a deal.  The time for lip service is over.  We are tired of politicians dialing for dollars and booking airtime on cable television instead of doing their job.  Our members show up to work every day and produce.  They expect elected officials to do the same.Deferring the need to address our nation’s infrastructure crisis must stop.  Using this bill, and the millions of working families it impacts, as bargaining chips must stop.  Congress must return to Washington and pass this bill without further delay.Read more: $12,500 electric vehicle incentive survives Biden’s updated ‘Build Back Better’ proposal",solar
2021/10/29,"The Biden administration’s Department of the Interior yesterday announced new actions to build offshore wind farms in the Atlantic, off the coasts of Massachusetts and the Carolinas, and in the Gulf of Mexico.This latest action is part of the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy by 2030 in order to address the climate crisis.The Department of the Interior is proposing an offshore wind auction in a 127,865-acre area off the coast of the Carolinas. The area could be divided into three leases. It has the potential to unlock more than 1.5 GW of offshore wind energy that could power more than a half-million homes.[The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] BOEM will publish a Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) in the Federal Register on Nov. 1, 2021, which will kick off a 60-day comment period ending on 11:59 p.m. ET on Jan. 3, 2022.Any prospective bidders wishing to participate in a Carolina Long Bay lease sale must submit qualification materials postmarked no later than Jan. 3, 2022. BOEM will host an auction seminar to discuss the auction format for prospective bidders.The administration will kick off an environmental review in November for Mayflower Wind, off the coast of Massachusetts, around 30 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard. The wind farm will operate up to 147 turbines and up to five offshore power substations. It will be able to generate more than 2 gigawatts of power, which is enough to power more than 800,000 homes. It will create 14,000 jobs over the project’s lifetime.Mayflower Wind is a joint venture between Ocean Winds and Shell New Energies US LLC, and a joint venture between EDP Renewables and ENGIE.Read more: First major US offshore wind farm approved todayFrom November 1 for 45 days, BOEM is inviting the public to weigh in on possible commercial wind energy leasing in a proposed area in the Gulf of Mexico. The area consists of almost 30 million acres just west of the Mississippi River to the Texas-Mexico border. Reuters explains:The move is an early-stage effort to consider offshore wind in the Gulf, which is home to the nation’s biggest offshore oil and gas drilling industry. Before deciding on whether to lease in the Gulf, BOEM would have to conduct an environmental review and seek input from the public and a government task force set up to consider offshore wind in the region.We at Electrek think these steps forward by the US government to grow US offshore wind are super exciting. It’s doable, and we’re optimistic this is going to happen, but it will likely be a bumpy (boat) ride.There will be the expected NIMBY and fishing industry objections in all regions. Indeed, Mayflower has had plenty of that already from Martha’s Vineyard residents. And the Gulf of Mexico is going to get very interesting, seeing how the fossil-fuel industry has been drilling there since the mid-20th century.The thought of more wind power, and thus clean energy, and less oil spillage, like the mess that occurred as the result of Hurricane Ida in September – or how about no oil spills one day? – is a compelling prospect indeed.Photo: Ørsted",solar
2021/10/27,"COP26, also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference UK 2021, kicks off Sunday October 31, and officially runs until Friday, November 12. It’s being held in Glasgow at the Scottish Event Campus (pictured). Here are five things everyone needs to know about this crucial summit.COP is pronounced “cop,” not C-O-P. The summits have taken place since 1995 – COP1 was held in Berlin. This year’s summit is No. 26, and the global gatherings have grown in size over the years.  In COP26’s own words:For nearly three decades the UN has been bringing together almost every country on earth for global climate summits – called COPs – which stands for “Conference of the Parties.” In that time climate change has gone from being a fringe issue to a global priority.World leaders will arrive in Scotland, alongside tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses, and citizens for 12 days of talks.Nearly 200 countries must work together to fulfill the Paris Agreement promises made at COP21 in 2015, where nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C – ideally, 1.5C – compared to pre-industrial levels. COP26 is the first official deadline since the Paris Agreement.In order to reach a climate-neutral world by 2050, “net zero” – the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere – must be achieved.Actions to limit global warming need to be implemented immediately, so that makes COP26 the most important climate summit ever.Countries must agree legally binding emissions reduction actions, and emerge from the summit with documents that outline concrete actions. Countries need to set new climate commitments ahead of this year’s summit, and well and truly act on those pledges. Even Queen Elizabeth II of Britain is annoyed by the lack of real action: She was caught on a hot mic in mid-October saying, “It’s really irritating when they talk, but they don’t do.”In a phrase, further emissions reductions. Countries who signed the Paris accord agreed to update and strengthen their targets every five years. Targets are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). But current targets aren’t anywhere near where they should be, and in fact, many countries are going in entirely the wrong direction. The world is currently on track for nearly 3C of global warming by 2100, which would have catastrophic environmental, social, and health consequences – and “catastrophic” is not an exaggeration.November 4 is Energy Day, so keep an eye out for new signatories to the UN’s No New Coal pact.November 10 is Transport Day, so look for gas and diesel car ban pledges.UK prime minister Boris Johnson pithily outlined his four aims for COP26 as “cash, cars, coal, and forest.” That means wealthy nations handing over money they already promised years ago to developing nations, ditching gas and diesel cars, stop burning fossil fuels, and planting trees and protecting biodiversity.China, the world’s biggest emitter, recently agreed to stop funding coal plants in other countries, but it still burns coal domestically.Countries’ targets must be backed up by actionable policies, or it’s just going to be a lot of hot air.

2021/10/27,"Italian renewables company Enel Green Power announced today that it’s partnering with Scottish startup ACT Blade, which uses fabric in its wind turbine blades. Enel Green Power explains the technology of ACT Blade’s wind turbine blades. It incorporates textiles that are similar to what boat sails are made of:First of all, the turbine blades are lighter because they have a slender supporting structure made of composite material that is completely covered with the technical fabric. The new blades with the same weight as conventional ones are longer and therefore ensure an increased production of electricity. In addition, the costs are lower thanks to other features, such as a structure that is composed of fewer materials in relation to its length, as well as modular production processes that are simpler and more streamlined, leading to expected savings of up to 17%.ACT Blade’s technology fits perfectly with Enel’s strategy for the circular management of wind farms: maximizing the reuse and recycling of materials and components and applying a circular perspective right from the design phase. In general, the recycling of metals (which make up the majority of a wind turbine) is quite straightforward, while the composite materials used to make up the rotor blades is more complex. So this technology is an interesting option in order to make wind power even more circular and sustainable.The fact that ACT’s blades don’t erode and can be recycled is what piqued Enel Green Energy’s interest, because it’s keen on recycling and reusing wind turbine materials and components in a cost-efficient manner.Nicola Rossi, head of innovation global power generation at Enel Green Energy, explains:We’re constantly looking for innovative solutions that can improve performance and sustainability, starting with the materials used and their life cycles. For this reason, ACT Blade’s technology is extremely interesting for us. We’re collaborating with ACT because we want to support the testing of their product in real environments, and accelerate the startup’s growth and market entryCheck out ACT Blade’s video below, which gives an overview of its wind turbine blades:ACT’s blades are actually already being tested in Glasgow. Sabrina Malpede, a cofounder and CEO of ACT Blade, used to be a competitive sailor, and she applied what she learned in her sport to the startup’s wind turbines. She explains:In July we achieved an important milestone with the installation of three blades, ACT27s, on a wind turbine at Myres Hill [Glasgow, UK] – not only demonstrating the structural integrity of ACT blades, but also their operational performance. Now we’re working on developing our first blade product, so the collaboration with Enel Green Power is of great value to us, ensuring we keep our focus on the end user, which is fundamental in this phase of development and in terms of the future commercialization of our technology as well.ACT Blade’s fabric wind turbine blade was clearly compelling enough to catch Enel Green Power’s eye. Will its blades become a commercial success and revolutionize the wind power industry? We’ll see. Every breakthrough in clean energy benefits everyone, and it’s better to try and fail than not try at all.Whenever a new prototype emerges, a lot of scoffing inevitably follows. Many startups don’t make it, but some grab the brass ring. Without risk takers, we’d never innovate. People mocked Thomas Edison, too. In 1878, the New York Times said Edison was going to bring about “the destruction of human society” – for inventing the phonograph.Read more: Sweden’s Vattenfall commits to wind turbine blade landfill banPhoto: Enel Green PowerUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/10/26,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):October 26 update: Apparently there aren’t enough charging stations in Glasgow for the fleet of around 240 electric Jaguars provided by the British government and Jaguar Land Rover to ferry visiting heads of state around at COP26, which starts on October 31. So the alternative, which isn’t a bad solution, to be fair, is to use generators fueled by hydrogenated cooking oil as an EV charging alternative. (And there’s always that plug-it-into-an-outlet thing. UK outlets are 230v.)Electrek’s Take: For those who are tempted to mock this problem, consider this: Isn’t the entire point of this monumental event to boost clean energy, because we are, as a planet, not on track to meet the Paris Agreement targets, as reported today in the UN Environment Programme’s “Emissions Gap Report 2021“? If everything was hunky dory, there’d be no reason to meet. So let’s take this charge point shortage for what it is: a good example of why leaders are convening to get to work.Jaguar Land Rover has announced, and the UK Cabinet Office has confirmed, that the automaker will provide a fleet of electric cars to transport world leaders at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, aka the COP26, in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. If you’re wondering why it’s known as COP26, COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and it’s the 26th UN climate change conference. The COP26 is a make-or-break summit to formulate an actionable worldwide plan to slow global warming:The COP26 summit will bring parties together to accelerate action toward the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.And if you’re also wondering why Jaguar Land Rover – well, it’s a British brand.Summit delegates will travel to and from the venue in Jaguar Land Rover’s electric cars.Thierry Bolloré, chief executive officer of Jaguar Land Rover, said:We are delighted to partner with COP26 and provide a fleet of all-electric vehicles, including Jaguar I-PACE performance SUVs, to deliver zero-emission transport at the summit.The automaker provided similar services at the G7 summit, held in Cornwall this summer.Jaguar Land Rover aims to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036, and net zero emissions across its supply chain, products, and operations by 2039.The total pipeline of floating offshore wind projects worldwide shows that it currently stands at over 54 gigawatts (GW) if all are fully constructed, according to a new report from RenewableUK, a British trade association for the wind, wave, and tidal power industries. The pipeline includes projects from early-stage development through to those that are fully operational.More than half of the pipeline is in Europe, at 30.9 GW. The UK leads globally, with 8.8 GW.

2021/10/26,"Researchers presented a new road map to create perovskite semiconductors that can be used in solar cells and LEDs. Perovskite could provide many advantages over purely silicon-based semiconductors, specifically due to its fault tolerance in manufacturing.In a new article published in the journal APL Materials, researchers presented a possible road map to bring this silicon alternative closer to production.Perovskite is able to provide many benefits over the current silicon panels. While silicon must be grown in an expensive process, perovskite semiconductors can be produced using a much cheaper process while offering tunable functionality.Silicon-based semiconductors cannot be processed in a solution bath, as that bath is more prone to producing faults in the material:For many years, solution-processed semiconductors were viewed as unable to deliver the same functionality as specially grown crystalline semiconductors. The reason behind this thinking was that simple solution processing will inherently lead to a relative high number of defects within the formed crystal structure, which can negatively affect its functionality.The hybrid design of the perovskite, however, makes it very fault-tolerant. This allows it to be processed from a solution, using a semiconductor ink coating to create the desired product, whether a solar cell or LED. This process also allows the semiconductors to be tuned to a specific purpose. So perovskite LEDs can be controlled for a specific wavelength of light, while solar cells can have their absorption profile optimized.While perovskite may provide more efficient panels, the researchers also point out the major drawbacks to the material that need to be addressed before any perovskite panels would be suitable for true solar installations.Those drawbacks come with the use of heavy metals, primarily lead, as well as the much shorter lifespan of the perovskite panels compared to current silicon offerings.Other researchers remain focused on addressing these concerns to bring the more efficient panels to market. In 2019, researchers found a self-healing polymer that can effectively seal in the toxic materials. While avoiding the use of lead altogether would be preferable, this sealing could be help minimize negative impacts while bringing a potentially superior material to market.Earlier this year, researchers at Brown University found a way to improve the long-term reliability of perovskite solar cells. By using a layer that has a silicon atom on one side and an iodine atom on the other, the researchers were able to improve the overall efficiency as well as the long-term reliability. Admittedly, though, the reliability and lifetime of these panels are still far behind standard silicon offerings. They estimated that the panel’s 80% efficiency life would be just 4,000 hours. Even lower-quality solar panels degrade at roughly 0.8% per year, meaning it takes more than 20 years to fall to 80% efficiency.While perovskite clearly has a long way to go before it is totally ready for the mainstream, each improvement is a promising step toward a more efficient future.",solar
2021/10/25,"Spain-headquartered renewables giant Siemens Gamesa announced today that it will build a new offshore wind turbine blade factory in Virginia. The $200 million factory will be the first of its kind in the US.Siemens Gamesa will develop an 80-acre (32-hectare) site at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Portsmouth, Virginia, which will ultimately become an offshore wind hub. The company entered a land lease agreement with the Virginia Port Authority, supported by Virginia state incentives for site improvements. The new factory will be built “upon execution of a firm order” for the 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial Project with Dominion Energy. Siemens Gamesa claims it’s the first commitment by a global offshore wind turbine manufacturer in a US-based supply chain.The manufacturing facility will create around 260 jobs, and Siemens Gamesa also intends to create around 50 service jobs to provide operations and maintenance services for the offshore wind farm.Liz Burdock, CEO and president of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, said:Bringing the first offshore wind blade factory to the United States is another historic moment for our industry’s development and critical to our ongoing efforts to localize a robust supply chain. With the global demand for offshore wind growing exponentially, we must accelerate development of a local supply chain to ensure the US can achieve its renewable energy goals and create well-paying American jobs in the process. Today’s announcement is a welcome sign of growing investor confidence in the US market and highlights the Commonwealth of Virginia’s emergence as a hub for offshore wind activity. Congratulations to Governor Ralph Northam [D-VA] and our federal leadership in helping make this day a reality and moving the US market forward.US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said:Offshore wind energy will create jobs and economic prosperity across the country, and with President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda, we’re showing that the United States is open for business on clean energy. Virginia is helping lead the way to strengthen the nation’s domestic supply chains of renewable energy and keep energy prices affordable for American households as we strive for a cleaner future.Read more: Almost the entire US coastline could now host offshore wind farmsUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/10/21,"Denmark-headquartered Ørsted is the largest offshore wind company in the world. David Hardy, who became CEO of Ørsted Offshore North America in October 2020, testified today on Capitol Hill, before the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Energy Subcommittee. Here’s what he said this morning.What follows is a transcript of Hardy’s statement:Chairman Pallone, Chairman Rush, Ranking Member McMorris-Rodgers, Ranking Member Upton, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. My name is David Hardy, and I am the CEO of Ørsted Offshore North America.Ørsted is the global leader in offshore wind energy with approximately 8,000 megawatts of installed capacity globally. While today’s hearing is focused on offshore wind, it is important to note that Ørsted is also a global leader in onshore wind, solar, energy storage, and green hydrogen. While once a fossil-fuel-intensive oil and gas company, today we’ve transitioned to a 100% clean energy company.Although we have this global experience, at our core we are a local company rooted in the communities we serve.In the US, Ørsted is the leading offshore wind energy company, currently developing offshore wind farms totaling more than 4,000 MW and powering millions of homes in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.We’ve been involved in one way or another with all seven of the current operating offshore wind turbines in the US – installing the first two turbines in federal waters off the coast of Virginia last year, and owning and operating the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.While our offshore wind projects are obviously being built along the coastlines, I would like to highlight how offshore wind energy creates economic opportunity in communities across the country.Thank you to @EnergyCommerce #SubEnergy leadership for inviting me to speak today & discuss how we’re investing into communities across the country, ranging from New England & other coastal states, to IL, PA & TX to name just a few. Read my testimony here https://t.co/fpZYFuwU9z pic.twitter.com/fc8iMHY0aKOne of the challenges facing the US offshore wind industry is the capacity of and expertise within the supply chain. Ørsted has a two-pronged approach to help solve this challenge. This includes, first, building US capability with existing American companies and second, attracting European firms to build facilities here in the US, thus creating foreign direct investment and new American jobs.Here are some examples of how we are helping to build capabilities with US companies:First, in the area of offshore substations: We’ve partnered with Kiewit, a company based in Nebraska, to build the first American-made offshore wind substation. Kiewit will leverage its oil and gas experience to produce this important piece of infrastructure in Texas.Drawing on its experience in the oil and gas sector, this new contract will provide Kiewit with new offshore wind energy experience, which will allow it to support future US offshore wind farms.Next, in the area of vessels: Earlier this summer, I was in Minority Whip Scalise’s district to meet with Edison Chouest Offshore, a [Los Angeles] company that will build America’s first Service Operations Vessel, or SOV. This is an $80 million vessel that is 260 feet in length.And in June, I joined Congressman McKinley, Senator Manchin, and Secretary Granholm in West Virginia to celebrate the lease we signed to charter the first US built offshore wind turbine installation vessel. This $500 million vessel will be built in Texas.US steel manufacturers in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Alabama, and West Virginia will supply the steel for these two vessels. And Caterpillar, in Illinois, will produce the engines to power our SOV.Last, in the area of foundation components: I attended an event just two weeks ago with Congressman Tonko to announce an $86 million investment for Riggs Distler and Ljungstrom Steel Fabricators to make steel components in Western New York for our turbine foundations. And in Maryland, we are investing $70 million into Crystal Steel, a minority-owned company to do similar work.Now, I would like to share some examples of how we are working with global partners to build US facilities and create American jobs.First in the area of undersea submarine cables. We’ve partnered with Nexans, a French global leader in submarine export cables, to expand their capabilities in their South Carolina facility. And as part of our current bid in Maryland, we partnered with Hellenic Cables, a Greek company, to open a factory in the Baltimore area and produce the first American-made offshore wind submarine array cables there.Additionally, we have also attracted EEW, a German offshore wind foundation manufacturer, to open the world’s most advanced monopile manufacturing facility in Paulsboro, New Jersey. This investment includes six large buildings to make 400-foot in length and 40-foot diameter monopiles.As you can see, there is already significant economic activity across the country.Even as a new industry, our supply chain today already includes companies and employees from every state represented on this subcommittee.In closing, I would like to emphasize one more important point. That is that Europe has had several decades to build the infrastructure needed to support a mature offshore wind energy industry. And although we are making considerable progress in building the US supply chain, it remains a challenge that needs regulatory certainty and incentive if we want to achieve 30 gigawatts by 2030 and realize our full potential.It is an exciting but critical time for US offshore wind energy, an industry that will both reduce the impacts of climate change, as well as create jobs across America.

2021/10/21,"Clean energy employment reached 12 million globally in 2020, up from 11.5 million in 2019, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), the eighth edition of “Renewable Energy and Jobs: Annual Review 2021.”The report confirms what we all know about the pandemic: that COVID-19 caused – and continues to cause – delays and supply chain disruptions, with impacts on jobs varying by country and end-use, and among segments of the value chain. But ultimately, the number of jobs still grew.Indeed, clean energy jobs have been on a steady upward trajectory since 2012, when the annual review commenced, when there were 7.3 million employed by the sector globally.In 2020, solar and wind jobs continued to lead global employment growth in the clean energy sector, accounting for a total of 4 million and 1.25 million jobs, respectively.China commanded the largest share of clean energy jobs worldwide in 2020, with a 39% share, or 4.73 million jobs. The EU followed (1.3 million), then Brazil (1.2 million), the US (838,400), and India (726,000). Other countries are also creating jobs in renewables, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, which are key solar PV exporters; Indonesia and Colombia, with large agricultural supply chains for biofuels; and Mexico and Russia, where wind power is growing. In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar jobs are expanding in countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and South Africa.Here’s a snapshot of what happened by sector:Solar. The solar PV workforce expanded to 4 million workers from 3.8 million in 2019. Record installations were somewhat offset by growing labor productivity in utility-scale projects and reductions of in-person sales.Wind. Wind power employment increased slightly from 1.2 million in 2019 to 1.25 million in 2020. The offshore wind segment is growing.Hydropower. Hydropower saw employment jump from 1.96 million in 2019 to 2.18 million in 2020.Biofuels. Biofuels jobs worldwide fell slightly to 2.4 million (from 2.5 million), owing to pandemic-driven reductions in demand, lower prices for fossil fuels used in transport, and adverse policy changes.Electric vehicles and green hydrogen. Energy transition technologies such as batteries for electric vehicles and green hydrogen are expected to become major job creators. Electrolyzers and other green hydrogen infrastructure could create about 2 million jobs globally from 2030 to 2050.ILO director-general Guy Ryder said:The potential for renewable energy to generate decent work is a clear indication that we do not have to choose between environmental sustainability on the one hand, and employment creation on the other. The two can go hand-in-hand.And this may be the most crucial nugget of information, for those who are under the impression that clean energy is going to eliminate jobs (share it with your doubting friends):IRENA and ILO’s work finds that more jobs will be created by the energy transition thanlost. An ILO global sustainability scenario to 2030 estimates that 25 million new jobs farsurpass losses of nearly 7 million jobs. Some 5 million workers who lose their jobs will beable to find new jobs in the same occupation in another industry.Read more: US solar sets records in 2020, predicted to quadruple by 2030UnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/10/21,"The UK’s Hornsea Two offshore wind farm, soon to be the world’s largest when it’s completed next year, just achieved a couple of major construction milestones.The first wind turbine was installed in May at Hornsea Two, which is 55 miles (89 kilometers) northeast of Grimsby, in Lincolnshire.Danish wind giant Ørsted’s 1.3 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farm will feature 165 Siemens Gamesa 8.4 megawatt (MW) wind turbines, an offshore substation, and a reactive compensation station.Now Hornsea Two has achieved two major milestones. First, all of the wind turbine foundations are now installed, which means it’s ready for the final third of wind turbines to be put in place. Most of the blades were manufactured at the Siemens Gamesa factory in Hull.Also, the offshore substation is complete:What is now the world’s largest AC offshore substation weighs around 8,000 metric tons.The Reactive Compensation Station (RCS) will also be lifted into place soon. An RCS is required because of cable length, so it will compensate for reactive power losses in order to ensure power transmission efficiency. Both the offshore substation and the RCS were built in and transported by sea from the Sembcorp Marine facility in Singapore.Once Hornsea Two becomes fully operational in 2022, it will be the largest operating wind farm in the world, outsizing its sister project, the 1.2 GW Hornsea One. It will supply power to more than 1.3 million homes in the UK.But its superlative status will be temporary, because it will be dethroned by the 4.8 GW Dogger Bank, also off Yorkshire in the UK, once it’s completed in 2026, as well as other global projects in the pipeline.Read more: Offshore wind could power the whole world, says IEAUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2021/10/19,"Berkeley, California-based carbon transformation company Twelve and Tulsa-based Emerging Fuels Technology (EFT) today announced that they have produced the first fossil-free jet fuel from carbon dioxide using an electrochemical process. The project received funding from the US Air Force.The new biofuel, which is called E-Jet, can be used by both commercial and military aviation.Biofuels are notoriously expensive. But where many processes have proven the ability to yield 65% of jet fuel from initial feedstock, EFT says its process yields more than 80%. EFT has also signed a licensing agreement with Norwegian company Nordic Electrofuel, which also makes fossil-replacement fuels.Twelve and EFT state that fossil-free jet fuel E-Jet is a drop-in replacement for petrochemical-based alternatives, and no changes are required to existing plane design or commercial regulations.  Twelve summarizes how E-Jet is made on its website:E-Jet is made with our carbon transformation technology, a new electrochemical reactor and proprietary catalyst that electrifies CO2 and water, which creates synthesis gas, CO + H2, which we then refine into carbon neutral jet fuel.E-Jet is drop-in ready and certified, with the same quality and performance, but has over 90% lower lifecycle emissions. That’s because we source the carbon in our fuel from the air, not the ground — and, because it has fewer contaminants than petroleum-based fuels, it burns cleaner.In summer 2021, the US Air Force tested and qualified our E-Jet product.Twelve and EFT worked in partnership with the US Air Force’s Operational Energy office through a joint contract with AFWERX, a program office at the Air Force Research Laboratory, and the Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. Roberto Guerrero, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for Operational Energy, said:One of our main goals with this project was to create a clean jet fuel that enhances security and energy independence without sacrificing operational readiness.

2021/10/19,"The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is projecting that there will be 22% more coal-fired electricity generation in the US in 2021 than in 2020 due to higher natural gas prices – but the coal spike won’t last.Coal and natural gas have historically been the two largest sources of electricity generation in the US, and which one is used often comes down to cost.US natural gas prices have been more volatile than coal prices, so the cost of natural gas often determines the relative share of generation provided by the two fossil fuels.This year, natural gas prices have been much higher than previous years. The EIA reports:The year-to-date delivered cost of natural gas to US power plants has averaged $4.93 per million British thermal units (Btu), more than double last year’s price.The overall decline in US electricity demand in 2020 and record-low natural gas prices due to the pandemic led coal plants to significantly reduce the percentage of time that they generated power. In 2020, the utilization rate (known as the capacity factor) of US coal-fired generators averaged 40%. Before 2010, coal capacity factors regularly averaged 70% or more. In 2021, higher natural gas prices have increased the average coal capacity factor to about 51%, which is almost the 2018 average.Read more: But here’s the good news about coal-powered electricity’s rise: It’s temporary. The EIA writes:Although rising natural gas prices have resulted in more US coal-fired generation than last year, this increase in coal generation will most likely not continue. The electric power sector has retired about 30% of its generating capacity at coal plants since 2010, and no new coal-fired capacity has come online in the United States since 2013. In addition, coal stocks at US power plants are relatively low, and production at operating coal mines has not been increasing as rapidly as the recent increase in coal demand.The EIA forecasts that US coal-fired generation will decline approximately 5% in response to continuing retirement of coal and slightly lower natural gas prices.Oh, and to state the obvious, clean energy is rapidly on the rise. In fact, it’s going to be the leading source of all US electricity by 2030. So the sooner we boot the fossil fuels, the better.Photo: PNAS",solar
2021/10/18,"South Korea today announced its commitment to slash its emissions by 40% of 2018 levels by 2030, compared to an initial 26.3% goal that the country set in 2020. South Korean president Moon Jae-in said at a presidential committee meeting about the country working toward becoming carbon neutral:This is the most ambitious reduction target possible under our circumstances.The goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions [by] 40% shows the nation’s strong willingness for carbon neutrality and responsibility toward the international community.Moon is right about ambition, seeing how coal makes up around 41% of South Korea’s electricity mix yet clean energy currently only makes up just over 6%, and manufacturing, which currently relies on fossil fuels, makes up a large part of the South Korean economy.Moon also said that the South Korean government has allotted 12 trillion won ($10.11 billion) to 2022’s carbon neutrality budget.Channel News Asia briefly summarizes the country’s net zero plan:The government aims to shift industry to minimize carbon emissions by halving coal-fired power generation from 41.9% to 21.8% by 2030 and raising renewables from 6.2% to 30.2%, it said in a statement.South Korea aims to put 4.5 million electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles on its roads by 2025, the statement said, while adding more charging stations and infrastructure.This is welcome news ahead of the upcoming United Nations COP26 summit in Glasgow, which kicks off on October 31, but some environmental groups still feel South Korea’s target is not ambitious enough.Justin Jeong, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner, told Reuters the target should be raised to over 50% to meet the international goals.Moon also reiterated that South Korea will reach net zero by 2050, which he initially announced nearly a year ago.According to the Yonhap News Agency:South Korea’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 648.6 million tons in 2020, down 7.3% from the previous year, according to the environment ministry. It marked the first time that such emissions declined for the second straight year.Read more: South Korea joins Japan and China in net zero pledge",solar
2021/10/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The US has enough usable rooftop space to deploy enough solar power that would match its current generation levels, according to a recent study. The paper, which was published on Nature Communications, came from scientists at the University of Cork in Ireland who assessed global rooftop solar PV potential.US rooftops could host enough capacity to produce an annual 4.2 petawatt-hours (PWh) per year, which slightly surpasses the country’s current total energy output of around 4 PWh per year. (The petawatt (PW) is equal to one quadrillion [1015] watts.)And that’s just the start, because solar panels are currently around 15-22% efficient, and that’s continues to improve with technological innovations. Solar panel efficiency is the percentage of sunlight a single solar panel can convert into electricity.On a global scale, the study notes:As the fastest deployable energy generation technology with the highest year-on-year growth rate, solar PV technology is projected to supply 25–49% of the global electricity needs by 2050 while providing employment for up to 15 million people between 2018 and 2050. Out of this, [rooftop solar photovoltaics] deployment will contribute up to 40% of the total solar PV-derived electricity generation by 2050.Read more: Here are the 3 biggest trends in rooftop solar and battery storageThe US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) “International Energy Outlook 2021” report makes projections based on legal and regulatory inertia – that is, the assumption that current laws and regulations stay as they are into the future.Using that model, the EIA projects that renewables, particularly solar and wind, will be the largest contributor to global growth in electricity generation through 2050. (That’s consistent with the University of Cork study noted above.)However, it predicts that certain regions will still mainly use coal for electricity generation. The EIA has a really interesting take on coal consumption (and I’m not panicking – yet – because I assume laws and regulations will change):The absence of regional carbon policies or regulations along with rising natural gas prices after 2030 — particularly in Asia and in regions that rely on higher-cost liquefied natural gas (LNG) — is likely to make coal the most economical generation fuel to pair with increased intermittent generation from wind and solar. This shift reverses the trend observed over recent decades. Although the cost of mining coal will likely raise coal prices after 2030, we project that coal prices will remain low relative to natural gas prices and provide a cost-competitive option to natural gas-fired generation.Increases in coal-fired generation in Other non-OECD Asia – which includes Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, among other countries – will account for over 75% of our projected increase in global coal-fired generation from 2030 to 2050. For Other non-OECD Asia, we project that renewable energy sources will account for about 60% of the generation increase over the projection period, primarily from wind and solar. Coal-fired generation will account for nearly all of the remaining growth.But… on September 24, the Bank of China said it would no longer provide financing for new coal mining and coal power projects outside China, and that announcement preceded the official release of the EIA’s report in October. So China’s big decision to cancel coal financing abroad will certainly influence “Other non-OECD Asia” countries to look more toward renewables, since they previously got most of their coal financing from China. That effectively impacts 44 coal plants earmarked for Chinese state financing totaling $50 billion.",solar

2021/10/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Pueblo, Colorado, is now home to the world’s first steel mill running almost completely on solar energy. The Bighorn Solar project was launched yesterday by solar developer Lightsource BP, utility Xcel Energy, and steel company EVRAZ North America.The project is primarily located on 1,800 acres of land on EVRAZ Rocky Mountain Steel property. It’s the largest onsite solar facility in the US dedicated to a single customer, with more than 750,000 solar panels that are bifacial solar photovoltaic modules on single-axis trackers. The steel mill supports more than 1,000 jobs.The solar panels will produce 613,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year, offsetting about 90% of the steel mill’s annual electricity demand. (We’re assuming that the other 10% of energy comes from coal, seeing how the solar power is routed to the Comanche coal-fired power plant run by Xcel Energy on its way to the steel mill. Comanche will be shut down in 2040.)Lightsource bp financed, owns, and operates Bighorn Solar and sells the electricity it generates to Xcel Energy under a 20-year power purchase agreement. As part of that arrangement, EVRAZ will receive clean power and price certainty from Xcel Energy through 2041. The project is the equivalent of taking 92,100 gas cars off the road annually.German home energy storage company sonnen and Rocky Mountain Power (RMP), an electricity provider in Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho, have been collaborating with Utah solar contractor ES Solar on virtual power plants that benefit both residents – clean backup power, energy management, and lower energy costs – and the local grid – load shifting, peak period offsets, and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. It’s known as the Wattsmart Battery Program. A 600-unit pilot project at Soleil Lofts Apartments in Herriman, Utah, is successfully up and running.It’s a first-of-its-kind utility battery program model. RMP hopes it will challenge the traditional rooftop solar contractor model and demonstrate how utilities can go beyond net-metering approaches to implement dispatchable behind-the-meter resources to benefit customers and its grid.Now sonnen and RMP have today announced that they will retrofit thousands of solar homes with battery storage units over the next year. RMP will have access to participants’ sonnen systems for dispatch and grid support services. ES Solar is already making installations, and the program is open to RMP’s 50,000 existing solar customers.Silicon Ranch Corporation, Shell’s US solar platform and one of the country’s largest independent power producers, has acquired clean tech pioneer Clearloop. Clearloop partners with brands, companies, and individuals to expand access to clean energy and generate long-term opportunities in economically distressed communities across the US. Former governor Phil Bredesen (D-TN) is one of the company founders.Clearloop will continue to operate under its brand and be led by CEO and cofounder Laura Zapata. Both companies are based in Nashville and will share office space at Silicon Ranch’s headquarters. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.On September 1, Electrek reported that Clearloop broke ground on a 1-megawatt solar farm in Jackson, Tennessee. Clearloop said that it’s the first utility-scale solar farm in the US that is 100% financed by corporate carbon offsets.Silicon Ranch’s acquisition of Clearloop is a notable break from traditional carbon offset practice. Typically, stakes in offsets from clean energy production have been sold to corporations via third parties such as carbon registry brokers. This use of middlemen often clouds the source of the offset credit and gives the buyer little to no tangible evidence of impact.Photo: Lightsource BP",solar

2021/10/12,"Electrek spoke with Rick Bohan, VP of sustainability at the Portland Cement Association (PCA), which represents 92% of US cement manufacturing production capacity and has distribution facilities in every continental US state. Cement is the second-most-used construction material on the planet. In November 2020, PCA announced an industry-wide ambition to develop a road map by the end of 2021 to help its member companies achieve carbon neutrality across the concrete value chain by 2050. October 12 update: PCA today released its “Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality,” which lays out the US net zero plan across the cement and concrete value chain by 2050. Bohan discussed this in his original Q&A with Electrek below.PCA is aligned with the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), which represents 40 of the world’s biggest producers and about 80% of the industry outside China. On a global scale, GCCA also made the pledge to reach net zero by 2050 today. Several major Chinese cement and concrete companies, which account for about 20% of China’s market, have also joined the pledge.The manufacture of cement accounts for 1.25% of US emissions.Cement is the key ingredient in concrete, so the forthcoming road map addresses not just cement, but concrete, too. Urgent action is necessary so cement and concrete can continue to play a critical role in the US’s infrastructure future without making emissions worse.Electrek: What are some examples of steps that PCA’s road map will likely include to achieve carbon neutrality across the concrete value chain by 2050?Rick Bohan: The road map being developed by PCA on behalf of the cement industry will include the full concrete value chain – from the production of cement through the use of concrete across the nation. A few examples of the actions included in the road map are:Increasing access to alternative fuels, especially materials that otherwise end up in landfills, for cement plants to use;Rapidly driving the adoption of innovative products like Portland limestone cements (PLC), performance-based concrete mixtures, blended cements and more;Investing in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology and critical infrastructure to support CCUS, including a robust and smart electric grid.Electrek: Could you describe how those examples will work in real terms?Rick Bohan: Increasing access to alternative fuels, especially materials that otherwise end up in landfills, for industry can have a dramatic and immediate impact. Currently, many cement plants are reliant on non-renewable resources to power plants, but that could be mitigated by increasing access to alternative fuel sources. Through this increased access, alternative fuels including fly ash, carpet remnants, tires, and other non-hazardous materials are not only helping to reduce emissions, but also diverting materials that would be otherwise sent to a landfill.Cement kilns are extremely efficient at combusting any fuel given their extremely high operating temperature, and they can maintain emissions at or below the levels from more traditional fossil fuels.In order for non-hazardous waste to be rerouted from landfills to industries such as cement to use for fuel, we’ll need regulatory reform and the recognition from policymakers that the increased use of alternative fuels is consistent with meeting mid-century climate goals. Today, alternative fuels make up only about 15% of the fuel used by domestic manufacturers, compared to more than 36% in the European Union, including as high as 60% in Germany.US cement plants began adopting alternative fuels as early as the 1970s, but today these fuels only make up about 15% of the fuel used by domestic cement manufacturers due to outdated/burdensome regulations. It’s really unfortunate, because there’s almost a regulatory disincentive against beneficial use of alternative fuels.Portland limestone cement offers the same durability and resiliency benefits of any other Portland cement, while reducing embodied CO2 by 10%. By optimizing the amount of clinker in cement to incorporate more limestone, we can reduce the amount of energy (and associated emissions) used to heat clinker (the main ingredient in cement) and ultimately produce cement. PLC isn’t as widely used as it could be, and barriers for broad uptake seem to be just a case of institutional inertia. People tend to stick with what they know, but in this case, doing so misses a great opportunity.By shifting to PLC, manufacturers have already reduced CO2 emissions by more than 325,000 metric tons in the US from 2012-2018, equivalent to carbon stored in over 400,000 acres of forest. 32 state Departments of Transportation currently allow the use of PLC, yet until recently, PLC was still less than 1% of total cement shipments. Carbon capture, utilization and storage-related technologies and innovations will not only be groundbreaking for the industry but also essential. There’s a unique opportunity with concrete to actually use captured carbon in the concrete-curing process, helping to harden and strengthen the concrete more quickly. The CO2 can be injected into fresh concrete and is actually permanently sequestered in the concrete, so even if a structure is demolished in the future, the CO2 is not released.CCUS represents an opportunity to lower emissions substantially. As such, the industrial sector should increasingly focus on CCUS research and development.Electrek: Are there any new innovations that PCA sees as being potentially groundbreaking for the industry to reduce emissions?Rick Bohan: The technology for carbon capture is still in early stages, and hasn’t been developed to scale. Truly continuing to see innovation here is going to be groundbreaking for the industry. Cement manufacturing is an energy-intensive process that depends on carefully balanced chemistry and physics. Cement plants run continuously, typically 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and generating and maintaining kilns at the high temperatures required to create clinker involves the combustion of significant quantities of fossil or alternative fuels. The chemical process to convert limestone and other ingredients into clinker is also emissions-intensive, typically generating 50% to 60% of the CO2 from manufacturing.US cement manufacturers have invested billions of dollars in technologies in increasing energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, but energy efficiency alone will not be enough to meet long-term reduction goals. As mentioned, over 60% of the cement industry’s carbon emissions result from the chemical conversion of limestone and other ingredients into cement – there is no way to prevent the generation of CO2 during this process – it is a “chemical fact of life.” Any long-term carbon reduction strategy for the cement manufacturing industry will require significant advances in CCUS technologies with a particular focus on research, development, and cost-effective deployment. While promising CCUS technologies are under development domestically and overseas, none have reached the commercial stage of deployment. Those technologies include traditional solvents, sorbents, and membranes, as well as unique technologies like algae capture, direct separation reactors, and oxyfuel calcination. Nearly all research and federal funding have focused on the energy sector, not industrial sector solutions. The CCUS technologies developed to date remain prohibitively expensive for energy-intensive industries, including cement. Electrek: How would a more robust and smarter electric grid help the cement industry meet your goal of carbon neutrality by 2050? Rick Bohan: We’re an energy-intensive, trade-exposed industry, and much of our electricity is consumed in crushing and grinding. It’s likely that plants will use technologies like waste heat reduction to generate onsite electricity, and we know that renewable energy will increasingly be a part of the cement plant energy mix. Both of those need a grid to deliver and to accept renewable energy, and that means a grid that’s reliable and robust.Rick Bohan is vice president, sustainability for the Portland Cement Association. He is responsible for coordinating all of PCA’s sustainability-related activities including its ongoing development of a road map to carbon neutrality. He was previously senior director of research and technology at PCA. Rick is an editor and author of the second edition of PCA’s 2-volume book, Innovations in Portland Cement Manufacturing, along with many other publications. His career with PCA spans 27 years in virtually every aspect of cement and concrete technology and applications. Before his tenure at PCA, Rick worked in consulting engineering and served on active duty as both an enlisted Marine and a commissioned Marine officer. He holds a BS in civil engineering, an MBA, and is a registered professional engineer.Photo: Rodolfo Quirós/Pexels.com",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/10/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Stockholm-based floating offshore wind company Hexicon will be granted a European patent by The European Patent Office for a floating platform with two tilted towers that makes it possible to install two turbines on the same platform. Called TwinWind (pictured above), here’s how they work, according to Hexicon:The TwinWind design specifically allows the foundations, rather than the individual turbine nacelles, to align with the wind. This innovative design allows for the deployment of more turbines per sea area, increasing the energy yield per acreage and reducing the environmental impact. TwinWind also reduces the total costs of cabling, steel, installations and maintenance.The patent has previously been granted in Sweden and South Africa. Hexicon will next receive a formal decision about the grant, and then validate the patent in the markets for which it wishes to obtain patent protection.Marcus Thor, CEO of Hexicon, said:Our floating platforms with tilted towers increase the power density for a given water area and thus reduce the number of platforms and cabling, which means more efficient electricity production and lower costs.

2021/10/07,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Scientists at the ReCell Center — the US’s first advanced battery recycling R&D center at the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory – have developed an innovative process for separating the valuable materials that make up the cathode, a battery’s positively charged electrode. It’s a pivotal discovery that eliminates the problem of making recycling lithium-ion batteries economically viable. Recycling Li-ion batteries will become an urgent need as the shift to electrification accelerates.The scientists’ method is called “froth flotation,” and Argonne explains how it works:Used for many years by the mining industry to separate and purify ores, froth flotation separates materials in a flotation tank based on whether they repel water and float, or absorb water and sink. Generally cathode materials sink, which makes them difficult to separate from each other. That’s true of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC111) and lithium manganese oxide, two common EV battery cathode materials that the ReCell team used in its experiments. What the researchers found was that separation can be achieved by making one of the cathode materials, NMC111, float via the introduction of a chemical that makes the target material repel water.Once the cathode materials were separated, the researchers determined through testing that the process had a negligible impact on the electrochemical performance of the materials. Both also had high purity levels (95% or above).[F]or now, the ReCell Center team is laser focused on creating, step by step, a complete recycling process for lithium-ion batteries that is economically viable.In less than a decade, researchers project that 2 million tons of end-of-life EV Li-ion batteries will be retired each year, so refining the process is crucial to make recycling more economically viable.Read more: Will this metal recycling startup revolutionize the battery and clean energy sectors?In yet another exciting chapter of clean energy superlatives – hey, we all benefit from the sector’s race to the distinction of being the “world’s largest” – Danish company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) has proposed building what it says would be the world’s largest floating wind farm off the Caithness coast in northern Scotland.The 100 megawatt floating offshore wind farm would generate clean power for around 70,000 homes.Highland Wind Limited, which is majority owned by CIP, will develop the project. The first stage, expected to be in 2023, consists of a single turbine demonstrator capable of 8.6 MW. Work on the rest of the project, consisting of up to 10 turbines, could start in 2025 and become operational in 2027.Offshore wind farms feature turbines on platforms anchored to the seabed.Located 62 miles (100 km) from the nearest electricity grid in British Columbia, Canada, the Nemiah Valley is home to the Xeni Gwet’in band of the Tsilhqot’in people. Canadian clean energy company Amp, working with the Xeni Gwet’in chief and community leaders, delivered a solar and battery storage microgrid, thus eliminating the need for diesel generators and reducing energy costs for the community.

2021/10/06,"Ørsted’s Skipjack Wind 1 will be a 120-megawatt (MW) offshore wind farm in Maryland that will power 40,000 homes once it goes live in the second half of 2026. It will generate $225 million in economic investment and create nearly 1,400 jobs in the state. Large offshore wind farms give rise to other projects, such as a new $20 million maintenance facility in Maryland for Skipjack Wind 1, which the Danish wind giant announced today.Skipjack Wind, which will be 19 miles off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia), will feature GE’s Haliade-X 12MW wind turbines.In order to service it, Ørsted is going to build Maryland’s first emission-free offshore wind operations and maintenance facility in west Ocean City. The nearly $20 million facility will create up to 110 temporary and permanent jobs in the community, and position the Ocean City area as a strategic hub for offshore wind jobs and economic activity. The new facility will serve as the strategic embarkation point for up to three Crew Transfer Vessels (CTVs) that will service Skipjack Wind 1. It will include a warehouse and serve as Ørsted’s Ocean City area office. Ørsted will use zero-emission CTVs and dock them at the facility as part of its commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. The facility will serve as the permanent home for key members of the Skipjack Wind 1 Maryland team, including wind turbine maintenance technicians, engineers, operations personnel, and other roles. The timeline for the facility will be announced by Ørsted in the coming weeks.Despite the fact that Skipjack Wind 1 is 26 miles from the Ocean City pier, some residents are concerned about being able to see the turbines, including Ocean City’s mayor, Rick Meehan, who claimed at a public service commission hearing on September 28 that the wind farm “will destroy the pristine view of the horizon.” Every time a big step is taken to advance US offshore wind, I get excited and feel optimistic. Ocean City residents love their town and love their beach. I know it well; I spent many days as a child on that beach, as did my parents and grandparents. But what those who worry about the view are not thinking about is how climate change will cause irrevocable damage to their town and beach that will far outweigh any concerns they might have about the way the wind farm looks. I personally find wind turbines exciting, but not everyone does. I certainly believe wind turbines on the horizon are better than having no beach at all. When Ocean City has a big storm, the beach floods. It’s entirely possible that it could disappear permanently.I don’t need a “pristine view.” I’d rather the beach still be there, where I can admire the giant beauties creating clean energy, which can help keep global warming at bay.Read more: US offshore wind workers to get virtual reality training in MarylandPhoto: Ørsted",solar
2021/10/06,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) this morning released its “International Energy Outlook 2021” report. What’s important to stress is that this report “assumes current laws and regulations.”So here’s what we can glean from this. If we don’t make changes, it’s not going to be good when it comes to reducing emissions and slowing global warming. Globally, we’ll continue to head in the wrong direction. The solution? DON’T stick with current laws and regulations.Preview in new tabQuoting the EIA, three key findings include:The Maine Governor’s Energy Office submitted an application to the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to lease a 15.2-square-mile area nearly 30 miles offshore in the Gulf of Maine for the US’s first floating offshore wind research site in federal waters. The state of Maine wants to deploy a small-scale research array of no more than 12 wind turbines on floating hulls designed at the University of Maine. The state would partner with the 11 megawatt floating offshore wind pilot project New England Aqua Ventus, Diamond Offshore Wind, and RWE Renewables.The research site will be used to investigate how floating offshore wind interacts with Maine’s marine environment, fishing industry, and shipping and navigation routes.In July, Maine banned new offshore wind projects in state waters, which will be used only for fishing and recreation.

2021/10/05,"GE Renewable Energy today announced that its Haliade-X offshore wind turbine prototype is now running at 14 megawatts in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This means that GE Renewable Energy is now the first to operate a wind turbine at a power output this high.There’s a competition going on between manufacturers for most powerful offshore wind turbine.In February this year, Electrek reported that Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas announced the launch of a 15 MW offshore wind turbine, thus dethroning the Haliade-X 14 MW as the world’s largest offshore wind turbine. But the 15 MW Vestas hasn’t yet begun to spin: The first V236-15.0 MW prototype is expected to be installed in 2022, while serial production is scheduled for 2024.The 15 MW Vestas will be used by German energy company EnBW for He Dreiht, a 900 MW, subsidy-free offshore wind farm in the German North Sea. Those turbines are expected to be installed in the second quarter of 2025, with full commissioning anticipated for the fourth quarter of the same year.So GE’s successful operation of its Haliade-X 14 MW prototype is a pretty big deal. According to GE, one turbine can generate up to 74 GWh of gross annual energy production, saving up to 52,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of the emissions from 11,000 vehicles in one year.The Haliade-X 14 MW will make its commercial debut at the Dogger Bank C offshore wind farm, which is off the northeast coast of England. Together with Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B, it’s due to become the largest offshore wind farm in the world upon completion. GE Renewable Energy will provide 87 units of the Haliade-X 14 MW for Dogger Bank C.Vincent Schellings, chief technology officer of GE Renewable Energy Offshore Wind, said:We’re pleased to announce that the Haliade-X prototype is the first turbine in the industry to successfully run at 14 MW. When we first commissioned our Haliade-X prototype in November 2019 at 12 MW, we made a big leap forward in the industry. Over the past two years we have learned a lot about operating and optimizing the performance of our Haliade-X platform, enabling us to uprate the Haliade-X platform to 14 MW today.Photo: GE Renewables",solar
2021/10/05,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):FPL Energy’s Gray County Wind Farm near Montezuma, Kansas, was built in 2001, and it’s still the largest wind farm in Kansas. The 112 megawatt wind farm features 170 turbines and can power 33,000 homes. The turbines are scattered over 12,000 acres, but only six acres are used for wind turbines and roads. Black Hills Energy purchases its electricity. So how’s it going, 20 years on? Wichita’s NBC affiliate KSN reports that the Gray County Wind Farm has brought $5.3 million in payments to the county, which has a population of around 6,000. Some of that money is funneled to local school districts.It, along with three other wind farms, has also paid for two new parking lots, a kitchen upgrade at the elementary school, and a new grandstand at the district’s football stadium, and that meant the county didn’t have to raise taxes to pay for those improvements.KSN spoke with Orville Williams, who leased part of his land to the wind farm and is also a county commissioner, and he just signed up for another 20-year lease. Williams said the wind farm has posed no problems as he’s farmed around the towers:I like them. They’ve been a very great economic boost for this area.Most people around here, I don’t think even notice them anymore.Anytime you can get money, but you’ve gotten the money from an outside source instead of having to get it from your local population, then it’s a win-win.And Montezuma Mayor Grant Salmans said:We hear somebody in a certain part of the state that doesn’t want one. And we’re kind of like that doesn’t really make much sense to us.Read more: Wind is now the largest source of electricity in Iowa and KansasThe board of Capital Metro, Austin’s transport provider, last week approved the purchase of 197 new electric buses from electric bus manufacturers Proterra and New Flyer to expand its fleet to more than 200 electric buses. Capital Metro says it’s the US’s largest electric vehicle procurement to date.Capital Metro’s goal is to transition its entire fleet of 400 of its buses to electric, but it doesn’t specify the timeline for that goal.In the short term, that includes the purchase of 26 40-foot Proterra ZX5 Max electric transit buses, which will be delivered in 2022.The US-manufactured 40-foot ZX5, which can seat up to 40 passengers, features 675 kWh of energy storage that can deliver up to 329 miles of range on a single charge. Proterra claims its 40-foot ZX5s (it also sells 35-foot ZX5s) have the most energy storage and longest drive range of any 40-foot electric bus currently available.According to a review by the SUN DAY Campaign of data recently released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), renewable energy sources (i.e., biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, wind) dominated new US electrical generating capacity additions during the first two-thirds of 2021.FERC’s latest monthly “Energy Infrastructure Update” report (with data through August 31, 2021) reveals that renewable energy sources accounted for 86.46% – 13,868 megawatts (MW) – of the 16,039 MW of new capacity added during the first eight months of the year. Wind led the capacity additions with 7,224 MW, followed closely by solar (6,585 MW). There were also small additions by hydropower (25 MW), geothermal (25 MW), and biomass (9 MW).Most of the balance (2,155 MW) was provided by natural gas. There has been no new capacity added this year by coal, and only 16 MW of new oil capacity have come online. Clean energy now provides more than a quarter (25.22%) of total US-available installed generating capacity. By comparison, a year ago, their share was only 23.22%. Five years ago, it was 18.39%, and a decade earlier it was 14.09%. Photo: “Gray County Wind Farm” by jimmywayne is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0",solar
2021/10/04,"British prime minister Boris Johnson will officially announce this week at the Conservative Party’s annual conference in Manchester that all of the UK’s electricity will be sourced from clean energy by 2035, according to the Times. But not everyone is happy that nuclear will be included in the mix.Johnson’s announcement comes as the UK prepares to host COP26 in Glasgow next month. Further, nearly 40% of Britain’s electricity is currently fueled by natural gas.In a front page story today, the Times broke the news:Boris Johnson will this week announce that all of Britain’s electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035 as he seeks to reduce the country’s dependence on gas and other fossil fuels, The Times has been told.The prime minister will use his conference speech to commit his party to plans to hugely increase investment in renewable and nuclear energy as Britain faces a crisis caused by a surge in the cost of gas.He is expected to argue that taking all electricity from green sources would be a significant step towards the government’s ambition to hit net-zero emissions by 2050, and reduce exposure to fluctuations in gas prices.The new target will require significant growth not only in offshore wind generation but also in nuclear capacity to provide a ‘baseload’ of electricity to cope with variable supply and demand. It will mean a minimum quadrupling of offshore wind from the present level over the coming decade.Johnson said yesterday on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show:What I’m saying is that we can do for our entire energy production by 2035 what we’re doing with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030.But not everyone is in favor of the use of nuclear power as part of the British government’s plan, and feel that wind and solar alone can do the job. For example, in June, guest writer Jonathan Porritt wrote for Greenpeace in an article titled, “We don’t need nuclear power to tackle climate change”: We should see nuclear as another 20th century technology, with an ever-diminishing role through into the 21st century.And according to the Associated Press:Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, welcomed what he called the British government’s realization “that gas needs to be taken out of the electricity system,” but said he was disappointed by the continuing commitment to nuclear energy.Do you think the UK’s clean energy plan should include nuclear? Why or why not? (Spoiler: We at Electrek agree with Porritt. It’s expensive, it’s a security threat, and there’s that small matter of the radioactive waste problem.)

It will be capable of carrying up to 16 Euro-pallets. Tevva says the total cost of ownership for its new truck is comparable to a diesel truck. The company is taking reservations now with a £1,000 deposit per truck.It offers a range of up to 160 miles (250 km) in pure battery electric vehicle (BEV) form, or up to 310 miles (500 km) with its patented range extender technology (REX), which has now been upgraded to use hydrogen fuel cells.The Tevva Truck will be manufactured at a new 11,000-square-meter (118,400-square-feet) factory in the London Thames Freeport area. Freeport is “an economic zone connecting Ford’s world-class Dagenham engine plant to the global ports at London Gateway and Tilbury, with an emphasis on introducing electric and autonomous vehicle technology along the A13 corridor into London.”Tevva’s new factory is expected to create an additional 1,000 skilled mechanical, software, engineering, and manufacturing jobs in the next 24 months.Tevva’s e-truck is expected to roll out in mid-2022 with a goal of producing 3,000 annually by 2023.The world’s longest subsea power cable that carries clean power from Norway to the UK is now live. The source of the clean energy is hydropower. It’s a joint venture between the UK’s National Grid and Norway’s system operator Statnett.The 450-mile (725km) cable runs between the Norwegian village of Kvilldal and the town of Blyth in Northumberland.The UK’s National Grid says that the 450-mile North Sea Link, as it’s called, will import enough hydropower at full 1,400-megawatt (MW) capacity to power 1.4 million homes. It will start with a maximum capacity of 700 MW and then ramp up to 1,400 MW over three months.The North Sea Link project cost £1.4 billion ($1.9 billion) and took six years to complete. It will avoid 23 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2030.The National Grid writes:When wind generation is high and electricity demand low in Britain, [North Sea Link] will enable renewable power to be exported from the UK, conserving water in Norway’s reservoirs. When demand is high in Britain and there is low wind generation, hydropower can be imported from Norway, helping to ensure secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supplies for UK consumers.ChargeUp Europe, the industry association for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure sector in Europe, today announced that French multinational energy management company Schneider Electric has become its 18th member.Schneider Electric integrates process and energy technologies for homes, buildings, data centers, infrastructure, and industries.ChargeUp Europe has more than 300,000 charging points in the European Union.",solar
2021/10/01,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The governors of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to build a new Midwestern electric vehicle charging network.Simply put, they want to make charging more accessible and easier to find across their five states in order to boost EV adoption. The five states will speed up the establishment of a network that supports medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles. They will coordinate their efforts to create consistent regulations and charging operations across the Midwest.The new plan is called the Regional Electric Vehicle Midwest Coalition, or REV Midwest. The memorandum of understanding states:Participating states will develop a coordinated approach to advance electrification that isinformed by industry, academic, and community engagement. Participating states will worktogether to enable an equitable transition to electric vehicles for all with specific considerationfor communities that are historically disadvantaged. REV Midwest will position states in theMidwest region to leverage and collectively increase public and private investment in electricvehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure.The Electrification Coalition released the following statement in response to the announcement of REV Midwest:The historic transition from the internal combustion engine to clean electric motors will pay enormous dividends for our health, environment, economy and national security. It will require a bold mix of policies, incentives, investments and infrastructure, and today’s announcement lays an important part of the foundation in the Midwest. We look forward to working with state leaders on the continued actions and policies necessary to accelerate this vital transformation.The price of natural gas in the US has more than doubled since this time last year, and it’s more than five times more expensive in Europe and Asia than a year ago. Further, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported yesterday that among 54 publicly traded crude oil producing companies, natural gas revenue accounted for 14% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2021. That’s the highest share among those oil-producing companies since at least 2018. So what should consumers do? Get off natural gas if possible – it’s a polluting, and now expensive, fossil fuel. We asked Michael Phillips, CEO of Sense, a technology company that makes a home energy monitor to track efficiency, cost, and reliability, what he thought good alternatives are.Phillips recommends replacing oil and natural gas burning furnaces with heat pump technology, either air source or geothermal, and replacing gas stoves with induction stoves. He also suggests using an electric or solar-powered hot water heater. (I have electric hot water heaters and had an induction hob in the UK, and love both. I plan on switching out my electric hob in my current home for induction.)Phillips said:Besides the spike in natural gas prices, gas powered furnaces are unhealthy and emit too much carbon. A new gas furnace can create 30 years of carbon emissions. We need to stop making those purchases.Photo: EVgo",solar
2021/09/30,"There’s a tariff battle under way within the US solar industry. On one side are project builders that rely on imported materials, and on the other side are domestic manufacturers.In August, a group of anonymous US solar manufacturers that calls itself the “American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention” asked the US Department of Commerce to investigate whether solar product imports from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam were unfair. The anonymous group claims that Chinese solar manufacturers are shifting products to those countries to avoid duties on products made in China.The US solar manufacturers want tariffs imposed on products from those three countries because they say they can’t compete with the less expensive Asian products. The solar project builders say the US won’t be able to ramp up clean energy in order to fight climate change without the imports, because the domestic manufacturing industry is still very small.The Department of Commerce issued questions to the anonymous group on Wednesday, including a request to identify themselves. The group says it’s chosen to be anonymous because it’s afraid of retribution, and the Commerce Department wants the group to explain who they think will exact retribution.The Department of Commerce says it will make a decision about tariffs and will issue a decision within 45 days of receiving a response from the anonymous group. Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which opposes the tariffs, issued the following statement in response late yesterday:We are disappointed that Commerce did not dismiss these meritless petitions outright. However, the detail and nature of the questions Commerce asked the anonymous petitioners clearly indicates that the petitioners have produced a filing largely devoid of the information the department needs to assess whether to initiate this case. We believe that when and if the petitioners amend their original submission, it will become abundantly clear that they have no case for circumvention.Read more: How US utilities are trying to block rooftop solar adoptionPhoto: “Bayview Home” by mjmonty is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar

It has spent $18,000 on targeted Facebook ads that have been viewed 2.2 million times, urging people to contact their member of Congress.The ads all convey similar messages that urge people to get their local representative to “vote no on higher energy costs” or vote against the “energy tax.”Have you seen API or AGA ads opposing clean energy on Facebook? Let us know in the comments below. General Motors (GM) announced today that it plans to source 100% clean energy to power its US sites by 2025 – five years earlier than previously announced, and 25 years ahead of its initial target that was set in 2016. By accelerating its clean energy goal, GM aims to avoid 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions that it would have produced between 2025 and 2030.Earlier this year, GM announced its Science Based Targets, as well as plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040, aligned with the aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. The company announced in June that it will invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles and plans to introduce more than 30 electric vehicle models globally by 2025.US independent solar comparison website SolarReviews has released a free online Solar Calculator that includes desired electricity offset, financing structures, options for battery storage, and electric vehicle ownership features.The calculator requires no personal information until you’re ready to receive actual quotes from solar providers, which is nice, because sometimes you want to get an initial idea without being bombarded by pitches.It’s easy to use, well designed, and intuitive.

2021/09/29,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):It’s no accident that the phrase “solar and storage” has become commonplace. There are 14.5 gigawatts (GW) of battery storage power capacity that are due to come online in the US from 2021 to 2024. Of that battery storage, 9.4 GW will be paired with a solar photovoltaic power plant, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Another 1.3 GW of battery storage will be co-located at sites with wind turbines or fossil fuels such as natural gas-fired plants. The remaining 4.0 GW of planned battery storage will be at standalone sites.The EIA spells out what at this point seems almost intuitive:Although factors such as cloud cover can affect solar generation, solar generators in particular can effectively pair with battery storage because of their relatively regular daily generation patterns. This predictability works well with battery systems because battery systems are limited in how long they can discharge their power capacity before needing to recharge. If paired with a wind turbine, for example, a battery system could go days before having the opportunity to fully recharge.The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) yesterday announced it’s increasing its goal for Solar+ Decade, aiming for solar to account for 30% of US electricity generation by 2030. The US organization’s previous goal was 20% by 2030, and this revision aligns with the Biden administration’s clean energy targets.To meet 30% solar by 2030, the solar industry must double its deployment pace. Without bold, long-term policy investments, solar will only account for 15% of electricity capacity by 2030, far short of what is needed to reduce emissions and address climate change.If the industry reaches 30% solar by 2030, the solar and storage industry will grow to 1 million workers and add more than $800 billion in new private sector investment.Meeting 30% of US energy capacity with solar would cut carbon emissions from the electricity sector by 50%.Vancouver-headquartered Ceylon Graphite (CYL:TSX-V), which holds a land package in Sri Lanka that contains historic vein graphite deposits, says it has achieved a significant breakthrough in the performance of its vein graphite anode material in coin cells for the lithium-ion battery market.In tests at WMG of the University of Warwick’s Energy Innovation Centre in the UK, Ceylon’s vein graphite anode material far exceeded comparable anodes made with standard synthetic commercial graphite.Ceylon claims that this is the first time in battery research that commercial spherodized vein graphite materials were tested in a lithium-ion battery in a coin cell.Ceylon CEO Don Baxter said:I expected very good results from our initial battery tests, but was excited to see my expectations being far exceeded by our vein graphite.The unique characteristics of our Sri Lankan vein graphite combined with our proprietary processing technologies produces a Li-ion battery with significantly higher power and energy as tested by WMG. You can read more about Ceylon Graphite’s findings here.",solar

The EPA summarizes:The proposed 2023-2026 [model year] standards would achieve significant GHG emissions reductions along with reductions in other pollutants. The proposal would result in substantial public health and welfare benefits, while providing consumers with savings from lower fuel costs. The proposal would incentivize technology available today to make vehicles cleaner and to encourage more hybrid and electric vehicle technology.Reuters notes:GM called the EPA’s proposal “historically stringent” and said the Biden administration should ensure automakers in compliance with EPA rules not be subject to civil penalties in the parallel National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fuel economy program “that may arise from the geographic location of its supply chain.”But 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, and several US cities yesterday called for even stricter vehicle emissions rules than the EPA has proposed.The transport sector accounts for nearly one-third of all US emissions.Read more: GM expands Ultium Charge 360 program to commercial fleets to accelerate EV adoptionUS Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm recently published an opinion piece in CNN explaining how President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda will create a clean energy system on a more resilient grid during extreme weather events. Here are key excerpts:Our power systems weren’t built to withstand extreme weather events. Without major investments to reinforce, modernize, and clean our grid, the question will not be whether it fails, but when.To keep the American people safe, we need to increase resilience to these potent storms — which first requires more transmission lines to transport power across long distances. This would reduce the likelihood that a local power plant going down during a storm will leave communities without electricity.We also need to ensure that the new infrastructure we’re building can weather the mounting climate impacts we know are coming. That means, for example, switching wooden poles for steel ones in reinforced concrete, and, where it makes sense, putting lines underground. In response to wildfires, Pacific Gas and Electric is working to bury 10,000 miles of power lines. We can replicate that effort in key areas most vulnerable to extreme weather.Even as most of New Orleans was in the dark, the residents of St. Peter Apartments enjoyed eight hours of electricity a day, thanks to the complex’s rooftop solar panels and onsite battery storage. We should connect more critical infrastructure and buildings to such renewable microgrids that can go online quickly and meet local needs. While we work to complete transmission upgrades spanning thousands of miles, cities and states can act quickly to deploy and incentivize these smaller-scale distributed energy projects.What else do you think the US power system needs in order to be more resilient? Let us know in the comments below.Sri Lanka will stop building new coal-fired power plants and achieve net zero by 2050, Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa said at the United Nations on Friday.The country has also set a target of sourcing 70% of all its energy from renewables by 2030. Reuters writes:Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and small and large hydro power plants together account for half of the island nation’s installed electricity capacity, with coal and oil-fired power accounting for the rest.Renewable and hydroelectric power currently account for about 35% of the country’s power demand.",solar

Jon Morton, VP of acquisitions at DSD, said of the project:DSD is extremely proud to be part of this unique project that provides all around benefits to the community.YSG Solar did an amazing job at leveraging incentives to bring renewable energy to an underserved community, while also improving the neighborhood at the same time.The project was selected as the first solar project for New York City Economic Development Corporation’s Accelerated Sales Tax Exemption Program, which provides a sales tax exemption of up to $100,000 for industrial construction or renovations in underserved communities.(And if we haven’t yet made it super clear, we at Electrek love solar on big warehouses – all that previously unused space put to good use!)Read more: New York City announces a massive clean energy planPhoto: First Solar",solar
2021/09/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Electrek reported on July 30 that battery cell technology developer KORE Power will build the first lithium-ion battery factory wholly owned by a US company, in Buckeye, Arizona. It will create a vital new US battery supply for electric vehicles and battery storage.The 1 million-square-foot manufacturing facility will be called the KOREPlex (rendering above). It will support up to 12 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery cell production.Now KORE has announced that it has signed a joint development agreement with Zero Electric Vehicles Inc., which is also finalizing a plan for a production facility and new headquarters, in Gilbert, Arizona.Simply put, ZEV converts fleet vehicles to electric. It manufactures electric powertrains for fleet customers with a commercially available, low-cost, fast-turnaround configuration for light- to medium-duty fleet vehicles.The KORE and ZEV teams will jointly tackle three key EV challenges: thermal management, safety, and module and pack configurability toward higher energy and power densities. KORE will provide ZEV with battery cells and supplies for their electrification solution through 2030.The joint teams will work out of KOREPlex, which is expected to be ready at the beginning of 2023; ZEV’s new headquarters and production facility; and at the Battery Cell Research laboratory at Arizona State University, in Mesa.Electricity generation from hydropower plants in the US is forecast by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) to be 14% lower in 2021 than in 2020. Extreme drought conditions are of course affecting much of the US West. California and the Pacific Northwest are particularly hard hit, and those states are home to the majority of US hydropower capacity. The EIA writes:In [our Short Term Energy Outlook], we forecast electricity generation for electricity market regions instead of state geographical boundaries. The latest STEO expects hydropower generation in the Northwest electricity region, which includes the Columbia River Basin and parts of other Rocky Mountain states, to total 120 billion kWh in 2021, a 12% decline from 2020. We expect hydropower generation in the California electricity region to be 49% lower in 2021 than in 2020, at 8.5 billion kWh.The EIA notes, for example, that the reservoir at Lake Oroville in California, the second-largest reservoir in California, hit a historic low of 35% in August 2021, which resulted in the Edward Hyatt Power Plant having to go offline for the first time since 1967.Read more: A huge California hydropower plant shuts down due to droughtPhoto: KORE Power",solar
2021/09/23,"The Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) and more than 35 other industry and environmental organizations, including the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in April to set national targets to curb the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrigerators, air conditioners, and other appliances. The EPA delivered today. It’s the first time the federal government has set national limits on HFCs. It’s also the Biden administration’s first concrete regulatory step to tackle emissions since the US’s announcement that it would slash emissions 50% by 2030.September 23 update: The EPA today released the following statement that confirms the finalization of the HFC rule:Today, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule establishing a comprehensive program to cap and phase down the production and consumption of climate-damaging hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the United States.This final rule will phase down the US production and consumption of HFCs by 85% over the next 15 years, as mandated by the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act that was enacted in December 2020.The AHRI represents more than 300 manufacturers of air conditioning, heating, and commercial refrigeration, and water heating equipment.The EPA has proposed to slash the use of HFCs, a potent climate-warming gas, by 85% over the next 15 years. The proposal would set annual “allocations” that gradually decline for each HFC producer and importer in the US. In December 2020, the EPA under the Biden administration passed the AIM Act. It directed that the EPA:[A]ddress HFCs by providing new authorities in three main areas: to phase down the production and consumption of listed HFCs, manage these HFCs and their substitutes, and facilitate the transition to next-generation technologies.That reversed the HFC deregulations implemented by the Trump administration in February 2020 that canceled requirements to fix HFC leaks.“The EPA estimates that phasing out HFCs could save the economy about $280 billion over the next three decades,” writes NPR, which then continues:Consumers will likely see little or no change in their appliances. New appliances will use safer refrigerants. If an older air conditioner or refrigerator needs its cooling gas replenished, the person repairing the appliance will be more likely to use an HFC alternative.EPA chief Michael Regan said:By phasing down HFCs, which can be hundreds to thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide at warming the planet, EPA is taking a major action to help keep global temperature rise in check.And David Doniger, senior strategic director in the Climate & Clean Energy program at Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement emailed to Electrek:Replacing HFCs is a critical and totally doable first step to head off the worst of the climate crisis, and we have safer alternatives ready to go that will save industry money in the bargain. The global HFC phasedown will avoid adding almost another degree Fahrenheit to our overheated world this century. This is a critical first step toward meeting our ambitious climate goals.The NRDC points out that the “US production phasedown will produce huge benefits, avoiding HFC use in the US by the equivalent of 2 billion metric tons of CO2 over the 15-year phasedown period.”",solar
2021/09/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Apex Clean Energy is developing the Big Bend project, which will be one of Minnesota’s largest wind farms that will be paired with a big solar array near Comfrey, southwest of Minneapolis.Big Bend will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity. It’s scheduled to come online by the end of 2023.The Minnesota Historical Society and the Upper and Lower Sioux Indian communities objected to the original Big Bend plan, because they felt it was too close to the Jeffers Petroglyphs, which features around 5,000 ancient sacred Native American rock carvings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The carvings are as much as 7,000 years old and are considered sacred to several tribal nations. And the turbines were close, initially – around 2 miles away.But instead of trying to kill the clean energy project dead, the three groups worked with Apex and the state to reach a compromise. The groups wanted at least an 8-mile buffer. The Minnesota Star Tribune explains:Apex Clean Energy, Big Bend’s developer, revised the project so that all but two of the 50-plus turbines would be at least 7 miles from the petroglyphs. The remaining two would be be 6.5 to 7 miles away. Apex, the tribes, and the historical society signed a settlement agreement earlier this month.Robert Larsen, council president of the Lower Sioux Indian Community, said:It is not perfect from our point of view, and it is not perfect from their point of view, but that is a sign of good negotiation.Electrek’s Take: NIMBYism is quickly and increasingly becoming a problem as clean energy projects multiply. Residents sometimes use “environmental” reasons as a red herring, but more often than not, they simply feel turbines or solar panels ruin their view. The Big Bend project is an example of a valid concern on the part of the tribes and the historical society over the Jeffers Petroglyphs, and a reasonable response from Apex Clean Energy. Ultimately, clean energy will help protect the petroglyphs. This compromise should serve as a model for other communities to follow.

It is both Zero Emissions Day – the global 24-hour moratorium on the use of fossil fuels – and the third virtual meeting of the Zero Emissions Vehicle Transition Council, which represents over 50% of the global car market.We – the governments of the UK and the Netherlands – support the European Commission’s proposals being agreed by the Member States and the European Parliament and, ahead of COP26, call on the US, EU, China, and other major markets to join forces in committing to 100% of new cars and vans being zero-emission by 2035 at the latest. The more countries that make this commitment, the faster investment will shift to EVs, and the faster their costs will come down.  The European Commission has submitted a plan for all new registered EU vehicles to be zero emission by 2035, but it is not yet finalized. Shapps and Van Weyenberg also call on automakers to abandon gas cars:Fiat, Jaguar Land Rover, Ford Europe, and VW Europe have all recently committed to selling 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2030 – 2035, and we call on other manufacturers to match this commitment ahead of COP26.

After Virginia lawmakers passed the Clean Economy Act, solar in the commonwealth skyrocketed. By clarifying that Virginia’s future will be powered by clean energy, lawmakers opened the door for renewable energy to grow in Virginia. Dominion’s proposed solar projects will help Virginia break free from fossil fuels and get more of its energy from renewable sources like the sun.Virginia has enough technical solar potential to meet all of the state’s 2020 electricity consumption.

It sought to understand how differences in fleet locations, use patterns, fleet sizes, and other factors impact fleet operators’ charging needs. The study also explored how electric demand could affect specific parts of the electric distribution and transmission system. It identified more than 50 operating fleets, analyzed their potential charging behavior and power needs, and mapped them to electric distribution lines.Researchers determined that parts of the electric grid are at risk of eventually being overloaded by large vehicles’ charging needs if system upgrades or alternative solutions are not simultaneously implemented.The study recommends that utilities, system operators, fleet operators, and policymakers begin planning for medium- and long-term fleet electrification. The study suggests that an “all-options” approach is considered: transmission, distribution, distributed resources, and managed charging programs. ",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix.

The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/09/14,"Oil giant Chevron USA and Gevo, a Douglas County, Colorado-headquartered renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company, today announced a letter of intent to jointly invest in building and operating one or more new facilities that will process inedible corn to produce sustainable aviation fuel.On September 9, as Electrek reported, major US airlines pledged to voluntarily make 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available to US aircraft operators to reduce aviation emissions by 20% by 2030. Aviation fuel demand by 2050 is currently projected to be around 35 billion gallons per year, so there’s certainly going to be a huge demand for a lot of SAF.Using its existing technology, Gevo will produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable blending components for motor gasoline to lower its life cycle carbon intensity. Chevron will co-invest with Gevo in one or more projects, and it will have the right to sell around 150 million gallons of the SAF annually to market to customers. The companies’ announcement does not yet detail where the SAF will be produced, or how much they will produce.The US Department of Energy explains what SAF is:SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel but with a smaller carbon footprint. Depending on the feedstock and technologies used to produce it, SAF can reduce life cycle GHG emissions dramatically compared to conventional jet fuel. Some emerging SAF pathways even have a net-negative GHG footprint.Growing, sourcing, and producing SAF from renewable and waste resources can create new economic opportunities in farming communities, improve the environment, and even boost aircraft performance.SAF can be made from the following:Check out this brief backgrounder video on SAF:Read more: US airlines boost their 2030 target for sustainable aviation fuel by 50%Photo: Gevo",solar
2021/09/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The global pipeline of proposed coal plants has collapsed by 76% since the Paris Agreement in 2015, according to a new report by E3G. The independent European think tank reports:Since 2015, 44 governments (27 in the OECD & EU, 17 elsewhere) have already committed to no new coal, opening a pathway for remaining countries that are yet to act. We find that a further 40 countries (eight in the OECD & EU, 32 elsewhere) are without any projects in the pre-construction pipeline and are in a position where they could readily commit to “no new coal.”Globally, 1,175 GW of planned coal-fired power projects have been cancelled since 2015. Accelerating market trends have combined with new government policies and sustained civil society opposition to coal. The world has avoided a 56% expansion of the total global coal fleet (as of June 2021), which would have been equivalent to adding a second China (1,047GW) to global coal capacity.China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, and Bangladesh account for over four-fifths of the world’s remaining coal plant pipeline as of July 2021. If those six countries took action, it would eliminate 82% of the pre-construction pipeline.The remaining 18% is spread across a further 31 countries, and 16 of those have just one project. China is the last remaining major provider of public finance for overseas coal projects. If China ended that, it would result in the cancellation of more than 40 gigawatts (GW) of pipeline projects in 20 countries.Read more: Wyoming is the No. 1 US coal producer, but its largest utility is ditching the fossil fuelSupply chain constraints are leading to price increases across every solar market segment, despite the addition of 5.7 GW of solar capacity in the second quarter of 2021, according to the US Solar Market Insight report released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.This is the first time that solar prices have increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in every market segment since Wood Mackenzie began modeling system price data in 2014. Prices increased the most for the utility-scale segment at about 6% year-over-year. Many solar developers have sufficient inventory for 2021 projects but will begin to see price increases in 2022, the report says. SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said:This is a critical moment for our climate future but price increases, supply chain disruptions, and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid.If we want to incentivize domestic manufacturing and drive enough solar deployment to tackle the climate crisis, we must see action from our federal leaders.Despite this challenge, the solar industry accounted for 56% of all new US electric capacity additions in the first half of 2021. The US officially surpassed 3 million solar installations in the second quarter, driven by a strong recovery in the residential sector after it was hit by the pandemic.New forecasts from Wood Mackenzie show that the US will average just over 29 GW of new annual solar capacity additions through 2026. But this is far short of the deployment pace needed to reach US President Joe Biden’s 2035 clean energy targets. To reach these targets the solar industry must install more than 80 GW of solar annually from 2022 through 2035.Photo: PNAS",solar
2021/09/13,"Missouri’s largest wind farm has been switching off at night since April 19 to avoid killing endangered and threatened bats. Is this good environmental stewardship, or is it throwing out the baby with the bathwater?The High Prairie Renewable Energy Center, which is in northeastern Missouri, is currently the largest wind farm in the state. The St. Louis-based electric utility Ameren Missouri bought High Prairie from a developer in 2020 and started operations then.Its 175 wind turbines sit on more than 60,000 acres. It’s capable of producing 400 megawatts of power, but it’s not currently producing at full capacity.That’s because there have been problems with bats (and birds) dying at the wind farm, as a report from the US Fish and Wildlife service details:Due to the potential risk of take of the federally endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and federally threatened northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) during operations, Ameren applied for an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) for these species, as well as for the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). In the interim, the Project operated under a Technical Assistance Letter (TAL) from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).To avoid potential effects to the Indiana bat and northern long-eared bat, the TAL required feathering of all turbines below 6.9 meters-per-second (m/s) for 0.5 hour before sunset to 0.5 hour after sunrise when air temperatures were above 50°F from March 15 through October 31 based on the 10-minute rolling average at each individual turbine. Due to the fatality of a male Indiana bat at the Project in September 2020, Ameren voluntarily increased the avoidance measures to involve no operation of the turbines when temperatures were above 50°F starting on March 15, 2021. Another fatality was discovered on April 15, 2021; Ameren voluntarily stopped all nighttime operations starting on April 19, 2021, but continued post-construction monitoring under the TAL until the ITP was issued on May 14, 2021.To clarify, feathering is when wind turbine blades are prevented from turning when they are not operational. This may reduce bat fatalities, which have been found to be higher at low wind speeds, according to the website Conservation Evidence.Further, an incidental take permit is a permit issued under Section 10 of the US Endangered Species Act to private, non-federal entities undertaking otherwise lawful projects that might result in the take of an endangered or threatened species.The June 2021 report stated that four bats and 52 birds were discovered dead on the wind farm. Ameren voluntarily stopped running the wind farm at night from April. Consumer advocates’ group the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, and the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers, which advocates for large commercial and industrial power customers, want the amount customers pay to reimburse Ameren for the cost of High Prairie wind farm reduced, due to the wind farm not currently operating at night.As a result of High Prairie’s nighttime pause, Ameren is also at risk of failing to meet a state requirement this year that requires utilities generate at least 15% of their power from clean energy.Once migration and mating season is over this fall, High Prairie will likely resume 24-hour operation. We asked Ameren in a phone call what its plans are for the wind farm, and its spokesperson said the utility would provide further, more specific updates soon. But in the meantime, it sent over its official statement from Ajay Arora, Ameren Missouri’s chief renewable development officer:The High Prairie Renewable Energy Center began delivering clean energy to customers more than nine months ago. It operates every day for the benefit of all of our customers, and we anticipate it will continue to do so for decades to come. Throughout siting, construction, permitting, and now generating clean energy at High Prairie, Ameren Missouri has worked closely with US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Missouri Department of Conservation.Ameren is being pressured by local and environmental groups to stop running turbines at night, and the utility has accommodated that. Of course we have to protect endangered species and birds. But are Missouri’s bats being used as an excuse by groups who just don’t want anything to do with clean energy, like Canadian-based Mothers Against Wind Turbines, who want to “[protect] children exposed to the effects of industrial wind turbines”?As Electrek noted at the end of July (see “Read More” below) when a group of residents opposed a huge Nevada wind farm in the name of animal protection while happily racing their ATVs around the desert, and Bloomberg just addressed, using wildlife as an excuse to hinder clean energy just makes the problems clean energy is trying to solve even worse. Climate change is destroying the natural habitats of animals and plants all over the world. It won’t be wind turbines that wipe out endangered bats; it will be fossil-fuel emissions and resulting global warming.Is whitewashing in the name of “environmentalism” to stop clean energy projects on the rise as the US transitions to clean energy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.Read more: The US’s largest solar farm is canceled because Nevada locals don’t want to look at itPhoto: Ameren Missouri",solar
2021/09/10,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Major US airlines yesterday pledged to voluntarily make 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel available to US aircraft operators in order to reduce aviation emissions by 20% by 2030.Airlines for America (A4A), an industry trade group that includes United Airlines, Southwest, Delta, American, and others, announced a 2030 goal of producing and deploying 2 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in March. The group will work with the US government and other stakeholders to achieve today’s higher goal. The new target is a 50% boost.Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fat and is, at present, rarely used.At a White House roundtable on sustainable aviation yesterday, A4A CEO Nicholas E. Calio highlighted the need for:[P]ositive government policy support – including a $1.50-$2.00 per gallon SAF blender’s tax credit; public-private SAF research, development and deployment programs, such as a new SAF and low emissions technology grant program under consideration by Congress; and other collaborative initiatives – to help enable the US aviation industry to reach its ambitious new 2030 SAF goal and its 2050 net-zero emissions goal.The White House Fact Sheet on sustainable fuels in American aviation pointed out yesterday: Aviation (including all non-military flights within and departing from the United States) represents 11% of United States transportation-related emissions. Without increased action, aviation’s share of emissions is likely to increase as more people and goods fly. That is why leadership and innovation in this sector is so essential if we hope to put the aviation industry, and the economy, on track to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Ultimately, the White House is calling for sufficient SAF to meet 100% of aviation fuel demand by 2050, which is currently projected to be around 35 billion gallons per year.Read more: Boeing says it will deliver 100% biofuel planes by 2030A new study, called “Help Wanted: Diversity in Clean Energy,” highlights the need for equity in clean energy:Despite its broad range of businesses, including construction, utilities, manufacturing, professional services, and repair and maintenance, the clean energy sector is dominated by white men.The study by BW Research Partnership was done in collaboration with E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs), The Alliance to Save Energy, American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE), Black Owners of Solar Services (BOSS), and Energy Efficiency for All (EEFA).Here are the report’s key findings:Nicole Sitaraman, policy committee chair of BOSS and vice president of strategic engagement at Sustainable Capital Advisors, said in a statement emailed to Electrek:We are living in a climate crisis in which Black communities are suffering disproportionately.  Clean energy industries often overlook the innovation, expertise, and insight that Black communities possess. It is time to change that. We will not reach our climate mitigation and adaptation goals without the full participation and leadership of people of color in the clean energy sector. This report presents important data showing the urgency of diversifying this space to achieve an equitable climate resilient future.Photo: “American Airlines MD-82 N455AA” by caribb is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0",solar
2021/09/09,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) released its flagship Global Offshore Wind Report 2021 today. The global offshore wind industry installed 6.1 GW of capacity in 2020, down slightly from a record 6.24 GW in 2019.However, GWEC expects 2021 to set a new record as China’s offshore wind sector rushes to install 7.5 GW ahead of the expiry of current feed in tariffs (FITs).The GWEC writes:China led the world in new installations for the third year in a row with more than 3 GW of offshore wind grid connected in 2020. Steady growth in Europe accounted for the majority of remaining new capacity, led by the Netherlands, which installed nearly 1.5 GW of new offshore wind in 2020, followed by Belgium (706 MW).The report forecasts 235 GW of new offshore wind capacity will be installed over the next decade under current policies. That capacity is seven times bigger than the current market size, and is a 15% increase on the previous year’s forecasts.In order to achieve the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5C, the world needs 2,000 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2050, based on calculations by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). But the new GWEC report finds current global wind targets account for only 560 GW.The world – and especially North America – still has a long way to go when it comes to utilizing offshore wind as a clean energy source.Read more: Siemens Gamesa claims world’s first recyclable offshore wind turbine bladeMore than half of the world’s fossil fuels have to stay in the ground in order to slow global warming, according to a new study posted on Nature yesterday. The study, published by University College London researchers, is titled “Unextractable fossil fuels in a 1.5 °C world,” and specifically, it says that countries not only need to switch to clean energy, but also to set hard, strict limits on fossil fuel extraction.In order for the world to have a 50% shot at achieving the Paris Agreement 1.5C global warming limit, 58% of oil, 59% of natural gas, and 89% of coal must stay in the ground. Further, oil and gas production must decline globally by 3% annually until 2050. The study’s abstract states:This implies that most regions must reach peak production now or during the next decade, rendering many operational and planned fossil fuel projects unviable. We probably present an underestimate of the production changes required, because a greater than 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5 °C requires more carbon to stay in the ground and because of uncertainties around the timely deployment of negative emission technologies at scale.The authors stressed in a call with press that theirs is likely an underestimate because there isn’t a universal carbon budget. And as Grist writes:The paper uses a carbon budget of 580 billion metric tons, an amount that is estimated to give only a 50% chance of stabilizing the global climate at 1.5C above preindustrial temperatures. [T]he model that the authors used to arrive at their fossil fuel quota actually allows the world to emit more than 580 billion metric tons of carbon and for temperatures to temporarily rise to 1.8C before settling back down to 1.5C by the end of this century.",solar
2021/09/08,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):As onshore wind farms rapidly multiply in the US, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory decided to run tests on the noise levels of wind turbines. So it tested a new technique that wind farm owners and turbine manufacturers are using to increase wind farms’ performance called wake steering, to see if it increases noise:Wakes are regions where winds slow behind a wind turbine, which can decrease energy production of downwind turbines. By yawing wind turbines – turning them to face the wind at slightly different angles – wind plant operators can steer wakes, decreasing energy production for specific turbines but increasing production for the entire wind plant. Before yawing becomes the go-to technique for plants, wind plant developers need to know if it increases (or decreases) noise.Researchers placed 11 microphones beneath a US Department of Energy-owned, GE, 1.5-megawatt wind turbine. The microphones collected noise across the range of frequencies that humans can detect. They also captured “full-field data” to measure how noise fluctuates across a large area.The researchers thought yawing would increase noise because of acoustic emission model predictions, but they got a surprise: It actually slightly decreased noise. (And it wasn’t very loud to begin with.)So if an onshore wind farm uses wake steering, then it can create more energy as a whole and, bonus, potentially decrease noise, too. Good news.Hydropower supplied 66% of Brazil’s electricity demand in 2020. Wind and solar have grown quickly in recent years and made up a combined 11% share of Brazil’s electricity generation in 2020.Further, biomass makes up 8%, fossil fuels supply 12% of electricity generation, and nuclear makes up 2%.According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA):National electricity reliability is challenged because of the country’s reliance on one resource (hydropower), the long distance between hydropower generation, and demand centers, continued drought conditions, and deforestation.Unfortunately, Brazil is trying to grow its natural gas supply to diversify. It’s developing its offshore natural gas reserves that are mostly in the south, off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.However, the EIA reports:Non-hydro renewables are the fastest-growing technologies in Brazil’s generation mix. With 4,600 miles of windy coastline, Brazil has abundant wind resources. Wind capacity in Brazil, which totaled 17,198 MW in 2020, is growing as new projects come online. One of these projects, Lagoa dos Ventos, began commercial operations in June 2021 and is the largest wind farm in South America. Although solar still represents a small share of the country’s generation mix, it more than doubled between 2018 and 2020, from 3.5 billion kWh to 6.7 billion kWh.In the Brazilian government’s latest 10-year plan, it forecasts that renewable sources will account for most of the additions to installed power capacity expansion by 2030. The largest forecast addition will come from solar.Photo: Dennis Shroeder/NREL",solar
2021/09/07,"Siemens Gamesa has launched what it claims is the world’s first recyclable offshore wind turbine blade. The “RecyclableBlade” is ready for commercial use offshore, and Siemens Gamesa has already made agreements with three customers. The Spanish renewable company’s first six 266-feet-long (81-meter-long) RecyclableBlades have been produced at its blade factory in Aalborg, Denmark.This announcement is a big step toward Siemens Gamesa’s goal to make turbines fully recyclable by 2040.Siemens Gamesa is working closely with German energy company RWE to install and pilot RecyclableBlades at the Kaskasi offshore wind farm in Germany, which should be working from 2022. It’s also working with France-based EDF Renewables to deploy several sets of RecyclableBlade at a future offshore project. And finally, it’s working with Germany’s WPD with the intention to install sets of the RecyclableBlade at one of their future offshore wind farms.According to Siemens Gamesa:Siemens Gamesa wind turbine blades are made from a combination of materials cast together with resin to form a strong and flexible lightweight structure. The chemical structure of this new resin type makes it possible to efficiently separate the resin from the other components at end of the blade’s working life. This mild process protects the properties of the materials in the blade, in contrast to other existing ways of recycling conventional wind turbine blades.So, once it’s time to recycle the blade, it’s immersed into a heated, mild acidic solution, which will separate the resin from the fiberglass, plastic, wood, and metals. The separated materials can then be recovered, rinsed, and dried. The materials are now ready to be used in new products matching their technical properties, such as in the auto industry, or in consumer goods such as flight cases and flatscreen casings. Check out this short video that illustrates the blades and the recycling process:85% of a wind turbine is already recyclable, but until this breakthrough, it has been inherently difficult to recycle the wind turbine blades in a cost-efficient way.What to do with wind turbine blades after their life cycle ends has been a point of contention in this rapidly growing clean energy sector. Blade recycling will avoid a lot of landfill.According to Siemens Gamesa, more than 200,000 blades could now be recycled, based on all new offshore projects globally projected until 2050. That’s a great leap forward for the wind industry. And the really cool thing is that the company is capable of recycling the blades now.Read more: Siemens spin-offs to develop offshore wind turbines that produce green hydrogenPhoto: Siemens Gamesa",solar

The 604 megawatt (MW) wind farm is Scandinavia’s largest and will increase Danish wind power production by 16%. It features 72 offshore wind turbines with a height of 617 feet (188 meters) and a capacity corresponding to the annual energy consumption of around 600,000 Danish households.The wind farm covers an area of 51 square miles (132 square kilometers), and about 106 miles (170 kilometers) of underwater cables have been laid.Kriegers Flak is in the Baltic Sea, 9-25 miles (15-40 kilometers) off the coast of Denmark. It will form part of a new 400 MW interconnector between Denmark and Germany.On July 28, Electrek reported that a judge ruled that digging at a lithium mine site in Nevada could proceed, after environmentalists claimed the mining would harm wildlife: Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno, Nevada, ruled late last week that Vancouver, Canada-headquartered Lithium Americas Corp can conduct excavation work at its Thacker Pass pre-feasibility stage lithium mine site in Humboldt County, Nevada.Du said environmentalists “failed to meet their burden to show they will be irreparably harmed,” according to Reuters.On Friday, Du denied another bid to halt digging. Three Native American tribes claimed the excavation work would desecrate an area that they believe holds artifacts and ancestral remains.Reuters reports:Du said the Native Americans did not prove the US government failed to properly consult them during the permitting process.Du said, though, that she was not dismissing all the Native Americans’ arguments, but felt bound by existing laws to deny their request.“This order does not resolve the merits of the tribes’ claims,” Du said in her 22-page ruling.In response, Lithium Americas chief executive Jon Evans told Reuters:We’ve always been committed to doing this the right way by respecting our neighbors, and we are pleased today’s ruling recognizes our efforts.Thacker Pass could become the largest US source of lithium, which is vital for electric vehicle batteries. Du’s final decision on the mine will be published by early 2022.Photo: Vattenfall",solar
2021/09/06,"The electric inland ship Alphenaar today sailed its maiden voyage, from Alphen aan den Rijn to Moerdijk in the Netherlands, for Dutch beer giant Heineken. The Alphenaar is the first electric inland shipping vessel in the Netherlands to launch – and it uses swappable batteries.Its manufacturer, Rotterdam-based Zero Emission Services (ZES), explains how its swappable batteries – what it calls “exchangeable energy containers” – work:Barges have a capacity varying from 500 to 1000 kW. With a ZESpack of 2000 kWh, a barge can sail for 2 to 4 hours; with 2 ZESpacks on board, it can travel a distance of 60 to 120 km. And there’s zero emission: the battery containers are charged with green energy, and the barge’s electrical powertrain ensures that no CO2, nitrogen or particulate matter is emitted. In addition, a ZES ship makes hardly any noise. The battery containers can also be used to stabilize the energy grid. ZES was founded by Wartsila, Engie, ING, and the Port of Rotterdam in July 2020.Here’s a short video explainer:The batteries work for new and existing inland vessels. Ships must be equipped with an electric propulsion line. Further:This systemic change involves a total cost of €20 million for the first phase. Financial support is provided by ING bank, ENGIE, Wärtsilä, the Port of Rotterdam Authority, and the Dutch government. The government’s contribution is in the form of a grant from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Works and a grant from the Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland supporting the goal of making transport more sustainable.  Here’s how the swappable batteries work: Put fully charged battery containers in, and when the ship arrives at the next terminal, take the used batteries out and replace them with fresh batteries in just 15 minutes. The charging station can recharge 2 ZESpacks at the same time in 2.5 hours.Companies use a pay-per-use model – ship owners rent the battery container. ZES explains:The financing concept can best be compared to a home energy bill: you pay a fixed charge for the connection, and an additional amount for the energy used.Alphenaar is a beer-run ship for Heineken and its transport company CCT. Heineken is ZES’ first customer. The Alphenaar will sail daily from its brewery in Moerdijk to the port of Rotterdam. ZES’ goal is to make all inland shipping in the Netherlands emissions free – and this country of canals has a lot of inland shipping. More than one-third of all goods and 80% of bulk transportation take place using inland waterways.Here’s the Alphenaar in action today:Read more: Meet the world’s first electric autonomous container shipPhoto: ZES",solar
2021/09/06,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):German wind turbine maker Nordex today announced it will join competitors such as Siemens Gamesa, GE, and Vestas to offer a 6 MW onshore turbine, its first. The new turbine will be designed for moderate and light-wind regions.The N163/6.X turbine has been added to Nordex’s Delta4000 product series, which was introduced in 2017 and already features 4 MW and 5 MW onshore turbines. Nordex writes:Compared to its sister model in the 5 MW class – the N163/5.X – the N163/6.X is able to produce an up to 7% higher annual energy yield, thanks to its much higher rated output.A more efficient gearbox is used to achieve the higher rated output in the 6 MW range and the electrical system of the Delta4000 product series has been adapted by raising the nominal voltage and using an improved cooling system.

Here is an excerpt (and click here to read it in full):[W]e – the editors of health journals worldwide – call for urgent action to keep average global temperature increases below 1.5C, halt the destruction of nature, and protect health……Many governments met the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented funding. The environmental crisis demands a similar emergency response. Huge investment will be needed, beyond what is being considered or delivered anywhere in the world. But such investments will produce huge positive health and economic outcomes. These include high-quality jobs, reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, and improved housing and diet. Better air quality alone would realize health benefits that easily offset the global costs of emissions reductions……We, as editors of health journals, call for governments and other leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world finally changes course.Photo: Nordex",solar
2021/09/03,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Royal Dutch Shell announced on Wednesday that it will install 50,000 on-street electric vehicle charging points in the UK by 2025. Ubitricity, which Shell bought in February, is the UK’s largest public EV charging network, and it will install the new charging points.Shell will support local authorities with a financing offer to install new ubitricity on-street chargers in towns and cities across the UK at potentially zero cost.More than 60% of UK households in cities and urban areas don’t have their own parking spaces, so rapidly increasing on-street charging is a priority in Britain.Ubitricity currently operates around 3,600 chargers in the UK. It holds 13.1% of the UK’s car charging points market. BP Pulse comes in second at 12%. (Tesla Supercharger is 2.9%.)According to a report published by the British government in July, between 280,000 and 480,000 charging points will be needed in Britain by 2030, more than 10 times the existing number of around 25,000 chargers.The UK will ban all new gas and diesel cars by 2030.Read more: Shell buys Ubitricity, UK’s largest EV charging networkThe villages of Brockport and Lima have activated what is claimed by Joule Community Power to be the first opt-out community choice solar program in the US. In other words, the energy supply defaults to clean energy.It’s part of Joule Community Power’s Finger Lakes Community Choice aggregation program in western New York State.Brockport and Lima have partnered with six local community solar farms that are expected to generate a combined 28 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually. As each solar farm begins to generate power, subscribers will benefit from savings. The solar farms are expected to go live in October 2021, and all residents will be covered by spring 2022.Opt-out community choice solar means that all eligible residents are automatically enrolled in the program without having to sign a contract, undergo a credit screen, or have solar panels installed on their homes. Should a resident wish to disenroll from the program, they are free to do so at any time with no penalty.Leaders can also choose to roll out opt-out community choice solar to low- and medium-income (LMI) residents first. The Lima and Brockport opt-out community choice solar program will benefit about 500 LMI households.Jessica Stromback, CEO of Joule Assets, explained to Electrek why the model is successful via email:There is a concerted 60-day initial education effort using community communication channels – such as local news outlets, social media accounts, public events, press, open Q&A sessions, etc. – to reach and inform the local community. The community solar program offers a guaranteed 10% savings off the solar credits on electricity bills. The difference between traditional opt-in programs and this new opt-out solar program is stark: For opt-in community solar programs, the average enrollment rate is only 2-3% of the pool of eligible program participants. In comparison, we expect the average enrollment rate of an opt-out community choice solar program to be around 90%.Barcelona-headquartered electric vehicle charger company Wallbox is going to unveil its newest charger, Hypernova, at the IAA MOBILITY 2021 show in Munich next week.Wallbox claims that the 350 kiloWatt Hypernova can charge a car in under 15 minutes.

2021/09/02,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):US shipments of solar panels reached a record high of 21.8 million peak kilowatts (kW) in 2020, 5.4 million peak kW more than in 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).Solar panel shipments include imports, exports, and panels produced and sold domestically. The shipment increase occurred for the following reasons:The EIA points out:The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) was set to decrease from 26% to 22% at the end of 2020. Some of the solar capacity growth in 2020 was a result of a rush to get projects installed before the expected ITC decrease. However, in December 2020, Congress passed an extension of the ITC, providing a 26% tax credit for solar systems installed from 2020 to 2022 and 22% for systems installed in 2023.The average solar shipment value dropped from $1.96 per peak watt in 2010 to $0.38 per peak watt in 2020. This was largely caused by lower supply chain costs and an oversupply of modules because of increased production.In 2020, 89% of US solar panel shipments were imports.Read more: Scientists develop ‘true’ bifacial solar cells with 29% power outputMore onshore wind energy was installed in the US in 2020 than any other energy source, accounting for 42% of new US energy capacity, and outpacing solar for the first time in years.The 2021 edition of the US Department of Energy’s “Land-Based Wind Market Report,” prepared by DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, detailed a record 16,836 megawatts (MW) of new utility-scale land-based wind power capacity added in 2020.

2021/09/01,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Bifacial solar cells aren’t new, but scientists at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra claim that they’ve developed what principal investigator Dr. Kean Chern Fong says is “a true bifacial solar cell, as it has nearly symmetrical power generation capacity on both surfaces of the device.” Fong said:Bifacial solar cells are becoming increasingly important in the roll out of solar farms and are expected to have a market share of over 50% in the next five years.And chief investigator Dr. Marco Ernst said:This is a world record for selectively laser-doped solar cells and among the highest efficiency bifacial solar cells.The team used a technique it calls “laser doping,” which uses lasers to locally increase electrical conductivity:This allowed the research team to achieve a front conversion efficiency of 24.3% and a rear conversion efficiency of 23.4%, representing a bifacial factor of 96.3%.This performance represents an effective power output of approximately 29%, well exceeding the performance of the best single-sided silicon solar cell. Of course, weather and geography will have a large impact on the efficiency of ANU’s bifacial solar cells. An ideal climate would be desert with little vegetation, such as a 125MW solar project in Oman, whose developer claims is the largest single-unit solar farm using bifacial modules in the world.Read more: JPMorgan Chase leads with the world’s largest bifacial solar rooftop — and lending to fossil-fuel companies, moreCorporate carbon offset schemes enable companies to invest in environmental projects in order to balance out their own carbon footprints. And on Thursday, a 1-megawatt solar farm will break ground in Jackson, Tennessee, that will be able to power 200 homes.

Former governor Phil Bredesen (D-TN) is one of the company founders.Solar provided a meager 0.56% of Tennessee’s electricity as of first quarter 2021, so even 1 MW is cause for celebration. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides Tennessee’s bigger solar picture:By early 2021, utility-scale solar power sites with a combined generating capacity of 182 megawatts were operating in the state. The state’s largest, a 53-megawatt solar farm, came online in December 2018. A new 150-megawatt solar farm is scheduled to begin operating in the state at the end of 2021. In 2020, about one-fourth of Tennessee’s solar power generation came from customer-sited, small-scale (less than 1 megawatt each) solar PV installations that are located mostly on residential and business rooftops.Tennessee is projected to install 1,740 MW of solar over the next five years.Photo: Eric Byler/The Australian National University",solar
2021/08/31,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):As of the latest update posted on Monday afternoon, 94.6% of oil production and 93.6% of natural gas production was offline in the Gulf of Mexico due to Category 4 Hurricane Ida, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).The BSEE reports:After the storm has passed, facilities will be inspected. Once all standard checks have been completed, production from undamaged facilities will be brought back online immediately. Facilities sustaining damage may take longer to bring back online.BSEE will continue to update the evacuation and shut-in statistics at 1 p.m. CDT each day as appropriate. This survey is reflective of 25 companies’ reports as of 11:30 CDT [Monday].US Gulf of Mexico offshore oil production accounts for about 17% of total US crude oil production and 5% of total US dry natural gas production, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Further:Over 45% of total US petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf coast, as well as 51% of total US natural gas processing plant capacity.Six refineries in the area, near New Orleans, are shut down, and the other three refineries in the area, near Baton Rouge, are apparently operating at reduced levels.So what does that mean for US gas-car drivers? Price hikes. CNN explains:The week after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, the average price of a gallon of regular gas shot up 46 cents, to $3.07 a gallon, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. That 18% jump in prices was the largest one-week percentage spike in data going back to the 1991 Gulf War. It took two months for gas prices to return to the pre-Katrina levels after that storm.Mark Jenkins, spokesman for the American Automobile Association, said:Based on overnight movement in the futures market, a 10-20 cent jump at the pump is not out of the question. Widespread power outages also occurred in Louisiana, as all eight transmission lines went down at the same time. As of Tuesday morning, most of southeastern Louisiana was still completely without power, and Mississippi and Alabama were also experiencing outages. Utility company Entergy writes:The full assessment of damage could take several days, since many areas are currently inaccessible either by roadways. Based on historical restoration times, customers in the direct path of a storm as intense as Hurricane Ida could experience outages for more than three weeks. While 90% of customers will be restored sooner, customers in the hardest-hit areas should plan for the possibility of experiencing extended power outages.Is there a way to avoid the blackout that New Orleans is now experiencing, despite opening a new natural gas power plant there last year that was supposed to prevent exactly that? (Entergy doesn’t yet have an explanation for the gas plant’s failure.) The New York Times writes:The Biden administration has planned tens of billions of dollars to add more transmission lines to carry more solar and wind power from one region of the country to another. But some energy experts said the increasing frequency of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters argues against a big investment in power lines and for greater investment in smaller-scale systems like rooftop solar panels and batteries. Because small systems are placed at many homes, businesses, schools, and other buildings, some continue to function even when others are damaged, providing much-needed energy during and after disasters.The Times spoke to one New Orleans couple – ironically, a retired engineer at oil giant Royal Dutch Shell – who has solar and storage, and thus power. So is household solar and battery storage the answer to resiliency in massive storms? It’s certainly one way to ensure your electric car stays charged, and of course, EVs can also be used as a source of power.

2021/08/30,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The US banned leaded gasoline on January 1, 1996, for use in new vehicles with the passage of the Clean Air Act for road-going vehicles. But it’s still used in aircraft, racing cars, farm equipment, and marine engines.Internationally, by the 1980s, most high-income countries had prohibited the use of leaded gasoline. Yet, as late as 2002, almost all low- and middle-income countries were still using leaded gas, which causes heart disease, stroke, and cancer.Today, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is announcing the official end of leaded gasoline worldwide. Last month, in Algeria, the world’s last refinery exhausted its leaded gas stocks.Further details will emerge following a press conference later today with Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UNEP, Janet McCabe, deputy administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other experts about how the ban will roll out, and we’ll update accordingly.Andersen said in a statement from the UNEP emailed to Electrek:Overcoming a century of deaths and illnesses that affected hundreds of millions and degraded the environment worldwide, we are invigorated to change humanity’s trajectory for the better through an accelerated transition to clean vehicles and electric mobility.Electrifying transport could add $47 billion annually to the US Southeast’s economy, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), which has released a new report, “Retained Transportation Fuel Spending in the Southeast: Electric vs. Internal Combustion Vehicles.”Here are the key points that the analysis found for Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee:SACE sums up:By saving consumers $42 billion in fuel spending and keeping an extra $5 billion in-region, electrifying transportation in the Southeast would result in $47 billion in transportation fuel spending retained annually.The Southeast clearly has a lot to gain by distancing itself from imported gas and diesel and embracing locally-generated electricity to power transportation.To foster a strong EV market, we need favorable policies and regulatory reforms. Read more: 96% of EV owners say they’d buy another electric vehicle — AAA studyPhoto: “Decayed Gas Pump” by Steve Snodgrass is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar
2021/08/30,"Wyoming has been the US’s top coal producer since 1986. But while the state stubbornly clings to the fossil fuel, its largest utility is dumping coal in favor of renewables.Rocky Mountain Power is Wyoming’s largest electric utility, and its parent company, PacifiCorp, announced on Friday, according to KPVI, that its biennial Integrated Resource Plan is expected to “include substantial investment in renewables — and no new investment in coal or natural gas. The 2021 plan will be finalized next week.”KPVI continues:PacifiCorp intends to retire 14 of its 22 active coal units by 2030 and another five by 2040, with the remaining three shuttered shortly afterward. It would retain two coal units at Wyoming’s Jim Bridger power plant, converting them to natural gas peaking units in 2024.All of PacifiCorp’s Wyoming coal plants would be offline by 2039, according to this year’s plan……Compared with a 2005 baseline, system CO2 emissions would be down 53% in 2025, 74% in 2030, and 92% in 2040, according to the company’s calculations.Further, PacifiCorps plans to add more than 3,600 megawatts of wind, more than 5,600 megawatts of solar, and around 6,700 megawatts of battery storage.The driver of PacifiCorps’ coal retirement? It’s bad business, and the company has known that since 2018:[A] 2018 company report found that 13 of its 22 coal units were uneconomical. In the 2021 announcement, it cited “ongoing cost pressures on existing coal-fired facilities and dropping costs for new resource alternatives.”In response, Wyoming legislators tried to stop utilities from shutting coal plants by passing a bill that went into effect last month. Oil City News explained in March 2020:Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon [R-WY] signed Senate File 21 into law on Tuesday, March 10. That bill will require electric public utilities to “first make a good faith effort” to sell coal-fired electric generation facilities before retiring such facilities.The rules will go into effect July 1, 2021, and will allow non-utilities to purchase otherwise retiring coal fired power plants and sell energy to industrial customers.Rob Godby, associate professor of economics at the University of Wyoming, told KPVI:Wyoming policy has actively tried to resist the transition away from coal and to prolong plant lives and mine lives. And so far, just looking at the outcomes, that’s been largely unsuccessful.Wyoming produces 14 times more energy than it consumes. It’s the biggest net energy supplier among the states, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).While it was responsible for around 39% of all coal mined in the US in 2019, and the state holds more than one-third of US coal reserves at producing mines, it’s also a growing wind producer. The EIA writes:Wind power in Wyoming has more than doubled since 2009 and accounted for 12% of the state’s electricity net generation in 2020. The state installed the third-largest amount of wind power generating capacity in 2020, after Texas and Iowa.Read more: Why Wyoming’s coal habit is turning it into an energy dinosaurPhoto: “Eastern Wyoming Coal Mine near Gillette, WY” by ccvedros is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0",solar

2021/08/25,"Danish shipping giant Maersk has ordered eight new vessels that can run both on traditional bunker fuel and carbon-neutral methanol. The ships will be able to sail between China and Europe and across the Pacific.Hyundai Heavy Industries will build the vessels, which will be capable of carrying 16,000 containers each, and will deliver them to Maersk in 2024. Maersk has also included an option for four more vessels in 2025. The new ships will replace older ones, rather than add new capacity, and generate annual emissions savings of around 1 million tonnes.The Financial Times writes:Some critics argue that green methanol makes little sense because CO2 is first absorbed in production and then emitted again when burnt, instead of sequestering the greenhouse gas.Maersk said last week that the green methanol for its feeder vessel would come from “biogenic” CO2, which means from natural sources, as well as renewable energy.…[Henriette Hallberg Thygesen, CEO, fleet and strategic brands at Maersk], said the biggest challenge was to secure enough green methanol for the vessels. “We need a significant ramp-up in production. We do feel there has been a lot of chicken and egg. So we find by going out with this announcement that we can break this cycle,” she added.Each ship costs around $175 million, which is about 10-15% more than a traditional fuel-powered ship. However, Maersk, which pledged in 2018 to reach net zero by 2050, has the support of big customers who are also working toward their own net zero goals so are willing to pay to reduce emissions.Michelle Grose, head of logistics and fulfillment at Unilever, said:Unilever is committed to accelerating the transition to clean transport solutions, not just in our own operations but along global value chains as we work to achieve net zero emissions by 2039. With logistics and distribution accounting for around 15% of our greenhouse gas emissions footprint, it’s important that we work with partners shifting to lower carbon fuels. We are proud to partner with Maersk as they pioneer carbon neutral transportation on the high seas.This is a hugely impactful announcement, not only on the shipping industry, but for the whole world.

The chargers will be made at a new US facility, which will be the company’s third US eMobility hub. Siemens will choose a location for the factory in 2021 and begin to manufacture the chargers in early 2022. It will create around 100 jobs across the site and regional supply chain.A Siemens spokesperson said to Electrek that its manufacturing operation will have impact down the regional supply chain, as some of the parts needed for the Siemens chargers will be best provided by partners close to the manufacturing site itself.The VersiCharge AC chargers can be used for both commercial/business use and home charging. Teslas can use Siemens chargers with an adapter. The plant will serve as a counterpart to Siemens’ existing operations in Wendell, North Carolina, where it makes chargers for buses, trucks, and heavy-duty electric vehicles. In 2019, Siemens expanded the 272,000-square-foot Wendell facility to manufacture DC fleet EV chargers.Electrek has written about GE’s mighty 814-feet (248-meter-tall) Haliade-X offshore turbine, which features a 14 MW, 13 MW, or 12 MW capacity, 722-feet (220-meter) rotor, a 351-feet (107-meter) blade, and digital capabilities. One rotation of its 220-meter rotor could power one household. One Haliade-X 14 MW turbine can generate up to 74 GWh of gross annual energy production.Vestas has plans for a 15 MW turbine, while Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is working on a 14 MW model that can be ramped up to 15 MW.Now Chinese company MingYang Smart Energy has announced details of a wind turbine prototype that it plans to install in 2023. The MySE 16.0-242 will be 866 feet (264 meters) tall, have a rotor diameter of 794 feet (242 meters), and a blade length of 387 feet (118 meters).MingYang says the massive 16 MW turbine will be able to produce 80,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 households. Its swept area will be the equivalent of more than six soccer fields.In a country that installed more than half the world’s offshore wind capacity in 2021 yet is still planning over 100 GW of new coal projects, MingYang points out:One MySE 16.0-242 can eliminate more than 1.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over the course of its designed 25-year lifespan.Read more: Vestas takes GE’s ‘world’s largest offshore wind turbine’ titlePhoto: Siemens",solar

Volvo took the delivery as a trial run before the green steel goes into full commercial production in 2026. HYBRIT started test operations at its pilot plant in Luleå a year ago.HYBRIT was launched in 2016 by steel maker SSAB, state-owned utility Vattenfall, and miner LKAB, all Swedish companies. Here’s how its steelmaking process works, according to HYBRIT:The HYBRIT technology involves replacing the blast furnace process, which uses carbon and coke to remove the oxygen from iron ore, with a direct reduction process where we use fossil-free hydrogen produced from water using electricity from fossil-free energy sources. Instead of carbon dioxide, water vapor is formed. Using HYBRIT technology, SSAB could potentially reduce Sweden’s total carbon dioxide emissions by around 10% and Finland’s by around 7%.Martin Lindqvist, president and CEO of SSAB, said:The first fossil-free steel in the world is not only a breakthrough for SSAB, it represents proof that it’s possible to make the transition and significantly reduce the global carbon footprint of the steel industry. We hope that this will inspire others to also want to speed up the green transition.The state-run Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) said yesterday that one of its research teams has developed a technique to recycle solar panels.The KIER researchers say they can retrieve 100% of glass components and around 80% of other materials from solar panels in order to recycle them into high-performance solar cells. PV Magazine summarizes the team’s process:The novel technique can be applied to either damaged or undamaged panels and works in four steps: The automated dismantling of the frame and the junction box; glass separation; metal recovery; and solar cell recycling…The Korean group claims that the new technique, which was, so far, tested on an undefined series of 72-cell panels, reduces power consumption by a third compared to other recycling technology, thanks to process optimization. The system is also said to allow the recovery of high-quality glass with an iron content of less than 200 parts per million, and of more than 65% of the components that make up a panel.The scientists were also able to refine the silicon recovered from waste panels to make six-inch single crystal ingots and wafers. The wafers were used to manufacture a 20.05%, high-efficiency solar cell.HST, a Korean solar-generating equipment maker, is going to use the KIER team’s technique for commercialization.Read more: A great breakthrough for solar panel recyclingPhoto: HYBRIT",solar
2021/08/19,"While legislators battle over federal infrastructure bills, some US states are out of the gate when it comes to adopting clean energy.Environmental advocacy organization Environment America’s new report, “The United States of Clean Energy, Summer 2021,” summarizes clean energy progress and commitments made in 2021 state legislative sessions across the US. (I’d just like to note that Florida, where I currently live, isn’t one of them. Solar is rapidly growing here, but no thanks to the state legislature.) 100% renewable campaign director Emma Searson says:Whenever I’m feeling pessimistic about the slow pace of change in the halls of our federal government, I look to the states.In state capitals around the country, we’re seeing not just the steady march of progress, but a real race to the top when it comes to clean and renewable energy. State leaders are hearing Americans’ calls for energy that doesn’t pollute, and they are answering with action.Here are five standouts from the spring and summer 2021 legislative sessions:Oregon: Governor Kate Brown (D-OR) signed a bill into law committing to 100% clean energy for Oregon customers by 2040. It joins New York as the national pacesetter, tying for the fastest timeline in the US to reach this goal. Oregon is now the eighth state with a legislative commitment to 100% clean electricity.Massachusetts: Governor Charlie Baker (R-MA) signed a bill into law that commits the state to sourcing 40% of its electricity from clean energy by 2030. The act also bumped up the state’s offshore wind power target by an additional 2,400 megawatts (MW) and committed to improve energy efficiency.California: California adopted a 2021-22 budget that includes $20 million of investments to help cities implement automatic solar permitting, plus an additional $15 million for developing offshore wind.

2021/08/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Electrical grid failures, power outages, and rising electric bills are spurring on many US homeowners to invest in solar and battery storage, according to a new survey released today by San Jose-headquartered SunPower Corp.1,500 respondents completed the survey that was conducted by Schlesinger Group, an independent research company. The survey consisted of a sample of US homeowners with solar on their homes, those considering solar, and those not considering solar. Here are four key findings:Power outages. 2 in 5 respondents worry about power outages on a monthly basis, and 1 in 5 worry weekly. More than 50% of homeowners who have experienced a power outage in the last year say trust in their energy provider has wavered. Outages spur action. One-third of those considering solar cited high-profile outages as a key driver. 70% of those polled plan to purchase battery storage, compared to less than 6% last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Additionally, those who experienced an outage in the last year are nearly four times more likely to have purchased solar panels and storage compared to those who didn’t have a power outage. Solar consumers are diversifying. 74% of solar users are millennials or Gen Z, and baby boomers represent the majority of those currently considering solar. Nearly 75% of those considering solar earn less than $100,000 annually, compared to just 34% of those who already have household solar. Most people who own or are considering solar are largely in the South and California. The Midwest is next in line, with 24% of homeowners there considering solar.Cost drives decisions. Lowering energy bills is the No. 1 reason homeowners invested in solar, followed closely by resilience during power outages. 79% of those considering solar cite cost as a prohibitive reason. But 60% of all respondents overestimate the average cost of purchasing household solar.Read more: Finally, a new bill calls for tax credits for integrated solar roofsThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that the average US wind farm construction cost fell from $1,895 per kilowatt (kW) in 2013 to $1,391/kW in 2019. Further:US onshore wind generating capacity increased 74% from 2013 to 2019 to a total of 104 gigawatts (GW), including 9.6 GW built in 2019. Wind capacity and construction costs vary significantly by region. Texas leads the US in onshore wind capacity. Average wind construction costs for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages around 90% of Texas’s electric load, totaled $1,114/kW in 2019 and were less expensive than the US average for that year. ERCOT installed more wind capacity than any other US electricity market region in 2019 (3.5 GW) and also had the most total wind capacity (26 GW) as of December 2019. Favorable market conditions, wholesale prices, and geographic advantages contribute to lower construction costs in ERCOT.The US Wind Belt runs down the center of the country and has some of the best conditions for wind power.The average construction cost for wind in SPP [Southwest Power Pool], which manages the electric grid in all or parts of 14 states including northwest Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, was $1,426/kW. In MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator], which covers the Midwest United States as well as parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, the average construction cost for wind in 2019 was $1,637/kW.New Mexico, Kansas, and Colorado, all in the Wind Belt, were among the least expensive states in the US for constructing wind generating capacity from 2013 to 2019.Photo: SunPower",solar
2021/08/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Biden administration and the US Department of Energy yesterday released an Issue Brief on “solar energy research, deployment, and workforce priorities.”The brief states:According to preliminary results of an upcoming analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to reach a largely decarbonized electricity sector by 2035, solar deployment would need to accelerate to three to four times faster than its current rate by 2030.It also states that solar could supply more than 40% of US electricity by 2035 if Congress implements clean-energy-friendly policies, such as tax credits for solar farms and manufacturing facilities. Solar currently makes up 3% of US electricity.Further, when it comes to job opportunities, it states:A pathway to a largely decarbonized electricity sector by 2035 can add millions of new jobs across clean energy technologies, including potentially 500,000–1,500,000 people working in solar by 2035.“Solar projects are currently eligible for a 26% tax credit that is in the process of being phased out. Biden has pushed for a 10-year extension, as well as new incentives for manufacturing solar components,” Reuters notes.The Solar Energy Industries Association sent a statement to Electrek from its president and CEO, Abigail Ross Hopper:The Biden administration’s report today on solar energy shows that with the right policies in place, solar will help tackle the climate crisis, build a strong US manufacturing sector and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The Issue Brief clearly demonstrates the massive growth in solar over the last decade and charts a course for solar to grow market share and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.The report also makes it clear that meeting the Biden administration’s goal for a zero-emissions electricity grid will require billions of dollars of investment and market opportunities through 2050 across all clean energy generation, including energy storage, electricity delivery, operations and maintenance, as well as community solar and solar for low- and moderate-income communities.President Biden also plans to extend the solar Investment Tax Credit, build US manufacturing, accelerate transmission and storage expansion and build diversity, equity, inclusion and justice goals into this transition to a clean energy economy. Good trade policy also will be critical to the president’s climate goals.Tempe, Arizona-headquartered First Solar broke ground yesterday on its third factory in Ohio at a ceremony that was attended by US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.The new 3.3 gigawatt (GW), 1.8 million-square-foot, $680 million facility in Wood County, south of Toledo, is expected to open in the first half of 2023, near where First Solar’s two existing factories are already located. The company claims that the third factory will bump its total annual capacity up to 6 GW, thus making it the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complex outside of China.The new factory is expected to create more than 700 permanent jobs and 500 construction jobs for union tradespeople over the next 18 months. Walsh said:Not only does this facility advance innovative manufacturing for a sustainable future, First Solar is also investing in its workers through skills training, competitive pay, and robust benefits. Empowering all of America’s workers is how we’ll build back a better economy and win the future.First Solar is the only US-headquartered company among the world’s 10 largest solar manufacturers. It does not manufacture in China and uses a fully integrated, continuous process under one roof. The company says that its “eco-efficient module technology, which uses its proprietary Cadmium Telluride (CadTel) semiconductor, has the lowest carbon and water footprints of any PV module available today.”Read more: Toledo, Ohio, connects a solar farm with neighborhood reinvestmentPhoto: Solar FlexRack in Utah",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

It will provide more affordable clean energy access to about 800 residents, over half of whom are low- and moderate-income (LMI).The Linden Hawk Rise project is one of 45 solar projects, totaling 78 MW, that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities reviewed, scored, and awarded in Program Year 1 of the state’s Community Solar Energy Pilot Program. The program provides guaranteed savings of 10-15% for all customers. Subscribers can cancel their subscription at any time, have no upfront costs, and will have their bill credits shown clearly on their PSE&G utility bill.With more than 135,000 solar installations, New Jersey is the No. 1 state in the US for installed solar capacity per square mile and has the most planned community solar capacity serving LMI households.Read more:A big challenge as the US moves to electrification is getting car dealerships on board, and the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, is working to encourage that.

Kelsey Rader, chief sustainability officer for the City of Albuquerque, told KOB:We hope ultimately the dealers will begin to prioritize electric vehicle sales more to make sure those vehicles are really top front and center and very visible for customers. We know that we’re only a few years out from EV’s being the primary vehicles that are going to be marketed by these major auto companies, so because of all of that, it’s really important the city of Albuquerque keeps pace with the EV market.Electrek’s Take: This is a great initiative from the city of Albuquerque, and other cities would be wise to follow its example. Over the last couple years, I’ve randomly asked car dealer professionals at both Toyota and Mini about electric vehicles – what they know, how they feel, what they expect to happen – and only one person could comprehensively discuss EVs and understood their benefits.

2021/08/12,"Remember the little “oldish and brownish and mossy” guy with the bushy mustache who “speaks for the trees?” Dr. Seuss’ character, the Lorax, is 50 years old this week. And his messages are more relevant than ever.It’s funny how The Lorax, the children’s book published by Dr. Seuss in 1971, is hitting its middle-aged milestone the same week that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report, “Climate Change 2021,” the world’s largest-ever report about climate change, was published.So while some of Dr. Seuss’s books haven’t aged so well, this one sure has. The Lorax is about what happens when humans destroy the environment, and it’s written in a way that makes it easy to relate to and understand for both children and adults alike.If you haven’t ever read it or any kids you know haven’t read it, you can buy it here for $6.90. (Or ride your bike or walk to a bookstore, which is a bit more environmentally friendly than Amazon.)I texted my 13-year-old and 15-year-old nieces (teenagers don’t do phone calls) and asked them what they learned from The Lorax. The 13-year-old: “That nature is important, so we should respect and protect it.”The 15-year-old: “The Lorax made me want to learn more about how I can preserve the planet, which I’m really passionate about now, and being introduced to it at a young age is impactful.”Then I asked them what protecting the planet looks like to them.The 13-year-old: “Not trashing [the earth], not destroying it, and keeping things beautiful and clean. Don’t litter, don’t make more waste than you need to.”The 15-year-old: “Respecting the earth is minimizing my impact on it (avoiding littering, not eating meat, doing everything I can to live a low-waste life). I convinced my dad to register to buy an electric truck.”Finally, I asked them, What are fossil fuels, and what do they do to the planet?The 13-year-old: “Fuels that come from underground and provide electricity.”The 15-year-old: “Stuff extracted from the ground like oil and gas that’s used to power things, but they release a lot of carbon dioxide that harms the earth + ozone layer.”(I just threw in the fossil fuel question because I was curious. I’ve got some work to do with them there.)So, based on this rather limited text poll I took – although I am pretty certain they’re not isolated cases – it seems as though The Lorax got the message across to protect the environment, but they didn’t recall specifics about how to do that.So let’s revisit The Lorax to see what lessons we can glean. Here were the three standouts:I’m the Lorax who speaks for the trees, which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please. But I’m also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots, who played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits. NOW… thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground, there’s not enough Truffula Fruit to go ’round.And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies! They loved living here. But I can’t let them stay. They’ll have to find food. And I hope that they may. Good luck, boys, he cried. And he sent them away.I, the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go. BUT… business is business! And business must grow regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.The message: It’s cause and effect. The “Once-ler” – the narrator who ultimately destroyed the environment – didn’t think about how cutting down Truffala Trees would affect the animals’ environment or the food supply. He only thought about profit. (Big Oil, I’m looking at you.) If we put profit above all else, it’s going to end in tears.What’s more, snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.) Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp. Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp. And what do you do with this leftover goo? I’ll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!You’re glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed! No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed. So I’m sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary. They’ll walk on their fins and get woefully weary in search of some water that isn’t so smeary.And then I got mad. I got terribly mad. I yelled at the Lorax, Now listen here, Dad! All you do is yap-yap and say, Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Well, I have my rights, sir, and I’m telling you I intend to go on doing just what I do! And, for your information, you Lorax, I’m figgering on biggering and Biggering and BIGGERING and BIGGERING!! Turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneed’s which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!The message: (“My rights” – that old chestnut.) Dr. Seuss drives this point home with a sledgehammer: “Biggering” is not the winning formula. I think my nieces got that message. The message is: Be mindful of our consumption and resist greed. Bigger isn’t better. (And that includes you, Texas. Wink.) Oh, and oil spills and pollution kill fish.But now, says the Once-ler, Now that you’re here, the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear. UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.SO… Catch! Calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall. It’s a Truffula Seed. It’s the last one of all! You’re in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.The message: The Truffala Seed symbolizes the environment, growth… and hope. Dr. Seuss was apparently inspired to write The Lorax because he was upset about a cypress tree being cut down in La Jolla, California. His conclusion is a call to arms – “someone like you.”If only we’d truly heeded the Lorax’s call 50 years ago. Now, we must. We’re still in charge of the Truffula Seeds. And if we don’t “plant” them right now, there won’t be another chance in 50 years.Read more: The IPCC climate change report – what it says and what we can doPhoto: “y2.d155 | i am the Lorax, i speak for the trees.” by B Rosen is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0",solar
2021/08/12,"The California Energy Commission’s five-member panel voted unanimously yesterday to require solar panels and battery storage in new commercial buildings and certain multifamily residences beginning January 1, 2023.The types of buildings that are included in the proposal are, according to the New York Times, “hotels, offices, medical offices and clinics, retail and grocery stores, restaurants, schools, and civic spaces like theaters, auditoriums, and convention centers.”The proposal also encourages electric heat pump technology for space and water heating, the use of electric appliances, and the installation of EV chargers. In other words, it’s working to get buildings off natural gas and support electric car charging.California’s Building Standards Commission also has to give its stamp of approval, and it’s expected to include the mandate in the overall building code revision in December. If approved, then that gives the construction industry a year to prepare for the solar and storage mandate.In 2018, California mandated that new single-family homes and multi-family dwellings up to three stories high must include solar panels from January 1, 2020. According to the California Energy Commission:Homes and businesses use nearly 70% of California’s electricity and are responsible for a quarter of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions.Over the next 30 years, the 2022 Energy Code is estimated to provide $1.5 billion in consumer benefits and reduce 10 million metric tons of GHGs, equivalent to taking nearly 2.2 million cars off the road for a year. Expanded adoption of new energy-efficient technologies will help reduce costs of the technology over time.Commissioner J. Andrew McAllister, the lead commissioner on energy efficiency at the California Energy Commission, said:Buildings profoundly influence our health, environment, and economy. Into the future they will use less energy and emit less pollution while still being comfortable and healthy.The 2022 Energy Code firmly pivots California’s buildings toward the clean, low-carbon technologies that are the bedrock on which our collective path forward will rest. This foundation will help the state meet its critical long-term climate and carbon neutrality goals.Photo: “Solar on Covina Walmart” by Walmart Corporate is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar

The province already had 12 Lion Electric LionC school buses that have been servicing routes in the Charlottetown area since early 2021. And it’s just ordered 35 more from the Quebec-based electric urban vehicle maker. So with 47 all-electric school buses in its fleet, Prince Edward Island will be one of the largest operators of zero-emission school buses in North America.Lion will also provide 35 Level 2 charging stations to Prince Edward Island.The purchase was made in part using funds from the governments of Canada and Prince Edward Island, which are contributing more than $6.3 million to the clean school bus project through the Green Infrastructure stream of the “Investing in Canada” infrastructure plan.Natalie Jameson, minister of education and lifelong learning and minister responsible for the status of women, said:As islanders, we see the impact of climate change every day and recognize the importance of leading by example. By adding 35 new electric school buses to our existing 12 electric school buses, more students will experience the important steps we are taking as a province to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as we work to become cleaner and more sustainable for future generations.Read more: Switching only 20% of US school buses to electric is a missed opportunityLG Electronics yesterday announced it would cut emissions in the use phase of major LG products such as refrigerators, washing machines, and residential air conditioners by 2030.

2021/08/11,"Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ed Markey (D-MA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) today announced the Offshore Wind American Manufacturing Act, which would drive domestic manufacturing and offshore wind deployment.The offshore wind supply chain currently exists mainly in Europe, China, and South Korea. With the growing number of offshore wind leases offered in the US, the Offshore Wind American Manufacturing Act would give a much-needed boost to US manufacturing with an investment tax credit and a production tax credit for qualified offshore wind components and dedicated offshore wind vessels.Warren said:The offshore wind industry is critical to our efforts to combat climate change, generate clean power, and boost our economy. The Offshore Wind American Manufacturing Act will help create more good jobs by building a made in America supply chain for all of the components that are needed for these large transformational projects.Here’s how it would work, according to a summary emailed by Senator Ed Markey’s office:This legislation would create a 30% investment tax credit for qualified facilities that manufacture offshore wind components and subcomponents that would reduce the high capital costs required to build, upgrade, or retool a facility. The investment tax credit would be complemented by a new production tax credit that ranges from 2 to 5 cents per watt multiplied by the total rated capacity of the turbine. The production tax credit varies by components including blades, towers, nacelles, generators, gearboxes, foundations, and related vessels.The Offshore Wind American Manufacturing Act would prioritize American workers and require prevailing wages for laborers involved in the construction and expansion of qualified manufacturing facilities or in the manufacture of qualified offshore wind products. The full investment tax credit would be available until December 31, 2028 and phase out annually afterward. The production tax credit would be available until December 31, 2030. Most importantly, the Offshore Wind American Manufacturing Act would help create thousands of manufacturing jobs and ensure that the United States meets President Biden’s offshore wind goal of 30 GW by 2030.Unsurprisingly, and rightly so, the clean energy/offshore wind sector completely backs this bill. 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 is a tight deadline, and this sector needs to motor.Jason Walsh, the executive director of BlueGreen Alliance, which unites labor unions and environmental organizations, said:Without the domestic manufacturing to support offshore wind, the US will be importing the materials and components we need to build out America’s offshore wind industry.We need policies, like those in the Offshore Wind Manufacturing Act of 2021, to ensure we’re building back better and manufacturing America’s energy future here in the United States.David Hardy, the CEO of offshore wind industry leader Ørsted Offshore North America, based in Boston, said:We recognize the importance of expediting the establishment of a sustainable US-based offshore wind supply chain that will not only enable clean energy production but will also boost the transition to domestic manufacturing and create good-paying jobs across the country.And Steve Dayney, head of offshore North America at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, said:As we continue to work alongside our partners to deliver on the promise of high-quality jobs for our local communities, this bill offers crucial support to bridge the divide across state-level markets and bring cost-effective climate solutions to American shores.Photo: Ørsted",solar

It will be in Riviera Beach, Florida, on the east coast, in a building that has been occupied by SolarTech Universal. Heliene’s already-established US factory is in Mountain Iron, Minnesota.A Heliene spokesperson told Electrek that the building is being leased to Heliene by a commercial real estate company, and that “SolarTech is no longer operating at the Riviera Beach facility.” But an employee of SolarTech, who didn’t speak in an official capacity, told us on the phone – from the company’s Riviera Beach facility – that SolarTech, which opened in Florida in 2015, is not shutting down, and will be sharing the building with Heliene.So will Heliene and SolarTech, unbeknownst to Heliene, be housemates, or is SolarTech, unbeknownst to the SolarTech employee we spoke to, shutting down?Solar Power World wrote yesterday: SolarTech was the only US manufacturer of heterojunction technology (HJT) panels in the last five years, and Heliene will continue using the advanced manufacturing process.Both companies manufacture HJT panels, and it’s the only location in the US where they’re made. Heliene’s spokesperson asserts that their product is unique.The Solar Nerd explains what HJT is:Heterojunction solar cells combine two different technologies into one cell: a crystalline silicon cell sandwiched between two layers of amorphous “thin film” silicon. Used together, these technologies allow more energy to be harvested compared to using either technology alone.The new Florida location will increase Heliene’s manufacturing capacity by 100 megawatts to a total of 240 megawatts of US production panel capacity. It will begin manufacturing operations in Florida next month, and it says more than 60 new manufacturing, maintenance, engineering, and logistics jobs will be created there.Regardless of whether it’s just Heliene, or both Heliene and SolarTech making solar panels in Riviera Beach, we’re just glad the panels are going to be made.

2021/08/10,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Block Island offshore wind farm, the US’s first offshore wind farm that launched in 2016, is temporarily shut down. EcoRI gives the wind farm’s background:The Block Island Wind Farm’s five 840-foot-tall wind turbines comprise the first operational offshore wind facility in the United States. The turbines were manufactured by General Electric subsidiary GE Renewable Energy, while the wind facility was still under the ownership of Deepwater Wind. In 2018, Deepwater Wind was acquired by Danish multinational utility company Ørsted, putting the Block Island Wind Farm in the hands of the world’s largest offshore wind developer.There is no power interruption, as power for Block Island, south of Rhode Island, is currently being sourced from the mainland’s grid.An Ørsted spokesperson told WPRI 12 News the reason yesterday:We put four turbines on pause as a precautionary measure and carried out a full risk assessment, which showed the turbines are structurally sound. We expect to complete those repairs and all maintenance in the next few weeks as scheduled.But a writer named David Collins had an article published on August 7 about the shutdown in New London, Connecticut, journal the Day. Collins thinks that Ørsted is being evasive, and feels there is a more serious reason.Collins writes:Getting Ørsted to answer media questions is a real challenge. All the phone numbers on its page for media calls are European, in Denmark.You would think the company could at least have easily available US telephone numbers for its media staff……My sense is that there is more trouble with the turbines run from Denmark than anyone wants us to know. But we may learn more about how long the shutdown will really last as the summer rolls on.The offshore wind farm has indeed run into problems in the past; for example, in 2019, an undersea electric cable became exposed at Crescent Beach, which unnerved residents and tourists, although the National Grid said that it posed no risk to boaters and swimmers.But I’m a bit skeptical about Collins’s “something is amiss” storyline because I easily found Ørsted’s US media contact months ago and have exchanged emails with them. I put in a call to him this morning. Update, 11:15 a.m. ET: Ørsted’s head of communications emailed me back and confirmed the WPRI statement, and added:Part of the work being conducted is the repair of stress lines identified by GE in the turbines.As Electrek wrote yesterday, Florida utility Tampa Electric Co. announced it will retire three coal units and double its solar output within two years, but gave no indication of what its longer-term plan was for natural gas, upon which the vast majority of its power is run.That’s just one big hurdle for Tampa’s City Council, which voted on August 5 in a non-binding resolution to move the city’s stationary municipal operations to clean energy by 2035. Environmental groups pushed for a 2030 deadline, but Tampa Mayor Jane Castor (D) resisted that time frame.The resolution also urges the state and federal governments to enact and enforce clean policies.Council members voted 6-1 in favor of the resolution, and the dissenting voter, Charlie Miranda, said:Let’s not just say, ‘I want it done.’ Show the world how you’re going to do it.That’s a fair point from Miranda, but the Tampa Bay Times notes:Council member John Dingfelder pushed back [on Miranda], calling the measure “an important step.”“It conveys a very important message to the community, and to the city itself,” he said.Also, WJCT writes:Tampa Mayor Jane Castor’s office has already committed to moving the city to a 100%, clean, renewable energy future through her Resilient Tampa campaign.Some parts of Castor’s plan are echoed in Citro’s resolution, like transitioning to a safe pedestrian city, transitioning to hybrid and electric vehicle fleets, and assessing the efficiency of Tampa’s stationary buildings.There’s also another rather large obstacle when it comes to clean energy. In June, Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) signed a law that prevents local governments from deciding which energy path they want to take. In other words, Florida towns and cities are now unable to switch to 100% clean energy because they can’t ban fossil fuels.Read more: Florida’s governor just locked ‘Florida into a dirty fossil fuel future’",solar
2021/08/09,"Florida utility Tampa Electric Co. has announced it will retire three coal units and double its solar output within two years. That’s good news, but in an interview published last week, its CEO doesn’t mention the fact that the vast majority of its power comes from natural gas or whether it plans to transition away from the methane-producing fossil fuel.Tampa Electric has supplied electricity to the Tampa Bay area since 1899. Its electrical system currently features 655 megawatts (MW) of solar, enough to power 100,000 homes. The utility wants to add an additional 600 MW of solar in 2021, 2022, and 2023. So its new total of 1,255 MW of solar would be enough to power 200,000 homes by 2023. Tampa Electric serves 800,000 customers in west central Florida.Tampa Electric’s new-ish president and CEO, Archie Collins, who joined the utility in February, told the Tampa Bay Times in a story published on August 5:We currently have on our system 655 megawatts’ worth of renewable energy, of solar. That’s enough solar power to power 100,000 homes, just to ballpark it, and it represents between 6 and 7% of our total energy sales.So we will be at 14% by the end of 2023, and we are committed to even more beyond that.He doesn’t comment on what “beyond that” means in the interview. (And the math above doesn’t add up for me. If Tampa Electric has 800,000 customers, how is solar only going to provide 7% of total energy sales if 1,255 MW can power 200,000 homes? Am I missing something? Feel free to comment below.)As for rooftop solar, as of September 2020, only 0.7% of Tampa Electric’s customers had it.The utility also says it will upgrade its infrastructure and retire three out of four coal-burning generating units at the Big Bend coal plant in Tampa. Unit 1 will be converted to use natural gas combined-cycle technology by 2023. Collins continues in his interview:I think it would surprise many of our customers to know that in just the last five years, we have reduced our consumption of coal by 95%. In the last 20 years, we have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that we generate as a company by 50%, even though we produce 25% more power than we did 20 years ago.Cool. That all sounds great, right?But here’s the thing. The vast majority of Tampa Electric’s energy comes from natural gas – a fossil fuel – yet Collins doesn’t even mention the words “natural gas” in the Tampa Bay Times article. Collins says all the right things about solar, and it’s nice to see some rapid momentum and goodbye to coal, but in reality, the Florida utility has a long way to go to get clean.Natural gas fueled about 74% of Florida’s electricity net generation in 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Monash University’s associate professor Shayne McGregor, a Chapter 3 lead author of today’s hugely impactful UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, said in an emailed statement:The next two decades are particularly critical. It will require sustained and concerted global efforts targeting rapid reductions in CO2, methane, and other greenhouse gases to limit warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris agreement.Read more: The IPCC climate change report – what it says and what we can doPhoto: Wikipedia",solar

As Al Jazeera notes, “The farm is part of the kingdom’s Vision 2030, a reform project intended to diversify the economy and move Saudi Arabia away from its dependency on oil.”Saudi Arabia did ratify the Paris Agreement, but it’s clinging to carbon capture and, like nearly half of the 200 nations who signed, has yet to provide details on how it will get to net zero by 2050.Texas-based Green Mountain Energy (not to be confused with Green Mountain Power, although it’s actually an offshoot of the Vermont utility), which offers electricity sourced from 100% clean energy, has applied to enter Arizona’s electricity market.Green Mountain Energy would become the first and only electricity provider to exclusively offer clean energy in Arizona if it’s approved.It would compete with Arizona Public Service Co. and Tucson Electric Power, which currently has monopolies in their territories.Arizona does not have an operating competitive market, but Green Mountain Energy wrote in its application:Approval of this application is in the public interest because it will result in more options for customers and expand the availability of renewable energy in Arizona. Indeed, by approving this application the commission can enable Arizonans to not only choose their electricity provider, but also choose the type of generation they would like to receive. Green Mountain is uniquely qualified to provide these new options to Arizonans.The clean energy provider would literally be a breath of fresh air for Arizona: Natural gas, nuclear power, and coal provided 88% of Arizona’s utility-scale electricity net generation in 2020, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Green Mountain Energy currently offers clean energy to residential and commercial consumers in Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

This indicates the industry is now using social media to directly reach a vast audience and influence public opinions on climate change and the energy mix. These ads had a spend of $9,597,376.The ads promoted either the climate-friendliness of the industry, including voluntary targets, investments into renewables, and promoting fossil gas as green, or promoted an ongoing role for oil and gas in the energy mix. Crucially, many of these ads either contained misleading content or present information that was misaligned from the science of climate change according to both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s and the International Energy Agency’s reports on reaching net zero by 2050.The worst offenders were Exxon and API, whose ads accounted for 62% of the ads analyzed by InfluenceMap.Facebook’s explanation?

The 26% tax credit is in place until the end of 2022, when it drops to 22% in 2023 and then 10% for commercial and 0% for residential in 2024.According to the Solar Energies Industry Association (SEIA):The residential and commercial solar ITC has helped the US solar industry grow by more than 10,000% percent since it was implemented in 2006, with an average annual growth of 50% over the last decade alone.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA, said:This legislation will make sure that homes that have solar built into the original design are eligible for the same ITC benefits as any other residential solar installation and will extend the cost-saving benefits of solar energy to all Americans. We’re pleased to support this bill.Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy, who manufactures roof-integrated solar, issued a statement in response to the introduction of RAISE the Roof Act:We see tremendous opportunity in roofs as real estate to drive the acceleration of clean energy. This bill positions existing American manufacturing resources and know-how to contribute meaningfully to a resilient path forward in our energy infrastructure.…Updating the ITC will bring jobs, increased solar deployment, support for homeowners, and the potential return of solar manufacturing to the US.This bill is welcome news, and would close a loophole that’s impeding BIPV solar growth. I really can’t think of a single reason why anyone in Congress would oppose this bill, unless fossil fuel lobbyists interfere. It encourages innovation and American jobs in solar. I would love a BIPV roof, as I need my roof to be completely resilient against the elements here in Florida Hurricane Land – and I want to do my part to fight climate change with solar.Photo: GAF Energy/Anbe, residential roof in California",solar
2021/08/03,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The US has a long way to go in its path to net zero, but it appears to be going in the right direction.In 2010, just 28% of new power installations in the US were wind, solar, and battery storage. In 2020, 78% of new power installations were wind, solar, and battery storage.Clean energy, including wind, utility solar, and battery storage, topped 170 gigawatts (GW) in the US in 2020, according to the American Clean Power Association’s first Clean Power Annual report. That’s after the year saw a record 26 GW of clean energy projects come online in 2020.The American Clean Power Association is a trade group formed last year that’s made up of more than 30 member companies from wind, solar, utilities, and other new energy industries. It writes:The rapid pace of new clean power installations included 16,836 MW of land-based wind, representing 50% of new additions; 8,894 MW of utility-scale solar projects, capturing 26% of the market; and 760 MW of battery storage capacity.Texas added the most clean power capacity in 2020 with 6,320 MW, followed by California with 2,193 MW, Florida with 1,267 MW, Iowa with 1,218 MW, and Oklahoma with 1,182 MW.Read more: Clean energy was second-most prevalent US electricity source in 2020Contrast the above with coal: By the end of 2020, the number of producing coal mines in the US fell to 551 mines, the lowest number since US coal production peaked in 2008, reports the US Energy Information Administration. In 2020, 40 coal mines were opened or reactivated, and 151 mines were idled or closed. This overall decrease resulted in an 18% annual decline in the total number of producing coal mines from 2019, and a 62% decline since 2008.Shutting down less-efficient mines while adding relatively few new mines and reactivating few idled mines resulted in the drop last year.The declining number of new mines in the US reflects reduced investment in the coal industry, less demand for coal internationally, and less demand for coal in the US electric power sector.However, coal is going to rise before it permanently drops: The EIA forecasts that US coal production will increase by 15% in 2021 from 2020 levels. Increased production could result in some idled US coal mines reopening in 2021.",solar
2021/08/02,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) blew up the 600-foot smokestack of its oldest coal-fired power plant, which was in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. The plant generated its first electricity in 1951 and its last on December 31, 2017. That’s the good news, and watch it fall below: Pump up the volume! 🔊Highly skilled demolition crews imploded the stack and old coal-fired boilers at the Johnsonville Fossil Plant in West Tennessee early this morning. The plant retired in 2017 after serving the region for over 60 years.Learn more: 👉 https://t.co/YCSfccDzQr pic.twitter.com/2M2dZ997obHere’s the bad news, according to TVA (which it announces in a tone-deaf manner as good news):Currently, there are 20 combustion turbines at the site, a number of which will be retired as new, more efficient natural gas generation is added to the system.TVA is also eyeing Johnsonville’s combustion turbines for a possible carbon-capture demonstration. The project could identify ways to lower the cost of carbon utilization technologies, and potentially help advance future hydrogen generation technologies.By 2035, TVA plans to add about 10,000 megawatts of solar power. To do this, the utility plans to use natural gas to keep the power system reliable as coal plants retire.[In July], TVA announced it is investing $1 billion to build new lower-emission, natural gas-fueled combustion turbines at shuttered coal plants in Tuscumbia, Alabama, and Paradise, Kentucky.In 2005, TVA generated 57% of its electricity from coal. Since 2012, TVA has retired six coal plants, which reduced the amount of coal energy to around 14%. The utility says it could retire its entire coal fleet by 2035 pending approvals.Electrek’s Take: TVA is doing some good things, such as increasing solar and building out an EV fast charging network. Getting rid of coal is also great (plus, it’s just kinda fun to watch coal plants blow up). But nothing annoys me more than when utilities try to greenwash natural gas as “clean.” It’s not clean. It’s a fossil fuel that produces dangerous methane. It’s the second most long-lived greenhouse gas, and it currently makes up 10% of emissions in the US. So to replace a fossil fuel with another fossil fuel is not the way to fight climate change and improve our air quality. Switch to battery storage, TVA, not gas. You were created under the New Deal, and should be a leader, not a laggard.Read more:Framingham, Massachusetts-based Ameresco (NYSE: AMRC) has completed a £1.1 million ($1.5 million) roof-mounted solar PV project for the UK’s Ministry of Justice (MoJ).

2021/07/29,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Electric vehicle chargers that are embedded into and flush with the sidewalk are now officially live for testing in the London Borough of Brent. The chargers have no permanent raised street furniture at the sidewalk edge:Scottish startup company Trojan Energy – “flat and flush EV charging” – has designed the system for those without access to off-street parking, garages, or driveways, which is a major impediment for charging, not only in London, but in most cities around the world. Fifteen flat EV chargers are installed in parallel from one electricity network connection, with power distributed across the chargers. London’s electricity network operator UK Power Networks has connected the chargers to the energy system. The user inserts a personal lance into the charger, which then locks it in place. Once charged, the lance can be removed by key fob or smartphone and stored in the car.Five Trojan Energy charge points have been installed on Mortimer Road for a small group of participants to test. The full trial of 150 charge points across London’s Brent and Camden will then go live later this year.The system has been designed with input from Disability Rights UK to improve safety for all street users.UK transport minister Rachel Maclean said:This project is a great example of how technology is being used to solve a real-world problem to  ensure that our EV infrastructure fits in seamlessly in our local towns and cities. This is crucial as we  build back greener and encourage more people to make the switch, which is why I’m delighted this government is backing its delivery.British-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell announced on Tuesday that it’s buying Santa Monica, California, and Philadelphia-headquartered clean energy retailer Inspire Clean Energy to grow its US renewable business. The purchase is expected to close in fourth quarter 2021. Patrick Maloney, founder and CEO of Inspire, said:We share the belief that renewable energy should be accessible to everyone and Shell’s resources, reach, and ownership of many aspects of the energy value chain will help us scale and advance our mission.Inspire’s website home page states, “We believe energy should be 100% renewable.” So Shell’s purchase is likely motivated by the fact that in May, a Dutch court ordered the company to cut its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Prior to the ruling, Shell’s emissions reduction target was 20% by 2030.Read more:Photo: Darren Cool/Trojan Energy",solar
2021/07/28,"Solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies, a spin-off from US-based SunPower Corporation that’s controlled by French energy giant TotalEnergies, is getting EU funds to manufacture its stick-on Maxeon Air solar panels.Maxeon will use the money to manufacture the Maxeon Airs in an existing factory in Porcelette, France, in the northeast of the country. But we don’t yet know how much money Maxeon will receive. PV Magazine explains why:The exact amount of grant funding to be awarded Maxeon is due to be settled in the final quarter of this year, when the EU’s recently established Innovation Fund makes its first payments. The cash will come from the revenue generated by the EU’s emissions trading scheme, which sells certificates generated by renewable energy operators to companies who exceed their maximum permitted carbon emissions.With the Innovation Fund expected to have around €20 billion to disburse to 2030, an additional €623 million is already available as unspent cash from predecessor the NER300, which had allocated those monies only for the associated projects to fall through.As Electrek reported in May, Maxeon Air solar panels, due to be released commercially this summer, are basically solar panel stickers. The panels can be installed directly on a roof’s surface without racking, anchors, or ballast. Maxeon says the solar panels are engineered to conform to uneven roof surfaces.The panels have no metal frames or heavy glass. The installed weight is around 6 kg (13 pounds) per square meter, which is 50% lighter than conventional systems, and they’re 4 mm thick. They’re also certified for fire resistance. The panels feature an efficiency rating of 20.9%.Maxeon Air panels will be used in select projects in Europe in the second half of 2021, and general product availability is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2022.As we’ve pointed out before, this is a very new product, but Maxeon is no startup. It’s been around for 35 years, and Maxeon Solar Technologies designs, manufactures, and sells SunPower brand solar panels in more than 100 countries.We’re still waiting to learn more about this product – for example, such as how Maxeon addresses cooling since the panels have direct contact with roofs. But it’s probably safe to assume that this financial vote of confidence from the EU means that these stick-on solar panels will, indeed, be manufactured and brought into the European market.Photo: Maxeon",solar
2021/07/28,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In 2020, clean energy sources – wind, hydroelectric, solar, biomass, and geothermal – generated a record 834 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity, or about 21% of all US electricity, reports the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Only natural gas (1,617 billion kWh) produced more electricity than clean energy last year in the US.Clean energy surpassed both nuclear (790 billion kWh) and coal (774 billion kWh) for the first time in 2020. This happened because of significantly less coal use in US electricity generation and a steady increase of wind and solar. Coal dropped 20% and renewables rose 9%. Wind, currently the most prevalent source of US clean energy, grew 14% in 2020 from 2019. Utility-scale solar (projects greater than 1 megawatt) increased 26%, and small-scale solar, such as rooftop solar, increased 19%. But it’s going to get worse before it gets better when it comes to transitioning away from fossil fuels. The EIA forecasts:We expect coal-fired electricity generation to increase in the United States during 2021 as natural gas prices continue to rise and as coal becomes more economically competitive. Based on forecasts in our Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we expect coal-fired electricity generation in all sectors in 2021 to increase 18% from 2020 levels before falling 2% in 2022. We expect US renewable generation across all sectors to increase 7% in 2021 and 10% in 2022. As a result, we forecast coal will be the second-most prevalent electricity source in 2021, and renewables will be the second-most prevalent source in 2022. We expect nuclear electric power to decline 2% in 2021 and 3% in 2022 as operators retire several generators.Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno, Nevada, ruled late last week that Vancouver, Canada-headquartered Lithium Americas Corp can conduct excavation work at its Thacker Pass pre-feasibility stage lithium mine site in Humboldt County, Nevada.

2021/07/27,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In 2020, due to the pandemic, US energy emissions from fossil fuels fell to the lowest level since 1983. The 4.6 billion metric tons (Bmt) of carbon dioxide emitted in 2020 was an 11% decrease from 2019, the largest annual decrease on record, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).The EIA says, broken down by source:US petroleum consumption accounted for 2.0 Bmt of energy-related CO2 emissions, or about 45% of the US total, in 2020. About 77% of petroleum CO2 emissions occurred in the transportation sector in 2020.In 2020, US natural gas consumption accounted for 1.7 Bmt of CO2 emissions, or about 36% of the total — its largest share on record. In 2020, about 38% of CO2 emissions from natural gas occurred in the electric power sector, and 32% were in the industrial sector.In 2020, coal consumption accounted for 0.9 Bmt of CO2 emissions, or about 19% of total CO2 emissions, both its lowest total amount and share in [the EIA’s] annual data series that begins in 1973. In 2020, about 90% of CO2 emissions from coal occurred in the electric power sector. Coal consumption in the electric power sector has declined over the past decade, displaced by natural gas and renewable energy.The EIA expects emissions to grow by 0.3 Bmt, or 7%, in 2021, due to the US no longer being in lockdown.Every little bit counts. Monson, Maine-based PowerMarket, an employee-owned community solar management company, and SunRaise, a New Hampshire-headquartered solar energy developer, owner, and operator, have launched a 7 megawatt community solar farm in Belfast, Maine. The town itself has a population of just under 7,000. It’s 35 miles southwest of Bangor.Central Maine Power (CMP) customers who take part in the community solar program receive 10% savings on the community solar credits. A further community solar program, Route 32, is now open for enrollment and will be online in the fall.Patrick Jackson, cofounder of SunRaise Investments, said:Community solar is a way to provide people from all walks of life – homeowners, renters, business owners, and more – access to renewable energy. Through community solar projects like this one in Belfast, we have been able to accomplish that goal and we are proud to see our work come to life and benefit Mainers.Maine’s electricity runs on around 80% renewables, but only a tiny percentage of that is solar. According to the US Energy Information Administration:In 2019, about four-fifths of Maine’s electricity net generation came from renewable sources. About three-tenths of the state’s total net generation came from hydroelectric dams, one-fourth was fueled by biomass, and nearly one-fourth was provided by wind turbines. Natural gas-fired power plants fueled less than one-sixth of state generation in 2019, its smallest share in at least two decades. A small amount of Maine’s net generation, a total of about 2%, came from solar power, petroleum-fueled, and coal-fired power plants. Read more: ",solar
2021/07/26,"The Battle Born Solar Project in Nevada – what would have been the largest solar farm in the US – is now canceled because nearby residents said it would be an eyesore.The 850 megawatt, 9,200-acre solar farm, which would have been constructed in southern Nevada’s Moapa Valley, was to sit on 14 square miles on the Mormon Mesa, a flat-topped hill around 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas.California-based Arevia Power and Solar Partners VII LLC withdrew their application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) last week in the face of opposition from a group called Save Our Mesa.The group, which is made up of residents, environmentalists, and others, feels that the solar farm would hinder hiking, camping, driving off-highway vehicles, and horseback riding and deter tourists from visiting artist Michael Heizer’s environmental sculpture, “Double Negative” (1969).Arevia told TV station KLAS that “the arrays would have been set back and not visible from the valley below. The company had estimated the project would create 2,600 jobs and provide daytime energy needs to 500,000 homes.”Kirsten Cannon, a BLM spokesperson, said that the project did not have high priority [via the Las Vegas Review-Journal]:The Battle Born project rated as low priority both in the initial ranking and after the proponent provided additional information and requested reconsideration.8News Now in Las Vegas pointed out on February 25, 2021:The Mormon Mesa is south of the site of the decommissioned Reid Gardner plant. The generation site closed in 2014, but its trunk lines to the power grid remain. A spokesperson for NV Energy said the company does not have a plan to buy power from Arevia, but it is required under law to move its electrons through its network.One Save Our Mesa supporter said in the KLAS video:I’m not against renewable energy, I’m just against losing this beauty.In a blog posted on July 24 on Save Our Mesa’s website, called “In our own words,” it says:We have been called a whining NIMBY (not in my backyard) group, well this is mostly true because this project IS literally IN our backyard! The Battle Born Solar Project is being proposed to be built 8000’ from our homes and 2/3 of Manhattan can fit in its footprint!And resident Suzy Rebich, who has solar panels on her roof, also wrote in a blog on Save Our Mesa’s website on July 24:We have room on our property to easily install over 100 panels and help generate some clean energy for all, however, if you install too many panels and overproduce energy they will not buy it back from you and you will be fined. So it’s not OK for individuals to use their rooftops to generate green energy, but it’s OK for giant industrial corporations to take PUBLIC LAND and destroy/restrict it to put solar farms on and turn a profit??? We absolutely love our new solar panels and it would be nice to help out by installing extra. We’re not opposed to the giant solar farms, but we just don’t want them in anyone’s backyard – especially ours.Arevia is building the 7,000-acre, 690 MW Gemini, which is Nevada’s largest solar farm. It’s around 20 miles away from Mormon Mesa.Nevada’s target is to source 50% of its energy from renewables by 2030. Renewables currently make up 28% of Nevada’s utility-scale energy generation. Battle Born would have made up one-tenth of Nevada’s total energy capacity.The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that a Solar Partners spokesperson wrote in an email:[The companies] withdrew the application for the Battle Born Project to relocate it to a more optimal site with better proximity to transmission. Several sites are under consideration.And the BLM clearly wasn’t overly excited about the Battle Born solar farm’s proposed location.So it appears as though this solar farm could eventually be located elsewhere. The need to transition to clean energy is urgent and non-negotiable, and Nevada is willing. Some Save Our Mesa activists say that they’re pro-renewable energy, but its website features some odd arguments against solar farms, such as how solar panels can lower humidity. In fact, the group’s website contains a lot of contradictions. Bottom line: They just don’t want the solar farm in their backyard, as they explicitly state.(Also, as an aside, those gas ATVs they drive rankle me. How is tearing around the desert in those vehicles caring for one’s environment? It’s not, according to the Forest Service – see the executive summary – and it’s particularly bad for the desert. Please do tell me in the comments below if it’s possible.)Solar farms can be very environmentally friendly. Heck, Indiana’s largest solar farm was designed to encourage the growth of native meadow grasses and pollinator-friendly wildflower plants. As I wrote earlier today, the Dutch are piloting a solar farm/farming project in which agriculture and solar panels coexist. Death Valley, a couple hours’ drive away, is hitting record high temperatures this summer. Lake Mead, which supplies water to surrounding areas, is at dangerously low levels.

2021/07/26,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Swedish energy firm Vattenfall has received a permit to run a four-year Dutch solar panels and strip farming pilot in Almere, east of Amsterdam. The Symbizon project will receive funding from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.Annemarie Schouten, head of Solar Development Netherlands, explains:In the solar farm we alternate rows of panels with strips where various crops are grown for organic farming. This means that far fewer solar panels are being installed per hectare than is usual.To ensure sufficient light yield, we use double-sided solar panels. They catch the reflected light from the soil, the crops, and the adjacent rows and use it to produce solar energy. The panels also rotate with the sun to maximize yield.Vattenfall will now decide whether to proceed on Symbizon by the end of 2021. If it does, construction will start in 2022. It would have a capacity of 0.7 MWp. Innovation organization TNO would develop a solar tracking algorithm that tracks crop and energy yields and the effects of herb strips, weather forecasts, energy price, and soil conditions.

The CMA forecasts suggest that more than 10 times this amount – 250,000 – will be needed by 2030. So it recommends that the British government sets out an ambitious national strategy for rolling out EV charging and supports local authorities to boost rollout of on-street charging. It also recommends that drivers have a choice of charging provider at each service station.Further, charger availability varies greatly by region, with 80 chargers per 100,000 people in London, yet only 17 chargers per 100,000 people in Northern Ireland and 20 per 100,000 people in Yorkshire and the Humber. The CMA writes:In particular, the CMA is concerned about the choice and availability of chargepoints at motorway service stations, where competition is limited; the roll-out of on-street charging by Local Authorities (which many drivers will rely on) is too slow; and rural areas risk being left behind with too few chargepoints due to lack of investment.Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said:Some areas of the rollout are going well and the UK’s network is growing – but it’s clear that other parts, like charging at motorway service stations and on-street, have much bigger hurdles to overcome.Our recommendations will promote strong competition, encourage more investment, and build people’s trust, both now and in the future.Photo: “Typical Dutch landscape” by Marcel Oosterwijk is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0",solar
2021/07/23,"Houston’s Metropolitan Transit Authority, which is heavily dependent on diesel vehicles, is going to purchase up to 20 electric buses that will run along two routes.Metro runs around 1,200 buses, so 20 electric buses will make up a tiny percentage of the entire fleet. The vast majority run on diesel, and less than 80 run on natural gas. Around 385 are diesel-electric hybrids.Houston’s Metro is skittish about e-buses because it thinks they won’t be able to handle the city’s heat. It’s also worried that the Texas grid won’t be stable enough to keep electric buses running. But it plans to transition its entire public transit fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2030.Kimberly Williams, chief innovation officer for Metro, said [via the Houston Chronicle]:Some of the recent weather events have made this a more urgent matter.The new electric buses are estimated to cost around $25.5 million and will be funded mostly by a $20 million grant from the US Department of Transportation. We don’t yet know which electric bus company Metro will work with.Colin Leyden, Texas director, Environmental Defense Fund, told Electrek:Electric buses are ready to roll and Houstonians deserve a clean transit fleet that saves money and cuts climate pollution. As the impacts of climate change and air pollution mount, the science is clear that we need to curb transit emissions. A modern, fully electric fleet will be crucial for Houston METRO to meet that goal, and this is a good first step.It’s great that Houston’s Metro has a net zero goal of 2030, but it has a lot of work to do in 8.5 years to replace all those diesel buses with clean buses. And it’s got the extra challenge of the standalone Texas grid. After the Big Freeze and summer blackouts due to heat, it sounds like Texans don’t have a whole lot of faith in their grid now. Metro board member Jim Robinson said to the Houston Chronicle, “If [the Electric Reliability Council of Texas] really had a worst case thing, you could be down for some time.”Texas is a leader in wind, and increasingly in solar, but its grid needs a serious rethink — and quickly.Read more: Photo: “Houston Skyline” by Katie Haugland Bowen is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/07/22,"Singapore-based solar energy provider Sunseap will spend more than $2 billion to build the world’s largest floating solar farm and energy storage system on Indonesia’s Batam Island, which is across the Singapore Strait from Singapore.The floating solar farm is expected to have a capacity of 2.2 gigawatt-peak. It will float on the Duriangkang Reservoir on a southern area of Batam Island and span nearly 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares). The energy storage facility will have a capacity of more than 4,000 megawatts per hour.The project will offset more than 1.8 million metric tons of emissions annually – the equivalent of 400,000 cars’ worth of emissions per year.Sunseap and the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority, Badan Pengusahaan Batam, announced that they signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday for the floating solar farm. It will be financed through Sunseap capital and bank debt.A portion of the energy generated from the floating solar farm will be used in Batam. The City of Batam, with a population of nearly 1.2 million, is the largest city in the Riau Islands province. The rest could be exported to Singapore (pictured above from Batam) via a subsea cable.The project’s construction is due to begin in 2022 and is expected to be completed in 2024.Frank Phuan, cofounder and chief executive of Sunseap, told Reuters:This single project will double our entire portfolio, more importantly build our capability towards hyperscale solar and energy storage projects.Floating solar systems will go a long way to address the land constraints that urbanized parts of Southeast Asia face in tapping renewable energy.Read more about Sunseap: Singapore completes one of the first floating solar farms in the seaPhoto: “Singapore Skyline at Sunset, two; Batam Island, Indonesia” by Jackerbie is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0",solar
2021/07/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):It’s not just adopting clean energy that’s essential to fight climate change – energy efficiency is also crucial.US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm yesterday announced new building energy code determinations from the US Department of Energy that will save US homes and businesses $138 billion over a 30-year period in energy costs. That’s equivalent to $162 in annual savings per residential unit.The projected savings include 9.4% for residential buildings and 4.7% for commercial buildings, compared to earlier model energy codes. That’s 900 million metric tons of avoided emissions, equivalent to annual emissions from nearly 200 million cars.For example, residential building changes outlined in an energy savings analysis include such things as high-efficacy lighting; increasing wall, window, and ceiling insulation; and improving mechanical ventilation fan efficacy.The DOE writes:America’s 129 million residential and commercial buildings collectively cost well over $400 billion a year to heat, cool, light, and power – accounting for 35% of U.S. carbon emissions, 40% of the nation’s energy use, and 75% of electricity use. And yet, buildings waste at least 30% of the energy they consume.DOE will increase technical assistance to support state and local governments in adopting and implementing the latest model energy codes – including help with updating model energy codes; workforce education and training initiatives that help workers in the industry take advantage of evolving technologies, practices, and building standards; and new and emerging opportunities for more advanced codes that go further on energy savings and pollution reduction, and incorporate technologies like electric vehicle charging.The City of Bloomington, Indiana, launched the Bloomington Green Home Improvement Program this week. It’s designed to support energy-efficient improvements for residents of Bloomington with a household income below $100,000. Homes must be owner-occupied.The Bloomington Green Housing Improvement Program helps Bloomington homeowners finance energy efficiency upgrades, reduce their utility bills, and increase the environmental sustainability of their houses, in accordance with the City’s goals to improve environmental and economic equity in Bloomington.Qualified residents can take out low-interest loans for projects, which also provide a 26% federal tax credit for solar if completed in 2021 or 2022. Once completion of a green energy project is verified, residents are then eligible for a $1,000 rebate from the city.The City of Bloomington writes:Program participants are able to utilize Clean Energy CU financing for a wide range of solar and energy efficiency projects, including solar electric system installations; geothermal heat pump systems; green home upgrades such as energy efficient HVAC, water heating, lighting, and appliances; energy analysis and monitoring; building envelope improvements; and electrical vehicle chargers.

2021/07/21,"Japan aims to increase its clean energy use to nearly 40% by 2030, according to a new Basic Energy Plan draft released by the Japanese government today. The country also plans to reduce its use of fossil fuels.The Japanese government updates its energy plan every couple years. It will finalize the policy in October.The latest Basic Energy Plan states that clean energy, especially solar, will make up between 36-38% of overall power generation by 2030. That’s a boost from the previous target of 22-24%. Nuclear’s target was unchanged from the previous plan at 20-22%, and new fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia have a modest 1% target.Fossil fuel use is to be reduced from 56% to 41% by 2030.For comparison, in 2019, Japan’s energy breakdown consisted of clean energy at 18%, fossil fuels at 76%, and nuclear power at 6%.The Associated Press points out:The 2050 emissions-free target will require drastic changes and likely prompt calls for a restart of more nuclear plants. Progress toward reducing Japan’s reliance on fossil fuels has been hindered by the prolonged closure of most of its nuclear plants after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.The nuclear energy target will be difficult to achieve because of persistent anti-nuclear sentiment among the public.Greenpeace Japan stated that it felt the country’s more ambitious plan to achieve net zero isn’t ambitious enough. Hisayo Takada, program director at Greenpeace Japan, said in a statement [via Agence France Presse]:The revision of the Basic Energy Plan is a pivotal point to demonstrate Japan’s political will to achieve net zero by 2050.However, the draft plan is disappointing as it is not anywhere near sufficient to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target.Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga said in April that the country will aim to reduce its emissions by 46% from 2012 levels, up from an earlier target of 26%, in order to reach net zero by 2050.

2021/07/21,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):At the end of June, the Biden administration said it would support a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. Included in the bill is a plan to replace diesel-powered school buses with electric models. There are around 480,000 school buses on the road in the US – the largest fleet of public transit systems in the country – and nearly 95% run on diesel fuel. A recent survey released by the American Lung Association found that 68% of Americans it polled support a spend of either $20 billion or $25 billion to transition 20% of the country’s school buses to electric.Voters agree that the investment would be a positive step for the health of America’s school children, for efforts to fight climate change, for the economy, and for the nation’s transportation infrastructure.American Lung Association national president and CEO Harold Wimmer said:Close to 25 million kids ride to school every day on diesel-powered school buses that emit millions of tons of pollution per year… The toxic pollution in diesel exhaust can harm children’s brain development and respiratory health.Electrek’s Take: Why stop at 20% of the US school bus fleet? Why not more, if electric school buses have broad public support? Electricity is less expensive than diesel. 82% of those polled agreed that “reducing air pollution around children is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it’s just common sense.” Electric school buses require less maintenance and repairs. Buses that have bidirectional chargers can return energy to the electrical grid. The bill provides the upfront money needed, which is often the obstacle to going electric, so reallocate more bill money to switch even more school buses to electric.Read more: New York’s vehicle-to-grid e-school bus pilot program is a successNew York State governor Andrew Cuomo yesterday announced the launch of the Inclusive Community Solar Adder program, which earmarks $52.5 million for community solar projects that support underserved New Yorkers and disadvantaged communities. Projects funded through the program are expected to serve up to 50,000 low- to moderate-income households, affordable housing providers, and facilities serving disadvantaged communities, which will help save residents money on energy bills.Community solar projects increase access to solar for homeowners and renters who may not have the ability to install solar panels onsite. Through community solar, energy is delivered by a customer’s regular electric provider, and the power produced from the community solar array is fed directly back to the electric grid. As the grid is supplied with clean energy, subscribers receive credit on their electric bills for their portion of the community solar system.Cuomo said:This program will provide the necessary support to bring forward solar projects in communities that are historically underserved and can gain the most from the health and environmental benefits and cost-savings.Photo: The Lion Electric Co.",solar
2021/07/20,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):As the result of using fossil-fueled ships to import their goods into the US, just 15 retailers emitted as much shipping pollution as the equivalent of 1.5 million US homes, according to a study released today from environmental organizations Pacific Environment and Stand.earth. Shady Ships: Retail Giants Pollute Communities and Climate with Fossil-Fueled Ocean Shipping is the first study to quantify the environmental and public health impacts from some of the largest US retailers’ reliance on overseas manufacturing and fossil-fueled transoceanic shipping. By cross-referencing a comprehensive set of cargo manifests – that is, consolidated lists of all the cargo that is on board a cargo vessel – with a dataset on individual ship emissions, researchers were able to estimate the pollution associated with each unit of cargo on discrete shipping routes and, for the first time, assign those emissions to retail companies.More than 50,000 merchant ships currently carry around 80% of global trade each year, and ocean-going cargo volumes are projected to grow by as much as 130% by 2050. Every merchant ship currently in operation runs on fossil fuels. The top 15 polluters ranked, with No. 1 being the worst, are:For example, the report states, No. 3 Target’s “dirty shipping produced more CO2 than the entire CO2 output of all 20 of the world’s smallest countries most vulnerable to climate change.”Electrek’s Take: It’s not enough to set a net zero target for just your own company, as many of the above companies have. Supply chain emissions – and especially maritime shipping emissions – also have to be acknowledged and addressed. Shipping emits over 1 billion tonnes a year of CO2, and it’s growing.Read more: Well, this is an interesting twist in the clean energy sector. Solar company Allco Renewable Energy is suing the US Department of the Interior over the Vineyard Wind offshore wind farm, off Massachusetts. Allco alleges that Vineyard Wind threatens the fishing industry and the fish. The lawsuit was filed Sunday in federal court. The lawsuit states:This case challenges the approval of the proposed Vineyard Wind Project by the Defendants. It asks the Court to set aside those approvals as violating the National Environmental Policy Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and section 101 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Defendants’ rules and regulations, and to ensure that federal review of the proposed project complies with the law.Allco also specifically argues that no offshore wind farm can survive a Category 3 or greater Atlantic hurricane, so the company says that could jeopardize endangered sea turtles and the Right Whale (and thus the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act).Electrek’s Take: To state the obvious, Allco is a competitor of Vineyard Wind in the clean energy sector. Hmmmm. There is definitely no ulterior motive here. And you know what will threaten marine life and the fishing industry even more than this offshore wind farm? Global warming.

That trend began in 2014, despite year-on-year declines from record-high production in 2019. US petroleum and natural gas output in 2020 totaled 66.9 quadrillion British thermal units (quads), which nearly meets the amount as Russia’s 45.5 quads and Saudi Arabia’s 26.5 quads of petroleum and natural gas production combined, at 72 quads.The EIA reports:Petroleum and natural gas production fell in all three countries in 2020 following a rapid decline in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent crude oil price declines, particularly in the first quarter of 2020. Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to reduce their crude oil production as part of an OPEC+ agreement, but in the United States, reduced production was largely the result of a price-induced fall in tight oil investments and, to a lesser extent, unplanned outages.Read more: The most important US energy chart of the year is out: 8 big takeawaysThe annual capacity-weighted average construction costs for solar PV systems in the US continued to decrease in 2019, dropping by just under 3%, according to the EIA‘s data on newly constructed, utility-scale electric generators. Solar construction costs averaged $1,796 per kilowatt in 2019, a 2.8% decrease from 2018. The decrease was driven by falling costs for crystalline silicon axis-based tracking panels, which fell to $1,497 per kilowatt in 2019. Crystalline silicon axis-based tracking panels made up almost half of the solar capacity added in the US in 2019, at 2.5 gigawatts. Among solar technologies, crystalline silicon fixed-tilt panels had the highest average cost in 2019, at $2,242 per kilowatt.Utility-scale solar panel costs are expected to continue to fall 19% by 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie in December 2020:However, procurement strategies and soft-cost optimization will determine just how much costs can be reduced on a dollar-per-installed-watt basis with more megawatts installed.

2021/07/16,"Clean energy may mean less mining for coal, but it also means more mining for minerals such as cobalt for use in alloys and batteries, tellurium for solar cells and semiconductors, and germanium for transistors in electronic devices. Reducing emissions from US energy sources will increase the need for metal production by two to six times per kilowatt of energy production, says Dr. Michael Moats, professor and interim chair of materials science and engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T).Moats, who is director of the Thomas J. O’Keefe Institute for the Sustainable Supply of Strategic Minerals at Missouri S&T, says current mining of cobalt, for instance, provides about 100,000 tons per year. To meet future clean energy needs, production would need to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Much of current production comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo and is refined by China.Moats says:We could eventually reach some of our materials needs by recycling, but there is very little to recycle at this point. So, we’re going to have to bring on new mines to meet the demand.It becomes an issue of how much control you want over your supply chain and how difficult it can be to bring supplies from overseas during wartime or political upheaval. It’s a very complex discussion because it involves energy, defense, economics, diplomacy, and other areas.The US relies entirely on imports for 17 mineral commodities, 14 of which are identified as critical minerals, according to the US Geological Survey. Resources in the US are small compared with countries such as Canada, says Moats, and the US lacks the smelters to refine the materials from ore and existing mine tailings.For example, Missouri Cobalt (pictured above) claims to be the only vertically integrated cobalt producer in North America. “Its flagship Madison mine in Missouri is estimated to hold 72 million pounds of recoverable cobalt, 105 million pounds of nickel, and 103 million pounds of copper, the company said,” according to Reuters. The US has cobalt assets in Missouri, Minnesota, and Idaho, but production trails other sources because the US permitting process takes years. When it comes to lithium, which is currently essential for electric car batteries, the New York Times wrote in May:Even though the United States has some of the world’s largest reserves, the country today has only one large-scale lithium mine, Silver Peak in Nevada, which first opened in the 1960s and is producing just 5,000 tons a year — less than 2% of the world’s annual supply.The US mining industry is working out the big conundrum of clean energy and electric vehicles – how best to extract vital minerals and minimize harm to the environment, such as groundwater contamination. One option is brine extraction.Developing a trained domestic workforce consisting of the trades, engineers, and scientists is another challenge to overcome. Moats testified to members of the US House Committee on Natural Resources earlier in 2021 that many US universities no longer offer degrees in mining or metallurgical engineering. In his testimony, Moats recommended that the US government create a mining and metallurgy innovation center to foster research and build interest in critical metals production.There are only 11 mining engineering programs in the US that are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), and seven schools that offer ABET-accredited metallurgical engineering programs.Read more: Tesla secures new cobalt deal as it phases out the controversial mineralPhoto: Missouri Cobalt",solar
2021/07/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):There are over 1.5 million oil-heated homes in the UK, which make up around 5% of total occupied homes. As of June 23, 19 properties across the country had successfully adopted hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which is made from fossil-free, certified sustainable waste materials sourced without harming the environment and reduces emissions by almost 90%.Jodie Allan, a former president of the UK and Ireland Fuel Distributors Association (UKIFDA), converted her home in Drymen, Scotland, to HVO in March, and said to Scottish Housing News that everything has gone smoothly. She’s piloting HVO in a yearlong trial. Of the 129,000 oil heated homes in Scotland, Allen is the first to adopt HVO. She said:Depending on the particular system being converted the cost will come in at somewhere between £500 [$690) and £1,000 [$1,381]. The HVO is stored in our existing 1,200-liter tank and it is estimated we will use 20 liters a day in the colder months.However, the current cost of renewable liquid fuels is approximately three times traditional heating oil. As the supply and demand increases, the cost is expected to drop. Ken Cronin, CEO of UKIFDA, said:The early trial results indicate that HVO can offer the all-important choice that has been lacking when it comes to low carbon heating solutions for our customers.We are confident oil heated households will be keen to accept an HVO solution as it overcomes the major cost of change and disruption barriers to decarbonization that exist for so many people living in older, hard-to-treat homes.Oil-heated households in the UK can learn more about using HVO here.The US Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) yesterday launched Solar Automated Permit Processing Plus – SolarAPP+ – which is a free web-based platform designed to help governments and installers by standardizing and automating residential solar permitting and installation.The software was developed by NREL, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), leading rooftop solar companies, building officials, and other clean energy leaders to help more than 2.4 million homes go solar while creating 30,000 new American jobs over the next few years. It was piloted in Tucson; Pima County, Arizona; Menifee, California; and Pleasant Hill, California. In Tucson, for example, SolarAPP+ reduced permitting reviews from approximately 20 business days to zero. The short video below explains how SolarAPP+ works:US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

SolarAPP+ will help the US double its solar installations to 6 million by 2026.Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO, also said:We can’t stop here, though, which is why SEIA is urging Congress to act on a bold infrastructure package that prioritizes long-term policy drivers for solar and storage deployment.

2021/07/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):If home rooftop solar is used to charge an electric car in the US, it costs just $415 annually, compared to $662 on grid power at home annually, and $1,058 annually with a public EV charger, according to a study conducted by consumer solar panel installation reviews website SolarReviews. The study also found that it costs up to $1,260 annually to fill a gas car’s tank.A typical solar EV charging setup includes: rooftop solar panels, a central string inverter that combines DC output of the solar panels to AC, and a level 2 EV charger. SolarReviews estimates that five solar panels are needed to charge an EV.According to the US Department of Transportation, the average American drives about 13,500 miles per year, or about 40 miles per day. Here’s how it breaks down:Home solar charging also contributes the least amount of carbon emissions, as electricity from the power grid still comes primarily from fossil fuels. In nearly every state, the long-term cost of solar roof panels is less than buying electricity from the grid, where the average kilowatt-hour cost is rising over time. The levelized cost of home solar will remain consistent, and in most cases, will be cheaper than grid power. SolarReviews estimates that charging an  EV with solar for 25 years could result in $16,250 in savings by the end of the solar panels’ production warranty.Despite the challenges of devastating hurricanes, floods, and landslides in 2020, El Salvador’s very first wind farm, the Ventus Wind Project, has now come online. The 54 megawatt wind farm, which is in Metapán, in the northwest of the country, consists of 15 Vestas V136-3.6MW turbines.Power generation developer Tracia Network Corporation, a subsidiary of Guatemalan conglomerate Grupo Centrans, commissioned the wind farm, and worked with US consultancy firm ArcVera Renewables.The new wind farm will help reduce El Salvador’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, which accounted for 69% of its total energy supply in 2019, according to IRENA. Another 19.6% comes from bioenergy. It will also provide greater energy price stability and diversify the national power grid.The Ventus wind farm will prevent the emission of around 200,000 tons of CO2 annually.Photo: Electrify America",solar
2021/07/13,"A site the size of greater Sydney may host a $100 billion project to convert wind and solar into green hydrogen in Western Australia. If built, it will become the world’s largest clean energy hub.Australian renewable energy developer CWP Global, Hong Kong-based Intercontinental Energy, and Indigenous-owned energy company Mirning Green Energy Limited announced the project today. The companies want to build the clean energy hub in three phases to produce up to 3.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen or 20 million tonnes of green ammonia annually for both domestic use and export. The group said in a statement:Green fuels produced at the site will meet massive future demand from multiple sectors, including in co-firing in power generation, the shipping sector, heavy industry such as steel, chemicals and mining, as well as the aviation sector.The $100 billion Western Green Energy Hub, which will be located on the southern coast of Western Australia, will sit on 15,000 square kilometers (5,792 square miles) and host a massive 50 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity. Wind would make up around 30 gigawatts.Renew Economy details:The consortium said the area featured a strong wind resource, with average speed of 9 meters per second, and good solar, with around 2,000 kWh per square metre of solar irradiation. That translated into an expected capacity factor of around 70%. A final investment decision is expected in 2028.According to the Guardian:Guardian Australia understands the consortium is looking to produce the first fuels from the project by 2030, and will look to construct an offshore facility to transfer fuels onto ships.Western Australia’s hydrogen minister Alannah MacTiernan said that “CWP and Intercontinental have secured a license from the [Western Australia] state government to complete site surveys that will be used to build a business case for the proposed site.”Unless Australia makes a minimum of a 50% cut in emissions by 2030 and reaches net zero before 2050, it won’t be able to meet its Paris Agreement targets.Read more: Australia to host the latest world’s largest solar farmPhoto: Rainbow Coast",solar

It’s a $436 million plan to install EV chargers throughout its 50,000-square-mile service area.The plan is the current largest utility-led investment in electric vehicle infrastructure in the US.Around half will be installed in disadvantaged communities, and many will be installed in public parking lots, workplaces, libraries, hospitals, public schools, housing complexes, and other public locations to accommodate people who live in apartments.Edison International chief executive officer Pedro Pizarro said yesterday of the new plan:Transportation electrification is the largest near-term opportunity to affordably reduce greenhouse gas emissions and clean our air.The Biden administration has called for a 100% carbon-free US power sector by 2035 with an interim target of 80% clean electricity by 2030.One widely studied policy design to achieve “80×30” is a flexible clean energy standard (CES). A CES would require utilities to achieve annual clean energy milestones. That would create a financial incentive for clean energy while indirectly lowering the value of other types of generation.A new multi-institutional report from The Clean Energy Futures project at Syracuse University, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Resources for the Future, and the Georgia Institute of Technology is called “An 80×30 Clean Electricity Standard: Carbon, Costs, and Health Benefits.” [The report] aims to quantify the carbon emissions, costs, and air quality outcomes of contrasting electricity sector policies that are relevant to current national discussions.

2021/07/12,"Landfill, aka garbage dumps or tips, can, under the right conditions, be converted into solar farms once they’re capped. (Capping means putting a cover or barrier between the contaminated material and the surface.) There has been a nearly 80% increase in landfill solar projects built in the US over the past five years. But there are some factors that first need to be considered.Putting solar farms on landfill is a great way to generate clean energy on what were previously considered unusable sites, but there are some special factors to consider. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) points out that “it is important to think about PV projects on landfills in terms of an integrated system, not as separate landfill and PV systems.”Major factors that impact feasibility of solar on landfill sites for both net-metered and utility-scale solar farms include, but are not limited to:There’s also venting and methane recapture infrastructure to think about, as landfill releases methane, carbon dioxide, and non-methane organic compounds.There are solar companies that are creating products that can be adapted to landfills’ unique needs. For example, landfills that host solar generally don’t allow penetration in the site’s land surface, so mounting and foundation technology must be adaptable and lighter. Youngstown, Ohio-based Solar FlexRack makes photovoltaic mounting and solar trackers. Its Series B Cast-In-Place mounting technology features customizable blocks, lighter ballasts, and greater flexibility that can successfully hold solar panels on the surface of landfill.Solar FlexRack installed its Series B mounting technology on a 4.7-megawatt community solar project in Spanish Fork, Utah (pictured above), which will go live this summer. It’s the largest landfill solar project in Utah, at 27 acres. It will generate enough clean energy to power nearly 3,000 homes.When it comes to making solar work on landfill, Gretchen Dolson, renewable energy lead for HDR, an architectural, engineering and consulting firm based in Omaha, Nebraska [via Waste 360], says:Always begin with the end in mind and know it’s never too early to plan and think of alternate uses, regardless of the type of waste facility. Solar is often viable. But it depends on how the landfill was designed to function and how it was closed.Read more: Where do solar panels go when they die?Photo: Solar FlexRack",solar
2021/07/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In February, as Electrek reported, Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas announced the launch of its new offshore wind turbine – the V236-15.0MW. It stole the title from US conglomerate GE’s 14MW Haliade-X to become the world’s largest offshore wind turbine.And now, German energy company EnBW has pre-selected the massive Vestas turbines for He Dreiht, a 900 megawatt, subsidy-free offshore wind farm in the German North Sea. It would be the first commercial deployment of the Vestas 15MW wind turbines if the pre-selection is upgraded to an unconditional order.EnBW secured the rights for He Dreiht in Germany’s first offshore wind tender in 2017.A single V236-15.0 MW is capable of producing 80 GWh per year, depending on site-specific conditions. The rotor diameter is 236 meters (774 feet). One turbine will sweep an area of 470,845 square feet (43,743 square meters) and will have capacity to power 20,000 households.Turbine installation is due to begin in the second quarter of 2025, with full park commissioning anticipated for the fourth quarter of the same year.Nova Scotia premier Iain Rankin announced on Saturday that he wants 80% of Nova Scotia’s energy to come from renewables by 2030. He also announced that a Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued for renewables to supply 10% of the Canadian province’s electricity. The RFP results are expected to get the province to 70% of renewable electricity, with the remaining 10% of the target to be reached by 2030.The RFP seeks 350 megawatts of electricity from renewables. It would reduce Nova Scotia’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 million tonnes each year, create 4,000 jobs mostly in rural areas, and generate more than $550 million in the construction sector.A press release from the province states that wind is now the cheapest source of electrical energy in Canada.Photo: Courtesy of Vestas Wind Systems A/S",solar
2021/07/07,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):July 7 update: After Electrek posted this story on July 2, a Maine state legislator, who is also a “lobster boat captain, and fisheries advocate,” emailed on July 4 to state that an amendment had been added that “calls for an indefinite prohibition on [offshore wind] in state waters.” Electrek examined the amendment, which did indeed state that, but there was no date on it. So we called Stephanie Watson, Maine’s offshore wind program manager, yesterday, and asked whether the offshore wind ban in state waters was a decade-long moratorium or permanent. Watson replied that she didn’t know and would come back to us.Today, Dan Burgess, the director of Maine’s Governor’s Energy Office, emailed us a breaking press release. It states the following:Governor Janet Mills [D-ME] has signed into law LD 1619, which prohibits new offshore wind projects in state waters. The prohibition preserves State waters for recreation and fishing – where up to 75% of Maine’s commercial lobster harvesting occurs – and cements into law Maine’s priority of locating offshore wind projects in federal waters in the Gulf of Maine.We asked the Energy Office why this story was originally reported as a 10-year moratorium and are waiting to hear back about why the offshore wind ban in state waters has been made permanent.Maine federal waters are three miles from shore. Maine Republicans and fishermen originally tried to ban all offshore wind but failed – the Natural Resources Council of Maine opposed the ban, for example – and the new law is a compromise. Electrek’s Take: The press release stresses Maine’s desire to embrace clean energy and offshore wind… in federal waters. We applaud Maine expressing its desire to “transition to 100% renewable energy, and help fight climate change.” So we hope to see concrete plans for Maine offshore wind farms in federal waters surface soon. Because if the lobster industry, which is vital to Maine, is to thrive, then renewable energy is the only way forwardThere has been a 50% decline in surface krill due to warming waters, for example, which is a food source for lobsters. If we don’t get rid of fossil fuels and the waters continue to warm, there won’t be any lobsters to catch, in state waters or anywhere else. Time will tell if this law will be successful or short-sighted.Maine governor Janet Mills (D-ME) supports offshore wind, but those working in the lobster industry are worried that offshore wind turbines will threaten their livelihood. So the Maine legislature has unanimously approved a compromise, which Mills is expected to sign, because she introduced the proposal.Basically, state waters will be used for fishing and recreation, and offshore wind energy will be prioritized in federal waters farther from the Maine coast.There will be a moratorium, which will last until March 1, 2031, on projects close to the coast, and the state is working with New England Aqua Ventus on a floating offshore wind technology demonstration project, the first in the US, in federal waters.Further, there will also be a group created called the Offshore Wind Research Consortium that will include members of fishing groups. At the end of April, Mills said:We will focus these efforts in federal waters farther off our coast, as we responsibly pursue a small research array that can help us establish the best way for Maine to embrace the vast economic and environmental benefits of offshore wind.Fundamentally, I do not believe offshore wind and Maine’s fishing industry are mutually exclusive. I believe they not only can coexist, but, together, can help us build a stronger economy with more good-paying jobs and a brighter, more sustainable future for Maine people.Read more: Maine becomes the first US state to divest from fossil fuelsION Energy, a startup that develops software to improve the life and performance of Li-ion batteries that power EVs and energy storage, has raised $3.6 million in Pre-Series A funding.

2021/07/06,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Dubuque, Iowa’s City Council will today consider launching a pilot program, called Renew DBQ, to help low- to moderate-income homeowners install rooftop solar. If the pilot is approved and is successful, then the city will expand and continue it. Dubuque’s program could also serve as a model for other cities to adopt.Dubuque has budgeted nearly $41,000 for the pilot project, which would see the installation of solar panels on 10 homes. The Dubuque Telegraph Herald explains how it would work:Under the pilot, city staff would work with entities such as Dubuque County Energy District and local solar installers to identify interested low- to moderate-income homeowners in the downtown urban renewal district to install solar panels at an average size of about 5 kilowatts per household.The total cost to install the panels would be about $10,000, but with tax credits, grants, and the sale of energy credits, homeowners would pay about $2,600, according to council documents. Households would save about $800 to $1,000 annually in energy costs and about $30,000 over the 25-year lifespan of the solar panels.The city would create a market for solar renewable energy credits. The city would pay homeowners in the program to cover the costs of the credits and claim them as part of its effort to reduce community greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030.According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Iowa has 423.7 megawatts of solar installed through first quarter 2021. The state ranks 28th in the US for solar, falling from 22nd in 2020. 0.46% of Iowa’s electricity comes from solar power.

2021/07/05,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):June car registrations in the UK showed strong growth in electric car sales, as well as the continued decline of new diesel car registrations. New diesel and new fully electric cars are now tied for third place behind gas cars and hybrids in the new car market, according to New AutoMotive, an independent transport research organization with a mission to accelerate and support the UK’s transition to electric vehicles.Almost 16,000 new fully electric cars were registered in June 2021 – the highest share of the market so far this year. In contrast, new diesel car registrations have not recovered from the collapse in sales during the pandemic.Regionally, the Northeast, London, and the Southeast continue to be hotspots for new EV registrations. Northeast England now averages 13% of all newly registered cars being fully electric.Ben Nelmes, head of policy at New AutoMotive, said:Electric car sales saw strong growth in June. While petrol remains the most popular fuel type, the growth of registrations of new hybrid vehicles is a concern. Hybrids are not zero emissions cars, and the UK needs to see faster growth in zero emissions, fully electric cars to meet its net zero target. Ministers should consider introducing a California-style scheme that would reward manufacturers for selling fully electric cars instead of hybrids.Check out New AutoMotive’s interactive data dashboard here.The pandemic significantly reduced US energy consumption overall in 2020. Almost all of the decline came from less consumption of petroleum for transport and coal used for electricity.

The benefits greatly exceed the costs. IRENA foresees the creation of up to 122 million energy-related jobs in 2050, more than double today’s 58 million. Renewable energy alone will account for more than one-third of all energy jobs, employing 43 million people globally. When air pollution, human health, and climate change externalities are factored in, the payback is even higher, with every dollar spent on the energy transition adding benefits valued at between $2 and $5.50, and in cumulative terms between $61 trillion and $164 trillion by 2050.Francesco La Camera, IRENA’s director-general, said in an emailed statement:There is consensus that an energy transition grounded in renewables and efficient technologies is the only way to give us a fighting chance of limiting global warming by 2050 to 1.5°C.Energy transformation will drive economic transformation.

Caterpillar will be the exclusive equipment, technology and services provider – developing, testing, and producing Cat® “zero-emission machines.”Neither company goes into specifics about the electric vehicles Caterpillar will develop.NMG “is developing advanced carbon-neutral graphite-based material solutions for the growing lithium-ion and fuel cell markets.” As NMG CEO Éric Desaulniers points out in the video below:The graphite extracted with this technology might actually power its battery pack.Electrek last wrote about Caterpillar in 2019, when it developed an all-electric 26-ton excavator with a giant 300 kWh battery pack for construction company Veidekke in Norway.Democratic Republic of Congo, which is Africa’s top copper producer and the world’s largest cobalt miner, signed power purchase agreements for the construction of two 100 megawatt solar farms in the southeast, which are copper- and cobalt-rich. Cobalt and copper are used in electric vehicle batteries.State-owned utility Société Nationale d’Electricité (SNEL) made the agreements with developer Financing Access, which is partnered with investment fund Green Power Capital.The solar farm in Kolwezi will cost $148 million, and the solar farm in Likasi will cost $157 million. Both are expected to break ground in March 2022 and come online in early 2023.Jean-Bosco Kayombo Kayan, SNEL’s director general, said in a statement [via Reuters]:With the signing of this agreement, we will contribute to securing the energy supply in the major urban and peri-urban centers.Similarly, we will be able to ensure the supply of electricity to industrialists in the area, in particular the mining companies which represent the economic lungs of Haut-Katanga and Lualaba [provinces].Reuters continues:The two plants will provide the [DRC]’s grid with an average annual production of around 500 gigawatt hours, enough to supply electricity to more than 1.25 million people, SNEL said.…Less than 10% of Congo’s roughly 90 million people have reliable access to electricity, and electricity shortages are a major impediment to building processing factories to add value to copper and cobalt exports.Photo: Nouveau Monde Graphite",solar
2021/06/28,"GE Renewables has launched a first-of-its-kind underwater robot that can inspect hydropower turbines faster, more easily, and safely than humans can.GE Hydro Solutions’ underwater turbine inspection robot, which GE describes as the size of a “beaver,” can inspect hard-to-reach areas of any type of hydropower turbine without taking the equipment out of the water. In fact, it’s able to inspect between turbine runner blades within openings of less than 200 mm – that’s under 8 inches. The inspection robot can detect all the same things as the traditional, time-consuming, expensive inspection method, which involves taking units offline, draining the turbines, and sending people into dark, confined spaces. Potential problems to look for include erosion, cavitation, corrosion, impact marks, and the presence of foreign bodies, according to GE. The robot’s onboard camera provides clear images, and it also records what it sees on video for further analysis.A GE blog describes operators’ experience of using the underwater inspection robot. Here’s an excerpt, and it sounds really exciting:[David Auger-Habel, lead engineer at GE’s Hydro Solutions] felt a jangle of nervous excitement as he launched the vehicle toward the idled turbine and returned to his laptop. “We had some doubts, because we were using so many new components,” he says. The engineer piloted the device up to the turbine using a joystick. On his screen were two real-time images: one from the remotely operated vehicle (ROV)’s onboard camera, which served as a kind of underwater dashcam, and the other from the probe, which trailed behind on a tether. Within minutes, the computer screen displayed a crisp image of the runner blades, glinting in the refection of the ROV’s headlights.With the ROV treading water, it was time to use the inspection probe. Auger-Habel guided the camera and light module between two of the runner blades. Mission accomplished: Engineers could now inspect every last inch of the hydromechanical system without leaving their chairs, let alone getting wet and cold. The image quality was stunning. “It really was a big surprise, to see so clearly. It was easier to float the probe than to crawl and squeeze my head between the blades as I’ve done during previous inspections,” he says.Back in the office, the engineers were impressed. “The images were so clear, people thought it was photoshopped,” Auger-Habel says. “We had to show the customer videos with fish swimming across to prove it was actually an underwater inspection.” Using the ROV, Auger-Habel completed inspections for all three turbines at the plant in just three days.GE Renewable Energy organized a two-day hackathon in Montreal – a major hydropower center – in September 2019 to come up with an “autonomous swimming robot that could scan submerged turbines for defects.” It brought in 25 students from Canadian colleges and paired them with 25 GE employees. The winner of the hackathon was a concept nicknamed “Yellow Submarine.” It took six months to develop the prototype, and GE turned it into the game-changing commercial product this year.Read more: This ‘bug’ robot will inspect and repair offshore wind turbine bladesPhotos: GE Renewable Energy",solar

Ambani is chairman, managing director, and the largest shareholder of Reliance Industries, a Fortune Global 500 company and India’s most valuable company by market value. Reliance is a diverse company that gets 60% of its revenue from oil refining and petrochemicals.Ambani announced that Reliance will spend 600 billion rupees on four gigafactories to produce solar modules, hydrogen, fuel cells, and a battery grid. An additional 150 billion rupees will be invested in value chain and other partnerships.Ambani was ranked fourth among global fossil-fuel billionaires by Bloomberg Green in 2020.Ambani said:The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer. The huge quantities of carbon it has emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.In 2020, Reliance announced it would become net-zero carbon by 2035. However, Ambani said the company’s plan to bring the Saudi Arabian Oil Company into its energy division as an investor will be finalized this year, and Aramco chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan will join Reliance’s board.Enel Russia has officially opened a 90 megawatt (MW) wind farm at Azov, in Rostov Oblast, western Russia. It sits on the coastline of the Taganrog Bay of the Azov Sea. Enel Green Power oversaw the development of the wind farm.The $161 million wind farm will generate around 320 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually. It features 26 Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy 3.4-132 turbines. Each has a rated capacity of 3.465 MW.It’s Enel Russia’s first clean energy project in Russia, and Rostov Oblast’s first-ever clean energy project. “Enel Russia is developing two more wind projects in the country – the 201 MW Kolskaya in the Murmansk region and 71 MW Rodnikovksya in the Stavropol area,” reports Renews.biz.Russia Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Novak said:In 2020, around 1GW of new renewable capacity was commissioned, which is 82% more than in 2019.And the majority of the renewable objects commissioned in 2020 are wind power plants.It was decided to extend the renewable energy support program until 2035. According to preliminary calculations, within the framework of the program in 2023-2035, it is expected to commission renewables-based generation with a total installed capacity of more than 6.7GW.Russia has great potential for wind energy resources utilization, but it has not yet developed large-scale commercial wind energy production.Photo: “India Solar” by CIFaction is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/06/25,"US Senators Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) announced late today that more than $5.4 million in federal grant funding will be awarded to the Atlanta-Region Transit Link Authority to purchase electric buses.Ossoff said in an emailed statement:We have secured this funding because electrification of Georgia’s public bus fleet is an economic and environmental imperative. These new buses will reduce air pollution and increase the efficiency of transit in Georgia.The Low-No Program through the Federal Transit Administration provides funding to state and local government authorities for the purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses, including acquisition, construction, and leasing of required supporting facilities.Atlanta-Region Transit Link Authority (ATL) has 166 coaches in its fleet and no electric buses to date, so new electric buses is a significant milestone.ATL’s application for federal funding was for 10 battery electric commuter coaches and 11 chargers (including one maintenance facility charger). ATL partnered with MCI, CTE, and Atkins on the application. MCI manufactures the D45 CRTe LE, the only federally tested/approved electric commuter coach currently on the market, according to Dr. Ericka Davis, ATL chief communications officer. CTE will provide project management, modeling, performance validation, and other technical assistance. Atkins will provide engineering services for infrastructure installation. The EV coaches will be based out of ATL’s South Ops Facility located in Clayton County and will replace 10 model-year 2004 diesel buses.ATL is also partnering with Georgia Power to make electrical infrastructure upgrades at its Xpress South Operations Facility.The project will reduce emissions and improve air quality in Fulton, Clayton, and Henry counties.Chris Tomlinson, executive director at ATL, told Electrek:We are extremely pleased to have been selected as one of 49 projects awarded. We greatly appreciate the support of our partners at the Federal Transit Administration, and the efforts of the Georgia congressional delegation in our receiving this transformative investment in our transit infrastructure. The ATL was fortunate to also have had the support of numerous state and local leaders, as well as the private sector. This grant award will help us improve fleet reliability, reduce our long-term maintenance needs, improve air quality, and reduce noise pollution in the communities we serve. These electric buses will eliminate the need for 87,000 gallons of fuel while reducing 901 tons of carbon emissions. These factors align with four of the ATL’s Governing principles: Environmental Sustainability, Equity, Innovation and Return on Investment – and ensures that our Xpress riders can continue to commute with confidence.Photo: Joey Kyber/Unsplash",solar
2021/06/25,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):German chemicals giant BASF will buy 49.5% of Swedish power company Vattenfall‘s future Dutch offshore wind farm, Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ). The remainder of HKZ’s power will supply clean energy to Netherlands residents. Once fully commissioned in 2023, HKZ will feature 140 Siemens Gamesa 11 MW wind turbines (pictured above). Construction will start in July 2021.HKZ’s site is 18 kilometers (11 miles) offshore in the North Sea, between The Hague and Zandvoort. HKZ will be the world’s first fully merchant offshore wind farm that doesn’t receive any price subsidies for its power produced because, in Vattenfall’s words, “the cost price of offshore wind energy has dropped appreciably in the last few years.”BASF will pay around €1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) to fund the project, which includes a purchase price of €0.3 billion ($0.36 billion) plus construction costs. BASF is boosting its investments in clean energy to offset emissions at its European production sites. It “aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by the year 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” according to a news release. BASF continues:One important lever to further bring down emissions is replacing fossil-based electricity with fossil-free electricity. BASF will secure the required amounts of renewable power through a “make and buy” approach. Read more: A 24-year-old Dutch wind farm is being decommissioned. Here’s what’s nextClean energy isn’t just about using renewable power; it’s also about efficiently using power. Houses are responsible for 20% of US greenhouse gas emissions.New York City-headquartered Sealed, which makes houses more energy efficient with no upfront costs for homeowners, announced yesterday that it has raised $16 million in Series B funding, which will enable it to accelerate US expansion efforts. It’s launching in New Jersey and Connecticut, its first service areas outside of New York State.Fifth Wall made its first lead investment from its Climate Technology Fund, and actor Robert Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition Ventures also invested. Returning backers Cyrus Capital and CityRock Ventures also participated in the round.Here’s how Sealed works: First, Sealed’s experts gather the house’s structural details and assess annual energy use patterns. Sealed then creates an energy efficiency plan and matches the homeowner with a suitable contractor. The homeowner can customize their payment terms, and all customers can opt for paying zero upfront costs. The repayment terms are designed to balance low upfront costs with minimal changes to the homeowner’s ongoing expenses. After the upgrades are complete, Sealed reviews the homeowner’s energy use from their utility bill and compares the new energy use to the pre-upgrade energy profile. The difference between the new energy use and the old energy profile is the homeowner’s monthly energy reduction. The bill for Sealed is based on the size of the energy reduction each month. That means if the house doesn’t save energy on a given month, the payment to Sealed is zero.FootPrint Coalition Ventures cofounder Robert Downey Jr. said:There’s roughly $50 billion in wasted energy leaking out through the roofs of more than 33 million homes across the United States.We love the promise of Sealed – upgrading homes with new insulation, air sealing, LED lights, smart thermostats, and modern heating and cooling technology – and that Sealed only gets paid if they reduce a customer’s energy consumption. Photo: Siemens Gamesa",solar
2021/06/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):It’s time for some electric vehicle statistical facts fun! Bottom line, the numbers confirm what we know: EV uptake is growing quickly in the US.According to Austin-based research, media, and events agency Zpryme that focuses on energy, and the US Department of Energy and Argonne National Lab, Tesla models accounted for over 54% of US EV sales in 2021 through May. Further, US electric vehicle sales in May reached 53,779 units, representing a 19.2% increase over April 2021. On a year-on-year basis, this represents a whopping 329% increase compared to May 2020 US EV sales of 12,536 units. April also saw a year-on-year jump, with 10,073 sold in 2020 and 45,105 sold in 2021.Through May 2021, cumulative EV sales totaled 204,012 and overall EVs sold since 2010 increased by 2.9%, to 1.92 million. Year to date, 2021 total EV sales are up by 119% versus 2020.In May, battery electric vehicles accounted for 70.6% of all plug-in electric vehicles sold in the US. (Take that, hybrids.)On the charging front, 609 charging stations and 1,736 charging outlets were added in the US in May. The majority – 439 – of the charging stations added were ChargePoint’s. California, Massachusetts, and New York added the most charging stations in May, with 170, 80, and 59, respectively.Through May 2021, the US had 46,104 EV charging stations and 117,674 charging outlets.

2021/06/23,"Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) just signed into law SB 1128/HB 919, “Preemption Over Restriction of Utility Services,” which was pushed through the legislature. It prevents local governments from deciding which energy path they want to take. In other words, Florida towns and cities are now unable to switch to 100% clean energy because they can’t ban fossil fuels.SB 1128/HB 919 states:An act relating to preemption over restriction of utility services; creating s. 366.032, F.S.; prohibiting municipalities, counties, special districts, or other political subdivisions from restricting or prohibiting the types or fuel sources of energy production used, delivered, converted, or supplied by certain entities to serve customers; providing construction; voiding existing specified documents and policies that are preempted by this act; providing an effective date.Or, as the Miami Herald explains, the new law:…invalidates local comprehensive plans that restrict land use related to fossil fuel and renewable energy.

Now, DeSantis just signed a new law that stops our local governments from moving to renewable energy.It’s anti-democratic. #HB919During the Trump administration, clean energy initiatives in the US were implemented at local, city, and some state levels.

DeSantis just kneecapped Florida communities’ efforts to fight climate change and transition to clean energy by insisting that fossil fuels must be present in all electricity systems.Supporters of the bill argued that consumers, not local governments, should be able to choose what type of energy source they use. But local governments are elected by the people.The bill naturally had the backing of the Florida Natural Gas Association, seeing how natural gas is Florida’s largest single source of electricity. It powers 70% of the state’s electricity. So it’s big money.It’s also dirty. Natural gas (mostly burned for electricity) produces 34.7% of Florida’s CO2 emissions, according to the US Energy Information Administration (table 3), behind petroleum, which produces 51.8% of the state’s emissions (mostly burned in cars). The electricity sector as a whole makes up 43.5% of Florida’s total emissions, which is disproportionately higher than the national average. Also, natural gas’s emissions might even be higher in reality due to unaccounted-for fugitive methane emissions.DeSantis has a record of passing preemptive bills against straw men, and this is yet another example. He likes to ban what might be. No local government in Florida has banned natural gas yet. Miami, the “most vulnerable coastal city” to climate change worldwide, is already experiencing the effects of climate change between flooding and contamination of its water supply due to sea level rise. The city has said it would need to block natural gas in new construction soon in order to protect itself from disaster, which would be important for the state, given that the Miami metro area makes up somewhere between a quarter and a third of Florida’s total economic output. Now, it can’t work to mitigate the causes of the climate change that threatens it because cities can no longer develop green building codes that exclude natural gas connections.Let’s use an analogy. It’s now universally accepted, after many years of Big Tobacco insisting otherwise (incidentally, using the same lobbyists and industry-funded scientists who now deny climate change), that smoking cigarettes is bad for our health. Individuals can still legally smoke, but the Florida government has restricted where they can smoke. Fossil fuel emissions are even more dangerous than cigarette smoke – they caused 1 out of 5 deaths globally in 2018 compared to about 1 out of 7 for smoking. DeSantis just signed a bill saying that we are all required to breathe fossil fuel emissions. In other words, we aren’t allowed to ban “smoking” in our community “house.”Bottom line, DeSantis chose short-term money – because climate change is going to cost Florida billions in the medium and long term, far more than any short-term profits from maintaining the status quo – and large corporate interests over those of his people. He doesn’t care what individual communities want, nor does he care about the health of Floridians.To put it succinctly, they’re angry. Florida Conservation Voters deputy director Jonathan Webber said:The governor had a choice with HB919: Sign it into law and side with the largest energy producers in the country, or veto it and side with local people and local governments. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, he decided to side with corporations – just as he did earlier this year when he raised taxes on working people to give corporations a tax breaks and just as he did when he gave over $500 million in tax breaks to corporations at the start of the pandemic last year. HB 919 does nothing to prepare us to transition to a clean energy future, but instead, it prohibits cities from protecting their own citizens through targeted community-wide clean energy goals. Why anyone, let alone the governor, would make it harder for local governments to protect their residents is beyond me.A group statement on HB 919 was issued by members of the Clean Energy For All table, which includes Catalyst Miami, CLEO Institute, Earthjustice, Florida Conservation Voters, Florida Clinicians for Climate Action, Florida Rising, ReThink Energy FL, and Solar United Neighbors of Florida:We are disappointed that the governor has chosen to sign HB 919. This bill will not only lock Florida into a dirty fossil fuel future, but also permanently silence voices of local communities and remove residents from the conversation on how we power our homes and businesses. By banning local governments from taking any action to control the type of fuel used in their communities, the governor is giving a free pass to polluters to continue promoting and using dirty fossil fuels, the leading cause of climate change. Florida is already dangerously over-reliant on out-of-state natural gas, a greenhouse gas which is much more potent than CO2. With his signature on the Preemption Over Utility Services bill, the governor has chosen to severely limit the choices Floridians have to develop cheaper and less harmful forms of energy production. We are disappointed to see that he has sided with Florida’s monopoly utilities and out-of-state gas companies instead of the people of Florida. And Brooke Errett, Florida senior organizer for Food & Water Watch, an environmental nonprofit that claims 1.1 million members, said in a press statement:We are in the midst of a climate crisis, yet Governor DeSantis insists on choosing politics over Florida’s future.Disclosure: I live in Florida.Here are two big reasons why you should care, even if you don’t live here. One, Florida ranks third in the US for carbon dioxide emissions by state. It is the fourth-largest energy-consuming state and uses almost eight times as much energy as it produces. It’s the second-largest producer of electricity after Texas, and that’s, of course, mostly fueled by natural gas. And it’s growing rapidly – it’s now got the third-largest population behind California and Texas. So that’s a big chunk of our national emissions, and neighboring states, and indeed the whole world, have to deal with the repercussions of Florida’s poor decisions.Secondly, Ron DeSantis just came in first, above Donald Trump, in a straw poll of Republicans as the favorite for the 2024 presidential election candidate. DeSantis has claimed he will address “coastal resilience,” yet here he is only furthering the causes that lead to that coastal devastation. And in the process, he just took cities’ power away to protect themselves. How would this play out at a federal level? Do you see DeSantis upholding the Paris Agreement? Or allowing states and municipalities around the country to protect themselves, should they need to?In recent days, there has been a lot of movement on an effort to define “ecocide” as an international crime, alongside genocide. The definition would involve destruction of our natural environment – which is on par with genocide insofar as humans rely on the natural environment to live.DeSantis’s decision to sign this into law is a clear effort to make our natural environment less livable – to cause harm on a broad scale. Except DeSantis isn’t just killing the home of Floridians; this pro-fossil-fuel decision effectively degrades the home of millions beyond Florida’s border. All cities, towns, and counties in Florida who wanted to commit to achieving 100% renewable energy – to work to protect their residents from the climate emergency – can no longer do so.Florida is seriously threatened by sea level rise – it’s not an “if,” it’s a “when” – and increasingly intense hurricanes, which are already happening. DeSantis knows this; that’s why, as I mentioned, he spends on “coastal resilience.” But to continue the behavior that caused the sea level rise in the first place? Well, that sure sounds like ecocide. ",solar
2021/06/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):US wind power has grown significantly over the past decade, from 40.1 gigawatts in January 2011 to 118.3 GW at the end of 2020. Most of that growth occurred in the Midwest, the US Energy Information Administration reported today.At the beginning of 2011, Texas (which is of course on its own grid) had 9.4 GW of wind capacity. By the end of 2020, wind grew to 27.9 GW, and it leads the US in wind power. The Midwest’s wind rose from 8.6 GW in 2011 to 26.9 GW in 2020. In 2011, the Central region – Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, parts of North Dakota – had about half the wind capacity of the Texas and Midwest regions. But after adding more wind capacity in the last decade than any other region – 20.5 GW – the Central region is now one of the top US wind capacity regions.The US added 14.2 GW of annual wind capacity in 2020. Previously, the most annual wind capacity added in the US was 13.2 GW in 2012.Long Beach, California-headquartered Ways2H, a global supplier of green hydrogen systems, and Skipton, UK-headquartered Element 2, a hydrogen refueling station provider and hydrogen fuel retailer, yesterday announced they would collaborate on the production and distribution of green hydrogen fuel for public transit and other transport in the UK.Ways2H will supply facilities that convert waste into hydrogen gas to supply the hydrogen for Element 2’s network of hydrogen refueling stations. (Ways2H has already achieved this in Japan.) The first project is planned for Scotland. The two companies envision as many as 40 sites. Each provides 500 kg to 1 ton per day of renewable hydrogen fuel. As they begin to arrive in the UK, this will be enough for a heavy-duty truck, lorry, or other Heavy Goods Vehicle to cover 11,000 road kilometers (6,835 miles).Electrek asked both companies’ CEOS if they would be receiving British government incentives.Element 2 CEO Tim Harper replied: We are entirely self-funded at the moment. There are still a lot of uncertainties regarding what support the government will provide and how it will be accessed.Ways2H CEO Jean-Louis Kindler also replied: Not at this time, but from other projects in the UK I know there are incentives available. So long story short, we have not identified a specific incentives package but we expect to have some indeed.The British government is due to announce its green hydrogen strategy before July 22, and it’s expected to include incentives for green hydrogen transport. In November 2020, the UK government wrote in its “Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution”:Working alongside partners in industry, our aim is for the UK to develop 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 that could see the UK benefit from around 8,000 jobs across our industrial heartlands and beyond. This will be supported by a range of measures, including a £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Fund, and setting out next year, our hydrogen business models and a revenue mechanism for them to bring through private sector investment.Read more about Ways2H: ",solar
2021/06/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Major businesses from the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative in partnership with Zero Emission Transportation Association (ZETA) members sent a letter today to US President Joe Biden. The letter backs robust vehicle standards to achieve 100% sales of new light-duty vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions ideally by 2030. Signatories include Rivian, Lyft, Flo, IKEA, National Grid, and Siemens.Electrek is exclusively sharing the companies’ letter:Dear President Biden, Administrator Regan, Secretary Buttigieg, and Acting Administrator Cliff, We write to you today as a collection of leading groups and businesses focused on accelerating electric vehicle adoption in the United States. We applaud your Administration’s leadership in prioritizing renewable energy development and transportation electrification through actions such as the American Jobs Plan and the proposal to restore California’s vehicle emissions waiver.We strongly support the establishment of robust vehicle standards to achieve 100% sales of new light-duty vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions ideally by 2030. Strong emission standards will help drive the burgeoning US industry to make EV’s the new normal by 2030. The climate crisis is accelerating at an alarming pace, and millions of people are already suffering from its impact. Since the transportation sector is the largest source of emissions in the US it also stands as the largest opportunity to reduce our country’s overall emissions. Transportation electrification can revitalize the economy, create millions of jobs, and improve public health for communities across the nation. More than 40% of Americans — over 135 million people — live in communities with unhealthy ozone or pollution levels that often lead to premature deaths and health conditions like asthma. This burden is disproportionately borne by disadvantaged communities. Fossil-fuel powered vehicles, especially diesel, emit pollutants like particulate matter and NOx, which have been attributed as the leading cause for premature deaths in the US. And while EVs have zero tailpipe emissions that will help reduce public health impacts, they are also 67% less carbon intensive over their lifetime compared to gas-powered vehicles, creating substantial climate benefits.  The cost savings from improved public health and environment amount to $1.3 trillion through 2050.Strong vehicle standards will also send a strong market signal that the US is committed to emissions reduction and is intent on restoring global automotive leadership. These standards, when paired with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), will create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.  In 2020 alone, the clean vehicles industry in the US created more than 270,000 jobs, and, as projections indicate, the US can create 2 million jobs by 2035 with the right regulatory support from our nation’s leaders.The evidence is clear. If the US makes EVs the number one choice for new light duty vehicles by 2030, our transportation sector emissions will be cut in half by 2050. This can help prevent approximately 150,000 premature deaths and save nearly $1.3 trillion in health and environmental costs.As the country’s leading EV manufacturers, fleet operators, utilities, and transportation network companies, we represent and understand the need to urgently move towards a clean vehicle future. By focusing on renewable and clean energy sources, these technological advancements will play an essential role in helping the US achieve its sustainable energy goals.Thank you for your efforts and consideration on this critical issue. Strong vehicle standards that drive 100% sales of new light-duty vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions ideally by 2030 are key to achieving net-zero by 2050. We look forward to continued ambitious actions.Signatories:Biogen, Danfoss, DHL, Enel X, Flo, Genentech, HP Inc., IKEA, Ioneer USA Corporation, Li-Cycle, Lime, Lordstown, Lyft, Momentum Dynamics, National Grid, Novonix, PG&E, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Siemens, VmWare, WAVPaul Augustine, senior manager of sustainability at Lyft, provided an email statement for Electrek:When we announced our 100% EVs by 2030 commitment, we said that meeting our goal will require the collective action of industry, government, and nonprofit organizations to overcome the barriers currently preventing wide-scale electrification, including vehicle availability and affordability. Federal vehicle standards will drive automotive industry innovation to solve both of those problems, and in turn, help us encourage drivers on our platform to make the switch to EVs.Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) yesterday introduced legislation, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which looks to establish a tax credit for domestic solar manufacturers. The legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI).Ossoff’s announcement on his website states:The Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act would provide tax credits for American manufacturers at every stage of the solar manufacturing supply chain, from production of polysilicon to solar cells to fully assembled solar modules.Today Sen. @ossoff introduced the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act to:☀️ rapidly boost American solar manufacturing👷‍♀️  create clean energy jobs♻️ accelerate the transition to clean energy🇺🇸 support American energy independence pic.twitter.com/CT2XKmmfldPV Magazine elaborates:The incentive would be available through 2028 with a phase-down taking place the two years following.[M]odules would receive a credit of 11 cents, multiplied by the capacity of the module; cells would receive 4 cents, multiplied by the capacity of the cell; wafers would be credited at $12 per square meter; and solar grade polysilicon would receive a credit of $3 per kilogram.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said:This legislation is an important step for spurring domestic manufacturing across all key elements of the solar supply chain and we look forward to helping it advance through Congress. In support of Senator Ossoff’s proposal, we are today setting a target of 50 gigawatts of annual domestic solar production capacity by 2030, including polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules, racking and trackers and inverters.

2021/06/21,"The solar roof industry is such a new – yet burgeoning – industry that it’s not really included in local, state, or federal policy. Updating incentives, policies, and regulations could help expand the adoption of solar roofs. With the Biden administration’s strong focus on carbon reduction, the solar investment tax credit (ITC) seems to be safe through 2024. But as it’s written today, integrated solar roofing does not fully qualify. The ITC was meant to encourage greater adoption of solar and reduce the cost and access to consumers. Electrek spoke with Keally DeWitt, vice president, marketing & public policy at GAF Energy, about why updating the ITC to include new technologies will spur innovation and speed the US transition to 100% clean energy.Electrek: What incentives at the local, state, and national levels are currently in place for integrated solar roofs, and what is included in the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill for integrated solar roofs?Keally DeWitt: Residential solar incentives begin and end with the ITC. When the ITC was first enacted in 2006, it primarily aimed to spur solar energy growth in the US and drive economic gains, especially the creation of new, clean energy manufacturing and construction jobs. The ITC has unequivocally delivered on its goals. Since its passage, the solar industry has grown 10,000% and added hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs to the US economy. In addition, the ITC has enabled millions of home and business owners to cost-effectively install solar roofs, save money on their utility bills, and reduce carbon emissions.  The ITC succeeded because it effectively promoted the widespread deployment of new technology. In large part because of that success, innovations in the solar sector are leading to an entirely new generation of products. That means that in order to keep pace with developments like the rapid advancement of integrated solar roofing, the ITC needs to be modernized to target cutting-edge technologies. It must reflect the reality of how solar is installed as well as how it will be installed in the future. The policy currently doesn’t encompass critical installation considerations of integrated solar roofing, such as the inseparability of the roof and solar when installed contemporaneously with a roof or when solar is actually, wholly part of the roof, as is the case with integrated solar roofs.Clarity within the ITC that the roof can be considered part of the energy property when installed with solar is critical as we take the next step forward in the evolution of residential solar from rooftop solar to integrated solar roofs.  Electrek: What impact could updating the ITC have for the US clean energy economy? Keally DeWitt: Providing clarity around the ITC at the federal policy level is critical. We believe that it could have the same impact on solar roofs that the ITC has had on rooftop solar. Solar roofing offers the potential for the US to scale its clean energy manufacturing operations on US shores. At GAF Energy, we recently announced the buildout of a state-of-the-art solar roof R&D and manufacturing facility in San Jose, California, while Tesla produces its solar roof product in Buffalo, New York. The Biden administration and Congress have already voiced a commitment to building a resilient economy that can both confront climate change and create thousands of high-quality manufacturing jobs. In order to maximize the positive climate and economic impacts of the next generation of solar energy technology, updates to the ITC are critical and must be a legislative priority.Electrek: How are integrated solar roofs different from typical rooftop solar, and why would these be treated differently when it comes to policy and incentives?Keally DeWitt: Put simply, typical rooftop solar is mounted on top of the roof using racks; integrated solar roofs are actually part of the roof. At GAF Energy, our current solar roofing product attaches directly to the roof deck for a lower-profile look and better waterproofing. Our goal with our next-generation product – targeted for release later this year – is to create solar-energy generating materials that are even more seamlessly integrated with roofing materials. When it comes to policy and incentives for rack-mounted versus integrated solar, the policy tends to favor the status quo instead of laying the groundwork for the direction the industry is heading. As is often the case, innovation is moving ahead of policy, and if we want to encourage further innovation, we need policy to catch up. The Biden administration recently held a Leaders Summit on Climate at the White House on Earth Day, where he announced that the US aims to reduce its emissions by 50% to 52% by 2050. This is an ambitious and important goal, and we need public policy to be put in place that closes the critical gap between pledges and tangible progress. I’m talking about updating the ITC because it’s currently being deliberated in Congress as part of clean energy and infrastructure proposals, but there are dozens of state and local policies that need to be updated to better acknowledge the growing interdependence of roofing and solar, and the potential of integrated solar roofs to change the game for distributed, residentially sited solar deployment. For example, in California, state licensing requirements regarding which trades can and cannot be solar providers don’t allow for roofers to act as both solar sales people and installers.  I know that the public is ready for solar roofs and the industry is ready to take off. Solar roofs are simply the better residential solar solution: They deliver the same financial and carbon-free energy benefits, but are easier to install, more aesthetically pleasing, and more durable and reliable when it comes to waterproofing. Integrated solar roofs are a win-win for homeowners, addressing a need for a new roof, while also satisfying a desire to have a positive impact on the environment by generating clean energy.The opportunity is enormous: More than 5 million roofs are replaced every year in the US. If we can convert just a fraction of those roof replacements to solar roof installations, the country could nearly double its rooftop solar capacity in just two or three years. If Congress recognizes this important advancement in innovation, it could spark a new jobs boom and truly bring residential solar to the mass market.Keally DeWitt, vice president, marketing & public policy at GAF Energy, comes to solar with the conviction that carbon-neutral is the new black. She started in renewables as the head of marketing for the largest solar company in the Northeast before moving into marketing and public policy leadership roles at Sunrun and SunPower. As the national organizing director of The Alliance for Solar Choice, Fortune described the netroots work she pioneered as “radically changing” political advocacy through digital technology.

2021/06/21,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):On June 16, two astronauts on the International Space Station attempted to install Roll-Out Solar Arrays (iROSA) on a spacewalk, but their attempt hit some snags, namely, a spacesuit problem for one of the astronauts, and they weren’t able to complete the job.On their second scheduled space walk, which was yesterday, June 20, second time was a charm. Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency and Shane Kimbrough of NASA positioned, attached, and unfurled six iROSA. The rollout of the iRosa took 10 minutes.You can see the astronauts installing the solar arrays yesterday in the video below. It’s pretty compelling viewing:It’s the first time since 2009 that a new array was unfurled on the ISS.Each iROSA will produce 20kW of additional power for the ISS, or a total of 120kW. According to NASA, once all six solar arrays are installed on top of the old solar arrays, the ISS’s solar power is expected to be boosted to around 215 kW, because portions of the old solar arrays will still produce around 95kW.The two astronauts are due to install a second solar panel array on Friday.The IKEA Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation today announced that they will jointly set up a $1 billion global platform to fight climate change and energy poverty.Their aim is to reduce 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and to empower 1 billion people with distributed clean energy that’s generated from sources such as mini-grid and off-grid solutions located near the point of use, rather than power plants. The new global platform, which launches this year, will oversee the organizations’ $500 million of risk capital each. It aims to deliver clean, reliable power to 800 million people worldwide who lack electricity, and a further 2.8 billion who have unreliable access. It will be run as a public charity.“Their goal by the end of this year is to have $10 billion of funds from development agencies to go alongside their initial $1 billion, and then to invite commercial investors to back individual projects,” the Financial Times explains.The Rockefeller Foundation will incubate the platform in RF Catalytic Capital Inc., which the foundation launched in 2020. This offers a way for impact investors and governments to combine their resources and expand their global philanthropic reach.Per Heggenes, CEO of the IKEA Foundation, said:We need to be honest and recognize that the current approach is not delivering the impact the world needs in the time that we have.Photo: NASA",solar

Irvine, California-headquartered Enevate, which develops and licenses advanced battery technology for electric vehicles, announced it has achieved up to 27% reduction of emissions during manufacturing with its XFC-Energy technology.Enevate announced its fourth-generation XFC-Energy technology last year. It says it provides a path to produce extreme fast-charge EV batteries at low cost and high-volume production. The company is currently working with multiple automotive OEMs and EV battery manufacturers to commercialize its technology for 2024-25 model year EVs.Enevate utilizes a higher energy density material and an ultra-thin multi-layer design in its large format EV cells that meet EV specifications. This has the potential to lower an EV’s carbon footprint at the start of life, which is significant because battery manufacturing is the highest contributor of emissions for the EV manufacturing.For example, a 21% greenhouse gas emissions reduction over conventional batteries manufactured in a 100 gigawatt-hour per year lithium-ion EV battery factory would be the equivalent of eliminating driving emissions annually from approximately 511,000 gasoline-powered cars or not burning about 265 million gallons of gasoline each year. Philippe Schulz, VP advanced powertrain engineering – Groupe Renault, said:The CO2 emission reduction Enevate’s battery technology offers is a very desirable contribution to Renault’s aim to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050. Furthermore, it provides another critical milestone to bring this battery technology to sustainable EV production by 2025.Photo: NASA",solar
2021/06/17,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):US special interest groups are working to stall the growth of rooftop solar, according to “Blocking Rooftop Solar,” a new report released today by Environment America Research & Policy Center and US PIRG Education Fund.The report examines case studies from all over the US of strategies promoted by pro-fossil-fuel lobbying groups that are then adopted by many utilities. This includes new fixed charges on rooftop solar, or putting restrictions on or killing net metering programs that ensure solar panel owners receive fair compensation for the clean energy they supply to the electric grid.To ultimately achieve these changes, special interests create astroturf front groups in an attempt to influence decision makers to support anti-solar legislation or regulations. (For example, the generically named Consumer Energy Alliance was founded by Michael Whatley, chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and a leading supporter of the now-terminated Keystone XL Pipeline.)The report’s executive summary explains why utilities adopt these regulations:Utilities increasingly fear that the falling prices and rising availability of clean solar power will threaten their business model, which ties profits to the amount of capital investment they make in the grid, and sometimes to the amount of electricity sold. Consequently, in states across the country, utilities are using their money and clout to push policymakers to undercut solar power and make it harder for homeowners and small business owners to produce their own clean energy.And here’s what the report says needs to be done to stop these actions:State decision makers, including governors, legislators, utility oversight boards and others, should resist efforts by utilities and other special interests to limit the spread of rooftop solar.States should also promote and defend policies that support the growth of rooftop solar and speed the national transition toward 100% renewable energy.The report details more specific steps that decision makers need to take to support homeowners who invest in rooftop solar. You can read the report here.The 2021 Department of Energy (DOE) Collegiate Wind Competition – conducted remotely this year – has ended. Penn State University, who has competed eight times (and won five times) since the inaugural competition in 2014, was the overall winner this year out of 11 universities.In the DOE’s words, the annual competition consists of three categories:Challenges multidisciplinary teams of undergraduate students to design, build, and test a model wind turbine against a set of rigorous performance criteria; develop a wind project plan based on market and siting considerations; and interact with wind industry experts and raise awareness of wind energy in their local communities. The team with the highest combined score in all three categories takes the overall top place at the competition. Penn State’s team, a student club with three sub-teams, scored highly in all categories.Dr. Mark Miller, assistant professor at Penn State and principal investigator for the team, explained to Electrek what they achieved:Penn State’s technical turbine subteam developed a new, optimized two-bladed wind turbine design that promised higher performance over the range of competition wind speeds. The project development sub-team, advised by Dr. Susan Stewart, took first place overall in the first category, impressing the judges with a comprehensive plan for a wind park development in western South Dakota. The connections creation subteam conducted extensive interviews with industry professionals and used social media platforms to connect with a broader audience about renewable energy.Dr. Robert C. Marlay, director of DOE’s Wind Energy Technologies Office and the competition’s lead, said of all the teams that participated:Their dedication and perseverance gives me confidence that the energy workforce of the future will be in good hands, and that we can expect a clean, affordable, and equitable energy future for all.Photo: “Bayview Home” by mjmonty is licensed under CC BY 2.0",solar
2021/06/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Detroit-based GM and Pittsburgh-headquartered Wabtec yesterday signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding.

Wabtec developed its FLXdrive prototype (pictured above), and claims it’s the world’s first fully electric freight locomotive. The 430,000-pound FLXdrive uses 18,000 lithium-ion battery cells.The FLXdrive was developed with a $22.6 million grant from the California Air Resource Board that was awarded to Wabtec, BNSF Railway, and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. According to Wabtec on May 17:[The company’s] next step is to build a second-generation locomotive with a battery capacity of more than 6 megawatt hours – a level of energy that can reduce a locomotive consist’s fuel consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30%, even while hauling several thousand tons of freight in a mile-long train. A fleet of second-generation FLXdrives will be commercialized and could enter supply chain routes in the next few years.GM’s battery and fuel cell technologies will help Wabtec move to the next stage of developing even more effective electric freight locomotives.Read more: Long Island Rail Road tests US’s first battery-powered trainsIn 2020, US consumption of clean energy grew for the fifth year in a row, reaching a record high of 11.6 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu), or 12% of total US energy consumption, reports the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Clean energy was the only source of US energy consumption that increased year-over-year. The consumption of fossil-fuel and nuclear energy declined. Here’s what the EIA had to say about wind and solar:Wind energy, or electricity generated by wind-powered turbines, is almost exclusively consumed in the electric power sector. Wind energy accounted for about 26% of US renewable energy consumption in 2020. Wind surpassed hydroelectricity in 2019 to become the single most-consumed source of renewable energy on an annual basis. In 2020, US wind energy consumption grew 14% from 2019.Solar energy accounted for about 11% of US renewable energy consumption in 2020. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, including rooftop panels, and solar thermal power plants use sunlight to generate electricity. Some residential and commercial buildings use solar heating systems to heat water and the building. Overall, 2020 US solar consumption increased 22% from 2019.Hydroelectric power accounted for about 22% of consumption in 2020, and US biofuel consumption fell 11% from 2019.Photo: Wabtec",solar
2021/06/16,"Roughly 10 billion tons of freight move through supply chains in the US each year, almost all of which pass through distribution yards – the area of the supply chain between the warehouse and the open road. Andrew Smith, Outrider founder and CEO, has dedicated his career to the commercialization of environmental technologies. He spoke with Electrek about how the automation of electric yard trucks is not only dramatically increasing the sustainability of this often-overlooked area of the supply chain, but also the agility and reliability of its movement of goods.  Electrek: What is a distribution yard, how many are there in the US, and why do we need to focus on them in order to reduce emissions?Andrew Smith: While we are familiar with warehouse automation, we’re less familiar with what occurs outside the warehouse doors. Distribution yards, one of the most underinvested parts of the supply chain for decades, are finally receiving the attention they deserve – in large part highlighted by the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Yards play an important role in ensuring goods move smoothly between the warehouse and over-the-road (OTR) trucks.For a sense of scale, roughly 10 billion tons of freight moves through the US each year, and just about all of that passes through logistics hubs. Distribution yards are chaotic environments rife with repetitive, manual tasks that are often performed in hazardous working conditions. Roughly 50,000 diesel yard trucks shuttle trailers back and forth between loading docks and parking spots within distribution yards on a daily basis. Every year in North America, these yard trucks emit 3.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of one coal-fired power plant. Plus, OTR trucks, or semi-trucks, keep their engines running while they wait up to four hours at distribution centers to drop and pick up their next load. Combined, yard trucks and semi-trucks in distribution yards emit more carbon dioxide than two coal-fired power plants annually. As enterprises implement automation in distribution yards, it’s imperative to consider how it can be done more sustainably, safely, and efficiently. This led to Outrider’s decision to standardize its autonomous system on electric yard trucks, which in time, will replace diesel yard trucks. Electrek: Who are the players that benefit from distribution yard automation, and what steps do they need to take, individually and in collaboration, to get emissions to net zero?Andrew Smith: Logistics-heavy enterprises, like those in retail, consumer packaged goods, and package delivery, benefit from yard automation by decreasing truck turn time, lowering the risk of equipment damage and injuries, and reducing their carbon footprint. Large enterprises can take several steps toward a net zero-emission future, first by standardizing their yard truck fleets on electric vehicles. Second, these companies can leverage automation to get OTR trucks in and out of the distribution yard more efficiently. If automation makes yards even slightly more efficient, say by as little as five to 10 minutes, OTR turn time increases, putting more than 1 million days and roughly 247 million gallons of diesel fuel to better use moving freight. Lastly, [you have] design distribution centers and yards that are ready to deploy electric, autonomous yard operations.Electrek: What sort of technology and electric vehicles are currently available that could be implemented to accelerate sustainability in distribution yards? And what does your company, Outrider, do?Andrew Smith: Within the supply chain, yard automation presents a significant opportunity to increase efficiency, improve safety, and drive sustainability by way of reducing emissions. Outrider’s goal is to work with customers and suppliers to rapidly retire diesel-burning yard trucks and standardize on zero-emission, autonomous yard truck fleets. Autonomous and electric go hand-in-hand. Autonomous yard trucks have advanced electronics that require clean, reliable power that a fully electric drive provides — and these trucks can effortlessly be dispatched to recharge during low utilization periods. Furthermore, enterprises with electric yard truck fleets will eliminate the need for on-site refueling infrastructure.Founded in 2017, Outrider is the pioneer in autonomous yard operations for logistics hubs, helping large enterprises improve safety and increase efficiency. The Outrider System consists of three integrated parts — management software, autonomous vehicles, and site infrastructure — to move trailers between loading docks and parking spots. Using proprietary autonomy technology, the Outrider System hitches and un-hitches trailers, robotically connects and disconnects trailer brake lines, interacts with loading docks, tracks trailer locations, and centrally manages and monitors all system functions.  Electrek: What technology still needs to be developed that distribution yards will need to accelerate sustainability?Andrew Smith: Outrider’s goal is to make yard operations more efficient, safe, and sustainable by fully automating the repetitive, manual tasks. Long-term, there is immense opportunity to apply our autonomous technology – all built on electric platforms – to logistics hubs, warehouses, intermodal terminals, and factories. The more applications for electric, autonomous systems throughout the supply chain, the faster we can make logistics more sustainable.Near term, there are three areas related to autonomy that will help accelerate sustainability: technology, infrastructure, and cost. On the technology front, sensor advancement will help autonomous systems perform better in extreme weather conditions, allowing them to be deployed in even more geographic regions. Related to infrastructure, enterprises and logistics real estate firms need to make sure the distribution center has adequate charging and communications infrastructure to support electric, autonomous yard operations. On a final note, the cost of EVs will continue to come down, particularly the batteries, as competition and innovation in the market continue to accelerate.Andrew Smith is the founder and CEO of Outrider, a pioneer in autonomous yard operations for logistics hubs. He is committed to the rapid commercialization of sustainable freight transportation by deploying zero-emission systems. Under his leadership, Outrider has grown from a concept to a yard automation solution for some of the biggest companies in the world. Prior to Outrider, Andrew was founder and CEO of ATDynamics Inc., an Inc. Magazine Top 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America nominee. At ATDynamics, Andrew redefined the shape of the modern semi-trailer with TrailerTails®, rear-drag aerodynamic devices capable of reducing trucking industry fuel consumption by over $2 billion annually. Andrew holds a physics degree from Middlebury College and an MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.Photo: Outrider",solar
2021/06/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The US solar industry installed 5 GW of new capacity in the first quarter (Q1) of 2021. It’s a new Q1 record, and a 46% increase over Q1 2020, according to the “US Solar Market Insight Q2 2021″ report, released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. That 5 GW made up 58% of all new Q1 electric capacity additions in the US. In fact, clean energy accounted for nearly 100% of all new electric capacity in Q1.The utility-scale sector accounts for a majority of these installations, with a Q1 record of 3.6 GW. Residential solar sales added 905 megawatts in Q1 2021, an 11% increase over the same period last year.Texas (pictured above) led all states with 1.52 GW of new solar capacity in Q1, more than it added in all of 2019 and three times more than any other state. It was followed by California (563 MW) and Florida (525 MW).The US solar market surpassed 100 gigawatts of installed electric generating capacity overall, doubling the size of the industry over the last 3.5 years.But there’s a wrench in the works – rising costs in the solar industry. Key inputs for solar modules and installations, including polysilicon, steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips, copper, and other metals, are facing supply constraints. Compounding cost increases across all materials started at the end of Q1 and are beginning to affect installers now.Michelle Davis, principal analyst and lead author of the report, said:Demand for solar power continues to grow, but attention is now turning to supply chain constraints, which have heightened since the latter half of 2020.There is a lag between commodity prices and subsequent solar system prices. But there’s no doubt this is impacting the solar industry. Installers are managing current equipment shortages and having to decide whether to renegotiate contracts.Evergy, Kansas’s largest electric utility, will invest in 700 megawatts of solar energy over the next three years and says it will reduce carbon emissions 70% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels, and reach net zero by 2045.Evergy has almost no solar power at present, but solar farms would provide 13% of its power within 10 years, with the first solar farm going online in 2023.The company has 1 million customers in Kansas (total population 2.9 million) and 600,000 in Missouri (total population 6.1 million). On May 28, the company announced the following:Evergy filed its first Integrated Resource Plan with the Kansas Corporation Commission. The plan prioritizes sustainability, reliability, and cost competitiveness with retirement of 1,200 megawatts of coal-based fossil generation and the addition of 3,200 MW of renewable generation in the next 10 years. The Associated Press writes:Evergy would shut down nearly three-quarters of its coal-fired generating capacity by 2039, starting with a plant in Lawrence by 2023. Its capacity to generate power from wind farms would increase by 23% by 2026.However, the company is taking a phased approach. Only 20% of its coal would go offline by 2030, because it wants to back up solar and wind with coal. It also plans to increase natural gas–fired plants after 2030 to back up solar and wind farms. Adding more fossil fuel energy into the mix is counterproductive.So there’s a push and pull between green energy advocates and fossil-fuel supporters. Kansas Republicans worry about cost and blackouts without fossil-fuel backups, and green energy supporters say switching to clean energy without coal and gas backup is not only good for the environment, but also more cost effective.Texas legislators blamed clean energy during its winter blackouts, but the biggest failure was confirmed to be natural gas, not wind turbines.Lisa Frantzis, senior managing director for Advanced Energy Economy, said:Most utilities see the handwriting on the wall. The customers — their ratepayers — are requiring it and we’re even seeing even more and more pressure from financial institutions.Sarah Akers, a utility analyst in St. Louis for Wells Fargo Securities, confirmed:What’s changed in the last five years is that the economics actually make sense.",solar
2021/06/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):North Carolina governor Roy Cooper (D) last week issued an executive order, “Advancing North Carolina’s Economic and Clean Energy Future with Offshore Wind,” that formally sets the state’s first-ever targets for offshore wind procurement:The state of North Carolina will strive for development of 2.8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy off the North Carolina coast by 2030 and 8.0 GW by 2040.Achieving those goals would create the ability to power around 2.3 million homes by 2040 with clean energy. The order lays out next steps, such as naming a clean energy economic development coordinator, and forming a taskforce and an interagency workgroup. It remains in effect until December 31, 2024.North Carolina commerce secretary Machelle Baker Sanders said:This coordinated approach to developing our offshore wind supply chain will bring new jobs to North Carolina for generations to come.The executive order follows a bipartisan memorandum of understanding among the governors of North Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia in October 2020 that created the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic Regional Transformative Partnership for Offshore Wind Energy Resources (SMART-POWER).The New Zealand government yesterday announced that it would provide new rebates for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles starting July 1, with up to $8,625 for new vehicles and $3,450 for used. It also announced that EV chargers are now available every 47 miles (75 km) along most state highways “to give Kiwis confidence.”Last week, The Climate Commission, an independent body set up to advise New Zealand’s government on what the country must do to achieve net zero by 2050. The Guardian summarizes the commission‘s transport findings:The commission’s recommended plan included banning imports of petrol and diesel cars by 2032, and that road transport be almost completely decarbonized by 2050. To meet its goal for transport emissions, the commission concluded electric vehicles would need to make up half of all light vehicle registrations by 2029, and 100% by 2035.Transport Minister Michael Wood said in a statement:New Zealand is actually lagging behind on the uptake of EVs, so we are playing catch up internationally. We’ve already committed to policies that will make a difference, like the Clean Car Import Standard, decarbonising the public transport bus fleet and revitalising rail, but we have to do more.The Clean Car Discount will make it cheaper for New Zealanders to buy electric and low emission cars. It will prevent up to 9.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and will help with the upfront cost of switching over with Kiwis getting up to $8,625 back.Photo: Orsted",solar
2021/06/14,"A Dutch court ruled that Shell’s emissions targets aren’t “concrete.” This is what the oil giant must do in order to achieve a viable plan to reduce emissions and meet clean energy targets.On May 26, a court in the Netherlands ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Previous to the ruling, Shell’s emissions reduction target was 20% by 2030, Electrek reported.The Hague District Court, where Anglo-Dutch Shell is headquartered, said in its summary that Shell’s emissions-reduction policy “…is not concrete, has many caveats, and is based on monitoring social developments rather than the company’s own responsibility for achieving a CO2 reduction.” But last week, on June 10, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden published a LinkedIn article in which he stated that the company disagrees with the court’s ruling, and said that Shell “expect[s] to appeal.” He also wrote:This ruling does not mean a change but rather an acceleration of our strategy. We have a clear target to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050, in step with society’s progress towards achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement. We have set rigorous, short-term reduction targets along the way to make sure we achieve net zero.But now we will seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable. That is likely to mean taking some bold but measured steps over the coming years.So Electrek asked Jimmy Leppert, managing director at change management and strategy execution firm Kotter and a former consultant for a global oil company, what he thinks Shell must do to meet its emissions targets. This is what Leppert said:To move at this speed and scale, senior leadership must activate talent and partnerships to drive the right metrics at the right time. What many large multinational companies don’t understand is that they have a competitive advantage over more entrepreneurial startups – they already have capital, infrastructure, existing (and formidable) relationships, technology, global weight, and impressive talent. Shell now needs to leverage these assets by tapping into usual and unusual suspects. This includes almost every one of their traditional antagonists, such as environmental groups, who now want to partner with them. Leaders at Shell could very well set a global course on what is possible for the energy industry. Big emission reduction goals will be met when senior executives recognize that acceleration is change, and change is essential to remaining agile. In doing so, they will drive better results on a significantly higher scale in less time.Photo: Shell",solar
2021/06/11,"The Rome-headquartered Enel Group’s Brazilian renewable energy subsidiary, Enel Green Power Brasil Participações Ltda, has started commercial operations of the 716 MW Lagoa dos Ventos I and II wind farm in Brazil. It’s South America’s largest wind farm currently in operation and Enel Green Power’s largest wind farm worldwide. The $750 million wind farm is in the municipalities of Lagoa do Barro do Piauí, Queimada Nova, and Dom Inocêncio, in Brazil’s northeastern state of Piauí. It consists of 230 wind turbines and will be able to generate over 3.3 TWh per year. It will avoid annual carbon dioxide emissions of more than 1.6 million tons.206 MW of the wind farm’s installed capacity will be delivered to the free market for sale to retail customers.  510 MW were awarded to Enel Green Power in Brazil’s A-6 public tender in December 2017. (It’s called “A-6” because projects have six years to come online.) Enel Green Power’s share is supported by 20-year power supply contracts with a pool of distribution companies operating in Brazil’s regulated market.In December 2020, Enel broke ground on the 396 MW Lagoa dos Ventos III wind farm. The new $435 million wind farm will bring the total capacity of Lagoa dos Ventos to around 1.1 GW. I, II, and III will have a total of 302 wind turbines and will be capable of generating around 5 TWh annually. It will boost the elimination of carbon dioxide emissions to over 2.8 million tons annually.Salvatore Bernabei, CEO of Enel Green Power and head of Enel’s Global Power Generation business line, said:As our largest wind facility in the world, Lagoa dos Ventos represents a significant step forward for our sustainable growth, while also supporting the green recovery in Brazil, further contributing to the diversification of the country’s energy mix.Brazil gets a lot of deserved bad press about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. The country also has a pretty good track record of using renewable energy. According to the International Energy Agency, “Access to electricity across the country is almost universal and renewables meet almost 45% of primary energy demand, making Brazil’s energy sector one of the least carbon-intensive in the world.”Large hydropower plants provide around 80% of Brazil’s domestic electricity. Wind and bioenergy are growing. But unfortunately, so is the use of natural gas. Brazil has found enthusiasm for fossil fuels with the offshore discovery of both oil and natural gas. “According to IEA forecasts, net oil exports will pass the 1 million barrels/day mark by 2022.”Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is rightfully being pressured by the rest of the world to reduce emissions and stop deforestation of the Amazon because the problem is serious and urgent. Deforestation soared 67% in May from the same month in 2020, according to Brazil’s national space research institute Inpe. Bolsonaro has failed to protect the Amazon from illegal logging, and he slashed environmental funding in April, just a day after he said he’d double it.According to Reuters, US climate envoy John Kerry told a congressional hearing last month:Unfortunately the Bolsonaro regime has rolled back some of the environmental enforcement. We’ve had this conversation. They say they are committed now to raise the budget. If we don’t talk to them, you’re guaranteed that that forest is going to disappear.",solar

That includes orders from American Airlines (between 250 and 350), Virgin Atlantic (between 50 and 150), and aircraft leasing group Avolon (310).The Financial Times reports: Vertical plans to go public this year on the New York Stock Exchange via a merger with special purpose acquisition (SPAC) vehicle Broadstone Acquisition, in a deal valuing it at $2.2 billion. SPAC investors include American Airlines, Avolon, Honeywell, Rolls-Royce, and Microsoft’s venture capital fund M12.Vertical Aerospace details the VA-X4’s specs:Capable of carrying up to five people (four passengers and a pilot), the VA-X4 is set to be the world’s first certified winged all-electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and is on course to start commercial flights in 2024.VA-X4 will boast cruise speeds of 202 mph with a useable range of up to 120 miles.Additional features will include reduce noise pollution – 100x quieter than a helicopter thanks to the VA-X4’s distributed propulsion system, a 15-meter wingspan, 13 meters in length, ensuring it can take off and land from existing helipads, a fly-by-wire flight control systems to make aircraft simple to fly, while its simple design optimizes safety, efficient aerodynamics, enabling it to fly with far less energy and power than a helicopter, a payload capacity of 450kg, EASA-certified design and is powered by Lithium-ion batteries.Ovo Energy entrepreneur and now Vertical Aerospace CEO Stephen Fitzpatrick cofounded the eVTOL company five years ago. Fitzpatrick said in a statement:Electrification will transform flying in the 21st century in the same way the jet engine did 70 years ago.The majority of US adults currently support the expansion of solar farms (84%) and wind farms (77%), according to a new survey by Pew Research Center. (The survey was conducted April 20-29, 2021.)Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, support for solar currently stands at 73%, while support for wind stands at 62%. In contrast, 93% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents support expanding solar, and 91% support wind power.It’s apparent that the clean energy sector hasn’t yet built up confidence among the US public when it comes to perceptions of reliability and cost implications. This is something the sector will have to work at to improve. 18% of US adults think wind farms are more reliable than other energy sources, 35% view the reliability of wind power as about the same as other energy sources, and 44% think wind power is less reliable. And when you break it down by political party, the differences are pretty pronounced. Republicans are more than twice as likely as Democrats (65% vs. 30%) to say wind power is less reliable than other energy sources. It’s unsurprising, seeing how so many Republican legislators weaponize clean energy in an attempt to shore up dying fossil fuels.As for the perception of what clean energy costs for consumers, 35% of American adults say the cost of wind power is lower than other energy sources, 34% say it’s about the same, and 26% say it’s higher. The perceived costs of solar power are about the same as wind.And again, cost perceptions diverge depending on political beliefs. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to say the cost of wind is higher than other energy sources (39% vs. 16%), and for solar, it’s 43% for Republicans and 22% for Democrats. And yet… Texas, a red state, leads in clean energy in the US. Go figure. Its Republican politicians say one thing, but the state is doing another.In October 2020, the International Energy Agency said that solar was now the “cheapest electricity in history.”Photo: Vertical Aerospace",solar
2021/06/10,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Chicago-headquartered NanoGraf Technologies today announced a major battery breakthrough. It claims it has enabled the highest energy density cylindrical 18650 Li-ion cell in the world. The company says that the 800 watt-hour per liter (Wh/L) silicon-anode based cell provides a 28% longer run time than traditional cell chemistries. It’s working with a top-tier battery company to manufacture its batteries.In 2019, the US Council for Automotive Research, a consortium of Ford, General Motors and the US FCA, which makes Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and FIAT vehicles, provided NanoGraf with $7.5 million for a 36-month electric vehicle battery research and development project. And in July 2020, NanoGraf was awarded $1.65 million from the US Department of Defense to develop a longer-lasting lithium-ion battery.The 18650 is the most popular format of battery cell for e-bike batteries. Tesla currently uses 18650 cells in the Model S and X, but the company is not expected to use them in the new Model S and Model X.NanoGraf president Dr. Kurt Breitenkamp said:Energy density has plateaued, only increasing 8% or so over the last decade. We just achieved a 10% increase in a little under a year. This is over a decade’s worth of innovation in one technology.A US transition to at least 50-70% clean energy by 2030 could create between 500,000 and 600,000 new jobs for US workers in the solar, wind, and battery storage sectors, according to the new report “2021 Clean Energy Labor Supply.” The report was released by the American Clean Power Association (ACP), which describes itself as “the voice of companies from across the clean power sector.”The manufacturing, construction, and professional service sectors will see the most growth in all 50 states. Roles in demand include wind turbine technicians, solar photovoltaic installers, semiconductor processing technicians, metal fabricators, and electricians, according to the ACP. Supply gaps are anticipated as demand increases.More than 415,000 Americans currently make up the wind, solar, and energy storage workforce. The sector’s fastest-growing role is wind technician, with a salary of $59,340 per annum in 2020. That’s 5% higher than the national average wage.Unsurprisingly, the researchers found that higher-than-average pay and significant union coverage are key aspects of clean energy employment growth. Union coverage rates for solar, wind, and battery storage are above 10% for each sector. The national private-sector union coverage rate is 7.7%.",solar
2021/06/09,"First Solar, the largest US-owned solar panel manufacturer, today announced that it’s opening a third manufacturing plant in Ohio in the first half of 2023. The $680 million factory in Lake Township, near Toledo, is expected to initially produce enough solar panels to produce 3.3 gigawatts direct current of power annually. That represents “an implied capital expenditure of approximately $0.20 per watt,” according to First Solar.Once the new facility is fully operational, the three factories together will manufacture panels that could generate a total of 6 gigawatts of direct current. First Solar states that it believes that will make it “the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complex outside of China.”First Solar expects to produce an average of one module around every 2.75 seconds across its three factories.The company currently employs 1,600 people at its existing two Ohio factories and plans to hire 500 people for the new factory.Crystalline-silicon technology, which mostly comes from China, is not used in First Solar’s thin-film photovoltaic panels.Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar, said in a statement:We have said that we stand ready to support President Biden’s goal to transition America to a clean, energy-secure future, and our decision to more than double our US manufacturing capacity with this new facility is First Solar making good on that commitment.This facility will represent a significant leap forward in photovoltaics manufacturing, a true factory of the future. It will leverage our advantaged position at the intersection of efficiency, energy yield, optimized form factor, and cost competitiveness, while leading our manufacturing fleet in delivering the highest efficiency and wattage, and the lowest cost per watt.The Biden administration has called for 100% clean electricity by 2035. US Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said of First Solar:As a partner to our solar program since 2003 and a DOE loan guarantee recipient in 2012, this company is a great example of how investment and innovation can build the clean energy future right here at home — shoring up American competitiveness and bringing good-paying jobs to all pockets of the country.But even with the three Ohio factories, First Solar would still import 40% of its panels from its factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, according to the Wall Street Journal, which continues:Mr. Widmar said the company wants to continue to expand US production, which helps it save on freight costs and strengthen the company’s standing as an alternative to Chinese imports.The company is banking on continued US support through tax breaks and possibly renewing tariffs on imported Chinese panels, as well as growing domestic demand.Photo: First Solar",solar
2021/06/08,"The Yara Birkeland, the world’s first net-zero, battery-powered autonomous container ship, was delivered to Norwegian fertilizer company Yara Norge AS in November 2020. It’s currently in the Norwegian port of Horten, where it’s undergoing further preparations for autonomous operation and a late 2021 launch. The open-top Yara Birkeland was ordered by Yara in 2017, designed by Marin Teknikk, and fitted at Vard Brattvåg in Norway. Norway’s Kongsberg Maritime developed its technology. Leclanché SA of Switzerland supplied the batteries. The hull was built at the Vard Braila Shipyard in Romania. The ship’s development was paused in May 2020, citing autonomous logistics on land as a challenge. It completed its maiden voyage in December 2020, sailing nearly seven hours from Brevik to Horten, according to MarineTraffic’s website.Kongsberg Maritime released a video about the Yara Birkeland in 2017, which gives a great overview. Kongsberg was a little ambitious at the time, as it stated in its YouTube summary that operation was planned to start in the latter half of 2018, but they’ll likely succeed this year.On May 31, 2021, Hellenic Shipping News reported:Yara advised that, at this moment, their priority is for the Yara Birkeland to begin operating with zero-emission transport of containers. The new port construction inside the factory at Herøya is completed with only the delivery and commissioning of the port crane remaining. Once this is completed in the autumn, the plan is for the Yara Birkeland to start operations and to transport approximately 40-60% of Yara’s container volume by the end of this year. Work is also ongoing to prepare the Yara Birkeland for the first phase of sailing with reduced manning. Once that has been achieved, the ship will be developed to reach the desired level of unmanned operation during the next two years.Yara provides the Birkeland’s specifications (and I’ve provided some explanations in italics for landlubbers):Kongsberg Maritime explains:Loading and discharging will be done automatically using electric cranes and equipment. The ship will not have ballast tanks, but will use the battery pack as permanent ballast.The ship will also be equipped with an automatic mooring system – berthing and unberthing will be done without human intervention, and will not require special implementations dock-side.To ensure safety, three centers with different operational profile are planned to handle all aspects of operation. This is an exciting, groundbreaking project. Of course, the autonomy aspect is intriguing, but we are particularly excited about the emissions-free, fully electric aspect of this cargo ship.The Yara Birkeland will reduce diesel-powered truck transport by around 40,000 journeys per year. And as Electrek reported in October 2020, shipping emits over 1 billion tonnes a year of CO2 and is growing — more than all but the top five country emitters. 90% of the world’s goods are moved by sea. Shipping generates between 2% and 3% of emissions.The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) greenhouse gas strategy is to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 and “a pathway of CO2 emissions reduction consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals.” This strategy absolutely must be strengthened considerably as the IMO works toward adopting a revised strategy in 2023. If the Yara Birkeland sails successfully, building a lot more like her will help the shipping industry achieve a more ambitious emissions reduction goal.Thanks to Kelvin Sundli!",solar

Duke will own and operate the project, and Moss is undertaking engineering and construction. The Texas solar farm will employ between 200 to 300 workers during construction. It will provide significant tax revenues for the Corsicana Independent School District.Wilmington, Massachusetts-headquartered US pharmaceutical company Charles River Laboratories has signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) for 102 MW of the project over 15 years. Two other unnamed corporations have signed separate 15-year VPPA agreements for the remaining 148MW of solar.Pisgah Ridge is expected to be online by the end of 2022.Researchers at Boulder-based clean energy nonprofit RMI analyzed 101 million miles traveled by Uber and Lyft drivers in Los Angeles. They found that charging stations were lacking in the low-income neighborhoods that ride-hailing electric car drivers serve. RMI published its findings in a new report, “EV Charging for All” (found on its website, linked above).The research team found that most public fast-charging stations are in or near high-income areas, where early adopters of electric cars tend to live, but that’s not necessarily where Uber and Lyft drivers do business. The uneven distribution of charging stations pulls electric Uber and Lyft drivers out of low-income communities. As a result, polluting gas cars are more prevalent in low-income areas. So building out a DC fast-charging network can provide cost-effective charging to all Los Angeles residents, and this model can be replicated in cities all over the US.The report comes just weeks after California approved its new Clean Miles Standard, which requires ride-hailing fleets to electrify 90% of miles served by 2030.EJ Klock-McCook, an RMI principal and one of the authors of the report, said:Ride-hailing services provide a unique opportunity to help build a fast-charging network that is not only financially sustainable, but also provides inclusive access to charging in currently underserved areas.It might seem painfully obvious, but it’s not reflected in the current reality: The US can only transition to electric transport if everyone has access to charging and affordable electric cars.

2021/06/07,"An uncrewed SpaceX Dragon CRS-22 cargo ship launched on a Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on June 3 and arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) two days later. It was carrying, among many other things, two new solar arrays that will power the ISS.Jacksonville-headquartered Redwire Space is an aerospace manufacturer and space infrastructure technology company. Redwire is under contract with Boeing, NASA’s prime contractor for space station operations, to provide six International Space Station Roll-Out Solar Arrays (iROSA).The Dragon delivered two out of six iROSA on this trip. They were rolled up and stored in a compact cylinder (pictured above). The other four solar arrays will arrive at the International Space Station by 2023. Redwire is responsible for the design, analysis, manufacture, test, and delivery of iROSA. Each iROSA uses upgraded solar cells from Boeing’s Spectrolab and provides 28 kilowatts of power. The six arrays will together produce more than 120 kilowatts that will boost the station’s power generation by 20-30%. ROSA technology was successfully demonstrated on the ISS in June 2017. Here’s a good look at Redwire’s ISS solar array technology in this video:Redwire explains how it works:ROSA’s patented design uses composite booms to serve as both the primary structural elements and the deployment actuator together with a modular photovoltaic blanket assembly that can be configured into various solar array architectures. Instead of using complex mechanisms and motors for deployment, ROSA uses stored energy from carbon fiber booms that are cut and rolled back against their natural shape for storage. At a designated point during the mission, the stored strain energy of the booms enforces the unrolling deployment actuation. When fully deployed, the now rigid booms provide the solar arrays’ structural stiffness and strength.NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough said [via Space.com]:Looking forward to all the science and other goodies that it brought up along with our EVA solar arrays. It’s going to be a great few weeks as we get into Dragon and get things out.Astronauts will install the two iROSA on spacewalks on June 16 and 20.",solar
2021/06/07,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Switzerland-headquartered Hitachi ABB Power Grids has launched a portfolio of transformer products for offshore floating wind farms. The portfolio, which Hitachi developed in partnership with floating offshore wind developers, includes collector step-up transformers, which step up turbine generator output voltage from a few hundred volts to the collector system’s medium voltage distribution levels; earthing transformers; shunt reactors – absorbers of reactive power – for floating substations; and wind turbine transformers for floating wind turbines.Hitachi ABB, which announced on Friday that it will switch to 100% fossil-free electricity by the end of this year, says its new transformer products will enable much greater volumes of wind to be efficiently harvested and integrated into energy systems.The Biden administration announced on May 25 that the US Pacific Coast will be open to commercial-scale offshore clean energy projects for the first time, and floating offshore wind technology will need to be utilized in California waters because the continental shelf falls away quickly, into deep waters. So Hitachi’s floating electrical systems are a timely arrival for that announcement, and for the fledgling floating offshore wind industry in general.Check out Hitachi ABB’s video below about their new transformers for floating wind turbines, and how offshore floating wind will unleash great clean energy potential:Turbine installation is complete at what is now Denmark’s largest wind farm. The 604 megawatt Kriegers Flak offshore wind farm is 9 to 25 miles (15 to 40 kilometers) off the east coast of Denmark in the Baltic Sea. It will provide enough energy for around 600,000 Danish households and increase Danish wind production by around 16%.Kriegers Flak consists of 72 Siemens Gamesa 8.4 MW turbines, installed by offshore development company Jan De Nul. Each turbine is 617 feet (188 meters) in height. The 72nd wind turbine was installed on June 5, and the first turbine was installed in February.The wind farm will be serviced out of Swedish energy company Vattenfall’s new service facility at the Port of Klintholm, which is south of Copenhagen.Kriegers Flak’s testing will need to be finalized, and it will then be certified, so that it can come online after summer.Catrin Jung, head of offshore wind in Vattenfall, said:Despite COVID-19, we have been able to deliver according to plan – actually a little ahead of schedule.Photo: Hitachi ABB",solar
2021/06/04,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):US president Joe Biden’s electric vehicles plan includes boosting battery recycling in the US, reports Reuters in an exclusive, which attributes its source as government officials.The Biden administration is wrapping up a 100-day review today of gaps in the supply chain, and that includes minerals in EV batteries and reducing metal usage in new batteries.Biden’s plan is to rely on mines in ally countries to supply much of the metals for electric vehicle batteries. Reuters writes:The administration’s options to spur domestic recycling include direct investment in projects and scientific research, as well as spending funds approved by Congress.Boosting domestic recycling would help the administration further that goal by breaking down older EVs into component parts for new vehicles and thus relying less on mining.The White House would like to see more recycling plants open in the United States, one of the officials said, noting the announcement last fall by China’s Ganfeng Lithium Co of plans to build a battery recycling plant in Mexico to supply the US EV market.The Biden administration also wants to give a lot of support to US research & development, particularly at the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory.An April report found that recycling end-of-life batteries could cut the projected need for new sources of copper for EV batteries via mining by 55% by 2040. For lithium, the figure is 25%, and for cobalt and nickel it’s 35%.The German government “aims to expand installed production capacity of onshore wind energy to 95 gigawatts [GW] by 2030 from a previous target of 71 GW, and of solar energy to 150 GW from 100 GW,” according to Reuters, who ran an exclusive story after seeing a climate protection draft law.In 2020, Germany’s installed capacity of onshore wind was 54.4 GW and solar was 52 GW.Germany’s offshore wind power increased last year by 3.4% to 6,679 MW, surpassing an interim government target of 6,500 MW for 2020. The country’s 2030 offshore wind target is 20,000 MW.The draft law also earmarks €1.8 billion ($2.1 billion) for electric car purchase subsidies for next year. Reuters continues:Earlier this month, the cabinet approved draft legislation for more ambitious CO2 reduction targets, including being carbon neutral by 2045 and cutting German carbon emissions by 65% by 2030 from 1990 levels, up from a previous target for a 55% cut.The draft law can’t be approved until after the German federal election in September.",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/06/03,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Update, June 3: ExxonMobil’s shareholders elected a third director nominated by activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 to the oil giant’s board, according to a statement from the company yesterday. Alexander Karsner, a strategist at Google owner Alphabet Inc, won the fund’s third seat out of its 12-member board. Engine No. 1 nominated four candidates, but the fourth was not elected.US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron yesterday suffered shareholder backlash from activists and institutional investors over their failure to set viable emissions reduction strategies. The New York Times writes that “analysts could not recall another time that Exxon management had lost a vote against company-picked directors.”Hedge fund activists Engine No. 1 successfully replaced two Exxon board members with its own candidates, and a vote on a third, Alexander Karsner, a senior strategist at X, is “not yet determined.”Engine No. 1 “holds a stake worth just $54 million in a company with $248 billion in market capitalization. Exxon’s shares rose 0.7% to $58.64 after the votes were tallied Wednesday,” reports the Financial Times.BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager and Exxon’s second largest shareholder with a 6.7% stake, backed Engine No. 1’s campaign. So did Legal & General Investment Management, which owns investment shares worth nearly $1 billion and is a top 20 Exxon shareholder.Chris James, founder of Engine No. 1, said in an interview [via the NYT]:This isn’t really about ideology, it’s about economics.And economics is what has driven the adoption of some of the alternative fuel sources versus fossil fuels. We want there to be an acceptance of change.So what can two or three board members achieve out of a total of 12? Their presence strengthens the position of investment firms pushing for climate change. Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp writes:It is about major asset managers and other influential investors stepping up, making their voices heard and walking the walk, connecting the dots between their climate rhetoric and their actions.Over at Chevron, a majority of shareholders voted 61% in favor of a proposal from Dutch campaign group Follow This to force the oil giant to cut its scope 3 emissions – the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain.Mark van Baal, cofounder of Follow This, said:Institutional investors understand that no investment is safe in a global economy wracked by devastating climate change.According to new data in the US Energy Information Administration’s “Electric Power Monthly” report, net generation of solar and wind power in the US increased by 24.3% (31,357 MWh) and 10.5% (96,658 MWh), respectively, in total electric power year-to-date, for January to March 2021 and 2020.Overall, renewable sources excluding hydroelectric were up 10.8% (136,262 MWh). That includes wind, solar, wood, other biomass, and geothermal. Hydroelectric conventional was down by 7.5% (69,646 MWh) and hydroelectric pumped storage was up 11.1% (-1,085 MWh).On the fossil fuel front, coal was up 34.8% (231,675 MWh) and natural gas was down 10.8% (342,372 MWh). This was due to higher prices for natural gas as a result of growth in liquefied natural gas exports and rising domestic natural gas consumption. Further, in March, S&P Global Platts reported:The EIA said the ‘recent extreme cold weather in much of the country contributed to an increase in coal use for power generation,” but added that the “supply for rising coal-fired generation will be partly met by draws from on-site stockpiles at power plants.’Going forward, renewables are projected to make up 21.2% of US power generation in 2021 and 22.6% in 2022, up from 19.7% in 2020. Coal is expected to make up 22.6% of power generation in 2021 and 22.8% in 2022, up from 19.9% generated in 2020. Power generation from natural gas is estimated at 35.8% in 2021 and 34.9% in 2022, compared with 39.2% in 2020. Globally, coal is expected to flatten by 2025 and renewables will surpass the fossil fuel, according to the International Energy Agency.",solar

That’s just a reality.""Why Bill Gates and John Kerry are wrong about climate change"" by @Carey_writer via @BulletinAtomic: https://t.co/DhC1L2geqF#NewClimateWarA new study, released today by Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group, reinforces those, such as climate scientist Michael Mann, who say Kerry is wrong about renewable tech. The report states that the US has the capacity now to build an energy system around renewable resources. Environment America is a federation of state-based environmental advocacy organizations, and Frontier Group is a nonprofit think tank.The study, “We Have the Power: Reaching America’s potential for clean, renewable energy,” finds that the US already has abundant renewable tech and resources to meet all of its energy needs. The study states:Researchers have largely concluded that the technology we need for a renewable future is already available. As one study from Nature Communications put it, “currently available generation and storage technologies are sufficient for nearly 100% power system operation.” And from another study from Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews: “The technologies required for renewable scenarios are not just tried-and-tested, but also proven at a large scale.”NREL has used sophisticated modeling to simulate electric grids running on high levels of renewable energy. In its most recent study, focused on Los Angeles, [the National Renewable Energy Laboratory] concluded that “[r]eliable, 100% renewable electricity is achievable — and, if coupled with electrification of other sectors, provides significant greenhouse gas, air quality, and public health benefits.”The report found that US solar energy resources have the technical potential to meet the US’s 2020 electricity demand more than 77 times over, and US onshore and offshore wind resources could meet America’s 2020 demand 11 times over. In addition, all 50 states have sufficient solar or wind potential to meet current electricity needs, and 49 (excluding Connecticut) have enough to do so under a 2050 scenario in which energy uses like transportation and buildings run on electricity.And the four steps the US has to take to achieve that? Build out renewable energy; modernize the grid; reduce and manage energy use; and replace direct uses of fossil fuels with electricity.Emma Searson, 100% renewable campaign director at Environment America Research & Policy Center, said:How quickly America shifts toward wind and solar will be decided by how and when we lean into fully erecting the four pillars outlined in this report. Given the remarkable technological advances and progress we’ve made so far, we should feel confident in our ability to build each and every one of them.If you like a good, clean, fun energy contest, check out the Department of Energy Collegiate Wind Competition that runs until June 11.The competing teams this year are:In the DOE’s words, the competition:Challenges multidisciplinary teams of undergraduate students to design, build, and test a model wind turbine against a set of rigorous performance criteria; develop a wind project plan based on market and siting considerations; and interact with wind industry experts and raise awareness of wind energy in their local communities.  To see the winning project, you can watch the Virtual Awards Ceremony (click on the Zoom link) on Friday, June 11 at 3 p.m. ET.

It’s doing so on the grounds that the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures when it bulldozed through a last-minute oil and gas auction before Donald Trump left office. In the auction, held on January 6, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority put up seven out of nine bids (the other two went to a couple of small energy firms). In other words, Alaska was the main bidder in its own auction, which netted around $14 million and is considered a flop.

It’s expected to be sea-ready by late 2023.Charybdis will first be deployed out of New London, Connecticut’s harbor to support the construction of Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. State Pier in New London will create and support a large number of jobs as a result of hosting the vessel. It will be homeported in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and manned with an American crew.Revolution Wind is a 704-megawatt offshore wind farm that will provide power to 350,000 Connecticut and Rhode Island homes. The site is located more than 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles southeast of the Connecticut coast, and 12 miles southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Construction could begin as early as 2023.Sunrise Wind is an approximately 924-megawatt offshore wind farm that will power nearly 600,000 homes in New York. Its site is around 30 miles east of Montauk Point, New York. Con Edison and the New York Power Authority will provide support. It’s expected to be fully operational by 2024.The charter’s terms will also allow the vessel, subject to state regulatory approval, to support construction of Dominion Energy’s 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach, which is expected to be completed in 2026.David Hardy, Chief Executive Officer of Ørsted Offshore North America, said:A Jones Act-qualified installation vessel is a game-changer for the development of the US offshore wind industry.This investment will enable us to unlock the economic benefits of offshore wind, not just for the Northeast, but for the southern states as well.

Duke Energy gave the department a $7,000 grant toward the e-motorcycles. Largo PD’s goal is a 100% alternative-fuel light-duty fleet (read: electric) by 2030, which aligns with the city of Largo’s sustainability goals. Its ICE motorcycles are Harley-Davidsons.Largo PD major Ann Starling said:Zero has been around for several years. We went and test drove it.

2021/05/31,"Kirk Edelman, chief commercial officer at New York City-headquartered solar development, construction, and asset management company Safari Energy, told Electrek about the three technologies that the solar industry needs to adopt in order to revolutionize processes and infrastructure.Many solar companies began as startups that cobbled together whatever processes and software they could afford to handle everything from origination to accounting. They often grew by focusing on finding cheaper, more efficient equipment. The Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie predicted that US solar capacity will increase by a multiple of four this decade. Edelman explained to Electrek what tech he thinks the US solar industry needs, and why, in order to keep up with the growing demand for solar power:Millions of variables and data points impact the efficacy of panels from shading to soiling. Parsing and developing insights from these data points requires an investment in artificial intelligence. AI enables increased automation, reduces human error, and can free up time to arrive at insights otherwise unattainable.For example, AI is being used at Safari Energy to evaluate complex commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftops. An AI algorithm can identify rooftops, determine ideal solar panel size and placement, and even accurately calculate system costs, savings, and investment returns. This method easily surpasses human analysis both in terms of speed and accuracy and can be used to rapidly analyze real estate portfolios of hundreds of properties to identify priorities.What this all means is that if you’re considering solar for your business, a company that utilizes AI can provide an estimate that is an order of magnitude more accurate in seconds compared to days when done manually.AI can also eliminate repetitive, error-prone tasks, avoiding confusion and delays in areas from bill analysis to proposal creation. This also frees up employees to focus on more sophisticated and creative work.Machine learning further amplifies the benefits of AI by continuously improving the algorithms used. By feeding a program with real-world data and reference cases, it can recognize patterns and self-correct, thereby improving accuracy.For example, some C&I rooftops might be different shades of color depending on the materials used. An algorithm might initially confuse a dark-colored roof with asphalt on the ground or even a body of water. By showing the algorithm-specific examples, it can recognize nuanced differences and incorporate its findings into future models.As a result, solar companies that use machine learning to continually improve their algorithms can further improve the accuracy of their proposals while reducing the burden of having employees focused on time-consuming tasks.Put simply, solar companies must incorporate robust analytics into their operations. By tracking and analyzing the data they create to find weaknesses in their equipment and operations, companies can de-bottleneck resources to maximize production out of existing equipment and improve daily operations. One area where data analytics can be applied is setting an organization’s strategic focus. Often, we have seen solar companies that rely almost entirely on instinct or inertia to determine which companies would be good targets. However, when you apply sophisticated analytics such as empirical data, regression analysis, heat maps, and scoring models (to name a few), it is possible to more effectively determine which geographies, industries, and company’s metrics represent the most potential and should be targeted.This area requires an investment in technology and personnel who can interpret and make decisions on the data produced, and a cultural shift so that an organization is agile enough to make large-scale decisions supported by their new data analytic capabilities. Otherwise, companies run the risk of falling into the big data trap, with lots of information, but no practical way to use it.The above technological advancements create opportunities for further enhancements, like digital twinning, which involves creating digital models of real solar equipment to run simulations on the degradation over the lifespan of that equipment. Using this preventive maintenance concept, companies can predict when their equipment will fail and replace in advance, averting any costly disruptions.  Kirk Edelman is chief commercial officer at Safari Energy.

2021/05/31,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Total shareholders voted overwhelmingly on Friday – 99% in favor – to rebrand the French oil and gas giant to TotalEnergies to mark its shift to renewables. The shareholders also backed the company’s climate plan to gradually reduce its emissions.Total is the world’s fourth-largest privately owned oil and gas producer. Renewables make up 20% of its investments this year.The investors who opposed its climate plan did so because they felt it didn’t go far enough. Business Recorder reports:Dutch fund ACTIAM… said that Total’s emissions strategy “falls short as it remains unclear how it will meet its goals given its current pace of fossil fuel production and investments that still significantly outpace those in renewables.”In a joint statement, Reclaim Finance and Greenpeace France cheered shareholders who opposed “the ‘bogus’ climate plan, while furiously condemning the large majority who backed Total’s plan for increased fossil fuel extraction.”“By supporting Total’s greenwashed strategy, shareholders have voted willingly for climate chaos,” said Reclaim Finance founder Lucie Pinson.Total announced in September 2020 that it would develop 35 gigawatts (GW) of gross wind and solar energy generation capacity by 2025, Electrek reported. In February 2021, it pledged to develop 100 GW by 2030, making it a frontrunner among oil giants shifting into renewables.European fossil fuel companies are ahead of their US counterparts in terms of willingness to set concrete targets to transition away from fossil fuels, but none of them are meeting Paris Agreement targets. Mike Coffin, senior analyst in oil and gas at financial think tank Carbon Tracker, said [via the BBC]:Total we see in the upper tier, ranking alongside BP, but below Eni. They don’t fulfil all our hallmarks of Paris [climate treaty] compliance, but above Shell and certainly above the North American companies.Italy-based Enel has a 145 GW renewables target and says it wants to be a “renewables supermajor.”The first of a total of 165 wind turbines has been installed on the Hornsea Two offshore wind farm in the UK, 55 miles (89 kilometers) northeast of Grimsby in Yorkshire.Danish wind giant Ørsted’s 1.4 gigawatt offshore wind farm will feature 165 Siemens Gamesa 8.4 MW wind turbines, an offshore substation, and a reactive compensation station, the world’s largest offshore substation.Once Hornsea Two comes online in 2022, it will become the largest operating wind farm in the world, outsizing its sister project 1.2 GW Hornsea One. But it will be dethroned by the 4.8 gigawatt Dogger Bank, also off Yorkshire in the UK, once it’s completed in 2026, as well as other projects being built globally.",solar

Crypto mining is seriously energy-intensive and not environmentally friendly at all. (Iran just banned bitcoin mining until September because it’s causing blackouts and power shortages in cities.)So Atlas Power’s owner, Kevin Washington, will apply to a Montana zoning board in June for a special use permit in order to buy a 300 megawatt, 1,600-acre solar farm on private ranch land in Butte to power his company. It’s called the Basin Creek Solar Project.Washington said, “Now, the only barrier for data centers like this is power, and I believe green energy is the answer.”Basin Creek would feature 700,000 solar panels on either side of the seasonal drainage, Little Basin Creek, with a 1,500-foot-wide corridor for wildlife in the middle. The $250 million project would be able to power around 40,000 homes.The Montana Standard writes:The project would be one of the top 10 largest solar generation facilities in the country and generate almost half the power produced by non-hydro renewable sources in Montana in 2010, according to developers.Though the buildings themselves won’t require a change in zoning, the solar project requires a special use permit because the land’s not zoned for industrial use.Atlas would use at most 75 megawatts of solar power annually, so Washington is in talks with utilities about where the other 225 megawatts could be used.Can emission-free airplanes replace our current polluting airplanes?  NOVA explores this question in an episode that aired this week, “Great Electric Airplane Race,” which you can watch below.

2021/05/26,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Biden administration yesterday announced that the US Pacific Coast will be open to commercial-scale offshore clean energy projects for the first time.The Department of Defense has been the biggest obstacle to the development of Pacific offshore wind power because the Navy and Air Force run testing, training, and operations off the California coast. The announcement is a compromise between the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.Collectively, the departments earmarked 399 square miles off California’s central coast region, northwest of Morro Bay (pictured above), which will be able to support 3 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind. Further, the Humboldt Call Area will be considered as a potential offshore wind area. Together, the two areas would bring up to 4.6 GW of energy to California, enough to power 1.6 million homes.Still-developing floating offshore wind technology will need to be utilized in California waters because the continental shelf falls away quickly, into deep waters. So the Department of Energy has invested more than $100 million in researching, developing, and demonstrating floating offshore wind technology. The Business Network for Offshore Wind has also assembled a Floating Offshore Wind Working Group to develop ideas and strategies. The Group will publish its first report in early June.And for those of you who want to revisit that old chestnut, “But don’t wind turbines kill birds?” this is what Audubon California’s executive director Sarah Rose had to say about the Biden plan for Pacific offshore wind power in an email:The biggest threat facing California’s birds is climate change, full stop.Audubon’s 2019 climate science shows that unless we can keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we may lose 389 species of birds across the continent. Properly sited wind power is an important ingredient in cutting carbon emissions and averting worst-case climate scenarios.A new study from a team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Electricity Markets and Policy group (EMP) found that new US wind and solar scheduled for connection to the grid has reached record levels, along with new battery storage projects. They examined projects that have applied for interconnection from all seven ISOs/RTOs as well as 35 non-ISO utilities. The team writes in its abstract:We find that the total capacity active in the queues is growing year-over-year, with over 750 GW of generation and an estimated 200 GW of storage capacity as of the end of 2020. Solar (462 GW) accounts for a large – and growing – share of generator capacity in the queues. Substantial wind (209 GW) capacity is also in development, 29% of which is for offshore projects (61 GW). In total, about 680 GW of zero-carbon capacity is currently seeking transmission access, as is 74 GW of natural gas capacity. Hybrids now comprise a large – and increasing – share of proposed projects, particularly in CAISO and the non-ISO West. 159 GW of solar hybrids (primarily solar + battery) and 13 GW of wind hybrids are currently active in the queues.However, the researchers note that there is bottleneck, which needs to be rectified:In four ISOs, the typical duration from connection request to commercial operation increased from ~1.9 years for projects built in 2000-2009 to ~3.5 years for those built in 2010-2020. There are growing calls for queue reform to reduce cost, lead times, and speculation. ",solar
2021/05/25,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Biden administration is keen for US electric vehicle manufacturing to ramp up fast, so South Korean companies are going to help. South Korean president Moon Jae-in and CEOs of Korean companies have pledged that the latter will make big investments in the manufacturing of such EV tech as batteries and semiconductors in the US. The two countries are collaborating to compete with China and create a stable supply chain. “If the US government provides a wide variety of incentives for battery production facilities, there will be more investment to come,” Moon said during a visit to SK Innovation’s electric vehicle battery plant in Commerce, Georgia [pictured above], on Saturday.Moon and US president Joe Biden held a summit in Washington on Friday. And in the time leading up to and during the summit, Korean tech giants Samsung, SK, LG, and Hyundai announced plans to invest nearly $40 billion in US manufacturing. The CEOs of the four companies accompanied Moon on his four-day visit to the US and participated in a South Korean-US business roundtable session. Here’s how the nearly $40 billion breaks down:In early April, SK Innovation agreed to pay LG Energy Solution, a unit of LG Chem, $1.8 billion in order to settle a US trade dispute. The two companies agreed to “work together to strengthen the battery network and environmentally friendly policy that the Biden administration is pursuing,” according to a joint statement.The settlement then enabled SK and Ford to agree a $6 billion deal in which SK will manufacture battery cells for Ford in the US, as Electrek reported.The UK’s energy regulator Ofgem will spend £300 million ($424 million) to install 3,550 new “ultra-rapid charging points” on motorways and in towns over two years. This breaks down to 1,800 charge points for motorway service stations and 1,750 charge points in towns and cities that can charge up an EV in 20-40 minutes.The Financial Times reports:One in 10 new cars sold in 2020 was a plug-in vehicle, with 6.6% battery electric cars and 4.1% hybrid cars that plug in to charge, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which says the government needs to “throw the kitchen sink at the issue of charging.”The UK will ban the sale of new gas and diesel cars from 2030 and phase out hybrid vehicles from 2035.Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said drivers “need to be confident that they can charge their car quickly when they need to” if the UK hoped for a “rapid take-up” of electric cars, reports the Guardian.Photo: Clayco",solar
2021/05/24,"Hecate Independent Power (HIP) has announced it will build an enormous, $30 billion offshore wind project off the coast of Iceland that will power the UK using long subsea cables.HIP is an Anglo-American joint venture. It’s made up of Hecate Wind, a subsidiary of Hecate Holdings, a North American renewable energy developer and majority owner of Hecate Energy, and Independent Power Corporation, a UK-based global power plant developer that previously focused on building gas-fired plants. The HIP Atlantic Project will consist of 10 gigawatts (GW) of fixed and floating wind turbines. They’ll be connected to the UK by long-length, high-capacity, high-voltage direct current submarine power transmission cables. The cables will be manufactured in the UK at a £200 million ($277 million) bespoke power cable plant that will be built at a port in northeast England. HIP will develop 2 GW of capacity off Iceland’s southern and eastern coasts, which is expected to come online by early 2025. The timing was planned to coincide with the UK’s decommissioning of its last coal-fired power plants and original generation of commercial nuclear power plants. The geographical diversity, i.e., not near the existing North Sea and Irish Sea offshore wind farms, was deliberate – “this diversity of wind source provides a geographical portfolio effect to protect the UK transmission grid from too much offshore wind capacity installed in just one region,” HIP writes.HIP has made four connection applications for an initial 4 GW of grid connections – 1 GW per wind farm – to the UK’s National Grid. This project is calling the farms wind “pods,” and each of the four pods will be in a different location in the North Atlantic with its own subsea cable. The wind pods will not be connected to the Icelandic grid.The initial 2 GW capacity will result in around 15,000 new jobs in the UK and around 500 new jobs in Iceland.",solar
2021/05/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The first four months of 2021 saw natural gas-fired generation in the US’s lower 48 states average 3,394 gigawatt hours per day. That’s a nearly 7% decrease from the same period in 2020, according to data from the US Energy Information Adminstration’s Hourly Electric Grid Monitor. This decline in natural gas generation is the result of higher natural gas prices and increased competition from clean energy. It’s the first year-over-year decline since 2017. Yet US electricity generation during the period increased 6.6% compared with 2020 due to colder winter weather. The bad news is that the US tapped into coal-fired generation in the first four months of 2021, because it was cheaper than natural gas. Coal-fired generation increased nearly 40% in the United States during that period and accounted for 23% of total generation. Ultimately, though, coal is on its way out in the US. Out of the total 235 US coal plants, 182 plants (80%) are uneconomic or already retiring.The EIA reports that wind and solar growth greatly surpassed natural gas growth between May 2020 and February 2021:Natural gas-fired generation has been facing increased competition from renewable generation in the United States because of recent record-high capacity additions to wind and solar power plants. Between May 2020 and February 2021 (the most recent month for which we have data), 22.5 gigawatts (GW) of combined net wind and solar electric generating capacity additions came online in the United States, a 15% increase. We expect an additional 28.7 GW of wind and solar capacity to enter service during the remainder of 2021, based on our latest Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory. In contrast, between May 2020 and February 2021, 4.8 GW of U.S. natural gas capacity came online, a 1% increase. We expect an additional 3.8 GW of natural gas capacity to come online during the remainder of 2021.The EIA expects that natural gas-fired generation will decline 9.1% in 2021 and a further 0.7% in 2022.The year 2020 was one of the hottest summers on record, and the US West Coast specifically suffered from both wildfires and intense heat waves last August and September. California agencies released a report in January 2021 stating that last summer’s heat waves led to an excessive demand for power, which in turn caused rolling blackouts.So smart electrical panel and app company Sense conducted a study of homes using anonymized data from last August and found that 55% of electricity usage in the evening timeframe could be reduced or shifted to other times during the day.Here are five things US households can do this summer to ease stress on the grid and save money on electric bills:",solar
2021/05/21,"Scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory published research on how the supply chains of rare earth minerals respond to disruptions. This could include natural disasters, labor or trade disputes, construction delays – and pandemics. The team found that mineral supply chain disruptions have long-range impacts that affect the costs and availability of electric vehicles.In November 2020, emerging technology market research firm IDTechEX wrote:China accounts for the vast majority of rare-earth production worldwide and this has, in the past, led to huge price volatility. In 2011, after China restricted its exports of rare-earths, the price of neodymium and dysprosium rose by approximately 750% and 2,000%, respectively.US president Joe Biden signed an executive order on February 24 to review supply chains for critical materials, including rare earth minerals – the group of 17 elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium used in permanent magnets. Magnetic materials are key in the production of electric vehicles. More than 80% of electric cars sold globally utilized permanent magnet-based motors in 2019.Biden’s executive order (non-consecutively) states:The United States must ensure that production shortages, trade disruptions, natural disasters, and potential actions by foreign competitors and adversaries never leave the United States vulnerable again. The order directs an immediate 100-day review across federal agencies to address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products. One of those key products is critical minerals:Critical minerals are an essential part of defense, high-tech, and other products. From rare earths in our electric motors and generators to the carbon fiber used for airplanes — the United States needs to ensure we are not dependent upon foreign sources or single points of failure in times of national emergency. This is a prudent move as the US shifts rapidly to electric vehicles and clean energy. A mineral supply chain disruption could negatively impact the way the Colonial Pipeline hack disrupted gasoline supplies on the US East Coast.So the study scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory undertook, titled “Agent-based modeling of supply disruptions in the global rare earths market,” should prove to be useful as federal agencies examine vulnerabilities in supply chains. Here’s what they found:In general, the analysis found that in the case of temporary scenarios — a one-year export stoppage and a two-year mine shutdown — price impacts tended to extend years beyond the disruption period. Effects on production, capacity, and demand also could potentially last longer. The model suggested some mines that started up outside of China in response to a disruption would not likely be able to keep operating after primary supplies recovered.And here’s what the Argonne team is doing going forward:The GCMat [an agent-based model] team is now working on changes to the model that will help align it with US goals to lower greenhouse gas emissions. They are enhancing representations of rare earth magnet markets for energy-efficient motors, including those used in wind turbines and electric vehicles. And new agent-based models of the lithium-ion battery supply chain will assess how shortages of global materials might affect the adoption of battery technologies important to electric vehicle markets.So how can the US best provide sustainable and secure mineral supply chains to maintain its pursuit of clean energy and vehicle electrification? Expanding reuse and recycle of minerals by big corporations, international agreements for ethical mining, and US expansion of exploration would be a start.

It will feature a prairie and pollinator environment. Livestock could graze between solar panel rows, according to Renew Wisconsin, a nonprofit that promotes clean energy. (Onion River says it’ll look like North Star Solar in North Branch, Minnesota, pictured above.) But some Wisconsin residents weren’t happy about the proposed solar farm. The Wisconsin State Journal reports:Commissioners noted and dismissed objections based on use of crop land, potential loss of property values, and the process through which private developers secure leases before seeking regulatory approval.“Not everyone is going to see things the same way,” said Commissioner Tyler Huebner. “On balance… this project is in the public interest for the state of Wisconsin.”Onion River is expected to generate $250,000 annually in revenue for Holland and $350,000 annually for Sheboygan County. It will also prevent more than 400 million pounds of carbon dioxide from being generated per year and provide clean energy to Alliant Energy customers.Onion River is one of six Wisconsin solar farms currently being built for Madison-based Alliant Energy. It’s part of the company’s first phase to add nearly 1,100 megawatts of solar by 2024 to replace its two remaining coal-fired plants that will be retired in 2025. Closing those coal plants and investing in solar will save the company “up to $6.5 billion in additional costs over the next 35 years,” reports PV Magazine. Alliant filed a separate application in April to acquire six more solar farms for about $515 million.In 2019, for the first time in more than three decades, coal-fired power plants provided less than half (42%) of Wisconsin’s electricity net generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration. (Natural gas fuels 34% of the state’s electricity.) But only 8% of Wisconsin’s electricity came from renewables, and thus why the state is rapidly installing solar.Florida Power & Lightʻs new FPL Rodeo Solar Energy Center is now supplying customers with electricity.

US residential geothermal company Dandelion Energy wants to help Vermont ditch the fuel oil – it today announced that it’s expanding its services into the Green Mountain State. Dandelion’s initial entry will be serving customers in southern Vermont’s Bennington County, with plans to expand in the future.When Electrek spoke with Dandelion Energy president Kathy Hannun in September 2020, she explained that Dandelion expands when utilities want to actively work with the company, and it also moves into places where they can easily send their drilling crews. Dandelion currently serves New York State and Connecticut, and Vermont is its third state.The expansion is supported by new incentives offered by utility Green Mountain Power (GMP), which is offering an instant rebate when customers purchase and install a Dandelion geothermal system. (GMP is also running a pilot program with Span Smart Panels.)GMP is offering an incentive of $1,800 per ton based on the system’s heating output, and Efficiency Vermont is offering an additional $300 for a combined $2,100 per ton. A typical whole-home system is about 4 tons. Dandelion will apply the discounts directly to the customer’s purchase price to make it simple to switch. Each new installation includes a heat pump and air handler, underground pipes to utilize the earth’s natural heating and cooling, and a smart thermostat. Homeowners in Vermont who pay cash and switch from fuel oil or propane heating can save approximately 50% in annual heating and cooling operating costs.Michael Sachse, Dandelion CEO, said:Geothermal heating and cooling is clean, efficient, and comfortable.

2021/05/19,"Singapore-based Maxeon Solar Technologies has announced that it will commercially release its Maxeon Air solar panels this summer. The company says the Air solar panels are frameless, thin, lightweight, and conformable, with efficiency and performance the same as standard solar panels.Basically, the Air is a solar panel sticker, or, as Maxeon describes it, “peel and stick,” so the panels can be installed directly on a roof’s surface without racking, anchors, or ballast. Maxeon says the solar panels are engineered to conform to uneven roof surfaces.No metal frame or heavy glass are used in the panel. The installed weight is around 6 kg (13 pounds) per square meter, which is less than half of conventional systems. They’re also certified for fire resistance.The cells within the panels include a solid metal foundation and stress-relieved cell interconnects. That protects against corrosion and enables fault-tolerant circuits that allow energy flow, even with cracked cells.The Air panels feature an efficiency rating of 20.9%, a low power-temperature coefficient, shade tolerance, wide spectral response, and hot-spot resistance.Maxeon Air panels will be used in selected projects in Europe in the second half of 2021. General product availability is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2022.That must be some seriously strong adhesive, and Maxeon doesn’t specify the types of roofs onto which the Air panels can be stuck. How do the Air panels work if tiles aren’t flat? And if any panels need to be replaced, how do they peel them off?Regardless of questions we still have, this seems like a game-changing product in the solar sector, and Maxeon is no startup – it’s been around for 35 years. It operates in more than 100 countries through a network of more than 1,200 partners and distributors. If the Air panel is as great as it sounds, it can basically be applied easily to roofs that previously couldn’t bear the load of conventional solar panels or are awkwardly shaped. Maxeon also doesn’t yet state what the Air panels will cost, but it says the product will be presented to the public during “The Smarter E Industry Days” on July 21-23. You can sign up for more information on their website.What do you think about these new solar panels? Let us know in the comments below.",solar
2021/05/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):GE Renewable Energy yesterday announced that it has finalized the Turbine Supply and Service and Warranty contracts for the third and final phase of the Dogger Bank offshore wind farm, known as Dogger Bank C. It’s also finalized the Service and Warranty Contract for a five-year full-service agreement that will begin once the Dogger Bank C phase is commissioned in 2026.The company has now finalized all contracts for the 3.6 GW Dogger Bank Offshore Wind Farm, due to become the largest offshore wind farm in the world upon completion.Dogger Bank is being built in three phases — A, B, and C — more than 81 miles (130 km) off England’s northeast coast. Each phase will be able to produce 6 TWh of electricity, totaling 18 TWh annually, when complete in 2026. That’s equivalent to powering approximately 6 million UK homes annually.GE details:Dogger Bank C is owned by SSE Renewables (50%) and Equinor (50%), while Dogger Bank A and B are owned by SSE Renewables (40%), Equinor (40%), and Eni (20%). As previously announced, Dogger Bank A and B phases will be the first to feature GE’s Haliade-X 13 MW, with a total of 190 to be installed. Today’s confirmation of an additional order of 87 upscaled Haliade-X 14 MW turbines for Dogger Bank C brings the total number of Haliade-X units to be installed at Dogger Bank to a total of 277.CS Energy, an Edison, New Jersey-based integrated energy firm that designs and builds optimized projects in the solar, storage, and emerging energy industries, has provided turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction services for the largest portfolio of distributed generation solar projects to date in Rhode Island.When completed, the 50 megawatt (MW) portfolio will push CS Energy’s total to more than 100 MW of clean power projects in Rhode Island over the last five years. Rhode Island has a target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030.The latest portfolio project located near Kingstown, Rhode Island, converted an inactive gravel site into a clean power generation plant. Rhode Island, the smallest US state by area, has a population of 1,057,125. It hosts Block Island, the first US offshore wind farm, and consumes less energy on a per capita basis than any other state. Rhode Island generates a larger share of its electricity from natural gas than any other state. In 2019, natural gas fueled 91% of Rhode Island’s electricity net generation, so it’s got work to do to get to 100% renewable energy by 2030. But its total carbon dioxide emissions were the second-lowest among all the states in 2017.",solar
2021/05/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The International Energy Agency (IEA) today released a special report that provides the first comprehensive energy-sector pathway toward global net-zero emissions by 2050. The IEA report, “Net Zero by 2050: A roadmap for the global energy system,” sets out in detail, ahead of COP26, what governments, companies, investors, and citizens need to do to fully decarbonize the energy sector and put emissions on a path in line with a temperature rise of 1.5°C. That means no more investments in fossil fuels from 2021.Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s foremost energy economists, told the Guardian: “If governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal, from now – from this year.”Dave Jones, global lead at independent climate and energy think tank Ember, said: The sentence that will probably be recited most from this report is this: “Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway, and no new coal mines or mine extensions are required.” The implications of that sentence are far-reaching; this is truly a knife into the fossil fuel industry.Although the IEA has embraced wind and solar less than other models, for example by the Energy Transitions Commission, the IEA has really stepped up on this report. This is a complete turnaround of the fossil-led IEA from five years ago.Further, IEA writes that inefficient coal power plants need to close by 2030 (that’s a big demand for countries such as China, South Africa, and India). It gives the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) 37 member countries a deadline of net-zero electricity by 2035. Everyone else needs to switch to net-zero electricity by 2040.IEA declares that wind and solar will get the global economy to net zero by 2050, and says that the two renewable sectors will generate nearly 75% of new electricity added by 2040. We’ve got to ask: Is anyone going to listen? We sure hope so. It lays out what everyone needs to do; by the time COP26 rolls around in November, countries should explain how they’re going to do it.Have a watch below of the IEA’s explanation of its report:St. Louis-based Azimuth Energy has installed a 1.1 MW solar project on Highbourne Cay in the Bahamas. The microgrid includes the largest PV array operating in the Bahamas to date. It was designed to withstand up to 180 mph winds and provides reliable around-the-clock power in the face of increasingly severe hurricanes. It includes a 2 MWh battery plant that enables all resort generators to be switched off for the first time in 50 years, resulting in clean energy for up to 100 residents and guests.Azimuth Energy, which has a long track record of building resilience into microgrid systems, selected Youngstown, Ohio-based Solar FlexRack’s G3-X mounting solution due to its suitability for very high wind applications, adaptability, corrosion resistance, and quick installation time.Prior to this installation, diesel generators were used 24/7. In total, about two-thirds of the island’s diesel fuel consumption will be eliminated as a result of this project, saving 1,800 metric tons of carbon emissions per year. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas, the strongest hurricane on record to strike the country. It caused $2.5 billion of property damage and $221 million was required for debris removal and cleaning a large oil spill.",solar
2021/05/17,"Danish wind turbine giant Vestas has announced today that it, along with a coalition of industry and academic leaders, has figured out how to fully recycle wind turbine blades.As Electrek previously reported at the end of April, the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow and Norwegian offshore wind developer Aker Offshore Wind worked out how to recycle glass-reinforced polymer composites (GRP) used in wind turbine blades.Strathclyde’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering developed a solution for thermal recovery and post-treatment process of glass fibers from GRP composites scrap to achieve near-virgin-quality glass fibers. Now Vestas, along with Olin, an epoxy producer, the Danish Technological Institute, and Aarhus University in Denmark claims to have achieved a full recycling cycle of turbine blades by splitting and recycling both fiber and epoxy:A coalition of industry and academic leaders have developed a new technology to enable circularity for thermoset composites, the material used to make wind turbine blades. The new technology delivers the final technological step on the journey toward a fully recyclable wind turbine value chain. To enable the adoption of this new technology, and to advance a circular economy across the wind industry, a new initiative entitled CETEC (Circular Economy for Thermosets Epoxy Composites) has been established. Within three years, CETEC is aiming to present a fully scoped solution ready for industrial adoption, based on commercialization of the novel circularity technology.Here’s how the two-step process works. First, thermoset composites are split into fiber and epoxy. Second, the epoxy is further broken up into base components similar to virgin materials using a chemcycling process. These materials can then be reused in new turbine blades. The cycle is illustrated below:Simon Frølich, PhD, team manager at the Danish Technological Institute, said:The key characteristic of composite materials is their unique combination of low weight and high strength. This is governed by the strong bonding of two different materials – fiber and epoxy. The dilemma is that this strong bond is also the feature that renders these materials difficult to recycle. Therefore, the development of CETEC’s novel technology, enabling disassembly of the composite at end-of-life, is a gamechanger, that will allow us to capture the value represented by each material stream in a new circular value chain.The technology also has the potential to be used for components of airplanes and cars. Advances in the recycling of wind turbines is crucial, because wind turbine manufacturing is ramping up quickly across the globe. The CETEC project is fantastic because it makes wind turbines fully sustainable throughout their life cycle. It also allows manufacturing innovation to move forward without creating landfill as older, less efficient turbines are replaced.This is an exciting announcement from Vestas just weeks after Strathclyde’s and Aker’s announcement, and we can’t wait to see what comes next.Photo and graphic: Courtesy of Vestas Wind Systems A/S",solar
2021/05/17,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) debuted a $100 billion economic recovery package called “California Roars Back” on Friday. $3.2 billion of that package is devoted to boosting California’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEVs) goals. In September 2020, California announced a ban of the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles from 2035.In 2020, ZEVs became the state’s number-one export, according to the full budget summary.Newsom said on Friday:The Biden administration’s been talking a lot about this, they’re hoping to do something with the Senate, but we’re doing it. We’re not waiting around.The summary states that the $3.2 billion ZEV acceleration budget over the next three years includes:If the state legislature, which must meet the state’s June 15 constitutional deadline, approves the California Roars Back budget, it would be the largest recovery plan in the state’s history.US climate envoy John Kerry is being criticized for saying yesterday on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that technology needed to reduce emissions hasn’t been invented yet:I’m told by scientists that 50% of the reductions we have to make (to get to near zero emissions) by 2050 or 2045 are going to come from technologies we don’t yet have.Spoiler alert: We already have it. As Carbon Brief’s daily newsletter points out, “Last year, the International Energy Agency set out the state of technology readiness for reaching climate goals, finding many needed after 2030 were currently at the demonstration or early prototype stage.”I spoke with @BBCJamesM of @BBCWorld/ @BBCNewshour  Radio about why @JohnKerry’s latest comments understate the role that existing renewable energy technology can play in decarbonizing our economy and place undue faith in “future tech”: https://t.co/AJLe7Rsmxe (starts @47:00)Climate scientist Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, responded to Kerry’s statement in a later BBC interview:This is a misguided statement and I hope it’s not the premise for the policy they’re going to be putting forward to reduce our carbon emissions. The reality is that we have the technology now… it simply needs to be scaled up. We need policies that will incentivize the shift that we need to see away from fossil fuels. This idea that we have to rely on future tech to decarbonize our economy unfortunately plays into this notion that we can just kick the can down the road…[I think Kerry is talking about] carbon capture, or CCS… it’s really expensive, it’s really difficult to do. It’s much cheaper to just stop putting carbon pollution into the atmosphere. So I think they are buying into this fallacy that we will be able to deploy those sorts of technologies at scale on the time frame that’s necessary. The existing technology for doing so-called CCS doesn’t work very well. … We just need political will.",solar
2021/05/11,"Roof-integrated solar company GAF Energy announced today that it will move all of its manufacturing from Asia to a facility in Silicon Valley. It’s a reversal of the solar industry trend of manufacturing solar panels in Asia due to lower labor costs.GAF Energy will shift both manufacturing and research and development to a leased 112,000-square-foot facility in San Jose, California (pictured above). It currently manufactures in both South Korea and the US.The company is investing more than $50 million to renovate and adapt the facility, where it will employ “hundreds” of people, according to its press release. (PV magazine says “around 400 people in manufacturing, engineering, and research.”)GAF Energy’s solar roof features panels integrated into the roof, thus avoiding drilling through the shingles. GAF Energy is part of Standard Industries and a sister company to roofing manufacturer GAF, the largest roofer in North America. In March, Electrek spoke with GAF Energy’s CEO, Martin DeBono, about building-integrated solar. When we asked him whether it’s possible to develop a BIPV manufacturing industry based in the US that provides homeowners with a high-quality, affordable product, he replied:Yes, it’s totally possible to develop a BIPV manufacturing industry in the US. I’d argue that it’s absolutely critical to grow the industry here, in fact. We’re manufacturing EVs here, we’re manufacturing energy storage and solar panels here. Manufacturing BIPV can be part of ensuring that America leads on clean energy.Most PV is manufactured outside the country at present, with only 10 companies manufacturing solar in the US now. I think BIPV represents an opportunity. The BIPV product is a very high-quality product, and that’s something that US manufacturing does well. I think it’s a fair bet to say that DeBono knew in March, when we spoke to him, that GAF Energy would be moving its manufacturing exclusively to the US. In the big picture of solar manufacturing, GAF Energy won’t be able to produce anywhere near what solar manufacturers in Asia currently produce. But it’s a significant step for an American solar company to open a solar manufacturing center in Silicon Valley. Plus, putting manufacturing and R&D together in the same building is efficient.The Biden administration is urging American companies to move away from relying on overseas manufacturing and create millions of US clean energy jobs. Indeed, that’s a key part of the American Jobs Plan. Biden is calling on Congress to invest more than $52 billion in domestic manufacturers.Photo: GAF Energy",solar
2021/05/11,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Update May 11, 12:38 EDT: Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo today announced approval of the construction and operation of the Vineyard Wind project — the first large-scale, offshore wind project in the United States. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), chair of the Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, sent the following statement to Electrek:With this record of decision on Vineyard Wind on the books, the era of American offshore wind is no longer on the horizon — it’s here, now, off the coast of Massachusetts, and the answer to America’s energy future is blowing in the offshore wind.Vineyard Wind will be the first of many offshore wind projects to come, and we can use our Bay State know-how to show the rest of the country how to get steel in the water, zero-emission energy on the grid, and union jobs to American workers.  Vineyard Wind 1 off the coast of Massachusetts is now cleared for construction. It’s the first major offshore wind farm in US federal waters. It will have 800 megawatts of installed capacity, sufficient to meet demand from over 400,000 Massachusetts homes and businesses according to parent company Iberdrola’s website. It’s expected to begin supplying power by late 2022.To put the project in perspective, the two much smaller existing US offshore wind farms (Block Island and a pilot project off the Virginia coast) have a collective capacity of fewer than 50 megawatts of power.The project is 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and is expected to feature up to 84 12 megawatt GE Haliade-X wind turbines. The project is a joint 50/50 venture of Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.The Biden administration intends to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030. At the state level, Massachusetts on Friday launched a 1.6 GW offshore wind tender. It’s the state’s third offshore wind solicitation. In its first two offshore solicitations, Massachusetts selected the Vineyard Wind 1 and Mayflower Wind proposals, with a combined capacity of roughly 1,600 MW. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has raised its forecast for the global growth of wind and solar by another 25% compared to figures it published six months ago. This puts wind and solar on track to match global gas capacity by 2022.The IEA reports:In 2020, annual renewable capacity additions increased 45% to almost 280 GW – the highest year-on year increase since 1999.Exceptionally high capacity additions become the “new normal” in 2021 and 2022, with renewables accounting for 90% of new power capacity expansion globally.Solar PV development will continue to break records, with annual additions reaching 162 GW by 2022 – almost 50% higher than the pre-pandemic level of 2019.Global wind capacity additions increased more than 90% in 2020 to reach 114 GW. While the pace of annual market growth slows in 2021 and 2022, it is still 50% higher than the 2017-2019 average.And as Carbon Brief reports, “the new forecast for 2021 is nearly 40% higher than the one published by the IEA just a year ago, in May 2020.”The IEA has boosted its US forecasts by more than 20% thanks to the expected extension of renewable energy tax credits.The forecast does not yet include the Biden administration’s new emissions reduction targets or its infrastructure bill, which the IEA says would boost renewable growth after 2022, if enacted.",solar
2021/05/07,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Brown University researchers have figured out how to improve the long-term reliability of perovskite solar cells, as per a new study published today in Science.Perovskite cells are very good at absorbing light. Their efficiency now rivals that of traditional silicon cells. Perovskite light absorbers can be manufactured at near room temperature, unlike silicon, which requires extreme heat. Perovskite films are also about 400 times thinner than silicon wafers. They’re cheaper to make than silicon cells. But making perovskite cells more stable and reliable has been challenging – until now.As Brown University’s news page explains: Each [perovskite] cell contains five or more distinct layers, each performing a different function in the electricity-generation process. Since these layers are made from different materials, they respond differently to external forces. Also, temperature changes that occur during the manufacturing process and during service can cause some layers to expand or contract more than others. That creates mechanical stresses at the layer interfaces that can cause the layers to decouple. If the interfaces are compromised, the performance of the cell plummets.So the scientists figured out a way to strengthen the weakest of those interfaces – which is between the perovskite film used to absorb light and the electron transport layer – with compounds known as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).They found that a SAM formulation with silicon atom on one side and iodine atom on the other could form strong bonds with the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer. Further, the SAM actually improved the cell’s efficiency, and it’s inexpensive.Non-SAM cells prepared for the study retained 80% of their peak efficiency for around 700 hours of lab testing. Meanwhile, the SAM cells were still going strong after 1,300 hours of testing. Based on those experiments, the researchers project the 80% efficiency life of the SAM cells to be about 4,000 hours.Going forward, the researchers intend to fortify the entire perovskite solar cell stack. They recently won a $1.5 million grant from the US Department of Energy to expand on their research.Danish wind giant Ørsted and Polish energy company PGE have closed a joint venture agreement to develop, construct, and operate the nearly 2.5 gigawatt Baltica 2 and 3 offshore wind farms off the Polish coast.Renews.biz reports that Ørsted and PGE submitted an application for registration to the National Court Register and have now closed the transaction. The Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection approved the joint venture in mid-March.Baltica 2 (1500 MW) and (1045 MW) Baltica 3 have already received environmental permits and signed grid connection agreements, and the Polish Energy Regulatory Office awarded Contracts for Difference on April 7. Baltica 3 could become operational in 2026, while Baltica 2 could come online before 2030.“PGE aims to install at least 6.5GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040, and is currently helping to develop just over 4.1GW of Polish offshore wind capacity,” according to Windpower Monthly. “Poland aims to have 3.8GW of offshore wind capacity installed by 2030, 10GW by 2040, and 28GW by 2050.”Poland is aiming for net zero by 2050, but has the challenge of being a coal-heavy country.Photo: Padture Lab/Brown University",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/05/06,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), The Solar Foundation, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, and BW Research today released its “National Solar Jobs Census 2020” report (you can read it here). The US solar industry employed 231,474 workers in 2020, a 6.7% drop from 2019 due to pandemic restrictions and increased labor productivity.But SEIA analysis shows that the US solar industry will need to reach more than 900,000 workers to meet President Joe Biden’s 2035 clean energy target, so the future is bright for jobs in the solar industry.Electrek‘s Michelle Lewis spoke with Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA, by email about future solar careers prospects:Michelle Lewis: How many solar jobs are full-time, and not gig work?Abigail Ross Hopper: In 2020, 92% of our 231,000 workers spent 100% of their time on solar-related work.Michelle Lewis: Are solar construction jobs temporary, since solar farms don’t require many full-time staff to maintain them? (Ed. note: Installation and construction-related employment continue to be the largest segment in the industry, representing 67% of all jobs.)Abigail Ross Hopper: Project construction is just one of the numerous types of jobs in the solar industry. The majority of solar project construction jobs are full-time, where workers are on several different sites throughout the year. Well over 90% of our 231,000 workers spend 100% of their time on solar work, with incredible opportunity for career growth. This isn’t an industry of temporary workers. We are over 200,000 strong working every day to build the clean energy that will power our future.Michelle Lewis: How do solar jobs’ salaries compare to fossil fuel jobs? Abigail Ross Hopper: Solar jobs are well-paying jobs and pay comparable or higher wages than similar occupations in other industries, including fossil fuels. For example, solar construction managers, operations managers, repair workers, and sales workers earn average salaries that exceed their counterparts in other energy sectors.2020 marked the largest annual decrease in US energy production on record, according to the US Energy Information Administration. In 2020, energy production in the US fell to just below 96 quadrillion British thermal units (quads), down more than 5% from 2019’s record high. Specifically, it dropped from 101.3 quads in 2019 to 95.8 quads in 2020. This is attributed to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Between 2019 and 2020, US coal production fell by 25% to less than 11 quads, its largest annual decrease on record. US crude oil production fell by 8% in 2020 after reaching a record high in 2019. The sudden drop in petroleum demand in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19 led crude oil operators to decrease production.Natural gas dry production in the United States increased in eight of the previous nine years and hit a record high in 2019. It decreased by 0.6 quads, or 2%, in 2020.The EIA continues:US renewable energy production increased by 2% between 2019 and 2020 to a record-high 11.8 quads in 2020, primarily because of increased electricity generation from wind and solar. In 2019, US renewable energy production surpassed US coal production for the first time. Wind energy production increased by 14% in the United States to 3 quads, and US solar energy production grew by 23% to 1.2 quads. US hydroelectric and geothermal energy production stayed flat, while biomass production, including biofuels and wood, declined by 8%.",solar
2021/05/05,"Enel Green Power North America, headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, has started construction on five new clean energy projects in the US. The new wind, solar, and hybrid projects announced today represent more than 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity and 319 megawatts (MW) of battery storage capacity. The five new projects under construction in Texas, Illinois, and Oklahoma will generate over 4.1 TWh of renewable electricity per year, capable of powering more than 525,000 US households annually. All five projects announced today have offtake agreements for a portion of their output.The five new projects are expected to generate around $450 million in tax revenue for local communities and new income for project landowners. The projects will create more than 1,500 construction jobs. Enel has started construction of the Roseland solar and storage, Blue Jay solar and storage, and Ranchland wind and storage projects. At 639.6 MW, Roseland will be Enel’s largest solar plant in the US and Canada and will include a 59 MW battery storage system. Located in Falls County near Waco, Roseland is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022.In Grimes County, Texas, northwest of Houston, the Blue Jay project will pair a 270 MW solar farm with a 59 MW battery storage system. The project is expected to complete by the end of 2021. The Ranchland project will be a 263 MW wind farm paired with an 87 MW battery system. Located in Callahan and Eastland counties, east of Abilene, operations are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2022.Enel also plans to retrofit its 500 MW High Lonesome wind farm (pictured above) and 497 MW Roadrunner solar farm in West Texas with a 57 MW battery storage system at each plant. Construction is due to begin this summer.In Illinois, Enel is building the Alta Farms wind project in DeWitt County, southeast of Peoria. The 200 MW plant is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2022. In Oklahoma, Enel has started construction on the 140 MW Rockhaven wind farm in Garvin and Carter counties, south of Oklahoma City and adjacent to the Origin wind farm, which the company has operated since 2015. The project is expected to become operational by the end of 2021.Photo: Enel Green Power",solar
2021/05/05,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):General Electric (GE) is, to state the obvious, a massive global company. It provides power generation, renewable energy, industrial aviation products, and healthcare products and services in more than 170 countries. GE Renewable Energy, which was responsible for 20% of GE’s revenue as of Q4 2020, manufactures the Haliade-X, the most powerful offshore wind turbine in the world.And yet GE has not yet set a comprehensive plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its businesses and products by 2050 in alignment with the Paris Agreement.Last year, GE announced its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030, but only for the company’s direct operations and facilities (Scope 1 and 2 emissions). Shareholders want the company to address its full climate footprint, including indirect emissions from GE’s products (Scope 3), which currently account for a large portion of the company’s total emissions. So yesterday, 98% of its investors voted for a shareholder resolution [via environmental and social corporate responsibility nonprofit As You Sow] at GE’s annual meeting that asks the company to report on whether and how it plans to do that:While GE has committed to achieve carbon neutrality for its facilities and operations by 2030 (Scope 1 & 2), it has not reported an ambition to reduce the largest component of its GHG emissions – its scope 3 product emissions – an important gauge of whether and how it is reducing climate risk and capitalizing on low carbon opportunities.BE IT RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors issue a report, at reasonable expense and excluding confidential information, evaluating and disclosing if and how the company has met the criteria of the Net Zero Indicator, or whether it intends to revise its policies to be fully responsive to such Indicator.Fortunately, GE’s board supported the resolution, and said it will discuss its full plan for emissions reductions in its sustainability report later in 2021.The UK’s wind farms set a new clean energy record on Monday by generating 48.5% of the country’s electricity system. More than 17.6 gigawatts of electricity was generated by offshore and onshore wind turbines at 3:30 p.m. on the Bank Holiday, according to National Grid ESO.The previous record for England, Scotland, and Wales of 17.5 gigawatts was set on February 13.ESO said in a tweet that wind produced 35.2% of the country’s electricity in all:Yesterday #wind produced 35.2% of GB electricity followed by gas 30.4%, nuclear 14.9%, imports 8.3%, biomass 7.2%, solar 2.8%, hydro 1.2%, coal 0.1%, other 0.0% *excl. non-renewable distributed generation pic.twitter.com/1vXCzxHrhNIndustry body RenewableUK’s deputy chief executive Melanie Onn said [via Sky News]:The fact that wind is generating nearly half the country’s electricity shows how central it has become in our modern energy system.The UK’s healthy pipeline of wind energy projects set to be built onshore and offshore will help us to reach the Government’s target of net zero emissions as fast as possible.The UK plans to produce 40GW of offshore wind by 2030.",solar
2021/05/04,"Danish clean energy giant Ørsted has just completed its very first utility-scale solar plus battery storage project, and it’s in the US. Its Permian Energy Center project (pictured above), a 460 MW solar and 40 MW battery storage facility, is in Andrews County, Texas. Electrek first noted Ørsted’s expansion into solar in September 2020. All of the new projects it completes in 2021 will be onshore, and most will involve solar.Its 670,000-panel, 227 MW Muscle Shoals, Alabama, project, its second solar project in the US, is expected to come online in third quarter 2021.On March 30, Ørsted commenced construction of its largest onshore project to date, the 518 MW combined wind and solar project, the Helena Energy Center, in Bee County, south Texas.On April 26, pharmaceutical giant Merck entered into an agreement to purchase energy from Ørsted’s Armadillo Solar Center in Navarro County, Texas. The Armadillo Center is expected to be operational by early 2023.The Permian Basin in west Texas, historically known for producing natural gas and oil, is increasingly seeing the rapid growth of solar and wind, and Ørsted is playing its part.As Ørsted explains, the Permian Energy Center project is “located on a 3,600-acre site alongside existing oil and gas installations and will supply growing West Texas demand for electricity.” The project’s 1.3 million solar panels will power more than 80,000 households. Permian Energy Center brings Ørsted’s onshore installed capacity to 2.1 GW out of its total operational and under-construction onshore portfolio of 4 GW across the US. Neil O’Donovan, chief operations officer of Ørsted’s Onshore business, said:Permian Energy Center is a significant milestone for Ørsted, making it the first developer to operate the full spectrum of new renewable energy technologies at utility scale in the US — onshore and offshore wind, solar PV, and storage.",solar
2021/05/04,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Researchers at the UK’s Oxford Brookes University think wind turbines would be more efficient if they were designed differently. A team from the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics has come up with a new design they call “vertical turbines.”According to the Oxford Brookes website, they conducted an in-depth study using more than 11,500 hours of computer simulation to show that wind farms can perform more efficiently by opting for compact Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs), pictured above in a computer rendering, instead of propeller-type Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs). VAWTs spin around an axis vertical to the ground, and the team asserts that if they’re set in pairs, they’d be 15% more efficient because the wind turbines would increase each other’s performance. Further, they also argue that arranging the VAWTs in a grid would further increase their efficiency.Dr. Mahak Mahak, coauthor of the study, which is published in the International Journal of Renewable Energy, said:The importance of using computational methods in understanding flow physics can’t be underestimated. These types of design and enhancement studies are a fraction of the cost compared to the huge experimental test facilities. This is particularly important at the initial design phase and is extremely useful for the industries trying to achieve maximum design efficiency and power output.Do you think this new design would be more efficient? Let us know in the comments below.The Interior Department yesterday announced that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has given final approval to a new solar farm on public lands in California.Sonoran West will construct the $550 million, 350 megawatt Crimson Solar Project, which will also feature a 350 megawatt battery storage system. It will generate and deliver power through the Southern California Edison Colorado River Substation. It will provide power for around 87,500 homes.The Crimson Solar Project will occupy up to around 2,000 acres of BLM-administered lands approximately 13 miles west of Blythe, in Riverside County, California. The project will provide an estimated 650 temporary construction jobs, 10 permanent jobs, and 40 temporary jobs in operations and maintenance over the 30-year life of the project.Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said:Projects like this can help to make America a global leader in the clean energy economy through the acceleration of responsible renewable energy development on public lands.Photo: Oxford Brookes University",solar
2021/05/03,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):GE’s mighty 814-feet (248-meter-tall) Haliade-X offshore turbine features a 14 MW, 13 MW, or 12 MW capacity, 722-feet (220-meter) rotor, a 351-feet (107-meter) blade, and digital capabilities. One rotation of its 220-meter rotor could power one household. One Haliade-X 14 MW turbine can generate up to 74 GWh of gross annual energy production.And now the Haliade-X’s 12 MW and 13 MW models have secured typhoon certification from independent certification body DNV. It’s known as class T certification. That means the giant wind turbines are able to operate effectively in extreme weather that typhoons – and hurricanes, because they’re the same thing, just different global locations. And imagine the power they’d produce. 4COffshore notes: “The Haliade-X prototype located in Rotterdam, operating at 13MW, set a new record in October 2020 by generating 312 MWh of continuous power in one day.”Kim Sandgaard-Mork, DNV executive vice president of renewables certification, said:Typhoon loads on wind turbines is of critical importance in emerging offshore wind markets such as Taiwan, Japan, Korea as well as parts of the US.Wind turbines need to be designed for these extreme local environmental conditions to support the ambitious plans to develop multi-megawatt offshore wind projects.With obtaining the DNV Certificate, GE Renewable Energy proves that the largest offshore wind turbine in operation – the Haliade-X – is able to reliably withstand the typhoons that are likely to affect it within their lifetime.The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday that tax incentives should only be given to US-made electric vehicles.

2021/04/27,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Rochester, New York-headquartered Hyzon Motors, which manufactures hydrogen fuel-cell-powered commercial vehicles, today announced a memorandum of understanding with Wyoming-headquartered Raven, a renewable fuels company, to build hydrogen hubs across the US and globally. The first hub will be in the San Francisco Bay Area, and others in California will follow.The companies expect to build up to 100 waste-to-hydrogen production hubs across the US and globally. Each hub will convert organic waste (pictured above) in nearly every form into locally produced, renewable hydrogen for Hyzon’s zero-emission commercial vehicles.Raven SR’s Steam/CO2 reformation process involves no combustion, as confirmed by the State of California EPA. The hubs will be built at landfills and are expected to power garbage trucks as well as other classes of heavy-duty trucks.The initial hubs will process 50 tons of solid waste daily, per hub, and yield up to 4.5 tons of renewable green hydrogen each, enough hydrogen from each hub to power 100 heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Future hubs may be able to scale to five times larger to accommodate sites with higher hydrogen requirements.Matt Murdock, CEO of Raven, said:Our planet produces over 5.5 million tons of municipal solid waste and 16.5 million tons of agricultural waste every single day. Theoretically, if we were to convert all of this waste, we could produce over 2 million tons of renewable hydrogen per day – enough to satisfy over 25% of total global oil demand. Currently, most waste is dumped into landfills or burned, which is extremely polluting to both air quality and other parts of our environment.Independent solar power producer Navisun has completed two solar projects in its home state of Massachusetts for a total of 3.8 MW of solar power. The solar farms – and one is community solar – in Orange and Sheffield, Massachusetts, will generate enough electricity annually to power around 600 homes. So they’re not huge, but they come with a bonus: Navisun earned the new pollinator adder for the two solar farms through Massachusetts’ SMART Program, a long-term sustainable solar incentive program that promotes cost-effective solar development. The company was awarded Pollinator-Friendly Certificates from the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst Clean Energy Extension. So Navisun will be now able to create pollinator habitats in all applicable future solar projects as well. (Certification by an independent party such as UMass prevents greenwashing.)Pollinator-friendly certification requires that solar farm grounds must be prepared and maintained to promote native meadow habitats under and around solar panels. This includes planting native flowering herbs and shrubs, no insecticide or fungicide, maintaining bee-nesting habitats, and providing safe passageways for small wildlife. Land development and pesticides have caused the number of bee colonies per hectare to decline by 90% since 1962 among US crops that require bee pollination.

The British Secret Intelligence Service (headquarters are pictured above) will be checking to see if you’re doing what you’ve said you’d do.Richard Moore, the head of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, said that “the agency had to play a role in relation to the ‘climate emergency,’” describing it as “the foremost international foreign policy agenda item for the UK,'” according to the Press Association.Moore, in an interview with Times Radio, specifically mentioned China, which has “a very different value set” and is the world’s “largest emitter.”Moore said: My service’s job I guess is to help with the managing of the threat side and making sure that we defend and protect our interests.And it’s, if you like, a sort of assurance, putting an assurance wrapper around the positive side of it.Climate change is a good example, where people sign up to commitments on climate change and it’s perhaps our job to make sure that when people sign up to them, that actually what they’re really doing reflects what they’ve signed up to.It’s our job to shine light in places where people might not want it shone.And so clearly, we are going to support what is the foremost international foreign policy agenda item for this country, for the planet, which is around the climate emergency and of course we have a role in that space.Crude oil production in Alaska has reached the lowest level of production since 1976, at an average of 448,000 barrels per day (b/d) in 2020, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).The 4% decrease in annual oil production in Alaska in 2020 was part of a larger decline in US oil production, and it was more than 75% less than the state’s peak production of more than 2 million b/d in 1988.The EIA reports:The oil industry is the largest contributor to Alaska’s economy despite the decline in production. Alaska has no state income or sales tax but relies instead on revenues from the oil and natural gas industry. Oil revenues supplied more than two-thirds of the state’s budget in 2020. Although Alaska relies on the oil and natural gas industry for its revenue base, production in the state makes up only 4% of all oil production in the United States. In January 2021, the Biden administration, in an executive order, imposed a temporarily halted federal oil and natural gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It was a reversal of Donald Trump’s last-minute gas and oil drilling-rights auction from November 2020.",solar
2021/04/23,"Orbital Marine Power yesterday launched its 2MW tidal turbine, the Orbital O2, in Scotland. It will become the world’s most powerful operational tidal turbine once it has been commissioned and connected to the European Marine Energy Centre in the Orkney Islands.Osprey Shipping Ltd managed the operation that transferred the 680-tonne tidal turbine from the Port of Dundee into the River Tay using a submersible barge. It was the first vessel launch from Dundee since shipbuilding ended more than 40 years ago.Aberdeen-based TEXO Fabrication managed the turbine build, which started in the latter half of 2019, as Electrek reported. The project supported around 80 jobs. Here’s an animation from 2018 that explains how the Orbital O2 will work:And now it’s become a reality. According to Orbital Marine:O2 has the ability to generate enough clean, predictable electricity to meet the demand of around 2,000 UK homes and offset approximately 2,200 tonnes of CO2 production per year.Offshore Energy described the tidal turbine’s specs:The O2 turbine has a 74-meter-long hull structure with twin 1MW power generating nacelles at the end of retractable leg structures. Its 10-meter blades give the O2 more than 600 square meters of swept area to capture flowing tidal energy.The final product is pretty awesome. Check out the short video below from a couple weeks ago in which it’s being moved to the water:Orbital CEO Andrew Scott said:The O2 is a remarkable example of British cleantech innovation, and the build we have completed here is an inspiring display of what a UK supply chain can achieve if given the opportunity – even under the extraordinary pressures of a pandemic.",solar

And now it’s catching up to No. 1 California in utility-scale solar capacity.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports:Texas will add 10 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar capacity by the end of 2022, compared with 3.2 GW in California. One-third of the utility-scale solar capacity planned to come online in the United States in the next two years (30 GW) will be in Texas.The installation of 2.5 GW of solar capacity in 2020 marked the beginning of the solar boom in Texas. We expect the state to add another 4.6 GW of solar capacity in 2021 and 5.4 GW in 2022, which will bring total installed solar capacity in Texas to 14.9 GW.Utility-scale solar projects that start construction in 2021 or 2022 are eligible for a 26% federal tax credit, and that’s driving growth. The tax credit drops to 22% in 2023 and to 10% for projects that start in 2024 or later. Thirty percent of the solar farms will be built in West Texas’s sunny Permian Basin, which is best known as a major center for oil drilling. It looks as though the Permian Basin could be headed for a new identity.The West Virginia Electric Auto Association (WVEAA), a chapter of the US Electric Auto Association, premiered a documentary film shot by Jon Averill about the early adopters of electric vehicles in the Mountain State and why they choose to embrace electric.

2021/04/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Leaders Summit on Climate kicked off today, Earth Day, at 8 a.m. EDT. Click on the link for the full schedule of events, and you can watch it live here or below.US president Joe Biden will host leaders from around the world in discussions highlighting the urgent need to reduce emissions and help vulnerable countries cope with unavoidable climate impacts, as well as the economic benefits of climate action.The 5 sessions are:And in addition to the US being expected to formally confirm the goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030 (Update: It did), and the possibility of China improving its own targets (Update: It didn’t), here are three more countries to watch that could make a huge impact:Japan may announce a 50% nationally determined contribution (NDC) target. As the world’s fourth-largest coal power country in 2020, it has moved away from coal more slowly than the US and other G20 countries. It’s considering ending support for overseas coal projects and has already announced it will retire old, inefficient coal-fired power plants by 2030. However, it remains the only G7 country without a coal phase-out commitment. A 50% NDC target would be difficult to achieve without rapid power sector decarbonization. Update, 9:23 a.m. EDT: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that Japan is setting a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a benchmark reduction of 46% by 2030 compared with 2013 levels.Germany is targeting net zero by 2050. However, its 2038 coal phase-out date is no longer compatible with the EU’s own climate objectives to reduce emissions by 55%, as recently confirmed by its minister of environment. According to independent think tank Ember’s analysis of National Energy & Climate Plans (NECPs), Germany still plans 104 TWh of coal power and 101 TWh of gas power in 2030 and will be the EU’s largest power sector emitter. With the German election this year, climate change is set to dominate the agenda. Update, 9:23 a.m. EDT: No new targets set by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but she said that Biden had sent “a very clear and important message to the international community.”Canada is expected to increase its NDC target. Ember’s recent analysis showed Canada is “green, but not getting greener.” Despite aiming for a coal phase-out by 2030, Canada’s current transition is one of the least ambitious among G20 countries. Canada’s coal generation has fallen by half the rate of the US and EU since 2015. It could easily achieve a coal phase-out earlier than 2030. Update, 9:23 a.m. EDT: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a target of reducing its 2005 emission levels by 40% to 45% by 2030.And here’s a little food for thought from environmental activist Greta Thunberg.When you compare the overall current best available science to their insufficient, hypothetical ""climate targets"" you clearly see that there’s a gap, there are decades missing.Until we adress this gap, no real solutions will be found.Let's call out the bullsh*t.#MindTheGap pic.twitter.com/USlPII68ZsThe Los Angeles City Council yesterday unanimously approved a historic resolution, the Global Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty (FFNPT), and entreats other cities to sign on, with the hope that countries will follow.

The 300-acre, 144,000-solar-panel hybrid project is at Sirindhorn Dam, on a 111-square-mile (288-square-kilometer) reservoir. The state-run Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT) will use an Energy Management System to switch between solar and hydropower.Project chief Chanin Saleechan told Reuters:We are currently at 90% completion. The project area is divided into seven platforms of floating solar cell panels. We’ve already installed five-and-a-half platforms. There are still one-and-a-half platforms to work on, which we expect to complete by the end of April. And we think we will be ready to distribute electricity with this by the end of June 2021.[W]e utilize everything we have here to make the best use of each component. We have space on the water surface, and we have a hydro power station with a high voltage power transmission system. And with that combination, it will make the cost of power generation per unit lower.”EGAT says the project should be able to generate 45 megawatts of power. Thailand’s goal is to use 35% clean energy by 2037.US food and beverage giant The Hershey Company (NYSE: HSY) yesterday announced two new power purchase agreements (PPA) to develop solar farms in the US as it moves its operations toward the use of clean energy.The company’s first utility-scale solar farm will be in Camden, North Carolina, a 20-megawatt solar farm on 218 acres of land. Hershey has agreed a 15-year power purchase agreement that will enable its financing and construction. It is expected to be completed by late July. It will reduce emissions by 32,025 metric tons per year. Global renewable energy developer BayWa r.e. will build the solar farm.Hershey has also signed a PPA with National Grid Renewables for 50 megawatts of the previously announced Noble Project, currently under construction in Denton County, Texas. Multiple companies will draw energy from Noble. Hershey’s solar contract will account for around 118,000 megawatt hours per year. It will reduce emissions by approximately 83,625 metric tons per year.Hershey says it’s committed to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, and reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 50% by 2030.Jeff King, senior director of global sustainability and social impact at Hershey, said:Not only will these solar projects help Hershey to reduce its impact on the environment, they will also create jobs and help contribute to the growth of local economies and our commitment to reduce our [greenhouse gas] footprint.",solar
2021/04/20,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its annual “Global Energy Review” report, and while there is some good news about the adoption of renewables, there is also some rather alarming news about an anticipated emissions surge in 2021.Update, April 20, 3:55 p.m. EDT: The Washington Post has issued breaking news:President Biden this week will pledge to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at least in half by [2030], according to two individuals briefed on the plan, as part of an aggressive push to combat climate change at home and convince other major economies around the world to follow suit.The planned US pledge represents a near-doubling of the target that the nation committed to under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, when Barack Obama vowed to cut emissions between 26 and 28% compared to 2005 levels.The White House says a final decision has not been made.Let’s start with the IEA’s positive findings about clean energy globally. Renewable electricity generation in 2021 is expected to expand by more than 8% to reach 8 300 TWh, the fastest year-on-year growth since the 1970s. Renewables are set to provide 30% of electricity generation worldwide in 2021.Solar and wind are set to contribute two-thirds of renewables growth. China alone should account for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity in 2021, followed by the US, the European Union, and India. Wind is set for the largest increase in clean energy, growing by 275 TWh, or almost 17%. China is expected to generate 600 TWh and the United States 400 TWh through 2021, together representing more than half of global wind output.Globally, solar is expected to increase by 145 TWh, almost 18%, to approach 1,000 TWh in 2021. China (pictured above) will continue to be the largest solar market, and US adoption of solar will continue to grow. Hydropower will also increase, as will bioenergy. The IEA concludes:Increases in electricity generation from all renewable sources should push the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix to an all-time high of 30% in 2021. Combined with nuclear, low-carbon sources of generation well and truly exceed output from the world’s coal plants in 2021.Coal use may be rapidly declining in Europe and the US, but that’s certainly not the case in China. Global coal demand declined 4% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the IEA expects coal use to “rebound strongly in 2021.”The IEA reports:Global energy demand is set to increase by 4.6% in 2021 – led by emerging markets and developing economies – pushing it above its 2019 level. Demand for all fossil fuels is on course to grow significantly in 2021, with both coal and gas set to rise above their 2019 levels. Oil is also rebounding strongly but is expected to stay below its 2019 peak, as the aviation sector remains under pressure.The expected rise in coal use dwarfs that of renewables by almost 60%, despite accelerating demand for renewables. More than 80% of the projected growth in coal demand in 2021 is set to come from Asia, led by China. Coal use in the United States and the European Union is also on course to increase but will remain well below pre-crisis levels.The result of this strong coal rebound is a projected surge of carbon dioxide emissions by 1.5 billion tonnes in 2021 – the second-largest increase in history. That’s an increase of almost 5% this year to 33 billion tonnes.As IEA executive director Fatih Birol said:Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022. The Leaders Summit on Climate hosted by US President Joe Biden this week is a critical moment to commit to clear and immediate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.And in the energy sector, Saara Kujala, general manager business development at Wärtsilä Energy, told Electrek:COVID-19 led to global leaders calling for us to Build Back Better, but the IEA Energy Review demonstrates that there is a discrepancy between the narrative and the policy, given how emissions are bouncing back in 2021.2021 may well be seen as the crucial year for how the world tackled the climate crisis, but only if ambition is met with real action.Well, quite. It can’t be said enough: We are in a global climate emergency and need to implement policy now.The fact that China (No. 1 polluter) and the US (No. 2 polluter) agreed to collaborate to fight climate change in the last few days is a start, especially considering the tensions between the two countries on many other matters. Energy and environmental groups expected that fossil-fuels use would get worse before it got better, but this predicted emissions surge simply isn’t something we can just accept with a shrug.Governments are throwing out all sorts of ambitious targets, but we’ve got to see action. For example, I watched Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Cecil Roberts, president of US coal’s largest union, the United Mine Workers of America, discuss a possible transition from coal to renewables in Appalachia with the National Press Club yesterday. (You can watch the full discussion here.) It was an important and intriguing conversation. Coal workers are rightly concerned about future work and training as their industry declines, but I didn’t hear about any concrete road maps out of coal from Manchin.Surely Manchin, of all people – the chair of the US Energy and Natural Resources Committee – should be able to speak definitively and comprehensively about renewable adoption and job creation, rather than vaguely repeating himself about the possibilities of carbon capture and sequestration. Even Roberts called for federal support for wind turbines and solar panels to be manufactured in Appalachia, and spells out a plan in the union’s new report (although it still leans heavily on coal).Manchin complained about China’s massive pollution output. He also repeatedly said that the US should be leading in renewable innovation and manufacturing (and rather ridiculously said he’s for “innovation, not elimination” of coal). He’s right that China both leads in pollution output and the manufacturing of renewables. So I’d like to see Manchin throw his full weight behind Biden’s infrastructure plan to eliminate fossil fuels and get his constituents clean energy jobs, and then support effective collaboration with China to get both countries off the coal path. There is no more room for hedging. Coal must be ditched by everyone.",solar
2021/04/20,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):New York’s commuter railroad The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and French train manufacturer Alstom will work together to explore the possibility of retrofitting the LIRR’s rail cars with rechargeable batteries to run on the railroad’s diesel branches. If successful, it would be the first commuter railroad in North America to run battery-powered trains. (They are already used in Europe.)The first phase of the study will be on paper, followed by trial runs on empty trains on M7 trains on the Oyster Bay and Port Jefferson branches. If it’s successful, some trains could run on batteries by next year. The Gothamist explains:The MTA’s battery study will last eight months and will test how long a train can run on batteries, how fast they can be recharged, and how easily a train can switch from battery to electrified third rail power. The test trains are expected to operate using third rail power on the electric section of the line, charging the batteries as they travel, then switch over to the battery-only power along the non-electrified section of track between East Williston and Oyster Bay.[LIRR and Alstom] will determine where exactly the batteries might be located, under seats, on the roof, or under the cars.The MTA will also assess how much power the several-ton diesel trains need to get up hills, as well as safety issues.If the study is successful, commuters who currently take diesel trains could then take a single train – that is, not have to switch – in order to complete their trips.UC Berkeley’s BEACN sustainability consulting group and SolarReviews, a US consumer reviews website for solar panel installation, surveyed more than 400,000 US homeowners who had submitted a request for a quote from SolarReviews.com between 2016 and 2020.They found that the primary motivation for installing solar was potential savings on electricity bills, followed by disaster resilience and reduced emissions. Further, interest in battery storage, specifically for the purpose of energy resilience during natural disasters, is increasing. Of the respondents that have solar, just 11.5% also have a battery storage system installed, but this percentage is expected to increase following a confirmed year-over-year growth since 2016, with 60% of battery installations in the last five years taking place in 2020.The upfront cost of solar is the most significant barrier to install solar, with 72.5% of respondents rating it with a score of “important” or higher. Increased home value was rated as “Important” or higher by 59.8% of respondents.The federal tax credit was the single-most important financial incentive to respondents, followed by net metering.Finally, three months is the most common lead-to-installation timeline. Yet, people who received solar quotes in 2016 were installing solar panels into 2020, debunking the claim that homeowner leads can only convert within a few weeks or months.",solar
2021/04/19,"The US Department of Energy announced the winners of its collegiate competition, the Solar Decathlon, yesterday. The contest, which has been running since 2002, challenges student teams to design and build highly efficient and innovative buildings powered by clean energy.As the US Department of Energy explains in its blog:The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is a collegiate competition that prepares the next generation of building professionals to design and build high-performance, low-carbon buildings powered by renewables. The Design Challenge is a one- to two-semester, design-only competition, while the Build Challenge is a two-year design-build competition.More than 20,000 students have participated in the Decathlon, and many have gone on to become architects, designers, engineers, and researchers at DOE’s National Labs. Students from 72 teams, representing 66 collegiate institutions and 12 countries, competed for top prizes in the 2020 Build Challenge and 2021 Design Challenge during the Competition Event. The Solar Decathlon Competition Event was held over the weekend at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado.Build Challenge participants design and build complete, functional houses in their communities over a two-year period to demonstrate creative solutions for real-world issues.The winner of the 2020 Build Challenge, announced on Sunday by Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, was the University of Colorado, Boulder team. It’s the third time CU Boulder has placed first in the competitive national event over the past 20 years.Granholm said of the winning project:It combines strong architecture and thoughtful market potential and innovative technologies. It showcased energy -efficient performance in its high-altitude cold climate.Participating students from sophomores to PhDs have majors in architectural engineering, engineering plus, environmental design, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, business, and anthropology. Their aim in the contest was to address the housing attainability crisis and construction challenges facing mountain towns across the US.The team created the SPARC House – Sustainability, Performance, Attainability, Resilience, and Community – in Fraser, Colorado, to serve as a replicable example of a high-performance building and an affordable living solution for seasonal and year-round service workers. The team explains its flexible, space-efficient, multi-use floor plan in its market strategy:With energy modeling and thoughtful design, the SPARC House consumes less energy than standard similar homes and is powered by rooftop solar photovoltaics, avoiding mountain community utility costs, which can be higher than the national average. Additionally, smart systems reduce maintenance and recovery costs, reducing the effective price of the home. The SPARC House is a model of an attainable, resilient, and efficient home that meets the needs of all its residents.The SPARC house is already selling energy back to the local power grid, all while temperatures still drop below freezing at night and the new homeowners use it to charge their electric car. In addition to significantly reduced utility costs and modest footprint, it also features an attached rental unit that further addresses housing affordability and attainability in mountain towns. Hannah Blake, project co-lead who graduated in 2020 and is now a mechanical designer at Henderson Engineers in Phoenix, told Electrek:Our project addresses residential attainability issues in mountain towns, but the design strategies and philosophies we implemented are transferable across different building types and climates. The SPARC House sets a precedent for cold-climate, sustainable building design because it proves that achieving zero-energy plus status with an all-electric design is possible with technology that is on the market right now. We want the industry to learn from our success with cold-climate heat pump technology in the coldest town in the US.You can read more about their project here.The 2021 Design Challenge winners were University of Oregon (commercial) and Northwestern University (residential).",solar
2021/04/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Researchers at Purdue University have produced ultrawhite paint to cool buildings, and thus reduce the need for air conditioning. That in turn reduces emissions. The research was just published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.Reflective white paints currently on the market only reflect 80-90% of sunlight and absorb ultraviolet light, so they can’t cool surfaces adequately. But the researchers’ paint can successfully cool buildings, as it reflects 98% of sunlight. (Think about how much money we’d save, too.) The study’s abstract states:During field tests, the BaSO4 [barium sulfate] film stays more than 4.5 °C below ambient temperature or achieves an average cooling power of 117 W/m2. So, if the temperature is 30C (86F), it could drop to 25.5 (78F).The Guardian explains how it works:First, barium sulphate was used as the pigment which, unlike conventional titanium dioxide pigment, does not absorb UV light. Second, a high concentration of pigment was used – 60%.Third, the pigment particles were of varied size. The amount of light scattered by a particle depends on its size, so using a range scatters more of the light spectrum from the sun. Professor Xiulin Ruan, a mechanical engineering professor at Purdue University, pictured above with a sample of the paint, said [via the Guardian]:Our paint can help fight against global warming by helping to cool the Earth – that’s the cool point. Producing the whitest white means the paint can reflect the maximum amount of sunlight back to space.The researchers say the cost of the paint would be similar in price to current white paints, as barium sulphate is cheaper than titanium dioxide. Purdue University and the research team have filed for a patent, and they are working with a large corporation to bring the paint to market within one to two years.Vietnam’s largest wind farm has officially come online.

2021/04/16,"When most Americans think of the infrastructure projects the Biden administration is proposing in the American Jobs Plan, they think of concrete, steel, and labor. But what if the biggest predictor of the success of the infrastructure plan is not in the materials but in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)? Electrek spoke with Monte Zweben, CEO of Splice Machine, a database company that helps utilities and industrial companies implement data, about how AI/ML technologies could determine whether the American Jobs Plan succeeds as the US transitions to clean energy.How will artificial intelligence and machine learning play a role in the development of infrastructure projects included in the American Jobs Plan?As one of the forthcoming technologies of the 21st century, the Biden administration is investing significantly in research and development of American AI and machine learning technologies. US leadership in emerging technologies is critical to ensure economic competitiveness and national security, and AI, along with its myriad applications, is one of the premier research areas of investment.How could AI and machine learning enable utilities to be more resilient in the face of external challenges?As US electrical grids currently stand, there is no way to store energy on the grid, no batteries to hold it. For this to be effective, supply and demand must be equally matched. If energy isn’t consumed, it goes to waste. The introduction of Big Data to the electric industry allows machine learning models to analyze and predict demand with high levels of accuracy and produce supply accordingly. By taking advantage of our ability to analyze data beyond manual comprehension, we can better move electricity along the grid to where it’s most needed. Can you give examples of how AI could improve the transition to clean energy and the upgrade of US electrical grids? While wind and solar intermittency has only started to stress the physical limits of some US electrical grids, requirements for future intermittent assets far exceed existing infrastructure capacity. Better predictive balancing, efficient energy storage, and better integration intelligence will be crucial for future grid reliability. There is no precedent for any human-run balancing at this level of complexity. Only real-time machine learning models that can ingest, store, and analyze petabytes of multi-domain data will enable grid and utility operators and their AI-based advisory systems to keep up with rapidly changing multi-domain data.  Do you think the Biden administration has adequately planned for the incorporation of AI into the American Jobs Plan to ensure success and maximum efficiency?We are hopeful that the Biden administration has adequately planned for the incorporation of AI in the American Jobs Plan. By investing money into research and development in an equitable fashion, questions of bias and fairness in AI will be better answered, and innovation will be greater through increased diversity in the technology sector.Monte Zweben is the CEO and co-founder of Splice Machine.

2021/04/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Superclean Glass is a company that uses a solar panel-cleaning technology developed at Stony Brook University in New York. It’s now a startup mentored by the Clean Energy Business Incubator Program (CEBIP) at Stony Brook.Superclean Glass has created a highly transparent electrodynamic shield that repels dust from solar panels (pictured above). The process can save up to 98% of the energy typically lost on panels subject to the elements, often in dusty regions (think the sunny, dusty US Southwest). The company is housed at the Long Island High Tech Incubator. Here’s a video that explains how the product works:And now, Superclean Glass has been named a finalist in the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) American-Made Solar Prize for 2021. It was one of 10 finalist companies, and it will receive a $100,000 prize and an additional $75,000 in DOE vouchers to test their technologies. The American-Made Solar Prize is a $3 million competition designed by the DOE to revitalize solar manufacturing through a series of contests. In September 2021, two winners from the finalists will be announced at a demo day. These winners will receive an additional $500,000 and up to $75,000 in vouchers to develop and test their prototypes.Facebook has procured enough new clean energy projects to meet 100% of its energy needs at a global scale. That includes its data centers, offices, and even employees’ home offices as everyone went remote during the pandemic. Facebook is one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy. Utility Dive writes:The company has contracts in place for more than 6.1 GW of wind and solar across 18 states and five countries, within the same electric grids that power its data centers and operations. Of the energy contracted, Facebook said it currently has 2 GW of solar and 1.3 GW of wind online, along with 720 MW of energy storage.Anything Facebook hasn’t yet fixed, such as diesel emergency generators or gas stoves in office kitchens, it offsets with carbon credits from forestation project TIST.Now, if they could just get the misinformation spreaders and climate deniers to stop spreading lies on its platform, that would be great.Photo: Stony Brook University",solar
2021/04/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Minnesota’s largest utility, Xcel Energy, announced in May 2019 that it intends to achieve net zero by 2050. On Tuesday, Xcel filed its plans for the largest solar farm in Minnesota with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC).The $575 million, 460 megawatt Sherco solar farm will replace Xcel’s Sherco coal plants (pictured above), in Becker, around 45 miles northwest of Minneapolis. (For scale, Xcel’s largest single-site solar farm in Minnesota at present has a capacity of 100 megawatts.)Xcel plans to bring the Sherco solar plant online in 2024, the same year Xcel intends to shut down the first of three coal-fired generators at Sherco. The final coal plant will be shut down in 2030. The solar plant would create 900 union construction jobs and provide enough electricity for 100,000 households.The Star Tribune points out:Xcel also plans to build a 750-megawatt gas-fired power plant at Sherco in the mid-2020s, although it has drawn considerable opposition from environmental and clean-power advocates.For the record, we at Electrek think building a new gas plant is a very bad idea, too.Two new reports, commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, analyzed the impacts of Illinois adopting zero emission vehicle policies in the state, and both found that it would result in significant benefits. In August 2020, Illinois governor JB Pritzker released a set of principles outlining his agenda for comprehensive energy reform. That report called for Illinois to electrify and decarbonize its transportation sector. Illinois has a goal of net zero by 2050. It’s on track, but its transportation sector has lagged.The Shulock Consulting report finds that the program will help Illinois drivers see significant savings, avoid millions of tons of climate pollution annually, and help improve public health through reductions in smog and toxic air contaminants.The second report, by Synapse Energy Economics, finds that the program would lead to benefits to the state’s economy, including increases in jobs overall.The program will save people who buy new vehicles in model year 2025 an average of $840 over the life of their vehicle, thanks primarily to fuel savings, even when accounting for the incremental technology costs. Under a more aggressive EV program, people buying a new vehicle will save an estimated $2,150 in model year 2030 over the life of their vehicle. In total, Illinois would save $340 million to $2 billion annually by 2040. The range reflects whether automakers meet or exceed the minimum requirements: more electric vehicles mean more savings. Those savings can be invested back into the local economy.Illinois could see an average net annual increase of approximately $413 million in GDP and 5,682 job-years and up to $2.43 billion in GDP and 29,720 job-years over the 2025 to 2040 time period.Photo: Tony Webster/Twitter",solar
2021/04/14,"In the early 2010s, Pat Collins, a 7th-grade life science teacher at Chisago Lakes Middle School — in Lindstrom, Minnesota, about 35 miles northeast of the Twin Cities — was having a discussion about solar panels with his students. One asked why they couldn’t just use solar power at the school, so Collins said he would look into it and see.A few school board meetings that eventually included student speakers (one of whom made her grandfather, a longtime school bus driver, cry from pride), several inventive fundraisers that included janitors paying students by the pound for gum spit into a bucket rather than stuck under desks, and several years later, the Chisago Lakes School District is now 100% solar.“Our students don’t see solar energy as an alternative energy source. It is the energy source that has powered every building that they have ever learned in,” Collins says.In the early 2010’s Chisago Lakes was leading the way, but they’re now one of a growing number of school districts that are using solar not only to save money and reduce their carbon footprints, but to increase learning and vocational opportunities for their students as well.This is thanks in part to Solar in Schools, an initiative of Generation 180, a nonprofit that inspires and equips people to take action on clean energy.When the nearly five-year-old group was starting out, they set out to focus on two of the largest energy consumption and emissions sources: buildings and transportation. “We did a landscape analysis of what was going on to see where we could have impact and also see where there’s a gap that we can fill based on what other nonprofits are focusing on,” says Tish Tablan, Generation 180’s program director. “We landed on schools because we love the ripple effect that schools have — there’s a school in every community.”According to Generation 180, 7,332 K-12 schools, or 5.5% of all public and private K-12 schools in the US, use solar. With a 139% increase in the amount of solar installed since 2014, 5.3 million students attend a school powered with solar today.Tablan says that the work they do to help schools go solar easily and often spread by students going home and talking to their parents or teachers going solar in their homes.Ripple effects have certainly been the case in Chisago County, which has branded itself the Solar Capital of Minnesota where solar now powers 20,000 homes. Thanks to the efforts of Collins and his students, they transformed what started with a two-year, $73,000 effort to install one 10 kW system on the middle school into a fully solar school district. Today all five of the district’s buildings have a 40 kWh solar display on their roofs consisting of about 15,000 panels. It’s hard to nail down the exact savings of the system because prices fluctuate, but solar will save the district between $3 and $6 million over 30 years, which goes back into the district’s general fund.Other schools, like one in Batesville, Arkansas, are using their solar savings to address teacher attrition by raising salaries $2,000 to $3,000 on average.Naturally, cost can be a prohibitive factor for many districts. Solar schools have found a way around them through third-party agreements like power purchase agreements (PPAs). Chisago Lakes got theirs through a six-year lease-to-own agreement. After that, the district owns them outright.It’s not just rural districts that have the luxury of wide-open space to install solar fields that can transform their schools to solar.“It’s not latitude, it’s attitude,” Tablan says, meaning that solar is an option nearly anywhere. New York City has a plan to install solar on the roofs of 50 of its public schools and other buildings.Laura Capps — a passionate parent and self-described product of public schools in Santa Barbara who joined the district’s school board four years ago — began campaigning for the Santa Barbara Unified School District to go solar in 2018.It was then that the city’s schools played an important role during the wildfire and mudslide disasters that devastated the community. During widespread power outages, schools were “where families could still get meals and city and country officials even did their daily briefings from one of the high schools,” Capps says. “It solidified for me and other district leadership that our schools need to be safe havens in the time of disasters.”The district is now in the early stages of creating a microgrid solar system that will both provide and store energy at six sites and provide power alone at eight more sites across high schools, junior high schools, elementary schools, a district office, and a warehouse.“A preschool was our first building. It’s a new building so it made sense to construct it solar-ready,” Capps says. “I like the symbolism of a preschool, that for these 4- and 5-year-old children, solar is what they’re going to know in their lifetime.” – Cinnamon JanzerCinnamon Janzer is a freelance journalist based in Minneapolis.

2021/04/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Electric car owners in the UK will soon be able to charge their cars for free when the countries’ clean energy sources are generating extra solar and wind power. When excess clean energy is available, EV drivers will be sent a notification, 24 hours in advance, about a four-hour “flash window” where charging will be free.Anyone who has ever owned a petrol or diesel car in the UK will know what a big deal this is, costwise. For example, it cost me £60 ($83) to fill up my Volkswagen Golf. It’s a big incentive to switch to an electric car.It will be the UK’s first EV “time-of-use” tariff powered by 100% renewable electricity.Clean power company Good Energy and ZapMap, a UK-wide map of charging points, are partnering to offer the free charging service. The tariff will be enabled by smart metering, and Good Energy will roll out smart EV chargers and an updated app to work alongside the new product. It will initially be launched in beta phase.The flash periods will vary by day.  The Summer Flash Period will run from April to September between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. The Winter Flash Period will run from October to March between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m.Good Energy CEO Juliet Davenport said:Britain generates so much renewable electricity it only makes sense for us all to take advantage of this free resource. The new ‘flash’ tariff will offer people the chance to benefit from free, green power when the wind and sun are strongest. Electric vehicle drivers are already doing their bit for the climate – here’s a chance for them to go one step further and support a truly clean energy grid.ZapMap cofounder Melanie Shufflebotham also said:The electric vehicle market is changing rapidly, and we need to keep up. There will be over 70 pure electric models available to buy in 2021 and the UK now has close to 500,000 plug-in vehicles on the road.This innovative tariff is supporting these seismic shifts by offering drivers a cheaper and greener way of charging their vehicle.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/04/13,"California’s Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) today launched the Community Microgrid Enablement Program. The program will help communities identify, design, and build permanent, multi-customer microgrids that serve critical facilities and vulnerable customer groups.A community microgrid is a group of customers and distributed energy resources such as solar and battery storage within clearly defined electrical boundaries with the ability to disconnect from and reconnect to the grid. These microgrids are designed to serve parts of communities that include community resources, such as hospitals, police and fire stations, gas stations, and grocery stores.Each community microgrid is uniquely designed by the community to address its specific goals and needs. A range of factors determines the size of the microgrid, which community services are served, and which elements are included in the design.PG&E’s new program is approved by the California Public Utilities Commission.The program’s first project is the Redwood Coast Airport Renewable Energy Microgrid. It’s a collaboration among PG&E, the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, Schatz Energy Research Center at Humboldt State University, Humboldt County, and Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, among others.This front-of-the-meter, multi-customer microgrid featuring solar and battery storage is under construction and expected to be up and running by December 2021.The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid will provide renewable energy for 18 customer meters, including the Arcata-Eureka Airport and a US Coast Guard Air Station, and serve as a lifeline for Humboldt County in a natural disaster or other emergency. The microgrid will be capable of disconnecting from the broader grid (known as island mode) and operating as an independent, PG&E grid segment during a planned or unplanned power outage. PG&E will provide technical and financial support on a prioritized basis for qualifying projects in areas with the greatest energy resilience needs. This includes dedicated funding to help meet the resilience needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable communities. Prioritized projects will be those that serve disadvantaged communities, critical facilities such as hospitals, and areas with a higher likelihood of public safety power shutoffs or other significant power outage events, as well as projects with higher levels of renewable energy. PG&E is pretty much constantly in trouble these days. In November 2019, Business Insider noted that its equipment caused more than 1,500 fires in California in six years, destroying countless homes and taking lives. It’s been on criminal probation since January 2017. And just last week, it faced new criminal charges for its role in igniting a 2019 wildfire that burned 120 square miles in Sonoma County north of San Francisco.At the end of March, the Associated Press reported that a federal judge overseeing PG&E’s criminal probation is considering requiring the utility to be more aggressive about turning off its electricity lines near tall trees. That could double the number of power outages for some Northern California counties in the next decade, so it’s good to see PG&E seek solutions – because, frankly, it has to. It simply can’t afford to keep doing what it’s doing, and community microgrids may prove to be one viable solution to the widespread blackouts as more are created.It also announced earlier this year, as Electrek reported, that it will use global energy storage tech company Fluence’s AI-powered Trading Platform in order to optimize its battery energy storage system at Moss Landing in Monterey.

2021/04/13,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Navajo Nation has finalized leases for the Cameron solar farm and the Red Mesa Tapaha Solar Generation Plant.The 200 MW Cameron, which is near the east entrance of Grand Canyon National Park, will generate energy for the Salt River Project, one of Arizona’s largest utilities. It will employ around 400 people during construction and create $109 million in revenue over the next three decades.The 70 MW Red Mesa Tapaha Solar Generation Plant will produce energy for the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and create create $7 million in lease payments over its lifetime. It will create around 300 construction jobs.As Electrek reported in November 2019, the 2,400-MW Navajo Generating Station — the largest coal plant west of the Mississippi River — was shut down, along with the affiliated Kayenta coal mine. The coal plant’s smokestacks were blown up in December 2020 – you can see a video of the demolition here. The tribe currently owns two other solar farms near Kayenta, which were the first (pictured above).Tribal president Jonathan Nez said:Our communities were once heavily dependent on fossil energy, but now we are seeing change.Some of that money will go toward connecting more Navajo families to the grid and lowering energy prices. As Grist wrote in March, the Navajo Nation generates a lot of power, yet 14,000 households out of a total of around 55,000 don’t actually have electricity.The Navajo Nation covers around 17.5 million acres across northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico. It’s the largest land area retained by Native Americans in the US.US president Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan earmarks $16 billion for cleaning up abandoned – known as orphaned – oil wells and mines. This is, as a whole, a win-win: It creates jobs and cleans up methane leaking into the air and oil seeping into the ground.According to the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission, there are 56,600 documented “orphan” wells in the US, and possibly around 746,000 more undocumented orphan wells. Some of these date back to the late 19th century when wells were unregulated, and Pennsylvania has the most by far.Biden’s plan targets orphan wells with either unknown or bankrupt owners.Most states require companies to post bonds to plug their wells if they go bankrupt. But the problem is that the allotted money often falls short, and the states end up paying. There is concern that Biden’s plan leaves the federal government to foot the bill, when the fossil fuel industry ought to clean up its own mess with larger amounts of money to fund capping.Robert Schuwerk, executive director at think tank Carbon Tracker, said [via the Financial Times]:If you need to if you need to get the water out of the bathtub, one of the first things you have to do is shut off the faucet.Are they going to be providing [funds] to states that are trying to address this problem going forward? Or is it just going to go willy-nilly to anybody for jobs?And Clark Williams-Derry, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said:The worry is that the oil and gas industry is going to take this and say: ‘We don’t really have to clean up our act because if we don’t, we know the federal government is going to step in’.Electrek’s Take: Biden’s plan should include a road map for ensuring that negligence doesn’t happen in the future. In other words, clean up, but keep the gas and oil industry on the hook. Fossil fuel companies should be responsible for cleaning up their messes to the greatest extent possible. In the meantime, the owners of those undocumented century-old wells are long dead, so the Biden administration is wise to put people to work to cap them.Photo: Laurel Morales/KJZZ",solar
2021/04/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Irish utility the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) announced on Friday that it would turn Moneypoint coal power station in Clare, western Ireland – Ireland’s only coal-fired power station – into a multibillion-euro green energy hub. It will feature a 1.4-GW floating offshore wind farm built by Equinor off the Clare and Kerry coasts, the Atlantic Ocean’s first offshore wind farm. The Atlantic has the highest average wind speeds in Europe.The wind farm would be wired into the green energy hub, called Green Atlantic @ Moneypoint. It will also feature a deepwater construction yard for the manufacturing and assembly of floating wind turbines; green hydrogen production, storage, and generation; and a giant power management station that will allow for more clean energy on the grid.It is expected to be online within the next 10 years and will supply power to more than more than 1.6 million Irish homes, according to ESB.The project is expected to create hundreds of jobs. The Irish Times notes:With Ireland importing 80% of its energy (oil, coal, and gas), this multibillion investment “turns this figure on its head,” according to ESB chief executive Pat O’Doherty, while allowing Ireland to become a net exporter of renewable energy.The project is in line with Ireland’s goal to reach net zero by 2050.French lawmakers voted on Saturday to ban domestic flights that can be covered by train in under 2.5 hours. The goal is to lower carbon emissions by 40% in 2030 from 1990 levels. France already has high-speed rail in place, and is continuing to construct new lines.The bill goes to the Senate before a final vote in the lower house. It’s expected to pass, as President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling party and allies dominate in the lower house.The French government provided $4.7 billion in support to Air France KLM last week on top of $12.3 billion in government aid it received last year, so it expects not only Air France but all airlines to comply with the effort to reduce emissions.  According to Air Journal, the 2.5-hour threshold would eliminate only five domestic routes: Paris-Bordeaux, Paris-Lyon, Paris-Nantes, Paris-Rennes, and Lyon-Marseille – “representing a total of 12% of passenger traffic (approximately 2.7 million passengers) and 3.5% of CO2 emissions from air travel in France.”Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Europe 1 radio:We know that aviation is a contributor of carbon dioxide and that because of climate change we must reduce emissions.Equally, we must support our companies and not let them fall by the wayside.",solar
2021/04/09,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Last week, we wrote about how the Netherlands’ 24-year-old Irene Vorrink offshore wind farm is being decommissioned. But that’s not on the cards for Egmond aan Zee (pictured, foreground), the Netherlands’ first large-scale offshore wind farm, because, at a middle-aged 15 years old, it still has more power to give. So Noordzeewind, its owner, is going to refurbish it.The 108 MW Egmond aan Zee was initially erected as a demonstration project in 2006. Noordzeewind was originally a joint venture between Swedish power company Vattenfall and oil giant Shell, until Shell became the sole owner of NoordzeeWind just last month.Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas first installed Egmond aan Zee’s 36 V90-3 MW turbines around 10-18 km (6-11 miles) off the North Sea coast and serviced them from 2006 to 2016, and again in 2020. NoordzeeWind is bringing Vestas back to provide maintenance, turbine troubleshooting, and replace components as needed for the rest of the wind farm’s life.NoordzeeWind also just hired European multinational energy asset management company OutSmart to independently operate the wind farm. OutSmart’s managing director Femmy Wervers said:We will do the day-to-day operations of this project. It is our responsibility to ensure HSSE, legal and regulatory compliance, smooth operation of the wind farm, reacting timely on failures, and to ensure contract compliance and coordination with third parties.Electrek’s Take: As we sit on the cusp of a global offshore wind farm boom, it’s informative to see how countries that are experienced in wind power manage different life stages of their offshore wind farms. They’re expected to have a life span of around 25 years. Those planning new projects can learn by watching the management of older projects as they lay out road maps for future offshore wind farms.BlackRock Real Assets, the world’s largest asset manager, has closed Global Renewable Power III (GRP III), a $4.8 billion renewable power investment fund. GRP III was nearly triple the size of Global Renewable Power Fund II (GRP II), which closed at $1.7 billion in July 2017.GRP III is the third in BlackRock’s Global Renewable Power fund series and the fifth fund overall that invests primarily in clean energy globally.GRP III amassed commitments from more than 100 institutional investors, up from 67 for GRP II, according to a BlackRock news release.PVBuzz reports:The Fund has actively begun investing capital and to date has already completed three investments in Europe, Asia, and North America. These investments include onshore wind in Europe, solar in Asia, and distributed solar generation in the US, each project playing a vital role in the region’s road to net zero.And Pensions & Investments points out that “GRP III will also invest in supporting infrastructure, including energy storage, distribution, and electrified transport.”Jim Barry, chief investment officer of BlackRock Alternative Investors and global head of BlackRock Real Assets, said:GRP III invests in the sustainable infrastructure of the future. As the world strives toward net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the transition will have dramatic impacts not only for public equities but for private markets as well, creating significant opportunities for front-footed investors. Photo: Tristan Surtel/Wikimedia Commons",solar
2021/04/08,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Boston-based Clean Energy Ventures, a $110 million venture capital firm that invests in early-stage climate tech startups, is pouring money into the energy storage sector for the first time. The company announced today that it will invest in battery materials (Volexion) and second-life battery recycling (Nth Cycle) startups.Chicago-based Volexion, which is nearly three years old, is a developer of graphene (pictured above) coating for lithium-ion batteries. It is receiving $2.2 million in funding, led by Clean Energy Ventures and Energy Foundry, a Chicago-based venture capital platform that invests in energy innovators. Volexion will use the money to scale its technology and improve battery performance for battery cell manufacturers.Volexion was founded by Professor Mark Hersam, director of the Northwestern University Materials Research Center and a MacArthur Fellow, who discovered that coating battery cathodes with graphene can improve battery performance. Volexion’s graphene coating acts as a protective layer around battery cathode materials to suppress material and electrolyte degradation. Battery cells with Volexion’s coating can see a 30% increase in energy density, 40% increase in power density, and run twice as long as non-coated lithium-ion batteries.Beverly, Massachusetts-based Nth Cycle is a developer of a recycling technology that extracts critical metals from batteries for a second life. It is receiving $3.2 million in seed funding led by Clean Energy Ventures. Nth Cycle will use the money to execute their technology road map and deploy several pilot projects with recyclers and mine operators in early 2022.Nth Cycle uses an environmentally friendly process called electro-extraction to recover cobalt and other minerals from discarded batteries, mining ores, and waste using only electricity and carbon filters. Electro-extraction is a cleaner, lower-cost alternative to the conventional pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes used by battery recyclers and mining companies to recover cobalt, nickel, and manganese for new battery manufacturing. This technology expands the circular supply chain of critical minerals for the clean energy transition. Nth Cycle’s technology was developed at Harvard University and Yale University.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen yesterday released details of a tax hike proposal that would replace fossil fuel subsidies with clean energy incentives. It’s part of President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan. It includes incentives to encourage people to switch to electric vehicles and energy-efficient electric appliances.By eliminating fossil fuel tax breaks, Yellen said it would raise revenues by $35 billion over 10 years. Reuters reports:One of the top fossil fuel breaks is called intangible drilling costs, which allows producers to deduct most costs from drilling new wells. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional panel, has estimated that ditching it could generate $13 billion over 10 years.The Biden tax plan would advance clean electricity production by providing a 10-year extension of the production tax credit and investment tax credit for clean energy generation, such as wind and solar power, and energy storage such as advanced batteries. It also creates a tax incentive for long-distance transmission lines to ease movement of electricity from clean energy generators.The plan would restore a tax on polluters to pay for Environmental Protection Agency costs associated with Superfund toxic waste sites, addressing harm caused by fossil fuel production.And even though the fossil fuel industry is protesting as expected, Bloomberg reports, as per the Treasury, that eliminating its subsidies would impact only profits: Research suggests little impact on gasoline or energy prices for US consumers and little impact on our energy security.US community solar website PowerMarket has redesigned their website.

2021/04/07,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In March, Texas grid operator ERCOT’s wind power generation smashed its previous record. Wind topped 10.4 million megawatt-hours (MWh) during the month, which is 2 million MWh above its previous high set in December 2020, according to data from the Energy Information Administration’s hourly electric grid monitor.That output pushed wind’s share of the ERCOT electricity market to 38.6% and the No. 1 spot in total generation. It’s another first for the rapidly expanding resource, according to a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) analyst Dennis Wamsted, which was emailed to Electrek by IEEFA.For March, solar generation topped 1 million MWh, a level it had only reached three times previously, in June, July, and August 2020. Combined, wind and solar accounted for 42.4% of ERCOT’s output during the month, well ahead of gas, at 30%, and coal, at just 14.9%.This sharp jump in output is a result of normal spring winds and the continuing buildout of ERCOT’s wind and solar capacity. ERCOT’s latest capacity installation report, released in February, projected that there would be 29,447 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity operating in ERCOT by the end of March, an increase of 2,343 MW from February. Solar was forecast to climb to 5,649 MW from 4,473 MW in February.ERCOT estimates that more than 12,000 MW of solar capacity could be installed within its service territory, and the amount of wind could top 35,000 MW by the end of 2021. Even more capacity is expected going into 2022. Texas is the US leader for wind energy, and its solar capacity is rocketing – whether Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX) likes it or not.The UK’s National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) announced yesterday that the country’s grid emissions fell to a record low on Easter Monday. Carbon intensity dropped to 39 grams per unit at around 1 p.m., the lowest the National Grid has recorded to date. The previous record of 46g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour was set on May 24, 2020.Sunny spells and windy conditions, coupled with low demand, contributed to the UK grid’s new record.Wind power made up 39% of the UK’s mix, solar came in at 21%, and nuclear accounted for 16%. Gas provided 10% of power, and coal generated no power on the grid.Fintan Slye, director at National Grid ESO, said:This latest record is another example of how the grid continues to transform at an astonishing rate as we move away from fossil-fuel generation and harness the growth of renewable power sources.It’s an exciting time and the progress we’re seeing with these records underlines the significant strides we’re taking towards our ambition of being able to operate the system carbon free by 2025.If you want to see what the UK is using on its grid in real time, the free National Grid ESO carbon intensity app shows live data on its electricity generation mix and new records.

2021/04/06,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The world added more than 260 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity in 2020, compared to the addition of 176 GW in 2019, according to data released yesterday by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in the report, “Renewable Capacity Statistics 2020.” The growth occurred despite the economic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.IRENA’s press release says that “renewables’ rising share of the total is partly attributable to net decommissioning of fossil fuel power generation in Europe, North America, and for the first time, across Eurasia (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation, and Turkey).”Solar and wind power led the growth, with 127 GW and 111 GW of new installations, respectively. And interestingly, the world’s two worst polluting countries also led in clean energy installations. China, which is already also the world’s largest renewables market, added 72 GW of wind and 49 GW of solar. The US installed 15 GW of solar and around 14 GW of wind – nearly 80% more than in 2019. Hydropower still accounts for the largest share (1,211 GW) of global clean energy, at more than 43%, although solar and wind are catching up fast. Bioenergy’s net capacity expansion fell by half in 2020 (2.5 GW compared to 6.4 GW in 2019). Geothermal energy saw very little capacity added in 2020; and off-grid capacity grew by 365 MW in 2020 (2%) to reach 10.6 GW. IRENA director-general Francesco La Camera said:Our 1.5 degree outlook shows significant planned energy investments must be redirected to support the transition if we are to achieve 2050 goals. In this critical decade of action, the international community must look to this trend as a source of inspiration to go further.South Dakota’s state government is considering whether to make more money available in the state to help underwrite more fast-charging stations along I-90 (which runs east to west) and I-29 (which runs north to south). The state Board of Minerals and Environment approved seven grants for charging stations in December. South Dakota’s current plan calls for 5% of the VW emissions scandal money to go into charging stations, and it wants to boost it to 15%. It’s currently taking public comment, and according to Keloland, Tim Jensen of Spearfish Motors (a GMC dealer whose main homepage image is of the GMC Hummer EV SUV) wrote:Being in a heavy tourism area and on I-90 it is a great location to take care of the future EV needs of the public.Mount Rushmore is off I-90 at Rapid City, which is around 45 minutes east of Spearfish.North Dakota installed nine chargers last year, so Robert Moffitt, coordinator of North Dakota Clean Cities, pointed out:Until this funding opportunity, the state had no fast chargers. Several of these are along I-29, if SD adds some along this highway, it will create a corridor for EV travel.South Dakota is among the US states with the fewest number of EV charging outlets.",solar
2021/04/05,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):A new study about the impacts of offshore wind farms on recreational fishing – specifically, Rhode Island’s Block Island, the US’s first offshore wind farm – found that anglers who had fished there reported that the wind farm was beneficial.The study, by Tiffany Smythe of the United States Coast Guard Academy, and David Bidwell and Grant Tyler of the University of Rhode Island, is titled, “Optimistic with reservations: The impacts of the United States’ first offshore wind farm on the recreational fishing experience.” It was published in the journal Marine Policy. The authors point out that there has been a lot of focus on the impacts of offshore wind farms on commercial fishing, but few on recreational fishing.As US offshore wind farms grow in numbers, this study should prove to be a useful reference in permitting processes.Interview findings revealed anglers’ enjoyment of the [offshore wind farms] as an enhanced fishing location, due to catch and non-related aspects of the experience. Anglers also reported concerns about increased crowding around the [offshore wind farms] and raised concerns about potential fishing access restrictions around this and future projects. Survey data confirms that anglers, particularly those who fished at the wind farm, believe the wind farm has benefitted fishing. Respondents also value the wind farm as symbolic of progress towards green energy.Dave Monti of the Sun Chronicle in Massachusetts writes:I am not aware of any fishing restrictions that have occurred at the Block Island Wind Farm since it became operational in December 2016 except during limited maintenance periods to ensure work crew and boater safety.Going forward, the authors recommend “conducting social science research to enhance understanding of ocean users, managing issues like crowding and access, and considering the benefits of nearshore [offshore wind farms] for anglers and other stakeholders.”The world’s largest solar company by market capitalization, China’s LONGi Green Energy Technology, which manufactures monocrystalline silicon wafers, is entering the hydrogen market.Xi’an Longi Hydrogen Technology Co. was registered on March 31 in China, according to Solarzoom.

He also said his company plans for the long term.“We don’t only look at today, but also three, five years later or even eight or 10 years later,” he said. “After finding the direction, we don’t begrudge money on research and development.”",solar
2021/04/02,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Dutch have been using wind power for so long that it’s time to decommission the Irene Vorrink wind farm this year. The first-generation Irene Vorrink wind farm, named after a Dutch Labour Party politician who died in 1996, has been operational since 1997.The 16.8 MW project (pictured above) features 28 Nordtank NTK600/43 wind turbines that stand in a long row, close to the shore of Lake IJsselmeer, in an average water depth of 16 feet (5 meters). The site is owned and operated by Swedish power company Vattenfall.The site will be be repowered as part of the Windplanblauw project, which is being jointly developed by Vattenfall and wind cooperative SwifterwinT. Windplanblauw is expected to be online from 2023 and capable of powering around 400,000 households.4COffshore reports on Windplanblauw’s details:In total, 74 older turbines (28 of which are from Irene Vorrink) will be replaced with 61 new and more powerful ones. SwifterwinT will develop the onshore turbines and Vattenfall and SwifterwinT will develop the nearshore turbines together. The project is expected to yield 250 MW.The life span of a wind turbine is currently around 25 years, depending on maintenance quality and environmental factors. (The oldest operating wind turbine is currently Tvindkraft in Denmark, which is now 43.)Where do wind turbines go when they die? Technically, wind turbines are 85-90% recyclable, but their blades are currently challenging to break down. Further, blade recycling efforts have been hampered by a failure to match recovered materials to supply chain needs and end products The Energy Transition Alliance just released a UK-focused report, “Sustainable Decommissioning: Wind Turbine Blade Recycling,” and also made a short, informative video about a number of creative future options for recycling wind turbines:The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has upheld As You Sow’s shareholder proposal asking Chevron for clear and transparent accounting of how a net-zero greenhouse gas by 2050 scenario will affect its operations and performance. As You Sow is a nonprofit organization that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy, coalition building, and innovative legal strategies.The proposal requests that Chevron issue an audited report to shareholders on whether and how the significant reduction in fossil fuel demand in the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario will affect the company’s financial position going forward.Chevron fought the proposal at the SEC, arguing that its third Climate Change Resilience Report, issued this year, meets the request, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, said:We agree with the SEC that Chevron has not yet addressed the critical issue of whether and how a significant reduction in fossil fuel demand from the world’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050 will affect its future financial position and the value of its assets.It is critical that the company disclose the expected climate-related impacts on its operations and performance, especially those which put the company and investors at risk.

2021/04/01,"GE Renewable Energy has made an agreement with Chicago-based Invenergy, a global clean energy developer and operator, to provide wind turbines for the 1.48 gigawatt North Central Wind Energy Facilities in Oklahoma.The North Central Wind Energy Facilities project is a group of three wind farms in north central Oklahoma. GE will deliver 492 2.X-127s and 39 2.X-116 turbines. According to GE Renewable Energy’s press release:The three wind farms are the 999-megawatt Traverse Wind Energy Center, the 287-megawatt Maverick Wind Energy Center, and the 199-megawatt Sundance Wind Energy Center. Maverick and Sundance will be completed in 2021 and Traverse in 2022.The Traverse Wind Energy Center will become the largest wind farm in the US if it goes online as scheduled.Tim White, GE Renewable Energy’s CEO, Onshore Americas, said:GE Renewable Energy is delighted to be a part of this exciting endeavor, which is the largest combined onshore wind project in GE’s history. We have a long partnership with Invenergy and AEP and look forward to working closely with them to help bring a significant amount of affordable, sustainable energy to the region. The project will be owned by Columbus, Ohio-headquartered utility American Electric Power (AEP)‘s subsidiaries, Public Service Co. of Oklahoma (PSO) and Southwestern Electric Power Co. (SWEPCO). According to Power Magazine:‘PSO will own 45.5% and SWEPCO will own 54.5% of the project, which will cost approximately $2 billion,’ AEP said. According to AEP, PSO received approval from Oklahoma regulators and SWEPCO received approval from regulators in Arkansas and Louisiana to acquire the North Central Wind Energy Facilities on a fixed-cost turnkey basis at completion in 2020. Both the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the flex-up option, agreeing to acquire the Texas portion, which the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) of Texas denied.In June 2020, AEP CEO Nicholas Akins said in a statement about Texas’ denial [via Power Engineering]:We are disappointed that our SWEPCO customers in Texas will not be able to benefit from the low-cost wind energy the North Central projects will provide.The regulatory approvals we have received in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will allow us to move ahead with the North Central wind projects at full scale, saving our customers in those states approximately $3 billion over the next 30 years. The Texas PUC has been in the news a lot this year.

The online vehicle rental company enables IKEA to rent e-trucks on a flexible schedule. Ingka Investments, the investment arm of IKEA parent company Ingka Group, became a minority stakeholder of Fluid Truck in March 2021. Steven Moelk, project implementation manager at IKEA US, explains:Independent contractors operate 90% of the delivery vehicles on the road today. Giving them access to electric trucks without becoming cost-burdened enables brands like us the ability to advance our sustainability and delivery commitments even when we don’t own or control vehicles that operate in our supply chain.The IKEA NYC fleet is currently comprised of Lightning eMotors Class 4 commercial box trucks and Workhorse C1000 trucks. The Lightning Class 4 box trucks feature 129 kWh of battery capacity, a range of 120 miles, and a top speed of 65 mph. The C1000 – it’s 1,000 cubic feet – has a 70 kWh battery (4 modules), a range of 100 miles, and a top speed of 75 mph. IKEA’s next home delivery electric truck goal is to put 50 of them on the road in Los Angeles. The Swedish retail giant is working on creating charging infrastructure at its LA stores, and e-trucks will be delivered to Burbank in May 2021, and then to Covina and Costa Mesa.IKEA has pledged to reach net zero on its home deliveries by 2025.The US transition to clean energy will pick up pace over the next two to three years, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) in its new report, “US Power Sector Outlook 2021.” While IEEFA, which examines energy markets, trends, and policies, isn’t telling us anything shocking, especially under the Biden administration, its confirmation of clean energy’s upward trajectory is good to read when we’ve been seeing reports about greenwashing by banks and a lack of energy companies’ definitive road maps to net zero.Solar and battery storage adoption is seeing almost exponential growth, and wind and solar improvements have helped turn the two into the least expensive option across the US.The increase in clean energy is happening largely at the expense of coal. Wind capacity has doubled since 2012, and solar capacity has doubled since 2016. Utility-scale wind and solar accounted for more than 10% of total US electricity generation in 2020 for the first time.IEEFA’s analysis expects that coal’s share of the US energy sector still could fall to 10% by 2025. It also expects natural gas to plateau (see page 24 in the report).IEEFA uses Texas as a good case study (see page 5 in the report) of shifts in the electricity sector, despite Governor Greg Abbott’s (R-TX) pro-fossil-fuel stance (and it addresses the “big freeze” in February). The Lone Star State is No. 1 in wind, and solar is growing rapidly there.At the end of 2011, Texas’s installed wind capacity was 9,603 megawatts (MW), making up 8.5% of the region’s electricity demand. By the end of 2020, installed wind capacity had climbed to 25,121 MW, reaching a 22.8% market share. Coal generation, which had accounted for 39% of electricity needs in 2011, fell to 17.9% in 2020. The Texas transition will not be replicated precisely in other areas of the country, but the broad themes are certainly going to hold true, particularly the surge in new wind and solar generation through 2024.",solar
2021/03/31,"The Biden administration has published its $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which is called The American Jobs Plan, on the White House website. He’ll discuss the plan today in a speech in Pittsburgh.It’s extremely comprehensive – and that’s an understatement – so we pulled out the clean energy overview in a quick roundup here.The New York Times points out:Officials said that, if approved, the spending in the plan would end decades of stagnation in federal investment in research and infrastructure — and would return government investment in those areas, as a share of the economy, to its highest levels since the 1960s.How it’s funded. The spending in the plan will take place over eight years. “The President’s tax plan will ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes by increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%… This will help fund critical investments in infrastructure, clean energy, R&D, and more to maintain the competitiveness of the United States and grow the economy.” (Yes, corporate are already howling about how this tax increase will hurt jobs.) Trump cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.Spur jobs modernizing power generation and delivering clean electricity. “President Biden is proposing a 10-year extension and phase down of an expanded direct-pay investment tax credit and production tax credit for clean energy generation and storage. These credits will be paired with strong labor standards to ensure the jobs created are good-quality jobs with a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively.”And, it will use the federal government’s incredible purchasing power to drive clean energy deployment across the market by purchasing 24/7 clean power for federal buildings. To ensure that we fully take advantage of the opportunity that modernizing our power sector presents, President Biden will establish an Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity Standard (EECES) aimed at cutting electricity bills and electricity pollution, increasing competition in the market, incentivizing more efficient use of existing infrastructure, and continuing to leverage the carbon pollution-free energy provided by existing sources like nuclear and hydropower.Build next-generation industries in distressed communities. “President Biden believes that the market-based shift toward clean energy presents enormous opportunities for the development of new markets and new industries.”For example, by pairing an investment in 15 decarbonized hydrogen demonstration projects in distressed communities with a new production tax credit, we can spur capital-project retrofits and installations that bolster and decarbonize our industry.The President’s plan also will establish 10 pioneer facilities that demonstrate carbon capture retrofits for large steel, cement, and chemical production facilities, all while ensuring that overburdened communities are protected from increases in cumulative pollution.And to accelerate responsible carbon capture deployment and ensure permanent storage, President Biden’s plan reforms and expands the bipartisan Section 45Q tax credit, making it direct pay and easier to use for hard-to-decarbonize industrial applications, direct air capture, and retrofits of existing power plants.Put union building trade workers to work upgrading homes and businesses to save families money. “President Biden’s plan also will establish a $27 billion Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to mobilize private investment into distributed energy resources; retrofits of residential, commercial and municipal buildings; and clean transportation. These investments have a particular focus on disadvantaged communities that have not yet benefited from clean energy investments.”Establish the United States as a leader in climate science, innovation, and R&D. “The President is calling on Congress to invest $35 billion in the full range of solutions needed to achieve technology breakthroughs that address the climate crisis and position America as the global leader in clean energy technology and clean energy jobs.”Jumpstart clean energy manufacturing through federal procurement. “To meet the President’s goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the United States will need more electric vehicles, charging ports, and electric heat pumps for residential heating and commercial buildings.”The President is calling on Congress to enable the manufacture of [electric vehicles], ports, pumps, and clean materials, as well as critical technologies like advanced nuclear reactors and fuel, here at home through a $46 billion investment in federal buying power, creating good-paying jobs and reinvigorating local economies, especially in rural areas.Job creation. Biden “is calling for a $40 billion investment in a new Dislocated Workers Program and sector-based training. This funding will ensure comprehensive services for workers, who have lost jobs through no fault of their own, to gain new skills and to get career services they need with in-demand jobs.” This includes clean energy.President Biden also will call upon Congress to ensure that new jobs created in clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure are open and accessible to women and people of color.He is asking Congress to tie federal investments in clean energy and infrastructure to prevailing wages and require transportation investments to meet existing transit labor protections.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in response to the plan:The release of these critical infrastructure priorities is just the beginning of a long policymaking process over the coming weeks and months that will require continued focus and determination on the part of elected officials.In line with the president’s emphasis on high-quality jobs, an upcoming jobs study will show that solar has a unionization rate of 10.3%, which is substantially more than previously estimated and higher than the economy-wide average. These union jobs, along with numerous other career-sustaining jobs in solar, offer another moment to prioritize equity and create opportunities in every community, regardless of zip code, including for fossil fuel workers who are looking to continue their careers in the energy sector. We look forward to working with the administration and bipartisan members of Congress to enact policies that generate the kind of economic growth and climate solutions we are all striving to achieve.As I mentioned above, The American Jobs Plan is absolutely massive. And this is only the first half of the plan.Public domestic investment as a share of the economy has fallen by more than 40% since the 1960s. The American Jobs Plan will invest in America in a way we have not invested since we built the interstate highways and won the Space Race.There will of course be a lot of pushback and shouting about taxes from many groups and legislators, and a whole lot of horse trading. (The Business Council for Sustainable Energy were excited, though.) We at Electrek are very excited and intrigued to see where this leads. We want to see a huge push in clean energy, clean energy jobs, and emissions reduction. And we believe that it’s going to take a gargantuan effort like this – and yes, it has to come with a gargantuan price tag. But you know what would cost even more? Doing nothing. And neglecting this since the 1960s is precisely why it costs so much now.",solar
2021/03/31,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):New research published by C40 Cities, “a network of the world’s megacities [metropolitan areas with a population of more than 10 million people] committed to addressing climate change,” titled “The Future of Public Transport,” reports that green investment in global public transport systems will not only safeguard existing jobs, but will also create millions of sustainable jobs and cut emissions from the transport sector in cities by more than 50% in the next decade.The pandemic hit public transport hard due to the need for social distancing. So it makes sense that globally, C40 mayors (that’s nearly 100 international mayors); the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which represents 20 million transport workers; and numerous unions and environmental groups are demanding that governments provide stimulus funding for public transport and infrastructure in order to address the climate crisis, drive economic stimulus, and create millions of jobs.Page 27 of the report states about electrification [Electrek editor’s note: We would have liked to have seen it featured more prominently in the report]:The electrification of public transport is also happening at a significantly faster pace than the electrification of private vehicles in cities. Whilst the sales of electric cars are rapidly growing,electric cars made up just 2.6% of sales in 2019 and 1% of global car stock.Virtually all city light rail and metro systems now operate using electricity and great strides are being made in bus electrification.At least eight C40 cities are currently procuring only electric buses and at least 29 have set ambitious targets for all new buses to be electric from 2025.This matches the most ambitious national commitments for the phasing out of new fossil fuel cars, and is well in advance of the ambitious 2030 date set by an increasing number of countries. As the pace of bus electrification continues at a higher rate than private vehicle electrification, the resulting climate benefits of public transport over private vehicles will continue to increase.In the conclusion, the report states:Specifically, financial support should be conditioned on compliance with science-based targets for emission reductions and transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement.C40 chair and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said:This report solidifies what mayors already know: Any recovery from COVID-19 must be green, just, fair, and driven by investments in public transportation that will help create jobs, reduce emissions, and lift up our most vulnerable residents.And in a just-released American Jobs Plan from the Biden administration, it states about public transit:President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $85 billion to modernize existing transit and help agencies expand their systems to meet rider demand.President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $80 billion to address Amtrak’s repair backlog; modernize the high traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors and connect new city pairs; and enhance grant and loan programs that support passenger and freight rail safety, efficiency, and electrification.The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has just released a set of US policy recommendations – “Charging Forward” and “Heavy-Duty Fleet Electrification” – that provide insight into the linchpin of truck electrification: charging infrastructure.Recommendations based on Gladstein, Neandross & Associates’ research for EDF found that electrifying heavy-duty trucks is achievable with existing technology if two key strategies are implemented: Managed charging allows fleets to use real-time data like grid load and electricity cost to determine optimum charging schedules and will be a critical strategy to reduce the cost of transitioning to electric fleets. The study analyzed one year of real-world trip data from 50 Class 8  NFI trucks and 42 Class 8 Schneider trucks, both operating in California, to evaluate the trip capabilities of electric trucks, the requirements and costs of charging systems, and the impact of managed charging and onsite distributed energy resources.The reports also outline cost estimates for upfront infrastructure costs required for electrification and annual fuel savings estimates by electrification for NFI and Schneider.Pamela MacDougall, senior manager, grid modernization at EDF, told Electrek:It’s clear that vehicle grid integration together with onsite distributed energy resources (DERs) are key to getting the economics right for heavy-duty truck charging and ensuring long-term grid stability.In the short term, additional support for infrastructure is necessary to ensure these fleets are able to meet their transition targets without being overly burdened with high charging infrastructure costs.You can read MacDougall’s blog about the reports here.",solar
2021/03/29,"The White House today announced an ambitious plan to expand offshore wind farms along the US East Coast.The White House website reports:National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met today with state officials, industry executives, and labor leaders to announce new leasing, funding, and goals that employ President Biden’s whole-of-government approach, position America to lead a clean energy revolution, and create thousands of jobs across the country with the choice to join a union.Today I met with @SecGranholm, @SecRaimondo, @SecretaryPete and @ginamccarthy46 to discuss how we can safely advance offshore wind to help build a clean energy economy. We must all work together to transition to a brighter future for everyone. https://t.co/BBvre7wdcjThe plan would generate 30 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030. This is a big deal because the US currently only has one offshore wind farm online – Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island. Vineyard Wind 1, off Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, is expected to achieve a formal authorization in April, reach financial close in the second half of 2021, and go live in late 2023. And this will provide a big boost to those already being planned, as well as new projects.The offshore wind farm plan is outlined on the whitehouse.gov website. It includes:The announcement then lists details for each of those three steps of how the plan will be implemented. The Washington Post summarized the details:[S]etting concrete deadlines for reviewing and approving permit applications; establishing a new wind energy area in the waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast; investing $230 million upgrade [to] US ports; and providing $3 billion in potential loans for the offshore wind industry through the Energy Department [DOE].The program also instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] to share physical and biological data with Ørsted, a Danish offshore wind development firm, about the US waters where it holds leases. NOAA will grant $1 million to help study the impact of offshore wind operations on fishing operators as well as coastal communities.The National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, a joint project of DOE and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, will also give $8 million in research grants to 15 offshore wind research and development projects.This form of renewable energy provides a great opportunity for jobs because they need regular operations and maintenance. The Biden administration says “more than 44,000 workers [will be] employed in offshore wind by 2030 and nearly 33,000 additional jobs in communities supported by offshore wind activity.”Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said:This… goal is proof of our commitment to using American ingenuity and might to invest in our nation, advance our own energy security, and combat the climate crisis. DOE is going to marshal every resource we have to get as many American companies, using as many sheets of American steel, employing as many American workers as possible in offshore wind energy — driving economic growth from coast to coast.Environmental Working Group president Ken Cook released a statement once the news was released:Now the private sector and federal government will be partners in the urgent transition from fossil fuels and reach the president’s target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035.",solar
2021/03/29,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Power from new wind and solar farms in 2020 (+315 TWh) helped force a record fall in global coal power (-346 TWh). But that happened because the pandemic slowed the world’s rising demand for electricity, according to a new report from London-based energy and climate research group Ember.According to Ember:Wind and solar now supply almost a tenth of global electricity, mirrored across many G20 countries, including India (9%), China (9.5%), Japan (10%), Brazil (11%), the US (12%), and Turkey (12%). Europe is leading the way, with Germany at 33% and the United Kingdom at 29%, giving confidence in how wind and solar can be quickly built and integrated into the electricity system.The growth in wind and solar helped push coal power to a record fall of 4% (-346 TWh). However, models from the International Energy Agency show that coal power must fall by 14% every year to keep the world on track for 2050 net-zero emissions. As electricity demand growth picks up again, wind and solar will need to significantly accelerate to ensure that coal continues to fall.In 2020, China was the only country that increased coal generation because electricity demand increased sharply. Despite that, the country has declared that it will reach net zero by 2060.China has successfully increased access to electricity; per capita demand is now above the United Kingdom and Italy. Over half of the increase in demand since 2015 was met by clean sources, but 39% was met with coal.The four largest coal-generating countries after China all saw coal power decline in 2020: India (-5%), the United States (-20%), Japan (-1%), and South Korea (-13%). In 2020, China was responsible for more than half (53%) of the world’s coal-fired electricity.And emissions were still around 2% higher in 2020 than in 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed.Dave Jones, Ember’s global lead, said:Progress is nowhere near fast enough. Despite coal’s record drop during the pandemic, it still fell short of what is needed. Coal power needs to collapse by 80% by 2030 to avoid dangerous levels of warming above 1.5 degrees. We need to build enough clean electricity to simultaneously replace coal and electrify the global economy. World leaders have yet to wake up to the enormity of the challenge.Uber passengers in central London can now request electric cars. Uber Green launches today for trips that originate in Central London, i.e., Zone 1. Customers can choose an EV over hybrid, diesel, or gas. The program will eventually roll out in further zones in London, and Uber Green will launch in 60 European cities and across the US by the end of 2021.The Financial Times reports:Uber will offer drivers of fully electric vehicles a reduced service fee of 15% as an incentive. Only 1,600 Uber drivers in London have electric vehicles, out of a fleet of about 45,000.‘With cities beginning to open up once again, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to drive a green recovery by ensuring that every car on the Uber app in London is fully electric,’ said Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe.In 2020, Uber signed a deal with Nissan to provide 2,000 Leafs to Uber drivers at below-market rates for rent or purchase. Uber’s target is to be electric by 2030 in Europe and North America, and fully electric by 2040.Lyft, which runs in the US and Canada, has also said it will move to a fully electric fleet by 2030.",solar
2021/03/26,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced yesterday that it intends to “cut the cost of solar energy by 60% within the next 10 years, in addition to nearly $128 million in funding to lower costs, improve performance, and speed the deployment of solar energy technologies.”The new goal moves forward its previous utility-scale solar cost target by five years. This DOE announcement is part of the Biden administration’s plan to decarbonize the US power sector by 2035.The DOE writes:To reach that goal in the next 15 years, hundreds of gigawatts of solar energy need to be installed as much as five times faster than it is now. To that end, DOE is accelerating its utility-scale solar 2030 cost target by five years – setting a new goal of driving down the current cost of 4.6 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to 3 cents/kWh by 2025 and 2 cents/kWh by 2030.Funding announced through DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO – and right on its front page are funding opportunities, resources, and research areas) will support advancing materials used to make solar cells [via the DOE website]: $40 million for perovskite R&D: Perovskites are a family of emerging solar materials that have potential to make highly efficient thin-film solar cells with very low production costs. The DOE is awarding $40 million to 22 projects that will advance perovskite PV device and manufacturing research and development — as well as performance through the formation of a new $14 million testing center to provide neutral, independent validation of the performance of new perovskite devices.$3 million Perovskite Startup Prize: This new prize competition will speed entrepreneurs’ paths to commercializing perovskite technologies by providing seed capital for their newly formed companies.$20 million for CdTe thin films: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will set up a consortium to advance cheaper CdTe thin-film solar technologies, which were developed in the US and make up 20% of the modules installed in this country. This consortium will advance low-cost manufacturing techniques and domestic research capabilities to increase opportunities for US workers and entrepreneurs to capture a larger portion of the $60 billion global solar manufacturing sector.  The DOE also announced $7 million as part of a new funding opportunity for projects to increase the lifetime of silicon-based PV systems from about 30 years to 50 years to lower the cost of energy and reduce waste. The aim is to improve PV system components, such as inverters, connectors, cables, racks, and trackers.Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm stated:In many parts of the country, solar is already cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels, and with more innovation we can cut the cost again by more than half within the decade.This first burst of funding will help us add even more affordable clean energy to the grid, jobs to communities across the country, and will put us on the fast track toward President Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.The solar sector now boasts one of the fastest-growing job rates in the US and is expected to be the country’s leading source of new electricity generation this year. This is really exciting. It reminds me of James Montgomery Flagg’s “I want you for the US Army” Uncle Sam poster from both world wars. It’s a call to arms, but for solar innovation. And the DOE is using creative ways to encourage Americans to rise to the occasion. If you click on the “$40 million to 22 projects” link above, you get to see all the exciting projects that are underway at universities and other organizations. And the startup prize resembles clean energy and EV projects in the private sector, such as at Elemental Excelerator, where Electrek recently spoke with Danielle J. Harris, director of mobility innovation (who are taking applications for cohort 10 right now).Necessity is the mother of invention, right? It’s a great time to be a clean energy entrepreneur or researcher. I can’t wait to see what comes out of this call for green energy greatness.",solar
2021/03/26,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Water supply is tricky stuff in California, as the state has a constant threat of drought. The California State Water Project is one of the largest public water and power utilities in the world. It includes more than 700 miles of canals. And that’s just one part of California’s canals – there are nearly 4,000 miles in total.So scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz have just figured out a win-win for both California’s water canals and green energy: Build over-canal solar photovoltaic arrays, which they detailed in the study, “Energy and water co-benefits from covering canals with solar panels,” published in Nature Sustainability.The paper is a feasibility study, but it has the potential to be a tangible solution, because, as the study states:Case studies of over-canal solar photovoltaic arrays have demonstrated enhanced photovoltaic performance due to the cooler microclimate next to the canal. In addition, shade from the photovoltaic panels has been shown to mitigate evaporation and potentially mitigate aquatic weed growth.Plus, the panels don’t have to occupy new land. The scientists analyzed three different configurations for eight different sites:The three solar PV structures included a ground-mounted system, a steel-truss canal-spanning design that has been deployed in Gujarat, India, and a suspension-cable canal-spanning design that has been deployed in Punjab, India.Our financial performance analysis included net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) comparisons of over-canal to ground-mounted designs. Our design comparisons considered enhanced PV performance due to evaporative cooling and avoided costs for water and aquatic weed mitigation.The study showed there wasn’t a big difference between the three project types when it came to LCOE:This is because in the case of the over-canal designs, the increases in the annual costs were proportional to the increases in annual energy output, due to evaporative cooling.Researchers recommend that the next step should be pilot projects or initial field experiments. Michael Kiparsky, director of the Wheeler Water Institute at the UC Berkeley School of Law, summed up the significance of putting solar over canals [via Wired]:You’re taking something that’s already been altered by human activity and doubling up on the benefits it provides. That’s the profound piece.US Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Representative Alan Lowenthal (D-CA) yesterday introduced the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act in Congress. Simply put, the bill has three aims:Or in a slightly more elaborate explanation, Merkley’s website explains the bill’s aim:The legislation would reduce plastic production, increase recycling, and protect frontline and fenceline communities from the burden of toxic emissions from plastic waste by changing the incentives of the industry. The bill would shift the burden of cleanup to the corporations that produced the plastics so they have financial motivation to end the burning and dumping; strengthening environmental justice protections; eliminating waste export loopholes; and extending across the nation existing laws that have been proven to work on the state and local level, among other steps.Merkley, who serves as the chair of the Environment and Public Works subcommittee overseeing environmental justice and chemical safety, said:Plastic pollution is a full-blown environmental and health crisis, and it’s time that we pass this legislation to get it under control.The bill is endorsed by over 500 groups. This short documentary from award-winning activist, filmmaker, and cofounder of the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement, Stiv Wilson, explains it best.

2021/03/25,"Singapore-based solar energy provider Sunseap says it has completed construction of a 5MW peak offshore floating solar farm in the Straits of Johor, between Singapore and Malaysia. It’s one of the world’s largest floating solar farms on sea water.If a country is land-scarce and wants to build solar farms, it will often turn to floating solar farms. And Singapore has that challenge, as it’s heavily urbanized. But floating solar farms are typically built inland, in bodies of water such as reservoirs and lakes. Building in the sea has special challenges, such as avoiding shipping routes and barnacles, but interest in floating solar in oceans is growing.This floating solar farm is off the coast of Woodlands in northern Singapore (pictured above). Renewable Energy Magazine details Woodland’s statistics:Sunseap said the floating solar farm at Woodlands took close to a year to set up amid movement restrictions during the COVID-19 lockdown. It involved a total of 13,312 panels, 40 inverters and more than 30,000 floats. The installation is expected to produce an estimated 6,022,500 kilo-watt hours (kWh) of energy per year, potentially offsetting an estimated 4,258 tons of carbon dioxide.The solar farm is equipped with electrical panels, control systems and a 22kV transformer. It is also a landing point for the subsea cable that transmits the  generated power to the national grid. The floating PV system is designed with a robust constant tension mooring system that is able to withstand changing weather conditions, keeping the platform and all of the operational equipment on board steady.  There  is also an air-conditioned  second deck that doubles-up as a visitor center and viewing gallery.Singapore’s Public Utilities Board (PUB) National Water Agency is also constructing a 60MW floating solar farm on Tengeh Reservoir, also in northern Singapore. It will be larger than Woodlands, and when it’s complete, it will “bring Singapore’s National Water Agency up to 100% renewable power and will generate enough clean energy to power PUB’s local water treatment plants,” reports Renew Economy.",solar
2021/03/25,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Utility giant Con Edison is training residents of New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments to become solar technician apprentices so they can install solar panels on NYCHA building rooftops. It’s part of the Community Power program, which creates jobs for residents and also saves them money on energy bills.It’s a new program, so there are currently just 12 newly trained solar installers working at Glenwood Houses, a development in Flatlands, Brooklyn. From there, they’ll move to Kingsborough Houses in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights. They already completed solar installation at Carver Houses in Manhattan. Lease revenue from use of the roof space will go to the three NYCHA developments.The three solar arrays will be capable of generating about 1 megawatt of electricity. Around 400 low- and moderate-income Con Edison customers will save about $120 a year each on their electric bills. Customers will pay a subscription fee, but they will always save because the subscription fee will be 20% less than the full dollar value of the solar energy credits they receive. This project gives meaning to the saying, “It takes a village.” Solar One is providing training and education; WE ACT for Environmental Justice and the Brooklyn Movement Center recruit and screen prospective affordable housing subscribers; and WE ACT, Green City Force, and NYCHA recruit for the solar technician roles. The solar technician apprentices work for Queens-based Accord Power. The project is financed by clean energy investment company Sunwealth. The New York City Community Energy Co-op will manage customer subscriptions.Juan Parra, director of community solar for Solar One, said:Community Power shows how public, utility, and community partnerships can develop successful renewable energy projects that provide good jobs and utility bill savings to those who need it most. This model can be replicated with other public rooftops in New York City and beyond.The city of Los Angeles commissioned a study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory last year called “LA100: The Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study.” That study, which was conducted by nearly 100 people and the “Eagle” supercomputer, was released yesterday, and it concluded that the city is able to achieve 98% clean energy within the next 10 years and 100% clean energy by 2035.The Los Angeles Times summarizes:The path forward for the next decade is clear, NREL found: Build solar farms, wind turbines and batteries as fast as possible. Get solar panels on rooftops, electric cars in garages and electric heat pumps in homes. And invest in energy efficiency and “demand response” programs that pay people to use electricity during times of day when solar and wind power are plentiful.Crucially, all the paths to 100% clean energy studied by NREL would be capable of keeping the lights on every hour of the year, the researchers say — even on the hottest summer and coldest winter days, even when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow for days at a time, and even when a wildfire takes down a major transmission line.That last point is a key one, since it’s a new favorite to bring up among green energy doubters: “What about Texas?” (It wasn’t the wind farms that caused the blackouts.)Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said:We can keep our medical equipment on, we can keep our refrigerators working, we can keep the city going even in the face of more extreme weather.The top scientists in the world have taken this from dreamland to reality. There are hundreds of pathways that could take us to 100% renewable. It no longer should be a question of if, but when and how.Photo: Accord Power Inc.",solar
2021/03/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Is the banking sector just one big greenwash? A report released today reveals that 60 of the world’s largest banks have poured more than $3.8 trillion into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2016.Further, fossil fuel financing was higher in 2020 than in 2016, a trend that sharply contradicts the Paris Agreement’s goal of rapidly reducing emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. These banks have poured nearly $1.5 trillion over the past five years into 100 top companies expanding fossil fuels.The comprehensive report, “Banking on Climate Chaos,” is the 12th edition released by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Reclaim Finance, and Sierra Club, and is endorsed by over 300 organizations from 50 countries around the world.The biggest offenders are US-headquartered banks. And No. 1 – again – is JPMorgan Chase, which committed to align its financing with the Paris Agreement on October 6, 2020, as Electrek reported. From 2016 through 2020, Chase’s lending and underwriting activities provided nearly $317 billion to fossil fuels – 33% more than Citi, the next-worst bank over this period. However, JPMorgan Chase’s overall fossil-fuel financing fell by 20% in 2020, during the pandemic.Another surprising result from the 2020 data is that Paris-headquartered BNP Paribas (whose US subsidiary is Bank of the West, which strongly advertises its supposed responsibility on climate – it’s right on their homepage) came in as the fourth-worst bank in 2020. BNP Paribas provided $41 billion in fossil financing in 2020, a 41% increase over its 2019 activity. This means the largest increase in fossil-fuel financing last year came from BNP Paribas, despite the bank’s strong policy commitments restricting financing for unconventional oil and gas.However, there was one notable US improvement. Wells Fargo’s total fossil-fuel financing plummeted by 42% in 2020, despite being the world’s top fracking funder. As a result, Wells Fargo dropped from No. 4 in 2019 to No. 9 in 2020 on the worst list. This is the first time over the past five years that Wells Fargo has not been one of the worst four banks. The report also compared banks’ existing climate policy commitments to the Paris Agreement goals, and found them grossly insufficient and out of alignment overall. Recent high-profile bank policies focus either on the distant and ill-defined goal of achieving “net zero by 2050” or on restricting financing for unconventional fossil fuels. In general, existing bank policies are strongest on restrictions for direct project-related financing – which made up only 5% of the total fossil-fuel financing analyzed in the report. David Turnbull of Oil Change International, a research, communications, and advocacy organization that co-authored the report, told Electrek:This report shows that banks are unfortunately still stuck in the past, and we’re all suffering the consequences. Financing fossil fuels in 2021 is not just bad PR, it’s bad business. Renewables must be where banks make their energy investments; they should not be duped by vague, insufficient, and loophole-riddled pledges by fossil fuel companies to clean up their dirty acts sometime in the distant future.The world’s largest coal miner, Coal India, could venture into solar wafer manufacturing and wants to “aggressively” participate in the country’s solar energy auctions, reports Reuters.Coal India’s chairman, Pramod Agarwal, told Reuters in an interview:Coal as you know, we’re going to lose business in the next two, three decades. Solar will take over [from] coal slowly as a major energy provider in the coming years.We are just exploring the possibilities where we can invest in solar wafer production, nobody is [currently] there in the country.Coal India closed 82 mines in the three years to March 2020. Pramod Agarwal said its joint venture with state-run NLC India Ltd plans to invest around 125 billion rupees ($1.73 billion) in solar power projects with a capacity of 3,000 megawatts, of which Coal India will invest some 60 billion rupees by March 2024.",solar
2021/03/23,"Pennsylvania’s state government will source 50% of its electricity from seven new solar energy arrays. It will go into operation on January 1, 2023.Pennsylvania says this is the largest commitment to solar among any governmental agency in the US. It will cover more than 400 accounts across 16 state agencies. London-headquartered global solar developer and manager Lightsource bp will build, own, and operate the solar arrays.Lightsource bp provided Penn State University with three solar farms in Franklin County in 2020. Nittany 1, 2, and 3 now produce 25% of the university’s total energy supply:The state government solar project is part of Governor Tom Wolf’s GreenGov initiative, Pennsylvania PULSE (Project to Utilize Light and Solar Energy). Wolf (D-PA) made the announcement yesterday in a virtual news conference with the departments of General Services, Environmental Protection (DEP), and Conservation and Natural Resources. Wolf said:Pennsylvania has been a national energy leader for more than 100 years. As we continue to diversify our grid with clean renewable sources of energy, we want to maintain Pennsylvania’s leadership position and bring the associated economic, health, and environmental benefits to all Pennsylvanians.Governor Wolf’s website provides the details of the project:Solar arrays will be built in seven locations in six counties: Columbia, Juniata, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder, and York. When completed, the total 191-megawatt project is expected to deliver 361,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year, supplying 100% of electricity for 434 accounts across 16 state agencies, or about half the electricity used by state government. The solar project will create 400-plus jobs and begin lowering carbon dioxide emissions statewide by 157,800 metric tons each year – the equivalent of the emissions from nearly 27,000 homes, or taking 34,000 cars off the roads.General Services contracted with Constellation, a Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission-licensed electric generation supplier, to secure a 15-year fixed-price supply agreement. Serving as a technical advisor on the purchase, the Penn State Facilities Engineering Institute coordinated an innovative retail approach.The state has committed to 30-year land leases with farmers in the six counties.DEP secretary Patrick McDonnell said:With over 85% of Pennsylvania’s greenhouse gas emissions coming from energy production and use, pursuing clean energy and energy efficiency at the enterprise scale, as the state government solar procurement demonstrates, will make a big impact. At the same time, research shows the clean energy sector is a leading creator of quality jobs in Pennsylvania, bringing positive economic impacts as well.According to the 2020 Pennsylvania Clean Energy Employment report (which, it’s important to note, was commissioned before the pandemic), clean energy industries added nearly 7,800 jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017-2019, for an 8.7% average job growth rate, significantly exceeding the average overall job growth in the state.Pennsylvania’s goal is to reduce emissions by 26% by 2025 and 80% by 2050 compared with 2005 levels. How that works with the US’s recommitment to the Paris Agreement remains to be seen.No details were provided on battery storage for the seven solar arrays, but Lightsource bp is an experienced solar developer and manager, so we expect that more details will emerge soon.Keep in mind that this announcement is for state government electricity; not for Pennsylvania’s electricity overall. When you compare 191 megawatts to the top 10 states by cumulative solar capacity installed, it pales in comparison. No. 1 in cumulative solar capacity is California, at 31,288 megawatts. So context is important.According to the US Energy Information Administration as of September 2020, Pennsylvania is the US’s second-largest natural gas producer (after Texas), the third-largest coal-producing state in 2018, and the second-largest coal exporter to foreign markets. In other words, there’s a lot of fossil-fuel action going on in the Keystone State. Its clean energy industry is fledgling, but the SEIA expects it to grow considerably. So symbolically, this state government solar commitment is a big step for Pennsylvania. Hopefully the state’s renewable industry will grow quickly in order to meet their emissions reduction targets, along with clean energy jobs in order to boost confidence among nervous fossil-fuel workers, as the loss of fossil-fuel jobs in Pennsylvania is a sore point.Electrek wrote about where Pennsylvania stands on energy on November 3 – you can read that here.Photo: Lightsource bp",solar
2021/03/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In the Shetland Islands, the northernmost part of Scotland, Nova Innovation‘s tidal turbines have powered homes and businesses for more than five years. Now, Nova has installed an electric vehicle charge point powered by tidal energy on the Shetland island of Yell – which Nova says is a first for the UK. The charge point is at Cullivoe harbor, at the north of the island, near where Nova’s turbines are installed. It’s not a fast charger, but then again, Yell is only 83 square miles.The Drive explains the power setup in the Shetland Islands:The Shetland Islands aren’t connected to the main electricity grid of Great Britain, with supply managed from Lerwick on the Shetland “mainland” island and distributed to Yell and Unst via submarine cables. Improving the supply has already led big projects both in terms of renewable use — via Nova’s tidal turbines and other schemes — and grid storage to allow the islands to better balance their usage. Nova first started working on tidal power in Shetland in 2016, installing three 100kW turbines, so although the eVolt charger installed on Yell isn’t a fast charger, it’s not because of a limitation on the supply. The Nova project received grant funding through Transport Scotland for the project. ICE vehicles are responsible for around a fifth of all carbon emissions in the UK. The Scottish government has banned the sale of new ICE cars by 2032, accelerating the need to develop new sources of clean energy to power vehicles.Climate Action 100+ (CA100) has issued its first net zero company benchmark of the world’s largest polluting companies. CA100 works with 167 focus companies that account for over 80% of corporate industrial greenhouse gas emissions.Climate Action 100+ is an initiative that aims to ensure the world’s largest corporate polluters take necessary action on climate change. CA100 consists of more than 570 investors that are responsible for over $54 trillion in assets. Climate Action 100+’s net zero company benchmark is a “report card” with 10 indicators that can be read here. A red circle with an X means “no, does not mean any criteria”; an orange circle with a dash means “partial, meets some criteria”; and a green circle with a tick means “yes, meets all criteria.” You can look up any of the 167 companies by name or sector. Duke Energy, for example (click on the link), has two greens, four oranges, three reds, and one “not currently assessed.” The assessments are worth a look, as the reports are extremely informative and transparent.Reuters reports:If added together and treated as a country, the companies – including oil majors like Exxon, Saudi Aramco, and BP as well as Unilever – would be the third biggest emitter behind the United States and China, the group said.Although 83 of the companies assessed have announced an aim of achieving net zero by 2050, around half of these commitments do not encompass the full scope of their emissions.While 107 companies had set medium-term targets, only 20 met all the assessment criteria; of the 75 to set short-term targets, only eight did so.The study found that less than 25% of the CA100 focus companies have an ambition to achieve net zero emissions across their full carbon footprint by 2050 or earlier. Further, just 10% of the companies are aligned with the Paris Agreement across their entire operations.Arne Staal, CEO, FTSE Russell, said:Ahead of COP 26 in the UK later this year, the Climate Action 100+ assessments launched… provide both investors and companies with a transparent and consistent approach to help track corporate ambition and progress toward net zero.Danielle Fugere, president of environmental and social corporate responsibility nonprofit As You Sow, said:These ratings allow investors to differentiate which companies are leading in aligning their businesses with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, a critical indicator of future value, and those whose inaction portends growing risk to their companies and to the climate.Photo: Nova Innovation",solar
2021/03/22,"The Duane Arnold Energy Center in eastern Iowa, the current site of a now-idle nuclear power plant, will soon host a 690-megawatt solar farm. The new solar farm plus storage will replace the single-unit, 615-megawatt nuclear plant, which powered more than 600,000 homes.Owner NextEra Energy of Florida will build the solar farm across 3,500 acres at and near Duane Arnold in Palo, Linn County. NextEra also intends to include up to 60 megawatts of AC-coupled batteries for power storage.The project is expected to bring in a $700 million project investment, $41.6 million in tax revenue, and around 300 construction jobs.NextEra will negotiate leases with landowners in summer 2021 and begin construction in winter 2022. The company intends to have the solar farm online by the end of 2023.NextEra Energy Resources currently has ownership interests in 3,160 megawatts of operating solar projects representing universal-scale solar facilities in 27 US states and one in Spain, as well as multiple small-scale (distributed generation) solar projects.The Gazette in Cedar Rapids reports on the history of the Duane Arnold site and why the nuclear power plant was shut down:In a 2019 article, a Duane Arnold plant director told the Gazette that the facility, which employed nearly 600 people, no longer fit in Iowa’s energy portfolio that increasingly consisted of wind and solar.The facility — Iowa’s only nuclear power plant, which began operating 45 years ago — was supposed to be decommissioned at the end of October 2020.But “extensive” damage to the facility from the August 10, 2020, derecho [a severe storm] forced NextEra to shut it down early.The Sierra Club explains Duane Arnold’s nuclear plant decommissioning process here, but the bottom line is that it’s going to take 60 years (and nuclear waste is of course radioactive for thousands of years):After 60 years, the plant will be torn down, the nuclear materials would be transported to a central storage facility if one is built by then, any contamination would be cleaned up, and the land will be available for re-use.Wind is currently the largest single source of electricity in Iowa, making up more than 40% of the state’s electricity.Photo: Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette",solar
2021/03/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):New York State’s Public Service Commission has approved an underground cable that would link the South Fork offshore wind farm to the power grid. This is a major win for what will be New York’s first offshore wind farm.Deepwater Wind South Fork will be a 15-turbine, 130 megawatt wind farm 35 miles off the Montauk coast. It will be connected to an East Hampton power substation through the 7.6 miles of underground cable that was approved. The transmission line is expected to be operational by 2023, but it still requires federal permits to proceed.New York governor Andrew Cuomo said:When people say it’s never been done before, New York shows them how to get it done, and this transmission power line – the first of its kind in the state – will showcase what the future of energy will look like.Public Service Commission chairman John B. Howard said:With this decision, we demonstrate the clear need for the project while avoiding or minimizing adverse environmental impacts.New York State has set a goal of around 9,000 megawatts of wind power by 2035. In January, the state announced two offshore wind contracts with energy giant Equinor totaling nearly 2,500 megawatts: 1,260 MW from Empire Wind 2, southeast of Long Island, and another 1,230 MW from Beacon Wind 1, 60 miles east of Montauk Point.Here’s a great model in Virginia that helps nonprofits and low-income households run on solar energy that certainly has the potential to be applied on a wider scale.Virginia-based Give Solar, which offers solar solutions for nonprofits and low-income households through crowdfunding and solar “barn raising,” is partnering with Central Valley Habitat for Humanity in Bridgewater, Virginia, to make solar energy available for Habitat homeowners. Habitat homeowners help build their own homes alongside volunteers and pay an affordable mortgage. On the solar front, volunteers implement energy efficiency improvements to the building, and solar professionals install the PV system. WHXV explains:Give Solar will pay the cost of the solar panels up front and then the homeowners will pay that back over the term of their mortgage, but by using solar energy the families will ultimately save $20 per month.The ultimate goal is for 20 Habitat for Humanity homes to have solar energy in the next five years.To meet that goal, the organization is trying to raise $100,000 with their Solar Seed Fund.Jeff Heie, director of Give Solar, said:The Give Solar project aims to reduce homeowners’ electricity expense through solar power, which is not only good for the environment but also puts money back in their pocketbook.It’s meaningful to me to be able to address some of the poverty that exists in this community through clean energy.Volunteers installed 24 solar panels on a Habitat for Humanity home on Friday, and five other completed projects are showcased on their website.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/03/19,"A number of utilities in the US Southeast want to create the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM). They filed a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in February, and they want an approval by May 13. The nonprofit advocacy group the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) explained why SEEM isn’t a good move for the transition to green energy or reducing energy costs.The funny thing about utilities is, the vast majority of the population don’t know a lot about them, yet they directly affect every single person who uses the energy the utilities sell – and that’s why this is important.The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy’s director of utility reform, Maggie Shober, explained the exchange market proposal in a blog:Southeastern utilities can already buy and sell power from each other, they just have to use an antiquated system to do so — pick up the phone and call to schedule the purchase. The proposal currently under discussion would be an upgrade to that system, not a move to a full-on market. Utilities would be able to submit a bid to provide or purchase power and have an algorithm automatically match them together.There would be no governing board.All sales would remain voluntary and would be ultimately up to each utility. This is different from every other energy market construct in the country.As of February 12, 2021, “SEEM Members” includes Alabama Power, Georgia Power Company, and Mississippi Power Company (collectively, “Southern Companies”); Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (“AECI”); Dalton Utilities (“Dalton”); Dominion Energy South Carolina, Inc. (“Dominion SC”); Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (“DEC”) and Duke Energy Progress, LLC (“DEP”) with DEC and DEP collectively referred to as “Duke”; Louisville Gas & Electric Company (“LG&E”) and Kentucky Utilities Company (“KU”) collectively (“LG&E/KU”); North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1 (“NCMPA Number 1”); Power South Energy Cooperative (“PowerSouth”); North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (“NCEMC”); and Tennessee Valley Authority (“TVA”).There are also potential SEEM members that are not officially part of the SEEM filing at FERC but are considering joining SEEM. Potential SEEM Members as cited in the filing are Georgia System Operations Corporation (“GSOC”); Georgia Transmission Corporation (“GTC”); Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (“MEAG Power”); Oglethorpe Power Corporation (An Electric Membership Corporation) (“Oglethorpe”); and South Carolina Public Service Authority (“Santee Cooper”).Shober explains:States in the Southeast continue to have some of the highest electricity bills in the country. An unacceptable combination of low incomes, a general lack of investment in energy efficiency, the prevalence of the need for electricity to provide both heating and cooling, and monopolistic utilities that are insulated from customer pressure have led states in the region to consistently appear among the worst in terms of energy burden (energy costs as a portion of household income).The SEEM proposal would not even scratch the surface of these issues. If the utilities’ claims of the benefits of SEEM are to be believed, and $40 million in annual savings is spread across the entire SEEM footprint, we estimate that could lead to, at most, a savings of $1/year for residential customers served by SEEM utilities. Most likely the impact would be lower.There are two main reasons the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy thinks the SEEM proposal would obstruct clean energy:The SEEM proposal lacks the ability for independent or small developers or projects to participate, and would not change how utilities plan future resources (i.e., would not change how Southeast utilities develop their Integrated Resource Plans), so will not lead to additional renewable energy on the grid, offset the need for planned new gas plants, or drive utilities to retire coal plants earlier than currently planned. Even the claims that SEEM would help to integrate existing renewables, particularly by leading to less curtailment of solar energy, are suspect. So in this regard, we don’t see SEEM as a driver of clean energy.It is possible SEEM could derail true market reform efforts if allowed to move forward in its current form. In our protest filed with allies, we detail all the examples of Southeast states and localities that are considering electric market reforms. If SEEM is approved, it could derail these discussions and either prevent or delay the kind of market reforms that could drive a significant increase in future renewable energy, accelerate the retirement of coal and gas units, and cause the cancellation of new gas plants before they are built.In an earlier blog posted in July 2020, Shober wrote that for true emission reductions, a market in the Southeast would need at least the following three things: Wholesale generation competition with complete transparency and complete divestment of existing generation resource to remove bias toward incumbent utilities.Combined regional resource and transmission planning to eliminate redundant proposals for new generation and open up existing power plants to competition with new resources.Involvement from state policymakers to ensure state clean energy policies are metTo read Maggie Shober’s blog, “Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM): What we know, Q&A-style” in full on SACE’s website, click here.Photo: TVA dams in 1935",solar
2021/03/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Workers will need a way to safely reach and then live and work at the world’s largest offshore wind farm project, the UK’s Dogger Bank, which will be more than 130 km off the Yorkshire coast. So Dogger Bank has awarded contracts totaling $375 million (£270 million) to Aberdeen’s North Star Renewables to build and operate three hybrid battery service operation vessels (SOVs). Wind farm engineers and technicians working on the turbines will live onboard the vessels on two-week rotations at the wind farm, so the SOVs are designed for logistical efficiency and hotel-grade comfort. “The design’s walk-to-work gangways will be rated for 10-foot seas to allow maintenance to proceed with a wide weather window,” reports Maritime Executive. The computer-generated imagery (CGI) shows a fantastic-looking vessel:North Star will deliver the SOVs from 2023 and will charter them to Dogger Bank operator Equinor for an initial period of 10 years, with an option for three one-year extensions. According to Offshore Magazine:The company will establish a new permanent presence at the Port [of Tyne] and will create 130 new full-time UK-based jobs in crewing and shore-based roles for the lifetime of the contract. Job recruitment will start 12 months ahead of vessel delivery for positions in Scotland and northeast England.Each 1.2 GW phase of Dogger Bank — 3.6 GW in total — is expected to generate around 6 TWh of electricity annually, and the entire project will be capable of powering up to 6 million UK homes each year once it’s complete in 2026.BP said yesterday that it intends to build the UK’s largest hydrogen plant by 2030. The plant would be in Teesside, and it would have capacity of up to 1 gigawatt of blue hydrogen, which is when natural gas is split into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored. Reuters reports:BP has begun a feasibility study on the project to explore technologies that could capture up to 98% of carbon emissions from the hydrogen production process. The Teesside project, dubbed H2Teesside, is expected to capture up to 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year and pipe it into storage below the North Sea, BP said.H2Teesside will be linked with Net Zero Teesside (NZT), a planned industrial zone that will also be linked to a carbon capture and storage project. The hydrogen could also be used for heating residential homes in the region or for transportation, BP added.BP says will make a final investment decision on H2Teeside in early 2024. Production could begin in 2027 or earlier.This week, the UK announced an industrial decarbonization strategy with a target to cut industry emissions by two-thirds in 15 years. The British government’s strategy paper details which industries are included:This strategy covers the full range of UK industry sectors: metals and minerals, chemicals, food and drink, paper and pulp, ceramics, glass, oil refineries, and less energy-intensive manufacturing. It also covers the new emerging industries, which will be the hallmarks of the net zero transition, including low carbon hydrogen and carbon capture, usage, and storage.Photo: North Star Renewables",solar

A new joint report, “Offshore Wind for America: The Promise and Potential of Clean Energy Off Our Coasts,” asserts that offshore wind has the potential to meet 90% of US electricity demand in 2050. The two groups examined US offshore wind potential by coastal region and state, and documented the status of existing projects and technological advances.  The study found that the Atlantic region has the highest potential to generate offshore wind – if fully developed, four times as much electricity as the region used in 2019 (which, frankly, isn’t much, seeing how the US had only one wind farm, Block Island, off Rhode Island, in 2019). The Gulf of Mexico is second, followed by the Pacific and then the Great Lake regions for potential capacity. But there are a lot of offshore wind farms in the pipeline, and Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts, slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the US, is headed toward formal authorization by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management under the Biden administration.So it’s not surprising that of the 29 states examined by the report’s authors, Massachusetts was No. 1 for potential to generate the most offshore wind power. Further, Maine has the highest ratio of potential offshore wind power to its current and future electricity needs. For projections of 2050 electricity demand, the report assumes that US buildings, industry, and transportation will be powered by clean electricity rather than fossil fuels. So it’s time for all coastal state legislators to look to its rapidly growing success in Europe and incentivize offshore wind farms. Hannah Read, Go Big on Offshore Wind associate with Environment America Research & Policy Center, said:For offshore wind to succeed, we need to set strong, enforceable targets around it. The sheer abundance of this incredible renewable resource should convince our state leaders to make bold commitments to start powering our homes with offshore wind.This week, energy and smart grid solutions provider Swell Energy and New York City’s energy giant Con Edison announced a residential solar plus storage program in Queens, New York. Those who own a home in Queens may qualify for a home battery, and Swell will cover a portion of the upfront costs (they don’t specify how much). The offer is limited to the first 300 homeowners who reserve a spot.Swell’s website states:The Virtual Power Plant will provide 500 kW of clean energy to Con Edison customers during peak periods, lightening the load on the energy grid on summer’s hottest days.This project is the first of its kind in New York City, and it’s just the beginning of a new way to think about how you get and use energy.These new, state-of-the-art home batteries will help you get the most out of your solar panels.Queens residents can apply by clicking on this link.And in Los Angeles, in order to form a virtual power plant there, too, 50 eligible homeowners in San Gabriel Valley will be able to enroll in the Bassett Avocado Heights Advanced Energy Community (BAAEC), a pilot project that will use sonnen batteries and rooftop solar.Blake Richetta, chairman and CEO of sonnen, said:Collaborative projects like BAAEC go beyond the conceptual, pilot phase and showcase how this model can perform at scale, delivering tangible benefits to residents, while helping to improve the local utility infrastructure.",solar
2021/03/17,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Duke Energy Renewables’ largest wind farm in its fleet has begun commercial operation. The 350MW Frontier 2 project is in Kay County, Oklahoma.The Duke Energy wind farm Frontier 2 is an expansion of the 200MW Frontier 1 project, which has been online since 2016, so together they have a capacity of 550MW. German wind turbine manufacturer Nordex supplied 74 4.8MW wind turbines for the Frontier project.reNews.biz reports:AT&T and Ball Corporation have signed 15-year virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for 160MW and 161 MW, respectively from Frontier 2.These VPPAs will settle on an as-generated basis tied to Frontier 2’s real-time energy output.AT&T network engineering and operations president Scott Mair said:With more than 1.5GW of renewable energy capacity, our portfolio delivers clean electricity to the grid, helps to create jobs and community benefits, and supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.This is an important piece of our journey to reach carbon neutrality across our global operations by 2035.Oklahoma ranks second in total electricity net generation from wind after Texas, and third in wind’s share of state generation after Iowa and Kansas.New research from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), University of California Los Angeles, and University of California, Berkeley, titled “Why Regional and Long-Haul Trucks Are Primed for Electrification Now,” finds that electric vehicle battery price drops has enabled Class 8 long-haul electric trucks to have a 13% lower total cost of ownership than similar diesel models today. This would save electric truck owners up to $200,000 over the life of each truck. The study’s abstract states:At the current global average battery pack price of $135 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (realizable when procured at scale), a Class 8 electric truck with 375-mile range and operated 300 miles per day when compared to a diesel truck offers about 13% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) per mile, about three-year payback and net present savings of about US $200,000 over a 15-year lifetime. This is achieved with only a 3% reduction in payload capacity. The estimated average distance traveled between 30-minute driver breaks is 150 miles and 190 miles for regional-haul and long-haul trucks respectively in the US. Thirty minutes of charging using 500 kW or mega-Watt scale fast-chargers would add sufficient range without impairing operations and economics of freight movement.Trucks are responsible for 28% of emissions from transportation, the largest source of emissions in the US. Further, electric trucks could offer up to a 50% lower total cost of ownership compared to diesel models by 2030. The authors note the need for a supportive policy environment to give the truck industry confidence in investing in manufacturing, batteries, charging infrastructure, and end-of-life management.David Wooley, co-author and director of the Center for Environmental Public Policy at the University of California Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy, said:In some ways, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are easy to electrify.They tend to charge at central locations or along freeway corridors, run regular routes, and have high fuel and maintenance savings because of their high mileage rates. They also reduce how much truck drivers are exposed to noise, vibrations, and diesel fumes.Photo: The American Clean Power Association",solar
2021/03/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The US solar industry grew 43% and installed a record 19.2 gigawatts of capacity in 2020, according to the “US Solar Market Insight 2020 Year-in-Review” report released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.According to SEIA’s press release: For the second year in a row, solar led all technologies in new electric-generating capacity added. According to Wood Mackenzie’s 10-year forecast, the US solar industry will install a cumulative 324 GWdc of new capacity to reach a total of 419 GWdc over the next decade.The 8 GWdc of new installations in fourth quarter 2020 marks the largest quarter in US solar history. For perspective, the US solar market added 7.5 GWdc of new capacity in all of 2015. New capacity additions in 2020 represent a 43% increase from 2019 and breaks the US solar market’s previous record of 15.1 GWdc set in 2016.California, Texas, and Florida are the top three states for annual solar growth for the second year in a row, and Virginia is the fourth state, installing more than 1 GWdc of solar PV. Residential deployment was up 11% from 2019, reaching a record 3.1 GW. This was lower than the 18% annual growth in 2019, as residential installations were significantly impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020. Non-residential installations declined 4% from 2019, with 2 GW installed. The pandemic impacted this segment through delayed project interconnections and prolonged development timelines.There was a historic 6.3 GWdc of utility-scale projects installed in fourth quarter 2020, bringing the annual total just shy of 14 GWdc. A total of 5 GWdc of new utility solar power purchase agreements were announced in fourth quarter 2020, bringing the volume of project announcements in 2020 to 30.6 GWdc and the full utility-scale contracted pipeline to 69 GWdc.SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said:The action we take now will determine the pace of our growth and whether we use solar to fuel our economy and meet this climate moment.The Biden administration’s recent two-year extension of the investment tax credit (ITC) will drive greater solar adoption. The SEIA’s goal is for solar to power 20% of US electricity by 2030.Clean energy investment must increase by 30% to a total of $131 trillion by 2050 to avert the climate crisis, according to a new report, “World Energy Transitions Outlook,” released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).The World Energy Transitions Outlook preview outlines a pathway for the world to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and halt the pace of climate change by transforming the global energy landscape. IRENA asserts in its annual flagship report that proven technologies for a net-zero energy already exist. The agency predicts that renewables, green hydrogen, and bioenergy will dominate in the future.Further, energy transition investment will need to increase by 30% to a total of $131 trillion between now and 2050, corresponding to $4.4 trillion on average annually.Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA, which has more than 160 member states, said [via Reuters]:The gap between where we are and where we should be is not decreasing but widening. We need a drastic acceleration of energy transitions to make a meaningful turnaround.Fossil fuel use will need to drop by more than 75% by 2050, and natural gas use needs to peak in 2025. IRENA points out that governments can still use pandemic stimulus packages to accelerate the transition, but to date, those packages have favored fossil fuels.",solar
2021/03/15,"Researchers at ETH Zurich and Empa have chemically modified wood and made it more compressible, turning it into a mini-​generator. When compressed, it generates an electrical voltage. Such wood could serve as a biosensor or as a building material that harvests energy.Ingo Burgert and his team at public research university ETH Zurich and Swiss federal laboratory Empa have proven that wood is much more than just a building material. Their research enhances the properties of wood in order to use it for new applications. For instance, they have already developed high-​strength, water-​repellent, and magnetizable wood.Now, together with the Empa research group led by Francis Schwarze, the team has used one chemical and one biological process to generate electrical voltage from a type of wood sponge. In doing so, they amplify what is known as the “piezoelectric effect” of wood.When a piezoelectric material is elastically deformed, it generates an electrical voltage. Measurement technology, in particular, exploits this phenomenon by using sensors that generate a charge signal when mechanically stressed. However, many of the materials often used for these sensors are unsuitable for biomedical applications. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT), for example, cannot be used on the skin due to its toxic lead and must be specially disposed of.Wood also has a natural piezoelectric effect but only generates a very low electrical voltage. If one wants to increase the voltage, the chemical composition of the wood must be changed – and this also makes it more compressible.In order to convert wood into an easily formable material, one component of the cell walls must be dissolved. Wood cell walls consist of three basic substances: lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. “Lignin is the stabilizing substance that trees need to grow tall. Without lignin, which connects the cells and prevents the stiff cellulose fibrils from buckling, this would not be possible,” says Burgert.A few months ago, Jianguo Sun, a doctoral student in Burgert’s team, together with colleagues from ETH and Empa, published a study in ACS Nano that explained how wood can be made deformable if the lignin is removed chemically. As a result, its piezoelectric effect is enhanced.The researchers achieved this “delignification” by placing wood in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. The acid dissolves the lignin, leaving a framework of cellulose layers. “The process retains the hierarchical structure of wood and prevents disassembly of the individual fibers,” Burgert explains.In this way, a piece of balsa wood becomes a white, wooden sponge, made up of layer upon layer of thin cellulose. The sponge can simply be compressed and then returns to its original shape. “The wood sponge generates an electrical voltage 85 times higher than that of native [untreated] wood,” says Sun.The team subjected a test cube with a side length of approximately 1.5 cm to around 600 load cycles. The wooden sponge proved surprisingly stable: For each load, the researchers measured a voltage of approximately 0.63 volts, which would be appropriate for a sensor. In further experiments, the team tested the scalability of this mini-​generator. If 30 such wooden blocks are connected up and evenly loaded with the body weight of an adult, enough electricity is generated to power a simple LCD display.In a follow-​up study just published in Science Advances, the ETH-​Empa research team went one step further, seeking to produce the wooden sponge without using chemicals. The researchers found the solution in nature: The fungus Ganoderma applanatum causes white rot in wood and degrades the lignin and hemicellulose gently. “Although the electrical voltage generated was lower in initial tests than with chemically treated wood, the fungal process is more environmentally friendly,” says Burgert.There are clear advantages to such a simple, renewable piezoelectric system. The researchers see various potential applications for the wood sponges – for example, as sustainable building materials that harvest energy in the use phase or skin-friendly pressure sensors for medical purposes.However, there are still several steps to go before piezo wood can be deployed as a biosensor, or even as an electricity-​harvesting parquet floor. Burgert and his colleagues are now exploring with various partners how to adapt the technology for industrial applications.News source: ETH Zurich editorial teamMain photo: Joel & Jasmin Førestbird/Unsplash",solar
2021/03/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):North Toledo, Ohio, hosts a 21,000-panel, 2.5MW solar farm that will generate energy for Dana Incorporated’s adjacent 300,000-square-foot axle assembly operation. Dana Incorporated supplies axles, driveshafts, transmissions, and electrodynamic, thermal, sealing, and digital equipment for ICE, hybrid, and electric vehicles.The solar farm is owned by the Greater Toledo Community Foundation, which says the solar farm “connects renewable energy and neighborhood reinvestment.” It was developed across two sites – north and south – in the Overland Industrial Park, which was once home to a Jeep plant that closed in 2006.The Toledo Blade reports:Revenue from the sale of electricity will be invested in the Solar Toledo Neighborhood Foundation of the Greater Toledo Community Foundation, and grants will be awarded to local nonprofit organizations to focus on development of the neighborhoods surrounding Overland Industrial Park.The solar array is expected to generate more than $300,000 annually. The funds are projected to be available at the end of 2021 for distribution to local nonprofit organizations working to better the neighborhoods surrounding the Overland Industrial Park. Grant amounts will be determined by the amount of energy Dana uses on an annual basis, less any operating expenses for the solar array, such as insurance and ongoing maintenance.The north side was completed in July 2020, and the south site was completed in August 2020. Tempe, Arizona-headquartered First Solar provided the solar modules and Yaskawa Solectria Solar supplied the inverters. GEM Energy, JDRM Engineering, Mannik Smith Group, and TTL Associates provided design and construction services.Jason Slattery, director of solar, GEM Energy, said:Projects like Overland, which involve numerous partners with significant ties to the community, demonstrate how success can be achieved through broad-based collaboration.Here’s a neat time-lapse video of Overland’s solar farm construction from September 2019 to August 2020:French multinational electric utility company Engie has started commercial operations at an 11-turbine, 44MW wind farm at the Port of Zeebrugge, Belgium. It will supply electricity to roll-on/roll-off cargo handler International Car Operators (ICO).It will deliver about 110 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually. reNews.biz reports:The local energy production is used, among other things, for 308 electric charging points that were also installed by Engie in 2019.The electric charging island, with a total capacity of 3.4MW, can charge more than 20,000 electric vehicles per week with green electricity.Engie said the wind farm will also provide shore power for ships moored at the quay.Marc Adriansens, managing director of ICO Zeebrugge, said:The automotive sector is facing the most radical change in its history. Sustainability will thus become the norm and electrification will be further implemented in all car brands. As an important player in the sector, we therefore want to be ready for the future and respond to this by placing this onshore wind farm.Photo: Toledo Aerial Media",solar
2021/03/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The good green energy news out of China: China built more new wind farms in 2020 than the whole world combined built in 2019.Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that China was responsible for 58 gigawatts out of the world’s total of nearly 100 gigawatts worth of wind farms built in 2020.The Guardian reports:Isabelle Edwards, the author of the report, said: “While every region commissioned more wind capacity than the year prior, the unprecedented growth observed in 2020 should be credited to the Chinese wind market.”Chinese renewable energy developers piled into the market before a looming cutoff for new wind power subsidies from the government, and demand is likely to slow next year.The bad fossil-fuel news out of China: Global Energy Monitor reported that China led in building coal power plants, too:In 2020, China built over three times as much new coal power capacity as all other countries in the world combined – the equivalent of more than one large coal plant per week.In the first half of 2020, China hosted almost 90% of all coal plants under construction and is home to half the world’s operating coal-fired electricity capacity,In September 2020, China declared that it would achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. But the country’s economic five-year plan, published on March 5, 2021, could lead to a serious rise in greenhouse gas emissions. China has provided few details on how it intends to meet its net zero by 2060 target. The Washington Post reports:China, the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, is widely viewed as critical to grappling with the climate change crisis. The country’s climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, has begun conversations with his US counterpart, [US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate] John F. Kerry.The US is the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, so collaboration between the two countries on climate-change efforts is crucial. The US rejoined the Paris Agreement under the Biden administration.German-headquartered discount supermarket chain Aldi is one of the US’s fastest-growing retailers, with more than 2,000 stores and 25 warehouses and offices across 37 states. (Its US headquarters are in Batavia, Illinois.) It plans to open another 100 stores in the US by the end of this year. And it’s just announced its new US sustainability goals through 2030.On the clean energy front, Supermarket News reports:Aldi has solar panels at 111 stores and 12 distribution centers across the country and aims to add solar energy to warehouses in Alabama and Kansas and to about 60 stores by the end of 2022.So while that’s only about 10% of its buildings hosting solar, Aldi buys enough clean energy to support all of its stores, warehouses, and offices. Aldi sources its clean power via Green-e.Aldi’s sustainability goals include:By the end of 2021, Aldo will remove Styrofoam from all produce packaging. Aldi has never offered single-use plastic bags at checkout, and it’s testing a new initiative to remove all multi-use plastic bags from six stores in Richmond, Virginia.Further, Chain Store Age reports:In addition, all Aldi warehouses (in the US) and nearly 400 stores use natural refrigerants that reduce the environmental impact by up to 4,000 times compared to common refrigerants. Aldi will continue to shift to natural refrigerants in all store locations. The Environmental Protection Agency gave Aldi the 2020 Green Power Leadership Award.Electrek’s Take: The fact that Aldi has a sustainability plan and is following through sets the chain up as a role model for other supermarket chains. Publix, as a comparative, touts itself as sustainable, but still freely hands out thousands of plastic bags, hides its paper bags (you have to ask for them), and uses an enormous amount of packaging, including Styrofoam. It has 1,252 stores in total, but solar panels on only five stores. Publix offers EV charging at 21 of its stores. It does not appear to have set sustainability goals.What sustainability and green energy initiatives would you like to see your local supermarket implement?

LM Wind Power, a GE Renewable Energy business, will set up and operate the plant to produce blades for its Haliade-X turbine, the world’s most powerful wind turbine. They will power Equinor’s Dogger Bank, which will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm when completed in 2026. It will have a combined installed generation capacity of 3.6 GW, enough to power 6 million UK homes.GE will provide 13 MW (phases A and B) and 14 MW (phase C) Haliade-X turbines for Dogger Bank, as Electrek previously covered. The turbine blades are 107 meters (351 feet) long.The Haliade-X blade factory will create around 750 direct jobs and 1,500 indirect jobs at Teesworks, a former steelworks, on the River Tees. This brings the total number of new jobs supported by the construction and operation of Dogger Bank Wind Farm to more than 2,500 so far.The factory will start production in 2023, supplying blades to Dogger Bank and SSE Renewables. Blades produced at Teesworks will be installed from 2024 onwards.The electricity generated by the Dogger Bank turbines, which are between 130 km (80 miles) and 200 km (124 miles) from shore, will be transmitted using subsea cables. Due to the distance from shore, it will be the first UK wind farm to utilize an HVDC connection. The UK’s target is to commission 40 GW of offshore wind by 2030.The City of White Plains, New York, and its chosen developer, Schenectady-based Distributed Solar Development (DSD), have broken ground on a nine-project, 6.8 megawatt (MW) community solar portfolio that will triple the amount of solar energy produced in Westchester County. DSD and White Plains have entered into a multi-year agreement with energy giant Con Edison.When complete, White Plains’ community solar portfolio will produce enough energy to power more than 700 homes annually. Construction on the portfolio is expected to conclude before fall 2021. It’s currently Westchester County’s largest municipal project.The nine solar projects include a mix of canopy, rooftop, and ground mount installations at four parking garages, the Ebersole Ice Rink, Gedney Way Recycling Facility, Gillie Park, Water Department, and the Sanitation Complex. Systems at the Recycling Facility and Shapham Place parking garage will also include energy storage as part of the installations.DSD has partnered with Community Solar Platform to manage registration for residential and commercial customers interested in taking advantage of the renewable energy the portfolio produces.In 2014, White Plains was one of the first municipalities to adopt the New York State Unified Solar Permit, which expedited residential solar permitting. New York State’s goal is to install 6,000 MW of solar by 2025 as called for in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.Michael S.

2021/03/10,"World Resources Institute (WRI) CEO Andrew Steer has been named as the first president and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund, and yesterday, Steer announced on Twitter that the $10 billion Earth Fund would be spent by 2030:I am deeply honored to have been invited by @JeffBezos to become the first President and CEO of the $10B Earth Fund. It will address climate, nature and environmental justice. Jeff's goal is to spend it down between now and 2030, the date by which the SDGs must be achieved. [2/5]Steer tweeted:The Earth Fund will invest in scientists, NGOs, activists, and the private sector to help drive new technologies, investments, policy change, and behavior. We will emphasize social justice, as climate change disproportionately hurts poor and marginalized communities.Bezos announced he would step down as Amazon’s CEO in February to focus on philanthropic and science interests. In an Instagram post, Bezos said of Steer:Andrew has decades of experience in environmental and climate science as well as economic and social policy in the US, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Most recently, he has been president and CEO of World Resources Institute, where he leads over 1,400 experts working to alleviate poverty while protecting the natural world. BusinessGreen reports that “in November, $791 million of grants were issued to 16 environmental organizations in the Earth Fund’s first ever funding round, of which $100 million was allocated to the WRI.” Other recipients included the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.The CEO Magazine rightly notes:The Bezos Earth Fund is Amazon’s answer to its own record on carbon emissions. Amazon has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2040. Its most recent sustainability report showed that its carbon footprint, for now, is rising quickly — up 15% in 2019 compared to 2018, when the company disclosed its emissions for the first time.Electrek’s Take: This fund is a great thing – it’s a lot of money that can, and likely will, be used for innovation, developing technology, and policy change in green energy. In February, for example, Amazon officially started using the first Rivian electric vans to make customer deliveries in Los Angeles. But we would like to see more transparency and a detailed road map from the Earth Fund, and what its structure will look like, especially seeing how Amazon is a huge emitter in its own right.

2021/03/09,"The Alameda County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a 350-acre solar farm on agricultural land north of Livermore, California. This will be the Bay Area’s largest solar farm to date, once it’s built.The Aramis Renewable Energy Project is Intersect Power’s 100-megawatt solar farm that will feature around 300,000 solar panels. Construction could start in mid-2022 and operations could begin by mid-2023.  It would power up to 25,000 homes and offset 188,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.The Mercury News reports:Intersect Power plans to continue some agricultural practices of the area. That would include beekeeping, which aims to produce some 5,000 pounds of honey per year, a chicken flock to produce about 70,000 eggs per year, and sheep grazing during parts of the year.The company also will dedicate an easement of the property for a public hiking trail, likely to be managed by either the Livermore Area Recreation and Park District or the East Bay Regional Parks District.This project has had its supporters and detractors, and the camps were pretty evenly split. The Sierra Club supported it because the solar farm would help to bring California closer to its goal of using 50% clean energy sources by 2030 and 100% by 2045. Workers’ unions said the project would bring 400 living-wage, union jobs to the East Bay.On the other hand, Friends of Vineyard and Open Space, which advocates for “open spaces and agricultural lands and the sustainability of its wine industry,” opposed it, along with Friends of Livermore and Save North Livermore Valley. The three groups contend that the solar farm [via Mercury News]:[W]ould tarnish the scenic character of rural north Livermore and conflict with requirements of Measure D, which county voters approved in 2000.Measure D aims to prevent development from sprawling to eastern Alameda County by protecting agriculture, open space, and wildlife. In three separate appeals of a zoning board’s November approval of the solar farm, opponents argued that industrial solar operations aren’t compatible with agriculture and Measure D mandates that any proposed changes to land use must be OK’d by residents.Those three groups intend to file a lawsuit against the solar farm approval.You know what ruins open spaces, agricultural lands, “scenic beauty,” and the wine industry’s beautiful vineyards? Climate change. Smog. Pollution. Particulate matter. Wildfires.In the short term, Alameda County residents might enjoy their solar-panel-free view (and, in my opinioin, they’re not unsightly – they look like “hope” and “clean air” to me, and the land is usually usable around them). But in the long term, that view will be lost forever without renewables. So the opposition groups’ objections are short-sighted. As Sierra Club expressed, every little bit of green energy is going to help everyone – and that includes the California wine industry, who will lose their vineyards to climate change if we don’t act.I’d choose solar panels – and wine – over billowing black fossil fuel smoke every time.",solar
2021/03/09,"Wells Fargo, the third-largest US bank by assets, has said it will set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for its financing activities by 2050. That includes the companies and projects it finances. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup made similar pledges last week. JPMorgan Chase did the same in October 2020, and Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have also said they would adhere to the Paris Agreement.For Wells Fargo, it’s about risk management. Jon Weiss, CEO of corporate and investment banking at Wells Fargo, told CNN Business in an exclusive yesterday: This transition to a lower-carbon economy is real. And we want to be leaning into it, financing it, and helping our clients through it rather than ignoring it.It doesn’t take a scientist to notice our clients are affected by changes in climate. When a wildfire burns down a major portion of California or a once-in-a-century flood occurs every five years, that implies risk to people and companies in its path.There’s no question we’ve made our share of mistakes — and maybe more than our share of mistakes in the past.Between October 2018 and October 2020, Wells Fargo lent $6.3 billion to the coal industry. (Citigroup lent $13.5 billion, Bank of America lent $8.5 billion, JPMorgan Chase lent $7.8 billion, and Goldman Sachs lent $3 billion.) Wells Fargo also helped fund the Dakota Pipeline.And like other big banks, Wells Fargo has yet to say how they’re going to do this [via CNN Business]:The bank said it plans to set and disclose interim targets for select carbon intensive businesses — including oil, gas, and the power sector — by no later than the end of 2022.Danielle Fugere, president of environmental nonprofit As You Sow, which promotes social corporate accountability, said:We will be looking to Wells Fargo to fill in the details of its climate plans by setting interim targets and transparently reporting progress toward those goals.But… there’s a hitch. DeSmogUK did an investigation into boards of directors for big banks, and found that both UK and international banks’ board directors had ties to polluting industries. It looked into the backgrounds of 64 current directors at Barclays, HSBC, NatWest, Lloyds, and Standard Chartered. Board directors tend to be appointed, and can earn up to £100,000 a year for working part-time.DeSmogUK found that “80% of board members at the UK’s five biggest banks have affiliations with environmentally damaging companies.” For example:DeSmog’s analysis shows that almost a quarter of the directors currently sitting on the banks’ boards have a current or past connection to the fossil fuel industry. For instance, Standard Chartered director Gay Huey Evans sits on the board of Conoco Phillips, which has produced more than 15 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions since 1965. Fellow board member Byron Grote also has a long history of working in the oil industry, including for BP, responsible for emitting around 34 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in the same timeframe. He is also a current director of mining company Anglo American.DeSmog also connected the dots between the UK banks and the international banks we discussed above.Nearly half of the banks’ directors also have strong ties to other international banks known to support the fossil fuel industry, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and JP Morgan.For example, Barclays group finance director Tushar Morzaria also has a seat on the board of BP.Barclays director Tushar Morzaria, for instance, has previously been employed by JP Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse, both of which are among the biggest financiers of the fossil fuel industry. JP Morgan alone invested nearly $269 billion in fossil fuels between 2016-2019.You can read the entire article here.

2021/03/08,"Vineyard Wind 1, slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the US, asked the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) under the Biden administration on January 25 to allow its federal permitting process to resume, as Electrek reported. The BOEM is expected to publish a favorable final environmental review of the project today, which would lead to a formal authorization in April (a decision comes 30 days after the review is released, as per federal law). Vineyard Wind 1 is expected to reach financial close in the second half of 2021 and go live in late 2023.Vineyard Wind 1, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, is an 800-megawatt project 15 miles off Martha’s Vineyard. The project will generate electricity for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts and is expected to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1.6 million tons per year. When the project decided to switch to GE Renewable Energy’s Haliade-X turbines, which have a powerful rating of 12-14MW, and paused the federal permitting process to determine whether design changes were necessary, the Trump administration’s BOEM canceled Vineyard Wind 1’s review in December.GCaptain points out [via Bloomberg]:President Joe Biden, who is aggressively pursuing a clean-energy agenda, signed in January an executive order to double wind generation in US waters by 2030. The Vineyard project alone would satisfy that commitment.Several large offshore wind farms are planned off the US East Coast.Wind farms are often wrongly blamed for disproportionately harming birds. The National Audubon Society provided a statement to Electrek about Vineyard Wind’s progress. Garry George, director of the National Audubon Society’s Clean Energy Initiative, said:As the lives of billions of birds hang in the balance due to climate change, responsibly sited and reviewed clean energy projects like Vineyard Wind are critical to their survival.This project shows that it’s entirely possible to boldly pursue a cleaner future while acting responsibly toward wildlife.Clean energy accounted for 47% of Germany’s domestically produced power mix in 2020, up from 42.3% in 2019, according to data released on Friday by Germany’s Federal Statistical Office (Destatis).Wind grew to 25.6%. It surpassed coal, which is down to 24.8% from 29.8% in 2019. Solar also grew marginally, from 7.8% to 9%. Nuclear energy and natural gas came in at 12.1% and 13.6%, respectively. Biogas also grew from 5.5% to 6%.Overall, there was a 5.9% year-on-year drop in Germany’s total power generation in 2020, at 502.6 billion kWh due to the pandemic lockdowns.Destatis writes:The lower total electricity generation as well as the increased share of renewable energies and the decline in electricity feed-in from coal-fired power plants are partly related to the lockdown in spring 2020: The comparatively low electricity demand during this period was largely covered by renewable energies. Due to the feed-in priority for these energy sources, many conventional power plants have been cut back. Only natural gas power plants, which can react more flexibly to fluctuations in electricity feed-in from renewable energy sources compared to other conventional power plants, recorded a slight increase of 3.6% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Germany imported 48% of electricity (a 19.7% increase) and exported 67% of electricity (an 8% drop).If you click on the link above, you can see actual figures in terawatt hours in a chart.Photo: Block Island in Rhode Island, the US’s first offshore wind farm",solar
2021/03/05,"The US is seeing rapid and sudden growth of energy storage, according to the new “US Energy Storage Monitor” report by energy research firm Wood Mackenzie and the US Energy Storage Association.In the fourth quarter of 2020, 2,156 megawatt-hours (MWh) of new energy storage systems were brought online. This is an increase of 182% from the third quarter of 2020, making the fourth quarter the new record quarter for US energy storage.Front-of-the-meter (FTM) projects – that is, energy storage not at residential property, such as utility, power transmission lines, and remote energy storage systems – drove the growth. Four out of every five megawatts deployed in fourth quarter 2020 were FTM (that’s 529 MW out of the total 651 MW), and most of it took place in California. Residential storage saw 90.1 MW installed, again, mostly in California. This is due to a response to the wildfires, generous state government rebates, and cheaper batteries overall.The study predicts that the US will add five times more megawatts of energy storage in 2025 than was added in 2020, with FTM storage continuing to contribute between 75% to 85% of new megawatts each year.Chloe Holden, Wood Mackenzie research analyst, said:[T]he ability of solar-plus-storage to provide backup is increasingly driving sales even in markets without additional incentives, particularly states that suffer from regular power outages. We expect an uptick in home battery sales in Texas in the aftermath of February’s devastating outages.Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), US President Joe Biden’s nominee for Secretary of the Interior, was approved yesterday in an 11-9 vote by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Her nomination will now be sent to the full Senate. She is expected to be confirmed, as Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) has said she will vote for Haaland, and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who voted for her on the Committee, is expected to cast her vote again for her. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), a moderate Democrat who comes from a fossil fuel state, has also confirmed that he would vote for Haaland.She will be the first Native American in this position should she be confirmed. Haaland had a contentious hearing, with senators who support the fossil-fuel industry grilling her over her views on that subject. She replied to Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), who was quite combative during the hearing and ultimately voted no:We need to care as much about the environment as we do about the fossil fuel infrastructure in your states and other states, we need to balance those priorities. Sometimes it might seem like a tricky balancing act, but I feel very strongly that if we have a mind to protect our public lands for future generations, that we’ll also be able to protect jobs for future generations, as well.On the other hand, many groups are elated about the prospect of Haaland being the interior secretary. I received a number of statements of support by email.Nikki Pitre, executive director of the Center for Native American Youth, said:Native youth look to Representative Haaland as a role model, as a fierce defender of their rights and their communities, and as the living representation of the future of Indigenous communities in this country. We urge the full Senate to promptly confirm Representative Haaland as the secretary of the interior. She will be a fierce advocate for all of us, in a way that no one else can.Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, which is made up of current and former National Park employees, said:We need to restore the operating budget of the National Park Service and fill all the vacant positions that exist, including the director of the National Park Service. And our National Park System must better represent our nation’s diverse people, places, and stories. Environmental protections must be restored, and our country needs to seriously address the threat of climate change. We need a leader who will put our irreplaceable resources first. We need someone like Deb Haaland running the Department of the Interior and we urge the Senate to confirm her as soon as possible.Robert Weissman, president of nonprofit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group and think tank Public Citizen, said:Haaland’s confirmation would be historic move, as she will be the first Native American to hold a cabinet post. This change is not only of symbolic importance, it means that tribes and local communities will finally have a voice at the table, rather than just energy and mining industries.Photo: NGEN",solar
2021/03/04,"Milwaukee-headquartered WEC Energy Group has purchased a 90% ownership interest in the Jayhawk Wind Farm, which will be built in Bourbon and Crawford counties, Kansas, from Apex Clean Energy for $302 million. Invenergy, which will operate Jayhawk, will acquire the other 10%.Charlottesville, Virginia-headquartered Apex Clean Energy intends to bring the wind farm online by the end of 2021.The Jayhawk site, which breaks ground this week, will consist of 70 GE wind turbines and generate more than 190MW of power. Facebook has signed a long-term contract to purchase all power generated by this wind farm. The tech giant stepped in after a previous power purchase agreement (PPA) was dissolved.Apex notes on its website:The deal marks Apex’s fourth renewable transaction with Facebook, following a 61.6 MW PPA with Altavista Solar [Campbell County, Virginia]; a 200 MW PPA with Aviator Wind East [Coke County, Texas], part of the largest single-phase, single-site wind project in the United States; and, most recently, a 175 MW PPA with Lincoln Land Wind in [Morgan County,] Illinois.Jayhawk will generate over $20 million in landowner payments and $27.2 million in tax revenue. Apex Clean Energy made a video in late 2019 about the benefits of wind to rural communities in the US, as explained in the words of the residents:In Kansas, 43.3% of electricity comes from wind, ranking the state second in the US in 2020, after Iowa, when it comes to sourcing electricity from wind. The Kansas City Star reported on February 16 that the state’s wind power outperformed fossil fuels during the recent brutal cold snap.The Washington DC-headquartered International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a report yesterday, “Implementing the United States’ Domestic and International Climate Mitigation Goals: A Supportive Fiscal Policy Approach.” Since the US has pledged to meet the Paris Agreement of net zero by 2050, the IMF has offered up suggestions, pointing out:Fiscal policies at the national, sectoral, and international level could play a critical role in implementing these objectives, along with investment, regulatory, and technology policies. Their suggestions across sectors are comprehensive, and here’s an excerpt of what the IMF’s report had to say about road transport, which is currently responsible for 19% of US greenhouse gases:Road transportation is especially difficult to decarbonize through carbon pricing (or highergasoline and diesel excises) alone due to the relatively modest impact it has on retail fuelprices and political resistance to higher road fuel prices at the federal level.There is a federal gas guzzler tax of $7,700 applying to passenger vehicles with fuel economy below 12.5 mpg, a tax credit of $7,500 for EVs, and tax credits of between $4,500 and $7,500 for plugin EVs.Generalizing the gas guzzler tax and EV tax credits with a more comprehensive feebate [when environmentally friendly practices are rewarded while failure to adhere to such practices is penalized] would strengthen incentives for progressively and cost-effectively decarbonizing the vehicle fleet, while avoiding a fiscal cost to the government.A feebate would provide a sliding scale of fees on vehicles with above-average emission rates and a sliding scale of rebates for vehicles with below-average emission rates. That is, each new vehicle would be subject to a fee given by:CO2 price × {CO2/mile – CO2/mile of the new vehicle fleet} × {average lifetime vehicle mileage}EPA-certified fuel economy by model type (currently used to administer the CAFE program) provides the data needed to assess the fees and rebates for each vehicle. The feebate:Promotes the full range of behavioral responses for reducing emission rates, as there is always a continuous reward (lower taxes or higher subsidies) from switching from any vehicle with a higher emission rate to one with a lower emission rate;Is cost effective as the reward is always proportional to the reduction in the emission rate — incontrast under the CAFE program, the reward for additional emissions reductions declineswith higher emission vehicles given the focus on miles per gallon rather CO2 (or gallons) permile; andMaintains (approximate) revenue neutrality — by definition, fees offset rebates as the averageemission rate in the formula is updated over time.The IMF suggests that subsidies for EVs would decline over time as the average fleet emission rate declines. It says that is appropriate as the cost differential between clean vehicles and their gasolinecounterparts falls over time.What do you think of the IMF’s suggestion for the Biden administration? Let us know in the comments below.",solar
2021/03/03,"Electrek‘s Michelle Lewis asked Anthony Allard, EVP, head of North America, Hitachi ABB Power Grids, how the US can make its power grids more resilient and better support clean energy, and what Hitachi ABB is doing to support large-scale electric vehicle deployment.Hitachi ABB Power Grids digitizes all elements of the energy value chain and brings power grids into a sustainable energy future. In July, Hitachi ABB announced Grid eMotion Fleet, an EV charging system for large-scale public transport and commercial mobility. The company will also be providing energy storage systems to support large-scale EV deployments. Electrek: What are the challenges/problems of the US electrical grid, and what does the US need to do in order to update to support the transition to clean energy?Anthony Allard: The pathway toward a carbon-neutral future has one common denominator everywhere you look: It is always built on much more electrification. This is particularly true when it comes to transportation. Vehicles powered by fossil fuels account for approximately 28% of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, replacing gas and diesel-powered vehicles with electric vehicles is an essential element of any decarbonization scheme. Just as important, the electricity used to power them will increasingly need to come from clean, renewable sources.This is a big lift. Transitioning toward reliance on more renewable energy sources will have enormous impacts on power grids. Perhaps the most critical challenge with renewable generation is location. Why? Renewable sources are typically in remote, often rural areas far from where the energy is needed – what we call load centers. They are also often in different locations than the thermal generation sources (coal-fired, mainly) that are currently being retired. Think of this as if we were to build a whole series of new cities in areas where there are currently no roads – transmission systems are those roads.Timing is also a challenge, since renewable sources such as wind and solar cannot be produced on demand but are dependent on the availability of sun or wind. As a result, this energy must be either consumed when generated, transported to available load centers, or stored. Otherwise, the energy is lost, resulting in what the industry calls “spilled kilowatt hours.” As we shift toward the use of more renewables, we need to expand the availability of storage options, such as the use of advanced battery energy storage systems. Additionally, the establishment of high-capacity transmission links from areas where renewables are being generated to the major load centers and to areas with large-scale storage in the form of hydropower can facilitate the sharing of power between regions. This in turn can help address timing challenges, providing greater flexibility to manage peak demand.In addition to the challenges above, it’s important to make sure that the grid is reliable and resilient. Changes in weather patterns, such as increases in extreme weather events, are also presenting challenges for grid operators. The winter storms in Texas and other parts of the central US are just the latest example of how disruptive such events can be. There will be a great deal of effort put into determining what exactly happened and how best to address the issues uncovered. What is clear, however, is that if we are going to rely much more heavily on electricity to power transportation, home heating, industrial processes, and other needs historically supported mainly by fossil fuels, then our power grids will need to be more flexible and resilient in order to support increased electrification and integrate clean energy resources.One of the most important ways to integrate more renewables into the grids and make them more resilient, flexible, and reliable is to upgrade our electrical infrastructure and build more transmission lines. This will require a lot of planning and preparation on both a federal and national level where various stakeholders from federal, national, and state governments, trade associations, grid operators, electrical manufacturers, and many other stakeholders would need to discuss how to implement this plan. Electrek: Who needs to be involved to do that, and how long could it feasibly take?Providing more transmission capacity in different areas than where it exists today is an absolute prerequisite for the integration of more large-scale renewable generation sources into the grid. Transmission systems fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in terms of oversight, but the planning for transmission today is done regionally by ISOs/RTOs, utilities, and transmission companies. The permitting and siting processes for new transmission lines are driven largely by state and local requirements. In the US, transmission lines can take years or even decades to secure the right-of-way, obtain the necessary permits for construction, and build the infrastructure. Local opposition can delay or derail such transmission projects altogether. This can present significant financial risks to developers, who typically need to make very substantial investments during the planning stages, resulting in huge losses if projects are not completed.To date, FERC has provided guidance that helps address some of the challenges associated with integration of large-scale renewables into the grid, such as Order 841 (which deals with storage) and 2222 (which deals with DERs). While these are important steps, they do not directly address the challenge of easing the way for developers to build out the needed transmission infrastructure. The development of an overarching national transmission plan could help provide a bit more clarity and certainty to developers, as they contemplate transmission investments.Electrek: Hitachi ABB Power Grids is working on energy storage systems to make large-scale EV deployments possible. Could you please tell us more about what that is, and how it works?Onsite solar and battery storage systems, along with other grid-edge technologies, will be crucial elements of the evolving electrification infrastructure. Energy storage technologies can be coupled with EV charging infrastructure to give grid operators more flexibility to manage peak demand by spreading consumption throughout the day and avoid any additional loads on the grid during peak demand.Carefully designed networks of charging stations that work in concert with optimized scheduling systems (supported by advanced analytics) can track and balance EV charging demand with both real-time and stored supply. In practice, this can help ensure that costs can be minimized by encouraging vehicle owners to charge their vehicles off-peak, through financial incentives or other demand/response management programs. This managed charging in turn can also lower the contribution of EV charging to overall peak demand for the system, reducing overall pressure on the grid. Anthony Allard is executive vice president, managing director, United States and head of Hitachi ABB Power Grids’ business in North America. Allard was most recently chief operating officer of BECIS, a leading energy as a service solution provider in Singapore. Having spent most of his career in the power sector at GE and Alstom in the US, he held several executive-level positions, including general manager and board member for GE Prolec Transformers in the US. He was also general manager for the GE-XD High Voltage Products partnership and spent 10 years working for Alstom Grid in both North America and the Americas in Strategy and Operations management roles.

2021/03/03,"Moscow currently runs around 600 electric public buses on 33 bus routes – the largest e-bus fleet in Europe ahead of London. The city says it will increase its electric bus fleet to 1,000 by the end of 2021. Moscow’s Department of Transport (DOT) says that the Russian capital will expand its fleet of electric buses to more than 2,000, and reach a total of 2,675 units of e-transport, in the next four years. (The city also has an extensive tram network that it will electrify.)Moscow’s DOT said in a statement sent to Electrek that all of its public transport vehicles will be electric by 2032. It also said that the use of e-buses on Moscow routes reduced the volume of emissions polluting the air by 400 tons in 2020. (That’s 78.4 passenger vehicles driven for one year, according to an EPA equivalency calculator.)For comparison, New York City, population of 8.4 million, has a plan to acquire 500 new electric buses to serve all five boroughs by 2024. It has a total of 4,373 public buses – the world’s largest bus fleet.Reuters reports:‘They are also buying new, more power-efficient trams, which is a good thing,’ said Mikhail Babenko, head of the green economy program at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Russia.Babenko said there was still a long way to go, however, when it came to Muscovites changing their own behavior and turning their backs on cars in favor of greener alternatives.Denis Endachev, CEO for information and intelligent systems at the State Research Center of the Russian Federation (NAMI), said:For a large city with dense traffic and a population of more than 12.6 million people, even a partial transition to e-transport can result in positive changes to air quality.Sunnyvale, California-headquartered Turntide Technologies, a smart electric motor company, today announced the completion of an $80 million funding round, bringing the company’s total funding to date to $180 million.The round was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $1 billion fund founded in 2016 and led by Bill Gates, and includes investments from Robert Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition Ventures, the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Keyframe Capital, Fifth Wall, and Captain Planet LP.  Turntide plans to expand development and production of its Smart Motor System to meet growing demand and extend it into new applications with the new funding.

It will be the largest solar farm in the Northeastern US and deliver enough clean energy to customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island to power more than 12,000 homes.It’s called Gravel Pit Solar, and construction could begin in 2021 and finish in late 2022 or early 2023. The site includes operating gravel pits (and thus the name), raw land, and agricultural fields.New York City-based developer D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments (DESRI) and project developer North Light Energy had secured options on the land from the various owners, according to the Hartford Courant. D.E. Shaw’s website states:Since 2005, we’ve invested in more than 40 solar and wind projects, including the country’s first offshore wind farm.The company is referring to Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island, which was the US’s first wind farm that powered up in 2016.The owners will pay $378,000 annually for 20 years, plus $1.5 million at the beginning of construction. The Courant writes:First Selectman Jason Bowsza said the project ‘presents an opportunity for East Windsor to be a part of the state’s renewable energy goals while seeing a significant increase in local tax revenue for the town.’The state of Connecticut has purchased 20 megawatts of power, while Rhode Island has purchased 50, with the remainder to be sold to additional buyers, officials said.The UK’s 857 megawatt Triton Knoll Offshore Wind Farm off the Lincolnshire coast in the North Sea has started to produce its first power. It is jointly owned by RWE,  which manages its construction, operation and maintenance, J-Power, and Kansai Electric Power.Triton Knoll will be able to power the equivalent of more than 800,000 homes in the UK once it’s fully operational.The project’s website states:First generation follows the installation of the first of the project’s 90 wind turbines in January 2021 and the successful energization of the project’s transmission system including the offshore substation platforms, offshore export cable, onshore cables and onshore substation.Triton Knoll uses 9.5 MW turbines made by Danish firm Vestas, which the project claims is “capable of energizing a typical UK household for more than 29 hours with just a single turn of the blades.”The UK is currently the number-one market for cumulative offshore wind installations, with over 10.2 GW of capacity, reported the Global Wind Energy Council on February 25. China has now overtaken Germany to become the world’s second-largest offshore wind market.The offshore wind industry installed just over 6 GW of new capacity globally in 2020, nearly the same levels as the previous year despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the second-best year for the sector.",solar
2021/03/01,"The Biden administration is calling for action in order to stem climate change for a wide range of sectors, and that of course includes buildings and transport as major emitters. It’s going to require the rapid implementation of innovative new ideas and products.Enter ready-to-roll – literally – “organic energy company” GO-OPV. All the products and applications are manufactured by GO-OPV from organic film printed by Brazilian company Sunew. The product is a thin film called ORENgE that can capture any light and convert it to clean energy in a more efficient way than traditional solar panels. The panels are thin, flexible, ultra lightweight, and can be used both vertically and horizontally.GO-OPV, a Florida-based company, launched ORENgE in the US in November. The technology is already being used in South America, as PepsiCo’s Brazil distribution centers have been working with the power technology for stand-by charging systems, interior lights, and onboard printing. GO-OPV claims ORENgE is “is the only commercial organic technology available in the US that is transparent, non-toxic, flexible, thin, durable, recyclable, sustainable, and cost competitive.”Electrek spoke with Paul Frischer, president of GO-OPV, about how ORENgE works.Can you tell us about your company, GO-OPV?GO-OPV is the leading product and application company bringing its zero-carbon ORENgE organic energy to the US market by providing ultra-low carbon footprint power to buildings (building-integrated photovoltaics), semi-trucks and tractor-trailers, outdoor furniture, and more. GO-OPV’s ORENgE technology is the lightest, most powerful organic energy technology for the growing global base of commercial organic energy applications.What is organic energy, and how does GO-OPV’s technology, ORENgE, work? Organic energy relies on any form of light to produce power, whether it’s indoor, low, or diffused – unlike solar power, which is dependent on sunlight. ORENgE is a recyclable product that provides power through an earth-abundant, low CO2, and sustainable energy solution. ORENgE is an energy source that is printed from organic ink. It is the most sustainable organic energy alternative because it uses recyclable materials abundant in nature. It has the lowest carbon footprint and the lowest energy payback among organic technologies. ORENgE’s use of organic materials is another major differentiator to silicon solar panels that rely on chemicals like cadmium telluride, silicon tetrachloride, and hydrofluoric acid, among others. ORENgE is semi-transparent and integrates to any surface, like building facades, home siding, tractor-trailers, park benches, and more, for applications in vertical or horizontal installation – something else solar can’t do. While ORENgE can be hung vertically, on the sides of buildings, solar panels must be placed on roofs, directly facing the sun. Thanks to its flexibility, ORENgE can also be applied to tractor-trailers and semis, unlike fragile silicon panels.What is ORENgE made of, is it manufactured sustainably, and if so, how?ORENgE is the greenest option among all alternative, renewable power sources due to its printing production process and the organic materials used. To make ORENgE, GO-OPV uses rollable film that is made up of eco-friendly materials (fullerene and non-fullerene-based inks) as well as recyclable earth-abundant materials. The printing production process has the lowest energy demand in manufacturing, resulting in the lowest carbon footprint among renewables.How can ORENgE be used and by whom, and what are the benefits to its users?ORENgE allows for the installation of the ultimate zero-carbon power solution within the building-integrated photovoltaics, trucking, and outdoor sustainability markets. For example:As building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) continues to be integrated into more buildings as a principal or ancillary power source, ORENgE offers a solution that can be applied to glass surfaces and façade applications to power lights in conference rooms 24/7, entire office floors across multiple real estate applications, and UL 924 backup at a zero-carbon footprint.  The transportation industry is in desperate need of solutions addressing zero-carbon power generation. Because ORENgE is lightweight, flexible, and durable, it can be applied to semi-trucks and tractor-trailers to power on-board electronics (printers, credit card machines, lighting, tracking systems, electronic locks, etc.), semi-trailers (wagons that often remain detached from the tractor for long periods of time), and reefer (the refrigeration system of tractor-trailers). With ORENgE, trucks have a longer lifespan, resulting in more income per truck. ORENgE increases battery lifetime and reduces unscheduled maintenance and its direct cost. ORENgE brings its zero-carbon power source to outdoor furniture, so you can charge your phone on park benches and ensure safety at public bus stops with 24/7 light. Because of its sleek design and flexibility, the application possibilities are endless, from beach umbrellas to carports, ORENgE can provide 24/7 outdoor power for daytime and added battery storage for nighttime.How much does ORENgE cost? ORENgE is cost-competitive with all renewable energy sources, since organic energy power is delivered onsite of the required power load demand and, in many cases, the lowest form of energy. ORENgE benefits from the lower cost since the onsite delivery of ORENgE power removes the cost of transmission lines, distribution lines, and higher cost of AC systems.You can check out all of ORENgE’s power stats here. It’s sold to corporate and industrial clients at present, but you can get in touch with the company to discuss possible consumer use.What do you think of this product?

2021/03/01,"A Florida State University research team has developed a way to use a material found in plants to help create safer batteries. Their research was published in the journal Macromolecular Rapid Communications.The team created battery electrolytes, which separate the negative and positive terminals of a battery, using the organic polymer lignin, a compound in the cell walls of plants that makes them rigid. Electrolytes can be either liquid or solid. Solid electrolytes are typically safer, stronger, and can be used at higher temperatures than liquid versions. The team combined lignin with the synthetic polymer polyethylene glycol to create their new type of solid electrolyte.Polyethylene glycol is a popular candidate for solid electrolytes because of its electrochemical stability, but it doesn’t conduct well at room temperature, which limits the abilities of batteries using that material to power something or to rapidly charge.Lignin’s chemical structure contains high concentrations of derivatives from a compound called benzene, which makes it strong. By using lignin, the battery keeps the strength and safety that comes with a typical solid electrolyte but gains the ability to function well at room temperature and makes the battery more sustainable.Lignin is cheap and abundant. About 50 million tons are produced each year globally, and most of that is a waste product from the paper industry. US president Joe Biden on Friday restored an Obama-era calculation on the economic cost of greenhouse gases. The interim figure, which will be revised by January 2022, is $51 for every ton of carbon released into the atmosphere. Former president Donald Trump’s carbon cost was $8. Trump did not factor in the global impacts of pollution. It will make it easier for Biden’s agencies to approve actions to fight climate change.Heather Boushey wrote in a White House blog:The Interagency Working Group — co-chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of Management and Budget, and Council of Economic Advisers — today announced it is replacing the previous administration’s estimates with the estimates developed prior to 2017, adjusted for inflation.This interim step will enable Federal agencies to immediately and more appropriately account for climate impacts in their decision-making while we continue the process of bringing the best, most up-to-date science and economics to the estimation of the social costs of greenhouse gases.Reuters reports:Economists Nicholas Stern and Joseph Stiglitz this week said that the Working Group should not “settle on anything much below $100 per ton by 2030 for the social cost of carbon” when it replaces the interim number to be able to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, limiting the rise of global temperatures to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.Photo: Min An/Pexels.com",solar
2021/02/26,"Toyota Motor Corporation and Woven Planet Holdings, Inc., the Toyota Group company responsible for a wide range of mobility development projects, broke ground this week on a futuristic prototype city, designed by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan.Toyota Woven City (Toyota was originally a loom maker) will be sited at the old vehicle yard adjacent to the former Higashi-Fuji Plant site of Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc.The plan, announced in January 2020 at CES in Las Vegas, will be a hydrogen-powered quarter housing 2,000 people. Toyota writes:Woven City is a project that will demonstrate a human-centered approach to community development. In Toyota’s shift from an automobile manufacturer to a mobility company, the project will bring new technology to life in a real-world environment across a wide range of areas, such as automated driving, personal mobility, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). It is expected to provide a number of opportunities for businesses and researchers around the world.Woven City will have three types of streets interwoven with each other on the ground level, one dedicated to automated, zero-emissions driving, one to pedestrians, and one to pedestrians with personal mobility vehicles. There will also be one underground road used to transport goods.Global Construction Review notes:The buildings themselves will be made mostly of wood, using traditional Japanese wood joinery combined with robotic production methods. Rooftops will be covered in photovoltaic panels to supplement the hydrogen fuel cells that will supply the bulk of the energy needed. Food will be grown using hydroponics.The community will start with roughly 360 residents, mainly senior citizens, families with young children, and inventors, and will eventually have a population of more than 2,000, including Toyota employees. The smart-city platform is designed to be exportable to other countries. Toyota did not give a completion date on its website.The US Senate has confirmed former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm as secretary of the Department of Energy. The Senate backed Granholm by 64 to 35, including 14 Republicans from several states, including North Dakota and Montana, that produce fossil fuels.Reuters reports:Granholm wants to boost jobs in manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and wind and solar power, and is likely to play a big role in Biden’s goal to put the country on a path of decarbonizing the economy by 2050.She said during Senate hearings that critical minerals, used in batteries for EVs and to support the electric grid, in wind turbines and solar panels, can be mined responsibly in the United States.It’s the honor of my life to serve as Secretary of @Energy. America's future is bright, and it will be powered by clean energy union jobs right here at home. pic.twitter.com/kTEitRZnKlSenator Joe Manchin (D-WV), the chairman of the Senate energy committee, said:I saw how she handled the difficult challenges facing her during the Great Recession, when the bottom dropped out of the auto industry in her state.She helped save the domestic auto industry; she diversified Michigan’s economy; she brought in new investment in new industry and she created new jobs, leaving no worker behind.She has the leadership skills, the vision and the compassion … to face the climate challenge and at the same time preserve our energy security, protect our national security, clean up the Cold War legacy and preserve our scientific and technological prowess.Granholm will be the second woman in the role of energy secretary after Hazel O’Leary during the Clinton administration.Images: Toyota",solar
2021/02/25,"The state of Mississippi is getting its very first wind farm. Lawmakers said Wednesday that the $250 million wind farm, Tunica Wind Power LLC, is planned for Tunica County, near Memphis, Tennessee.Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley said [via Mississippi Today]:[The wind farm] will have 100 wind turbines on 13,000 acres in Tunica, be a 200-megawatt facility, able to power at max capacity 7,000 homes.In light of what we’ve seen in Texas, we will be asking them about their winterization efforts.Further, Mississippi will also be getting its third solar farm, a $140 million to $160 million solar farm for Chickasaw County. Both projects will get county tax breaks, reducing the ad valorem tax assessment on property for the projects from 15% to 8%. The Chickasaw solar project is expected to generate more than $800,000 a year for the county.The two new wind and solar farms will only sell power wholesale to the Tennessee Valley Authority or nationally.It’s a welcome announcement: Mississippi’s predominant source of energy is natural gas, at 73.96%, followed by nuclear at 16.73%.President Joe Biden nominated Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM) to head the Interior Department, which oversees more than 500 million acres of public lands. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American to hold the position. Republicans, particularly from Western states, view her as a threat, calling her “radical,” and have grilled her during her confirmation hearing about the Keystone XL pipeline and fossil-fuel drilling on federal lands. Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) tweeted:My statement after meeting with @JoeBiden’s nominee to head @Interior. pic.twitter.com/fW0vCCVnNDThis is because Haaland said in 2019 that she is against fracking and drilling on public lands, and she supported the Standing Rock Sioux protesters in North Dakota in 2016 who opposed the Dakota pipeline.On Tuesday, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) said to Haaland, “I almost feel like your nomination is sort of this proxy fight over the future of fossil fuels.”The New York Times reports:But even before her hearing had concluded, the Republican National Committee sent out an email urging senators to vote against Ms. Haaland, writing, “By nominating Haaland, Biden is embracing far-left special interest groups who do not care what jobs they destroy, do not know the true impacts of their policies, and have no answers on when they can get Americans back to work.”But here’s the game-changer. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who heads the Senate Energy Committee, announced Wednesday that he would vote to confirm Haaland, saying that she has a “strong commitment to bipartisanship.” Manchin comes from a coal-mining state, so often sides with Republicans on fossil-fuel issues. So his vote for confirmation is crucial. If the Senate splits 50/50, then Vice President Kamala Harris will cast her vote, and Haaland will be confirmed.That saying, she seems to have support from some of Alaska’s Republican legislators, so Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) is a possible confirmation. Alaska’s population is 18% Native American. Haaland was introduced to the Senate committee by Representative Don Young (R-AK), who said:You may be wondering why I am doing this… I have had her reach across the aisle to talk to me about Alaska. She’s bipartisan.Anyone who thinks we’re going to call off fossil fuels immediately is smoking pot. That’s legal, by the way, in the state of Alaska.Native American leaders also weighed in on the grilling Haaland has received in her confirmation hearing:“She is a Brown, traditional Indigenous woman who cares about the land and future generations,” Ashley McCray, a member of the Absentee Shawnee and Oglala Lakota nations and an organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Grist. “At the foundation of that, she is unsettling settler colonialism which is really what the United States government is.”",solar
2021/02/25,"Systemic tax abuse, corruption, and money laundering slow down climate action, says the United Nations’ High-Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda (FACTI Panel).The FACTI Panel, which includes former world leaders and central bank governors, business and civil society heads and academics, says bankers, lawyers, and accountants who enable financial crime must face punitive sanctions.The panel has today released its final report, “Financial Integrity for Sustainable Development,” in which it says stronger laws and institutions are needed to prevent cross-border corruption and money laundering. As much as 2.7% of the global GDP is laundered by criminals annually.Electrek spoke with Dalia Grybauskaitė, FACTI co-chair and the former president of Lithuania, about how governments can tackle climate change with global finance reform.Electrek: FACTI’s unified aim is to foster a system of “financial integrity for sustainable development.” What is the connection between global finance reform and the fight against climate change, and how could global finance reform effectively promote renewable energy?Dalia Grybauskaitė: The transformation of the financial system must be in parallel with the transformations being developed to address climate change and ensure sustainable investment. At the moment, money laundering, tax abuse, and corruption take billions of dollars out of public finance and governments have less to invest in fighting climate change, for example, in financing the switch to renewable energies. Electrek: The Panel proposes a Global Pact for Financial Integrity for Sustainable Development. How could the Global Pact be enforced – how do you get every country on board – and again, how would that further the growth of renewables and promote the Paris Agreement?Dalia Grybauskaitė: Governments, businesses and their boards, finance professionals like lawyers, accountants and bankers, journalists, civil society and individuals all have responsibilities toward financial integrity for sustainable development.Progress will be achieved by strengthening laws, policies, and institutions at a national, regional, and international level. On the international level, the present global architecture to tackle corruption, money laundering, and tax abuse is fragmented, ineffective and inadequate. The system is only as strong as its weakest link. That is why the FACTI Panel called for greater coordination and strengthened international cooperation. This requires inclusive processes so that the developing countries can have their voices heard and the international community can decide together on effective solutions.By strengthening international agreements and peer review processes, even countries with the largest challenges can witness improvements. It’s not just about increasing the investment in sustainable development, for example financing clean energy, but about rebuilding trust in institutions., both national and international. Strengthening trust in multilateralism can feed into stronger support for climate agreements as well.Electrek: The executive summary of the report states that “the creation of financial integrity for sustainable development requires nothing less than a transformation of the global financial system.” This is a monumental, albeit necessary, task. What do you think that transformation would look like and require, and what it is going to take to get countries like the US and Russia and Brazil onboard? How do you align so many countries that have radically different financial systems, and how do you overcome some leaders’ suspicion of globalism?Dalia Grybauskaitė: The FACTI Panel outlines an achievable blueprint for governments requiring greater transparency, enhanced accountability, and more cooperation at the national, regional, and global levels. With a fraction of the billions that are currently being hidden, governments could mobilize public resources to invest in education, healthcare, livelihoods, the green economy, promote human rights, and inclusive societies.The biggest countries have all signed up to the SDGs and Paris Agreement, this will help deliver them. All countries have an interest in a safe and secure financial system. They are already part of international efforts on money laundering, corruption, and tax transparency. With political determination, countries can only gain by enacting these recommendations.Electrek: Tech giants like Amazon and Google are leaders in working toward fighting climate change, yet have been criticized for not paying their fair share of taxes globally. Large companies are often not transparent about what percentage they are actually contributing toward fighting climate change. They make announcements about “a large amount of money” devoted to fighting climate change (looking at you, Big Oil), when in fact it is actually a small percentage of their total revenue. What more could those companies do financially in order to support the renewable industry and fight climate change, and how can we get them to be more transparent about what they are actually doing?Dalia Grybauskaitė: The FACTI Panel recommends a minimum global corporate income tax rate on profits to stop corporations shopping around for tax-free jurisdictions. There should also be fair taxation of digitalized economic activity, so digital and traditional businesses are taxed equitably, based on group global profit. The money recovered should be used by governments to support sustainable development, including action on renewables. The money governments lose due to corporations shopping around for tax-free jurisdictions – estimates are up to $600 billion a year – could have a profound impact if spent on sustainable development, such as the fight against climate change.Human-rights defenders, anti-corruption advocates, investigative journalists, and whistle-blowers need protection and a safe environment so as to demand more transparency and hold corporations and public officials to account for all of their impacts on sustainable development.Dalia Grybauskaitė served as president of Lithuania from 2009 to 2019. She is the country’s first woman president and the only president in Lithuania’s post-Soviet history to have served two consecutive terms.As a European Union commissioner for financial programming and budgets, she was elected Commissioner of the Year in 2005. She served as finance minister for Lithuania from 2001 to 2004. She served as minister plenipotentiary in the Lithuanian Mission to the European Union, as deputy chief negotiator for Lithuania’s Association Agreement with the European Union, and as minister plenipotentiary in the Lithuanian Mission to the United States. Within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she was director of the Economic Relations Department, responsible for economic diplomacy and development assistance.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/02/24,"Xos, Inc., a leading manufacturer of electric Class 5 to Class 8 commercial vehicles, and NextGenAcquisition Corp., a publicly traded special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), announced Monday that they have entered into a business combination agreement that will result in Xos becoming a publicly listed company on Nasdaq. The combined company is expected to be traded under “XOS.” The business combination values the company at $2 billion.Xos believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on the electrification of the $100 billion market for medium- and heavy-duty last-mile commercial electric vehicles. (“Last mile” is the movement of goods from a transportation hub to the final delivery destination.) Xos has a more than 6,000-unit backlog of contracted and optional orders.Demand in the last-mile commercial EV market is expected to grow at a 35% compound annual growth rate through 2040 as electric vehicles replace ICE vehicles.

2021/02/19,"Despite what some Texas officials are stating (thus causing a lot of misinformation to fly around), frozen wind turbines did not cause the state’s widespread outages, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the state’s power grid. It said that failures in wind and solar power were the “least significant factor in the blackout,” according to Reuters.ERCOT CEO Bill Magness says bottom line, the cause of this failure is the storm. And demand for electricity during the weekend cold front far exceeded what ERCOT predicted for a winter storm. Here’s an interview with Magness on ABC News on February 17:Dan Woodfin, a senior director at ERCOT, said on Tuesday [via the Texas Tribune]:It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system.The Tribune continues:It’s estimated that of the grid’s total winter capacity, about 80% of it, or 67 gigawatts, could be generated by natural gas, coal, and some nuclear power. Only 7% of ERCOT’s forecasted winter capacity, or 6 gigawatts, was expected to come from various wind power sources across the state.‘Texas is a gas state,’ said Michael Webber, an energy resources professor at the University of Texas at Austin.While Webber said all of Texas’ energy sources share blame for the power crisis, the natural gas industry is most notably producing significantly less power than normal.We at Electrek would like to reiterate that Texas leads the US in wind, and solar is rapidly increasing, despite the fact that natural gas still dominates.So why did some wind turbines fail (and others continued to function, thus making up lost power due to failure of natural gas), particularly when wind turbines function just fine in much colder climates? First of all, Texas wind turbines aren’t equipped with cold weather packages, which can involve a number of precautions such as heating up turbine components and lubricants. This is because the state typically does not experience extreme cold. Newsweek spoke to various experts, and here’s what a couple of them had to say:In Northern Europe, wind power operates very reliably in even colder temperatures, including the upper Arctic regions of Finland, Norway, and Sweden.As long as wind turbines are properly maintained and serviced, they can operate reliably in temperatures well below zero. Humans, to carry out servicing and maintenance and operation, are the most important factor, not the weather.Also:With the current range of anti-icing measures available, wind power is an effective source of energy in cold climates, because icing can be managed and the quality of wind that is normally available in colder locations.Although fossil fuels may have met our needs in the past, they have caused significant problems for the environment and to our health. They are also a finite resource which is reducing with the growing market demand for energy, so relying on them would not be a wise long-term strategy.The US added a record amount of wind and solar energy in 2020, according to BloombergNEF and Business Council for Sustainable Energy yesterday, who released their annual Sustainable Energy in America Factbook.

2021/02/18,"US geothermal company Dandelion Energy yesterday announced the close of a $30 million Series B round of funding, bringing the company’s total funding to $65 million. The raise was led by Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from existing investors.This new investment enables the company to expand operations while continuing to invest in research and development. The Dandelion team began working on creating more cost-effective geothermal solutions while working at Google parent company Alphabet’s X lab, and in May 2017, Dandelion launched as an independent company. More than 70% of energy usage in homes comes from heating, cooling, and water heating. Installing a geothermal heating and cooling system can reduce a home’s carbon emissions by as much as 80%, and eliminate the need to buy heating fuel. Dandelion’s business model aligns federal, state, and utility incentives so that homeowners can upgrade to geothermal for less than they’re currently paying to heat and cool their home. In 2020, Dandelion saw a $12 million Series A-1 in January 2020, developed a fully virtual sales and design process, and surpassed 100,000 tons of carbon emissions avoided.Michael Sachse, CEO of Dandelion, told Electrek:We cannot reach our climate goals and achieve what science demands without cleaning up residential heating and cooling — and geothermal is the best, most efficient solution. Our innovations in technology, installation, and the business model have cut costs and improved the product. Now, we’re positioned to make residential geothermal take off over the next decade — and reach a market that the Department of Energy says is more than 26 million homes. We’re excited to partner with [Breakthrough Energy] and all our investors to bring sustainable heating and cooling to the mass market.Oh, and if you live in New York or Connecticut and want a green energy job, Dandelion is hiring.Read more: Japan has installed a Scottish-built tidal turbine that has generated its first 10MWh of green electricity after 10 days in use.Simec Atlantis Energy (SAE) designed and manufactured the tidal turbine, and then assembled and tested it in nine weeks, at its base at Nigg Energy Park north of Inverness, Scotland.

2021/02/17,"French energy company Total aims to have 100 gigawatts (GW) of gross wind and solar energy generation capacity by 2030, making it a frontrunner among oil giants shifting into renewables.In comparison, Shell hasn’t set a target, as it says it’s focusing on green power sales, and BP’s target is 50 GW by 2030. Italy-based Enel leads, as it has a 145 GW target and says it wants to be a “renewables supermajor.”Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne said today that “in 2030, [Total] will have invested in 100 gigawatts of gross capacities; this is the objective and it will be spread in … 30 countries around the world.”The company is building on its pledge of developing 35 GW by 2025, which it announced in September 2020. Total has already secured a pipeline of capacity needed to achieve that goal, according to Recharge.Last week, Total was “among winners in Britain’s first major auction of offshore wind farm leases in more than a decade,” Reuters reported.Recharge continues:Pouyanne told a French business magazine in a recent interview that ‘for a company like Total to shift 15% of its portfolio to electricity, or nearly 100GW, by 2030, we will have to finance more than $60 billion worth of projects over a period of ten years.’Pouyanne said to financial analysts last week:We want to anchor this transformation in our identity.

2021/02/16,"Microsoft cofounder, philanthropist, and innovator Bill Gates just released his much anticipated book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. He describes it, simply, as “a plan for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions.” And as usual, the internet is responding with polarized excitement and conspiracy theories.Gates came to turn his attention to climate change through his Gates Foundation work on the problem of energy poverty in such places as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.He guest edited for Fortune magazine today on a package called Blueprint for a climate breakthrough – the first-ever guest editor in Fortune‘s 91-year history. Clifton Leaf, the editor-in-chief of Fortune, explains why Gates’ climate book inspired their editorial team to ask him to collaborate with them:In the midst of the death and economic destruction of the coronavirus, Bill — like so many other experts and globally minded citizens — could see what was lurking just over the horizon: an even more colossal danger to life as we know it.And it turns out, he’d written a book on it.When I read that book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, which debuts today, I was struck by how clear the message is. In my own view, Bill has written the most comprehensible explanation for what’s driving our warming planet; how to measure the impact of the myriad contributions to this staggering and seemingly incalculable problem; and ultimately how to go about finding more effective approaches to each of them. It’s the closest thing I’ve seen to a how-to guide for addressing the climate crisis. And I knew then that I wanted to devote Fortune, for a day at least, to getting out that message. The next step was to see if Bill wanted to be part of that effort, and I’m thrilled he agreed.Gates also released a video on February 14 explaining his reasoning for writing How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, and states of his outlook, “It’s our power to invent that makes me hopeful”:As Electrek reported in December 2016, Gates and other notable billionaires from Richard Branson to Jack Ma founded Breakthrough Energy, a $1 billion fund to invest in and scale up clean energy tech and innovation in order to help the world to reach net zero by 2050. It’s grown since its founding, and in a post today, Gates explained Breakthrough Energy to Fortune:[Breakthrough Energy] is a network of programs, funds, and advocacy efforts, all designed to get clean-energy technologies into the market faster.And then deployed at scale.As Breakthrough Energy’s Amy Harder tweeted, it’s redesigned its website so that it’s easier for everyone to understand what it’s working to achieve:To many people, including my sources & myself before I was hired, @Breakthrough Energy has been a bit of a black box. With Bill's new book out today, we have a snazzy–and quite informative–new website that opens up this box for all to see. Check it out! https://t.co/rBN1xnyUHH https://t.co/iC1vpqMOADGates sees Breakthrough Energy as one tool to implement the ideas in his book, as he explains on his blog, Gates Notes:We’ll be supporting great thinkers and cutting-edge technologies and businesses, as well as pushing for public- and private-sector policies that will speed up the clean energy transition. Over the coming weeks and months, we’ll be turning the ideas in my book into action and trying to turn this plan into reality.He’s steered by three basic premises:First of all, a disclaimer. I used to write and edit for News Deeply, and one of our projects, Women’s Advancement Deeply, was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. We got to do great, meaningful work on important issues. We were grateful for the financial support.And once again, Gates is putting his money behind another topic I care about. As a result, I have a positive bias toward him.So I don’t understand the hatred or the fear other people feel. I googled, “Why do people hate Bill Gates?” There are a lot of articles. It turns out, for example, that a Forbes writer doesn’t get it, either. John Brandon explored the conspiracy theory that Gates wants to inject microchips in people. He concluded that the theories are so bizarre that people must just hate billionaires.Oh, and he’s not responsible for COVID, either – Reuters fact checked that bizarre theory. In fact, Reuters helpfully lists all those COVID conspiracy theories about Gates:Many instances of misinformation related to COVID-19 have referenced Gates. These include, but are not limited to, a false claim that the pandemic is a hoax in which an old Gates quote about pandemic readiness is used (here); false or misrepresented claims that Gates plans to microchip people to fight coronavirus (here and here); a false claim that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was linked to conspiracy over patents (here); and a false claim that linked Bill Gates to a pharmaceutical company that may develop a vaccine for the virus (here).Today, Twitter is freaking out about Gates suggesting we reduce our meat consumption, just one small part of his suggestions to help tackle climate change. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) dove right in this afternoon with a response (since nothing else is going on in Texas):I just did a long interview with @BillGates and that’s not what he said at all. He still loves cheeseburgers but also tries to each more plant-based ones. But knock yourself out with your feckless, actually synthetic trolling. Here’s the actual interview: https://t.co/8Bv57OPrOT https://t.co/zf2bzVh0XmSo I’ll be honest. I find the hysteria exasperating. I’ll leave you with another Gates video that I find immensely helpful that explains what we can all do to fight climate change. And no, I’m not worried he’s going to put a microchip in my veggie burger or my much-anticipated COVID vaccine. He has better things to do.Let us know your (non-conspiracy-theory-based) thoughts in the comments section below.Photo: Luke MacGregor via TIME",solar
2021/02/16,"Texas is experiencing very cold temperatures that the Lone Star State isn’t used to – and that is severely impacting its power grid. As of time of writing, it’s 15F in Houston (-9C), 11F in Austin (-12C), and 5F (-15C) in Dallas. Much of the northern US deals with these sorts of temperatures every winter, and places like Scandinavia and Russia don’t blink an eye, but this is new to Texas.The Texas grid is run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a nonprofit controlled by the state legislature. Nearly the entire state is part of a single grid that lacks extensive integration with surrounding states’ grids, which is unusual.Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX), who thanked President Joe Biden for a federal emergency declaration for Texas on Sunday, released a statement yesterday:Due to the severe weather and freezing temperatures across our state, many power companies have been unable to generate power, whether it’s from coal, natural gas, or wind power.To avoid large-scale blackouts and damage to the grid, ERCOT began implementing outages shortly after 1 a.m. Monday while the companies that generate power work to restore power generation.It’s not just because a portion of the wind turbines froze (remember that Texas leads the US in wind energy). Wind turbines operate successfully in freezing temperatures in Antarctica and Europe’s North Sea. The Austin American Statesman explains:Wind farms across the state generate up to a combined 25,100 megawatts of energy. But unusually moist winter conditions in West Texas brought on by the weekend’s freezing rain and historically low temperatures have iced many of those wind turbines to a halt.As of Sunday morning, those iced turbines comprise 12,000 megawatts of Texas’ installed wind generation capacity, although those West Texas turbines don’t typically spin to their full generation capacity this time of year.Fortunately… the storm’s gusty winds are spinning the state’s unfrozen coastal turbines at a higher rate than expected, helping to offset some of the power generation losses because of the icy conditions. ERCOT told Bloomberg that problems were widespread across generating sources, including coal, natural gas, and even nuclear plants. Of the 34,000 megawatts of generation forced off on Monday, the grid operator said about 20,000 MW was thermal, with about 14,500 MW of wind, according to E&E News.ArsTechnica reports:In the past, severe cold has caused US supplies of natural gas to be constrained, as use in residential heating competes with its use in generating electricity. But that doesn’t explain the shortfalls in coal and nuclear, and the ERCOT executive wasn’t willing to speculate.Authorities will probably need several weeks, if not longer, to fully understand how so much generating capacity was taken offline at what turned out to be a period of critical demand. But the event drives home the fact that balancing supply and demand on the grid has always been a challenge and prone to failure at times of extreme heat and cold. While the variability of renewable supplies will undoubtedly increase the challenge, the growing emphasis on pairing them with storage may ultimately help smooth out some of the problems in the coming decades.We should be able to restore some customers this afternoon due to additional wind & solar output, & additional thermal generation that has told us they expect to become available. But, the amount we restore will depend on how much generation is actually able to come online.In other words, time to upgrade the US grids, as Electrek reported this week, to include boosting storage. In the meantime, Texans: If you’re lucky enough to have power, help out ERCOT by turning off your nonessential appliances (TV is not an essential appliance, folks), turn off unnecessary lights, turn down your heat as low as you can stand, and layer up. Good luck.Ford has become the first US automaker to join the Washington State-headquartered Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), the automaker reported yesterday in a press release. It says it is committing to sustainably source all raw materials used in vehicles globally.Ford has also committed to lead the electric vehicle and sustainable mobility revolution and nearly doubled, to $22 billion, what it will invest in developing EVs and create solutions.  That work will increase the company’s reliance on mined material, particularly related to production of electric vehicle batteries.Sue Slaughter, Ford’s purchasing director for supply chain sustainability, said:Everything we make and everything that goes into our products throughout the supply chain must not only comply with local laws, but follow our commitment to sustainability and human rights protection.Joining IRMA helps us and other companies consistently achieve that goal by forwarding best practices to address environmental, social, and governance issues.Ford says it will continue to conduct outreach to mining companies to engage with IRMA and undergo assurance.Photo: CBS DFW",solar
2021/02/15,"Duster Funeral Home is a family-owned and operated funeral home that has served Tarentum, Pennsylvania, northeast of Pittsburgh, and its surrounding communities since 1938. It was founded by the late Albert H. Duster Sr. and is currently run by Albert’s two sons, J. Rodney and R. Gary Duster. So it’s got history and roots, but this is a funeral home that is trailblazing, as it’s thinking about its clean energy future – or what they call “going green.”The Duster brothers just bought a Tesla Model Y as a fleet vehicle (yes, it’s black, as pictured), and say they will buy more EVs to convert to a fully electric fleet. I wonder if Tesla will start making hearses? Duster brothers, call Elon. I bet he would if you asked. Otherwise, convert a Cybertruck. That would be cool. Someone converted a Tesla Model S into a hearse in the Netherlands in 2017. Check it out [via CleanTechnica]:According to the National Directory of Morticians Redbook, the number of funeral homes in the US as of 2019 is 19,136. J. Rodney Duster said he doesn’t know of any other funeral homes locally, state, or in the US that have a plan to go green like their funeral home, according to TribLive:We’re going to be aggressive with it. Short term expensive, long term you gain.The Duster brothers’ five-year green plan includes going all EV and switching to solar. They have already installed all LED lighting, which they say has significantly brought down their electricity costs, and switched to furniture that is manufactured without the use of chemicals.Duster Funeral Home also offers environmentally sustainable funerals, in which chemicals are not used in the body. It is then placed into the ground in a biodegradable coffin or shroud. Currently there are some 160 natural burial cemeteries in the US. Only a few are designated Conservation Ground burial sites that specifically aim to restore a natural habitat.The Scottish government has awarded more than £633,000 ($880,000) to 45 e-bike projects across the country.Through previous rounds of the eBike Grant Fund, almost £2 million ($2.7 million) has been awarded to 104 organizations across Scotland, providing people with access to 830 e-bikes.The eBike Grant Fund is delivered through Energy Saving Trust, an independent organization dedicated to promoting energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, and sustainable energy use. In the latest round, schools, hospitals, and community groups will establish projects to adopt e-bikes, adaptive bikes, and e-cargo bikes as an alternative to cars. For the first time, more than £223,000 ($310,000) of this overall funding package is enabling specific projects that directly support key workers during the pandemic. For example, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Simon Community Scotland is being provided with a grant of almost £16,000 ($22.2K) to support their outreach work in helping vulnerable people through the assistance of e-bikes.Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, infrastructure, and connectivity, said:In our latest round of funding for e-bikes I’m delighted that more organizations will be able to assist communities and key workers in discovering the benefits of what modern e-bikes can bring.To help keep the country moving during the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve targeted some of this funding to support key and essential workers.I ride an e-bike – and it’s completely transformed what I thought was possible on two wheels. I’m pleased that with this funding more people and communities will discover how e-bikes and e-cargo bikes can meet their transport needs while improving Scotland’s air quality, health, and sense of well-being.Photo: Shane Dunlap/Tribune Review",solar
2021/02/12,"Scientists at the University of Maryland have developed a transparent wood that “is a promising candidate for applications in energy-efficient buildings” – and the method they used is surprisingly simple.Researchers at the University of Maryland recently published a paper in Science Advances titled, “Solar-assisted fabrication of large-scale, patternable transparent wood.” Transparent wood isn’t a new idea, but energy-efficient transparent wood is, and that’s what this group of researchers have achieved.Wood is made of cellulose, which are tiny fibers, and lignin, which bonds those fibers together. Lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which make the wood brown. So scientists have been trying to remove the lignin, but they’ve previously used hazardous chemicals and high temperatures. The old method was also time consuming.But these researchers changed the lignin rather than removing it, and their method is much more simple. CBC explains:Starting with planks of wood a meter long and one millimeter thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened. This made the white wood transparent.The wood made with the new method is 90% transparent. Here’s a short demonstration video:Transparent wood made using this new method could replace window glass, as it provides much better insulation. Glass windows are a major source of heat or cooling loss. Plus, the transparent wood is much more durable than glass. (I’d just like to add that I’d be extremely enthusiastic to have this in my window openings, as I live in an area prone to hurricanes. These could put the hurricane shutter companies out of business.)It also doesn’t take high temperatures to manufacture transparent wood using this method.This transparent wood is lighter, and the team found it to be 50 times stronger than transparent wood made the old way. So it could potentially be used as load-bearing walls – as in, entire transparent walls, like on big glass buildings. And the researchers say it could be used for roofs, too. Imagine the light, without the energy loss.Photo: Qinqin Xia/University of Maryland/Science Advances",solar
2021/02/12,"Is the US national grid ready to handle the surge in electric vehicles? It’s doable, but it’s going to take a really clear and well executed plan. The New York Times pointed out four key actions that need to occur, and we summarize them here:Build more charging stations: President Joe Biden has set a goal of building 500,000 new public chargers by 2030. This is going to require public spending and government coordination. Further, it’s easier for people in single-family homes to install EV chargers, even though it costs a couple thousand dollars (incentives would help), but not so much for those who park their cars on the street. One recent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used detailed modeling to see where it might make most sense to build all this infrastructure. New chargers on residential streets, as well as high-speed charging stations along highways, would go a long way to supporting an electric-vehicle boom.Further, as Electrek reported earlier this week, Electrify America just installed 30 solar EV charging stations in rural California that are free for customers. How about more of those, please?Generate more electricity: Utilities will probably need to build a lot of new power plants and upgrade their transmission networks. That’s going to take careful planning.In 2018, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute looked at what a shift to electric vehicles would mean for the power grid in every state. While Americans would likely pay more for electricity as utilities made necessary upgrades, that would be offset by fuel savings from not having to buy gasoline anymore.Stagger charging times: If everyone plugs in at once, it may put strain on the national grid. So if utilities offer cheaper rates during off-peak hours, then they’ll be better able to handle the demand. Southern California Edison does this already, offering cheaper rates during the day when there is plenty of solar power.A 2019 study by Boston Consulting Group concluded that utilities could reduce by 70% the costs of grid upgrades over the next decade by shifting to “optimized” charging.Create a cleaner grid: Transport makes up one-third of the US’ emissions a year. EVs help, but it’s a bit ridiculous to be plugging into a grid ultimately powered by fossil fuels. So utilities need to get off the fossil fuels and onto renewables to truly make the transport clean. One recent study by Carnegie Mellon University found that if America’s grid was close to emissions-free, and if about 84% of all vehicle travel was electrified, transportation emissions from light-duty vehicles would fall by 90%.Nonprofit, consumer rights advocacy group, and think tank Public Citizen released a study this week called “Big Oil’s Capitol Hill Allies: Oil-Funded Lawmakers Resist Biden’s Energy and Climate Plans.” It’s a report that should surprise absolutely no one.US lawmakers who most vehemently oppose Biden’s energy plans receive the most money from the fossil fuel industry.On January 26, the Department of the Interior imposed a 60-day moratorium on oil and gas leasing, drilling permits, and lease extensions on federal land. On January 27, 29 Republican members of the 70-member Congressional Western Caucus condemned Biden’s expansion of the moratorium in a statement.Public Citizen analyzed campaign finance data for those 29 lawmakers in the Congressional Western Caucus, a bipartisan caucus within the US House of Representatives that refers to themselves as “the voice of the West.” The analysis of data from the Center for Responsive Politics shows these 29 members received a combined $13.4 million over their careers from fossil fuel interests and $23.6 million from energy and natural resources interests.Ironically, because Big Oil companies have stockpiled permits, the pause may not even make that great of an impact. Further, the market is going to ultimately kill fossil fuel demand as renewables and EV demand grows. So their statement is political posturing. Here’s an example:House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called President Biden’s executive order “a political stunt crafted to pacify the radical, left-wing of his party [that] will cause overwhelming devastation to California’s energy industry, potentially jeopardizing more than 360,000 oil and natural gas-related jobs.”Guess who has had the most contributions from career fossil fuels/natural resources? McCarthy. $2,097,961 from oil and gas, and $3,831,688 from energy and natural resources. McCarthy’s district is a major hub of oil drilling. McCarthy’s top donors over his career include Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Steve Scalise (R-LA), the second-ranking House Republican – and energy and commerce minority whip – represents much of the New Orleans area, a major area for offshore oil drilling. And he comes in second for fossil-fuel contributions.Kinda interesting how the first and second-ranked House Republicans also get the most money from fossil fuels.To see the full list of who gets what in that list of 29, it’s here. It’s always about the money, folks.And to reiterate Electrek‘s stance on politics, in case it isn’t clear by now, it’s pretty cut and dried: We support green energy and electric vehicles.Photo: Pok Rie/Pexels.com",solar

According to LG, they are the company’s most powerful and highest-performing modules to date.LG’s new 66-cell NeON R and NeON R Prime modules with Back Contact Technology are available to US homebuilders and homeowners this spring.The LG NeON R 66-cell residential solar panel (left) has a power output up to 440W, while the LG NeON R Prime (above) comes in a 425W model. This puts both models at the maximum-range end of the spectrum of electricity output among solar panel manufacturers. Both LG models have an efficiency of up to 22.1%. The average solar panel efficiency falls between 15-20%, so this is higher than what’s generally currently available on the market. Solar panels usually produce between 250 and 400 watts of power, according to EnergySage, and of course other factors have to be taken into consideration in terms of efficiency, such as the size and quantity of the panels, the amount of sunlight they’re exposed to, how clean they are, and other environmental factors.Both panels feature Back Contact Technology, which enables all interconnectors to be positioned on the cell’s underside to increase the potential for sunlight absorption and decrease vulnerability to environmental damage, such as micro-cracks that potentially increase energy loss. The electrodes have also been moved to the back.Both panels come with a 25-year limited warranty that covers product, performance, and labor. They’re guaranteed to produce at least 92.5% of their labeled power output. LG makes its own solar panels in both South Korea and the US. The company opened a solar plant in Huntsville, Alabama in 2019.Prices of the panels were not disclosed by LG, but more information can be found here.Solar panel marketplaces consistently place LG solar panels in their top 10 lists, so it’s great to see that the company is continually working to improve its products. I guess they have to – the market is getting competitive, and it’s going to stay that way. It also gives us an opportunity to spotlight the latest innovations in the solar sector and observe how products are improving. In fact, as Electrek has covered at length, just expect solar to get more efficient and more inexpensive, and at a rapid pace. That’s why it’s predicted to be the leading source of electricity in the US by 2040.",solar
2021/02/11,"PGE, Poland’s state-owned public power company and the largest power group, and Danish wind giant Orsted finalized a deal yesterday to jointly develop two offshore wind projects in the Baltic Sea – 1.5 GW Baltica 2 and 1 GW Baltica 3 – a combined capacity of 2.5 gigawatts. PGE and Orsted will form a 50/50 joint venture, and the two projects could provide electricity to 4 million householdsPGE currently generates most of its electricity from coal but plans to have at least 6.5 GW in offshore wind energy capacity by 2040. Baltica 3 is the more advanced of the two projects and could become operational in 2026, according to offshorewind.biz.PGE chief executive Wojciech Dabrowski said:Offshore wind energy is a great opportunity for the Polish economy and Polish entrepreneurs.The potential of offshore energy in the Baltic Sea is estimated at around 11 GW by 2040, and the estimated total value of investments in offshore wind projects is up to 160 billion zlotys ($43 billion).Poland was the only EU member to not commit to net zero by 2050 in 2019 but is increasingly turning to wind power in an attempt to shift away from coal. Electrek wrote about Poland’s pivot away from coal in September 2020.Orsted Executive Vice President Martin Neubert said:Poland is emerging as the front runner in offshore wind in the Baltic Sea, and we are very excited to enter the Polish market with this joint venture.Things have increasingly gotten really exciting on the green energy reporting beat – my inbox is more full of announcements than ever, and every day, there’s a new event or innovation announcement. So why is global energy consultancy group Wood Mackenzie shutting down the excellent green energy website Greentech Media in the middle of March? Wood Mackenzie sends me just as many press releases about green energy as anyone else.Other climate and green energy reporters are wondering the same. Alexander Kaufman from the Huffington Post asks:Bizarre for @WoodMackenzie to shutter @greentechmedia — one of the most thorough, professional and readable trade publications in the space — at the dawn of the clean-energy boom. https://t.co/DeotctEpSWGreentech Media, a cleantech news, analysis and events business, was acquired by Wood Mackenzie for approximately $40 million in 2016. Energy Transition Now published Wood Mackenzie’s statement, which is kind of a non-answer:As part of the final integration of GTM within Wood Mackenzie, we have taken the decision to retire the GTM and GTM2 news sites. We will cease publishing new editorial and news content on the sites from March and all impacted subscribers will be contacted. We know this will be disappointing news for many loyal GTM subscribers and we thank them for their readership over the last decade.

2021/02/10,"Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas today announced the launch of its new offshore wind turbine – the V236-15.0MW. It replaces US conglomerate GE’s 14MW Haliade-X as having the distinction of being the world’s largest offshore wind turbine.The V236-15.0MW will have will have a rotor diameter of 774 feet (236 meters) and a wind-swept area of 470,845 square feet (43,743 square meters).In comparison, GE’s Haliade-X has a rotor diameter of 722 feet (220 meters) and a wind-swept area of 409,168 square feet (38,013 square meters). GE’s 14MW Haliade-X turbines will be used for the first time at Equinor’s and SSE’s Dogger Bank, the world’s largest offshore wind farm, as Electrek reported on December 18. Installation of the 14MW Haliade-X turbines is set to begin in 2025 ahead of completion of the whole Dogger Bank project in 2026.Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is also working on a 14MW turbine that will also be able to be boosted to 15 MW if required.The Vestas V236-15.0MW boosts wind energy production to around 80 GWh/year, enough to power around 20,000 European households and save more than 38,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing 25,000 passenger cars from the road annually.Vestas says it optimized design synergies from its existing turbines such as the V174-9.5 MW:The globally applicable offshore turbine offers 65% higher annual energy production than the V174-9.5 MW, and for a 900 MW wind park it boosts production by 5% with 34 fewer turbines. The first V236-15.0 MW prototype is expected to be installed in 2022, while serial production is scheduled for 2024.Henrik Andersen, Vestas president and CEO, said:Offshore wind will play an integral role in the growth of wind energy and the V236-15.0 MW will be a driver in this development by lowering levelized cost of energy, thus making our customers more competitive in offshore tenders going forward.As CNBC reports, Vestas’ revenue in 2020 hit €14.8 billion ($17.9 billion), a 22% increase compared to 2019, despite the pandemic.I’m not gonna lie, I really geek out on this stuff. Just when you think offshore wind turbines can’t get any larger, they do. And dangit, I really want to climb into a boat and look at the sweeping, powerful beauty of an offshore wind farm firsthand, once travel is safe again. It must be mind-blowing. I’ve seen hundreds of Denmark’s onshore wind turbines, but the offshore giants will be a different experience.One of the most exciting things about renewables, and writing about renewables, is the delight in learning about the latest innovations, the anticipation of when they’re put into action, and actually seeing them in action. Will they truly cause a Green Revolution, like the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century (but much cleaner)? That’s where hope comes in.I can’t wait to see these sweeping giants from Vestas and GE and Siemens cranked up, and for the healthy competition to continue. Will 16 MW follow? Place your bets.",solar
2021/02/10,"The Guardian spoke with Braidon Nurse, 19, who is in the second year of his apprenticeship working on the Greater Gabbard offshore wind farm 12 miles off the coast of Suffolk, England, for SSE Renewables. Greater Gabbard is a 140-turbine, 504 MW wind farm jointly owned by SSE and RWE Renewables. It’s is the farthest from shore and in the deepest water of any commercial UK offshore wind farm.Here’s an excerpt where Nurse talks about his apprenticeship, of which is likely to become a permanent role:A lot of my dad’s friends worked in the offshore oil industry, and I liked the sound of working outside, being busy and keeping on my feet. I’m not sure how I’d cope being stuck in an office all day. Everyone I spoke to said the same thing: oil is dead, renewables are the future.I’m learning skills I wouldn’t be able to learn anywhere else and I’m working with a team of people that are really committed to helping me progress. I’m starting to work on bigger jobs and be trusted to handle maintenance tasks on my own. We regularly check the whole of the turbine, clean it, change filters, maybe change the main circuit breaker – whatever’s required.People always ask what it’s like being at the top of a 100-meter-high wind turbine. It does make your legs go a bit funny when you look over the top.Long term, I’d like to specialize in the high voltage side so that I could isolate a particular turbine from the others if necessary. There are only three people authorized to do that on the Greater Gabbard site, so it’s an important job.I’m happy I decided to work in the renewable energy sector in general and wind in particular. It’s certainly increased my awareness about the fact that we all have a role to play in making the future a sustainable one.Enevate, which manufactures silicon-dominant lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology featuring extreme fast charge and high-energy density for electric vehicles, has secured $81 million in Series E funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Company. That money will provide the company with further resources to accelerate global adoption of Enevate’s battery technology in electric vehicles. Existing investors Mission Ventures and Infinite Potential Technologies also participated in the round. Enevate has raised $191 million to date. It was founded in 2005.This latest investment will enable the company to significantly expand its pre-production line designed to guide EV and other battery customers toward implementing larger-scale battery manufacturing using Enevate’s silicon anode-based batteries. It will also enable Enevate to hire additional personnel with an emphasis on scientists and engineers.Enevate works with multiple automotive original equipment manufacturers and EV battery manufacturers using a business model of technology transfer and intellectual property licensing.LG Chem is one of many investors in Enevate. Sungrok Bang, director of open innovation from LG Energy Solutions, the battery spinout from LG Chem, said:Our collaboration with Enevate started in 2017 and progresses today, we are excited about fast charge, high energy density technology and we are working to bring it to the EV market.

2021/02/09,"More than 8 million people died in 2018 from fossil fuel pollution, significantly higher than previous research suggested, according to new research from Harvard University, in collaboration with the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, and University College London. The study was published in the journal Environmental Research.The burning of fossil fuels was responsible for 8.7 million deaths globally in 2018, or 18% of deaths. This is double the most recent estimate from the most recent Global Burden of Disease Study, the largest and most comprehensive study on the causes of global mortality, which put the number at 4.2 million.Here’s how the researchers reached their conclusions:Previous research relied on satellite and surface observations to estimate the average global annual concentrations of airborne particulate matter, known as PM2.5. The problem is, satellite and surface observations can’t tell the difference between particles from fossil fuel emissions and those from dust, wildfire smoke, or other sources. To overcome this challenge, the Harvard researchers turned to GEOS-Chem, a global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry…For a global model, GEOS-Chem has high spatial resolution, meaning the researchers could divide the globe into a grid with boxes as small as 50 km x 60 km and look at pollution levels in each box individually. The researchers plugged into GEOS-Chem estimates of emissions from multiple sectors, including power, industry, ships, aircraft, and ground transportation and simulated detailed oxidant-aerosol chemistry driven by meteorology from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office.The researchers used emission and meteorology data primarily from 2012 because it was a year not influenced by El Niño, which can worsen or ameliorate air pollution, depending on the region. The researchers updated the data to reflect the significant change in fossil fuel emissions from China, which fell by about half between 2012 and 2018.Coauthors Alina Vodonos and Joel Schwartz, Professor of Environmental Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), developed a new risk assessment model that linked the concentration levels of particulates from fossil fuel emissions to health outcomes. The Guardian reports, “Without fossil fuel emissions, the average life expectancy of the world’s population would increase by more than a year, while global economic and health costs would fall by about $2.9 trillion.Eloise Marais, a geographer at University College London and a study co-author, said:We can’t in good conscience continue to rely on fossil fuels, when we know that there are such severe effects on health and viable, cleaner alternatives.In March 2020, Electrek reported on how a study found that atmospheric pollution may make the coronavirus even worse.KTNV in Las Vegas reported on the 2021 Nevada legislative session, which began on February 1, and convenes today. Legislators acknowledged that the state’s economy is too reliant on tourism and gaming. They are considering ways in which they transition more to green energy to diversify the economy, create clean energy jobs, and fight climate change. Diversification would make the state less vulnerable economically.Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said:You’re going to see some additional conversation on how do we start to convert from a fossil fuel economy to a cleaner energy economy.Cannizzaro acknowledged a lot of infrastructure projects need to be implemented to support electric vehicles, for example.Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson said:We’re in a difficult time right now, but we have to work on improving our infrastructure in the state as a whole.Assembly Minority Leader Robin Titus, a Republican, was optimistic about wind and solar energy jobs, and also cited geothermal as having potential:We have another great source, geothermal. That hasn’t been mentioned much, but we have a tremendous geothermal access here, and absolutely all of that put together is a good option for Nevada.On January 26, Electrek reported that Vineyard Wind 1, slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the US, asked the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) under the Biden administration to allow the federal permitting process to resume the day before.When the project decided to switch to GE Renewable Energy’s Haliade-X turbines, the most powerful turbine available to developers that have a power rating of 12-14MW, and paused the federal permitting process to determine whether design changes were necessary, the Trump administration’s BOEM abruptly canceled Vineyard Wind 1’s entire review in December.Incoming BOEM Director Amanda Lefton, in one of her first actions, reopened consideration of the permit application for Vineyard Wind on February 3.Lefton said in a statement:Offshore wind has the potential to help our nation combat climate change, improve resilience through reliable power, and spur economic development to create good-paying jobs.BOEM is committed to conducting a robust and timely review of the proposed project.",solar
2021/02/08,"By 2030, renewables will collectively surpass natural gas to be the predominant source of electricity generation in the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook 2021. But that’s not enough.The EIA also projects that the share of renewables in the US electricity generation mix will double from 21% in 2020 to 42% in 2050. This is due to regulatory and market factors. Wind and solar will make up the bulk of that growth, as per the EIA chart below:The EIA predicts that all solar electric generation (that’s photovoltaic and thermal technologies and both small-scale and utility-scale installations) will surpass wind by 2040 as the largest source of US renewable generation. However, wind will lead renewable growth through 2024, accounting for two-thirds of the increase in that period. Further, the EIA writes:After the production tax credit (PTC) for wind phases out at the end of 2024, solar generation will account for almost 80% of the increase in renewable generation through 2050. EIA assumes that utility-scale (and commercial) solar PV facilities will receive a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) through 2023, which will then be reduced to 10% beginning in 2024 and lasts through 2050. Residential solar PV will also receive a 30% ITC through 2023, which will expire in 2024.Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is anticipated to remain relatively constant, at about one-third of total generation from 2020 to 2050, and nuclear and coal are projected to decrease. The EIA has made its renewable and natural gas predictions based on renewable energy technology costs and natural gas prices.It’s good that green energy is going to double, but it’s not good enough growth, if EIA predictions are accurate. Renewables need to make up much more than 42% of electricity generation overall by 2050. By 2035, 90% of the United States could be powered by renewables, according to a UC Berkeley study.Plus, it’s not quite clear where the EIA is getting its ITC predictions, but its prediction appears to boost the current situation. In December, Solar Power World noted the current status of solar tax credits:For projects on which construction began in 2019, taxpayers may claim a Solar ITC of 30% of the eligible basis of property included in the project. This phases down to 26% for projects on which construction begins in 2020, 22% for projects on which construction begins in 2021, and 10% thereafter. The solar industry wants Congress to extend solar tax credits by five years at the original 30% level. But solar industry publications all state that what’s coming for solar, ITC-wise, is uncertain, so here’s hoping the Biden administration is as ambitious as it says it’s going to be in its support for both wind and solar.",solar
2021/02/08,"Royal Dutch Shell and Amazon today announced that Shell Energy Europe BV will supply Amazon with green energy from a subsidy-free offshore wind farm off the Netherlands coast. The CrossWind consortium, a joint venture between Shell and Dutch sustainable energy company Eneco, will operate the wind farm. Starting in 2024, Amazon will use 250 megawatts from Shell and 130 megawatts from Eneco, for a total of 380 MW.This will enable Amazon to power its business completely using clean energy by 2025, five years before its original target of 2030. Amazon has pledged to become net-zero by 2040. Shell has pledged to be net-zero by 2050 or sooner. Five days ago, Amazon officially started using Rivian electric vans to make customer deliveries. Amazon is buying 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian.A new report released by BuildingClean.org, an initiative of the BlueGreen Alliance Foundation, a US environmental group-labor union alliance, found that increasing the rate of US residential deep retrofits with energy-efficient housing products with the implementation of Buy American procurement policies could create more than 190,000 American manufacturing jobs.Deep retrofits go beyond basic weatherization and feature exterior continuous insulation; energy-efficient appliances; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); and windows.The report, “Manufacturing Efficiency: How Buy America Policy Can Boost Jobs Manufacturing Energy-Efficient Products,” compares the manufacturing job creation potential of strengthening all retrofits to full deep retrofits, increasing the retrofit rate, and implementing Buy American policies.At the current estimated retrofit rate of 2%, just strengthening retrofits to full deep retrofits would support 132,000 manufacturing jobs. Adding a Buy American policy to a deep retrofit rate of 2% would create another 20,000 jobs. Finally, the report explored the impact of increasing the deep retrofit rate to 4% while also enacting a Buy American policy. Under this scenario, more than 170,000 additional US jobs would be created.Jason Walsh, president of the BlueGreen Alliance Foundation, said:The creation of manufacturing jobs in communities across the nation will help our nation heal from the devastating economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Stopping energy waste will strengthen our fight against climate change. And, ramping up residential deep retrofits — especially in affordable housing — will make the buildings we live and work in healthier and safer.",solar
2021/02/05,"Denmark is going to build a $34 billion artificial wind energy island, which will be located 50 miles (80 km) offshore, in the North Sea, near the Jutland peninsula in the north. Construction of the island is expected to start in 2026.The Danish coalition government has agreed to take a 51% stake in the island. The private sector will hold the remainder. The Danish government’s website says:The state will own the majority of the island, but private companies will be crucial for the project to fulfill the potential as regards to innovation, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and business potential.  The energy hub will serve as an offshore power plant that gathers and distributes green electricity via the grid from hundreds of wind turbines surrounding the island directly to consumers in countries that border the North Sea. As pictured above, high sea walls will protect it on three sides from rough North Sea weather, and the fourth side will feature a dock.The artificial island will offer the best opportunities to expand the project, for example by building a harbor and facilities for storage and conversion of green electricity from the nearby wind turbines in the sea. It is the long-term ambition to be able to store green electricity on the island, convert it to liquid green fuel, and send it via subsea cables to Denmark and neighboring countries.Furthermore, the abundance of offshore wind energy can be used to produce climate-friendly fuels for shipping, aviation, heavy industries, or heavy-duty vehicles.The 1.29 million-square-foot (120,000-square-meter) artificial island, in its first phase, will be able to provide 3 million households with green energy.Denmark will also build an energy hub on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea off Sweden’s southern coast. The two hubs’ initial capacity will be 5 GW, triple the current installed offshore capacity in Denmark. They will later be expanded to provide a total capacity of 12 GW.Denmark has set the cutoff date of 2050 for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. Denmark is currently the largest oil producer in the EU.South Korea today unveiled a 48.5 trillion won ($43.2 billion) plan to build the world’s largest offshore wind farm by 2030. The project will have a maximum capacity of 8.2 gigawatts. That’s the equivalent of energy produced by six nuclear reactors.It’s considerably larger than the current world’s largest offshore wind farm: Hornsea 1 in the UK, which has capacity of 1.12 GW.The project will provide up to 5,600 jobs and help achieve the goal to boost South Korea’s wind power capacity to 16.5 GW by 2030 from 1.67 GW now.Utility and engineering companies involved include Korea Electric Power Corp, SK E&S, Hanwha Engineering & Construction Corp, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Co., CS Wind Corp, and Samkang M&T Co., according to Reuters.The project is a major part of South Korean president Moon Jae-in’s Green New Deal, which, as Electrek reported, was announced in July 2020. Investment in electric and hydrogen vehicles also plays a major part in that plan, which aims to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.Photo: Danish government",solar
2021/02/04,"New York City’s iconic Empire State Building and other buildings in its owner’s portfolio are all now powered entirely by wind, making it the US’ largest real estate user of 100% renewable energy.Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) has made a deal to purchase wind power from renewable energy provider Green Mountain Energy and Direct Energy. Both are headquartered in Houston. The three-year contracts started on January 1 and will provide around 300 million kilowatt hours of electricity for ESRT’s 10 million-square-foot portfolio. It’s the equivalent of the removal of all New York City taxis for one year. Buildings generate more than two-thirds of New York City’s carbon emissions, so this is a significant step forward for renewables, as ESRT made this decision using many metrics in addition to sustainability. For example, the first year of the contract is expected to result in more than $800,000 in savings for ESRT.The Empire State Building, which was built from 1930 to 1931, underwent a decade-long, $550 million retrofit that has resulted in a 40% reduction in energy use and emissions, and has itself been on renewable energy since 2011.So why did ESRT make this latest decision? Dana Robbins Schneider, director of energy at ESRT, says:ESRT is the leader in sustainable operations with a viable example of how to scale carbon neutral technologies, strategies, and policies to balance with an effective economic business case.We have purchased renewable power from Green Mountain Energy for the World’s Most Famous Building, the Empire State Building, for a decade. We now expand that to all properties in New York State with an additional Direct Energy contract for our Connecticut properties.Or as Anthony Malkin, the trust’s chief executive, put it:We want to differentiate ourselves so we get better tenants at higher rents so we can outperform our competition. It’s all market driven.Here’s what purchasing wind power means, since of course there aren’t wind turbines on the Empire State Building or any other of ESRT’s buildings. Buying renewable energy means the ESRT is paying for that energy to be produced somewhere else. In this case, as the Washington Post points out: Green Mountain Energy sells power from certified wind farms around the country. Purchases of renewables through Direct Energy go toward solar and wind facilities in Texas.With the new contracts, a kilowatt hour of clean energy will be added to the grid for every kilowatt hour of electricity that ESRT properties use — helping to shift the nation away from carbon-emitting fossil fuels.Photo: Charles Parker/Pexels.com",solar
2021/02/04,"Coal will be replaced largely by renewables, which will supply 39% of US electricity in 2030 and 55% in 2035, according to a Morgan Stanley report released this week. The banking giant predicts that coal is on track to disappear from the US power grid by 2033.This is because a growing number of states are requiring utilities to eliminate carbon emissions.According to the US Energy Information Administration, “Coal’s forecast share of electricity generation will rise from 20% in 2020 to 22% in 2021 and 24% in 2022, which is close to its share in 2019.” But that’s not a trend; it’s a blip, as it will be dwarfed by the global push toward clean energy.Morgan Stanley analysts said in the report [via Bloomberg Green]: [Gas prices may climb 48% this year, which] drives coal generation and the sector’s carbon footprint to increase in 2021 but we continue to project a constant decline thereafter.Meanwhile, the US Senate energy committee voted 13-4 yesterday to approve the nomination of former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm to head the Department of Energy. She is expected to be confirmed in the full Senate next week.Granholm, according to Reuters, “wants to steer the department to help the United States compete with China on electric vehicles and green technologies like advanced batteries and solar and wind power.”Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) voted against Granholm. Wyoming is the number-one producer of coal. His concern is that Biden’s plan threatens thousands of fossil-fuel jobs. He said:I can’t support a Biden administration agenda that throws my constituents out of work and kills the economies of the communities in which they live.Interestingly, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who will become the committee’s chairman, said of Granholm handling the Great Recession:She was up to those challenges, she helped save the domestic auto industry, she diversified Michigan’s economy, she brought in new investments and new industry and she created new jobs.Electrek’s Take: Keep in mind that this isn’t Greenpeace declaring coal’s demise; Morgan Stanley is a global financial institution. I recognize that it is Barrasso’s responsibility, just like Senator Joe Manchin’s (D-WV), to represent their constituents in trying to preserve fossil-fuel jobs. But what many legislators from coal-producing and dependent states such as Wyoming and West Virginia won’t admit – because surely they must know – is that their attempts at preserving fossil fuel jobs are in vain. It’s a losing battle. Their best bets are to start formulating a plan for new job sources and industries for their residents, and get them off futile, polluting coal. (Manchin’s comment seems to imply that he knows that.) It will be better for their livelihoods and their health. As I write repeatedly, work with Senator Tammy Duckworth, who introduced a bill to support communities hurt by the loss of coal (D-IL). That’s foresight. Maybe Manchin will take her up on that.The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has installed 22 new EV fast charging stations at nine locations throughout the state.

2021/02/03,"Harvard University announced yesterday that it has bought four electric buses. The new buses will replace four bio-diesel-powered vehicles representing more than 30% of Harvard’s fleet, and the university’s plan is for all of its vehicles to be run by clean energy.Each Proterra ZX5 Electric Transit Bus has dual independent 205 kW motors, gets a maximum range of 240 miles, offers a seating capacity of 29, and accelerates from 0-20mph in 5.6 seconds. Its top speed is 65 mph. The new vehicles can accept high-power DC fast-charging. The shuttles will be charged during off-peak overnight hours using 150 kW charging stations. The buses can be fully charged in about three hours.Harvard has pledged to create and implement a Zero Emission Vehicles Action Plan, which will include moving entirely to electric buses. The university intends to eliminate the use of fossil fuels on its campus by 2050 and achieve fossil fuel-neutrality by 2026. Its bus fleet transports around 600,000 students across campus, and the transition to electric is expected to lower greenhouse gas emissions by more than 220,000 pounds annually.Commuters can also access dozens of electric vehicle charging stations across the campus in Cambridge and Allston.Elsie Sunderland, Gordon McKay professor of environmental chemistry at Harvard John A.

The total cost of the project is around €1 million ($1.2 million). Testing will commence in April 2021.The test setup will be the first of its kind in the Netherlands. SolarDuck will supply the solar island: four linked platforms containing 39 solar panels each. These modular platforms are suited for rough sea conditions, but will first be tested on the Waal to look at the effects of strong currents and heavy winds.The floating solar island, called The Atoll, which produces 65 kilowatts of peak power, is connected to a 10 kilowatt electrolyzer that produces hydrogen. The hydrogen is bonded to a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), an oil-like liquid that serves as a binding agent, or carrier, for the produced hydrogen. Part of the test setup is the manner in which the hydrogen is released from the oil and subsequently used to generate power on board. Wiard Leenders, CEO of Voyex, says:This “hydrogen-oil” can be transported at room temperature, under the same atmospheric conditions as fuels such as diesel.The carrier itself can be reused.The joint goal of both companies is to produce hydrogen using floating solar islands at sea to supply both the shipping sector and other heavy-duty applications. ",solar
2021/02/02,"Edinburgh-headquartered Sustainable Marine, which provides island and remote coastal communities with sustainable energy, is moving ahead with plans to deliver the world’s first floating tidal energy array after unveiling its next-generation platform in Nova Scotia.Construction of the new 420kW PLAT-I 6.40 floating tidal energy platform was recently completed at AF Theriault & Son Ltd. in Meteghan, Nova Scotia, and launched yesterday in the Bay of Fundy, which experiences the highest tides on earth.Here’s how it works, according to Construction Connect:The PLAT-I 6.40 will host six tidal turbines that have been designed to flip up like an outboard motor on a powerboat for easy maintenance. The platforms will be anchored to bedrock using a four-point mooring system… and will be able to spin around the mooring turret… to align with both the advancing and receding tide each day. Onboard generators will match the power up to the grid frequency and the power will be exported via underwater cable to the shore.It will undergo commissioning and testing in Grand Passage, a river in Nova Scotia, and will then be moved to the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy site as part of the first phase of the groundbreaking Pempa’q In-stream Tidal Energy Project. The Pempa’q Project takes its name from the Mi’kmaq First Nation word “Pempa’q” meaning “rise of the tide.”The total in-stream tidal energy project will deliver up to 9 megawatts of electricity to the Nova Scotia grid. This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and power approximately 3,000 homes in Nova Scotia. It’s being supported by the Government of Canada with CAD $28.5 million (USD $22.2 million) in funding – one of Canada’s largest-ever investments in tidal energy.Seamus O’Regan, Jr, Canada’s minister of natural resources, said:We are harnessing the power of our tides to power our homes, our businesses, and our communities. This is how we build our clean energy future.The University of Arkansas Hope-Texarkana (UAHT) is building an education lab at its Hope campus in order to deliver a new Certificate of Proficiency in Solar Energy Technology program. Laura Clark, interim chancellor, said: The lab will be modeled after the state-of-the-art Solar Energy International (SEI) lab in Colorado and will allow our students to take their classroom instruction and apply it by actually installing and uninstalling several types of solar arrays. The lab will be the first of its kind for photovoltaics in the region and fills a current need for accredited technicians in Arkansas.Using the SEI curriculum, UAHT will become an approved training provider for the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). This certificate provides the necessary training to install, construct, maintain, and operate solar electric systems. The classroom curriculum for the program is expected to begin in the fall 2021 semester. The certificate is part of the path to completing the Associate of Applied Science in Power Technology degree at UAHT.Clark continued:Becoming an approved NABCEP training partner means our graduates are eligible to sit for the NABCEP PV Installation Professional Certification Exam to earn their PV Associate Credential.The PV Associate Credential is the opening pathway for graduates who want to move into specializations such as design, inspection, or solar fields engineering. The credential also opens the door for UAHT to add these additional educational tracks for credit and non-credit certifications.Industry expansion is expected in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, which will create new renewable energy jobs. The solar lab will give our students a real hands-on learning experience that will allow them to be competitive in this growing job market.The university is also installing a 1 MW solar project that will take sit on around seven acres on the south end of the campus and provide electricity for the university.According to Solar Industry International Association, Arkansas moved from 36th in 2019 to 25th in 2021 in the US for solar installations. There are currently 26 solar companies in the state.",solar
2021/02/01,"Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX) wants to fight Biden’s clean energy plan, despite being the No. 1 state in the US for wind power. Texas is also a rising star of solar power, not to mention the home of Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas. Yet, Abbott has issued an executive order to “protect” Texas’ energy industry from federal overreach, or in other words, President Joe Biden’s endorsement of clean energy. Or to put it another way, what Texas is already doing.As Electrek reported in February 2020, Texas is a leader in US clean energy: The Lone Star State leads the US with the most energy generated by wind power, and now it’s ramping up solar, which is projected to be the fastest-growing contributor to the state’s power grid in the next three years.Texas is expected to add 5.5GW of capacity from new utility-scale solar projects this year (via the Houston Chronicle). Most of the planned solar projects are expected to come online before summer 2021.Further, in November 2019, Electrek reported that, albeit for different reasons, both Democrats and Republicans nearly equally support solar, which is both increasingly turning into the cheapest form of energy and also a clean form of energy.Abbott visited the Permian Basin late last week and announced during a news conference in Odessa that he would be signing an executive order that directs all state agencies to challenge any federal action “that threatens the continued strength, vitality, and independence of the energy industry.”Rigzone reports:US President Joe Biden signaled ‘extreme hostility’ toward the energy industry by rejoining the ‘job-killing’ Paris Agreement and signing Executive Order 13990, which revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, Abbott highlighted in his order. He also outlined that order 13990 directed the US Environmental Protection Agency to rescind its 2020 methane rule ‘as an apparent prelude to burdensome new regulation of the energy industry’s emissions in Texas and in sister states’ and warned that more and greater threats to the Texas energy sector seem imminent ‘as President Biden embraces Green New Deal policies.’Oil and gas are still big business in Texas – they make up around one-third of the gross state product. But as we alluded above, [via KCBD] Abbott acknowledged at his news conference that in Texas, there is “either zero or close to zero” federal land where drilling is done. So Biden’s 60-day freeze on new oil drilling on federal lands has next to no impact on Texas.Responding to Abbott’s news conference, the Texas Democratic Party said Abbott was not ‘being honest with working Texans,’ noting that the state’s energy industry is still hurting and its path forward is through renewable sources, not fossil fuels.Which, funnily enough, is exactly what Texas is doing. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said:[Abbott’s] head-in-the-sand approach to global warming makes no sense when Texas could lead in solving the crisis by taking full advantage of our abundant clean energy resources and technological know-how.My stance is slightly different from Metzger’s, although I agree with him and global warming. Abbott is just never going to put global warming first and foremost; he’s always going to be about money and jobs.Republicans tend to adopt renewables for economic reasons, not to fight climate change. Texas is doing a roaring trade in both wind and solar. So instead of holding a nonsensical news conference in the Permian Basin defending dying fossil fuels, what Abbott should have done is talked about how Texas is the biggest in wind and solar – because we know how Texans like that everything’s big in Texas – and how renewables are going to replace the inevitably dying fossil-fuel jobs. (Plus, he just plain lied about the Paris Agreement being a job killer.)Employers reported the greatest overall difficulty in hiring workers for jobs in Electric Power Generation. So instead of championing pollutants, how about announcing incentives to train and attract talent to that sector, since jobs are going unfilled?Employers reported the following as the three most difficult occupations to hirefor:But instead, Abbott chose to ignore Biden’s call for unity and instead pick a fight with a pointless executive order about something his state is already successfully doing.And here’s the real kicker about Texas, according to the US Energy and Employment Report 2019:Wind makes up the largest segment of employment related to electric power generation, with 25,386 jobs (up 0.6%), followed by traditional fossil fuel generation at 12,709 jobs (up 1.9%).Further, 9,612 people were employed in 100% solar and 1,576 in hydroelectric.There are 162,816 energy efficiency jobs in Texas, which represent 7% of all US energy efficiency jobs. It was projected to grow 7.4% when the report was issued.And if he’s got a problem with electric vehicles and is concerned about fuel workers, then he can take it up with GM CEO Mary Barra, as the race is on to EVs. I’m guessing he has no problem with Elon Musk’s Gigafactory Texas?Abbott doesn’t need to get onboard. His state is already onboard. He needs to stop pretending that it’s not, because he’s lying to the people of Texas.",solar
2021/02/01,"Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in his 2021 State of the City Address that New York City “will renounce fossil fuels fully. And, therefore, we need to ban fossil fuel connections in the city by the end of this decade, literally ensuring that our only choice is renewable energy.” In other words, no more natural gas by 2030.He wants to reduce cars in the city, prioritize electric vehicles, and increase access for pedestrians and cyclists:For the Brooklyn Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge, we’ll create new two-way protected bike lanes. We’ll have space on the bridges devoted solely to clean transportation, and we’ll create new bike boulevards in every borough designed to give bicycles travel priority and put cyclist safety first. Referring to the city’s largest pension funds, De Blasio said:We started by taking the billions of dollars in New York City pension fund investments and taking them away from fossil fuel companies that were poisoning the earth, putting that money into renewable energy development. And now, we resolve to deepen this effort by making a commitment to a $50 billion investment of our pension resources in renewable energy over the next 15 years. We will take all of our pension fund dollars away from any element of the fossil fuel supply chain and make sure those dollars are helping us create a greener future. He continued:We need to turn to renewables like never before and connect New York City to clean Canadian hydropower and invest in the transmission lines that make that possible.With this new asset, New York City’s government will run on 100% renewable energy in the next four years.On February 6, 2020, De Blasio signed an executive order that banned new fossil fuel infrastructure in New York City, including pipelines, import terminals, and fossil fuel-based power generation capacity.SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), a San Jose-based solar technology and energy solutions provider, and EagleView, a Bellevue, Washington-based technology provider of aerial analytics, today announced a new agreement to work together to reduce solar installation timelines and costs.Every new home solar installation requires a custom design tailored to the home’s roof and electrical system. This is traditionally done with an in-person survey. But in-person surveys are costly for installers and extend solar installation cycle timelines. The mySunPower Home Survey app with EagleView Roof Reports provides installers all the information they need to create final solar designs without site visits. The app is designed to replace ladder-climbing and drone photography with machine learning technology.Homeowners use the app to take photos of their home’s structural and electrical components from ground level. SunPower’s AI software automatically evaluates images and provides real-time feedback to homeowners on photo completeness and clarity. EagleView Roof Reports include aerial imagery and proprietary 3D models that clarify accurate roof characteristics.  With the use of the app, SunPower can reduce project cycle times by up to two weeks and eliminate costs associated with sending a site surveyor to the home.As renewables ramp up, a lot of exciting innovations and partnerships like this will streamline switching to green energy and make it more cost-effective than the use of fossil fuels.",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/01/29,"The Sierra Club released a report, The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges, an assessment of whether US utilities are committing to the actions needed to adopt green energy and abandon fossil fuels.Sierra Club analysts examined plans for 79 operating companies owned by 50 parent companies and assigned a score to every utility based on its plans to retire coal, stop constructing new gas plants, and aggressively build out new clean energy by 2030.The report is based on an analysis of long-term energy plans released by utilities – known as integrated resource plans (IRPs) – and major announcements for the 50 utilities that generate the most electricity from coal and gas. This includes investor-owned utilities, power authorities (like the Tennessee Valley Authority), generation and transmission co-ops, and large municipal utilities.Sierra Club then provides a map of the US so you can see who’s succeeding and failing, and a search function to look up your utility. The Public Service Company of Oklahoma and Northern Indiana Public Service Company get an A, and so does Great River Energy in Minnesota. Sierra Pacific Power in Nevada was awarded a B. The Northeast isn’t evaluated (we don’t know why), and the Southeast is abysmal – an F pretty much across the board.John Romankiewicz, one of the report’s authors, said:We want to see no new gas. We want to see coal replaced entirely with clean energy.In my current residential state of Florida, everyone is failing, apart from the Orlando Utilities Commission — 55 points, a B grade. Its goal is to be net-zero by 2050 with a 50% reduction by 2030. Florida can’t seem to shift away from its gas habit and more toward solar, the obvious choice for the Sunshine State.The New York Times released an interactive map yesterday that asks, “Every country has its own climate risks.

Other high risk climate hazards include heat stress, flooding, cyclones and sea level rise.Overall in the United States, roughly 80% of population, GDP, and agriculture might be exposed to at least one climate hazard in the future.The climate risks are color coded on a map. In the US, it shows hurricanes on the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard, flooding along the Mississippi River, wildfires on the West Coast and parts of the eastern US, and water stress (ie, drought) through a large swathe of the Midwest, among other issues.(I also checked out the UK, my other home country, and it’s flooding, as of 2040. Practically the whole island is blue.)If you keep scrolling, it gives you an overview of global trends, such as:From 2000 to 2019, floods upended the lives of at least 1.65 billion people — the highest number in any disaster category.It’s worth knowing more about where you live, or where people you care about live, as it illustrates why we want to switch to electric vehicles and green energy, apart from them just being pretty awesome.

2021/01/28,"Fifteen 60-seat hydrogen double-decker buses officially opened their doors in Aberdeen, Scotland, today to passengers – the “world’s first” hydrogen double-decker buses. The vehicles will be operated mainly on the Service 19 (Peterculter to Tillydrone) by First Bus in a project led by Aberdeen City Council. Wrightbus in Northern Ireland built the buses. They are more efficient than their electric equivalents, with refueling 25 kg of hydrogen taking less than 10 minutes and offering a greater range of 250 miles, similar to that of diesel buses. If further daily range is required then additional hydrogen tanks can be installed.Hydrogen buses emit only water and create no noise pollution. The UK’s first hydrogen production and bus refueling station was opened in Aberdeen in 2015. Aberdeen City Council does not state whether these buses are currently running on green hydrogen or not, but it says it has plans to make its own hydrogen. Wrightbus explains the logistics of fueling them:In the short term a gas tanker truck would be required to deliver the hydrogen to the bus garage but longer term the hydrogen could be delivered via the existing mains gas pipelines. This means that FCEV buses can be suitable for both inner city bus garages where there is insufficient electricity grid capacity and very rural bus garages where there is no suitable electricity grid. The only tailpipe emission from a FCEV bus is water vapor.The £8.3 million ($11.37 million) project has been funded by Aberdeen City Council, European Union Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, and the Scottish Government with an investment of about £500,000 ($684.4K) per vehicle. The city already owns hydrogen and electric vans, road sweepers, and cars through a car share scheme.Aberdeen is keen to distance itself from the North Sea oil industry and become known as the “Energy Capital of Europe” rather than “Oil Capital of Europe.” Thus the city is showing initiative in the development of new energy sources, and movement from oil into green energy and other industries is underway as part of its Net Zero Vision plan, which it agreed to in May 2020.London and Birmingham are expected to follow Aberdeen’s footsteps with hydrogen buses.Shoals Technologies Group (SHLS), a Portland, Tennessee-headquartered manufacturer of solar energy equipment parts, just went public. Its offering has nearly doubled in recent days to about $1.9 billion. It’s the biggest solar IPO ever.Shoals, which moved into solar in the mid-2000s from auto parts, makes and combines the function of cable assemblies, combiner boxes, external fuses, and re-combiners. The balance of system products carries the electric current generated by solar panels to the power grid. The company has three facilities, two in Tennessee and one in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.The company plans to grow its business internationally and break into the electric vehicle chargers market.The Nashville Post reports:The company last year generated about $33 million in net income on sales of about $175 million. Those numbers were up about 32% and 21%, respectively, from 2019.The 700-employee company estimates at least one of its parts were installed in more than half of the new solar capacity installed across the country in the year ended Sept. 30 and it had $157 million in backlog and awarded orders on its books at the end of 2020.It’s no accident that Shoals had such a successful IPO; solar stocks have rallied since the election of US President Joe Biden, who announced his climate change and energy plans yesterday and initial plans for green energy jobs growth.As Shoals Technologies’ CEO Jason Whitaker says below, solar is the cheapest source of energy generation available as power demand grows.Photo: Abermedia/Michal Wachucik",solar
2021/01/27,"As we previously wrote on inauguration day, it was anticipated that US President Joe Biden would take further executive action on a number of new initiatives today to fight climate change and curb fossil fuels. Here’s some of what the White House has just announced:In regards to the fossil fuel leases, it’s important to note that a number of Big Oil companies have stockpiles of drilling permits for federal lands, and it wouldn’t affect existing drilling leases in the West and in the Gulf of Mexico.The initiatives were posted this morning, and you can click here to read them in full. And here’s President Biden announcing his initiatives:Many environmental and health groups weighed in in advance of the announcement – my inbox is full of statements – and they are overwhelmingly optimistic.Josh Axelrod, senior advocate in the Nature Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the fossil fuel moratorium:The era of putting polluters profits first is over. We can’t lock our children and grandchildren into decades more of the dirty fossil fuels of the past, and all the hazards and harms they bring to our public lands, oceans and coastal communities. This moratorium gives the country a chance to modernize the way we deploy our natural resources for developing energy – and to speed up a just and equitable transition to good-paying clean energy jobs of the future.Katie Huffling, MS, RN, CNM, FAAN and executive director of the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, said:We are deeply encouraged by President Biden’s executive orders suspending oil and gas leasing on federal land and taking steps to preserve air quality and protect the health of the American people.Our country’s response to the pandemic must be holistic, prioritizing communities impacted by racism, health inequities, and air pollution in the COVID response – and we need to do so while addressing the impacts of climate change. We need solutions that support a healthier future for America’s communities – and this executive order is a bold step in the right direction.Rue Mapp, founder and CEO of Outdoor Afro, said:We believe all people in our nation deserve to have the opportunity to experience the joys and health benefits of time spent outside. We’re thrilled that President Biden and Vice-President Harris in the opening days of their Administration have prioritized outdoor access for all. We have the right to gather joyfully and peacefully in the outdoors. This 30×30 commitment is a unique opportunity to center a more inclusive and equitable vision of outdoor access for the nation. We look forward to building on this momentum with President Biden and Vice-President Harris to dismantle America’s systemic barriers to nature and the outdoors.The financial tides within the renewable energy sector appear to be changing. The number of announcements that I am receiving announcing renewable investments has suddenly increased, and I expect these are only going to multiply as the Biden administration continues to gear up its shift toward clean energy and EVs. As a result, these announcements flag up some cool initiatives for moving to a green energy future. Here are two examples:Sitetracker, the project management software for deploying, operating, and servicing critical infrastructure and technology, has raised a $42 million series C funding round led by Energize Ventures and H.I.G. Growth Partners. Sitetracker works such EV charging companies as Chargepoint, EVgo, and Volta, and utility Dominion Energy. Here’s how it works for EV charging companies:Successful deployment of EV chargers requires close coordination with local utilities and authorities for interconnections and permitting – externalities that companies can’t always control. Aligning permits, sites, and project schedules gives the most accurate view into permit and interconnection risks, and intelligent forecasting allows for adjusting project timelines automatically based on past utility or permit timelines.Distributed Solar Development (DSD) announced the closing of a $300 million debt facility financed by Credit Suisse. DSD was launched as a startup within General Electric in 2012. Examples of solar solutions that they offer include solar canopy and carport configurations, rooftop, ground-mount, and energy storage.

2021/01/26,"West Virginia is getting a 115 MW wind farm, which will increase the state’s wind power by 15%. Here’s why that’s a really big deal – and why West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice, is so excited.First, let’s check out West Virginia’s new wind farm. Construction is underway on the $200 million Black Rock Wind project. It consists of 23 turbines that produce 5 megawatts each on the Grant-Mineral county line, in the northeastern region of the state. Green energy developer Clearway Energy is building Black Rock Wind, which will provide power to Toyota and American Electric Power.Clearway, which already operates the Pinnacle Wind Farm (pictured above) in Mineral County, intends to have Block Rock Wind live before the end of this year.WVMetroNews reports that Clearway Energy CEO Craig Cornelius says that $52 million of the $200 million will be spent on payroll and services during the construction process.Construction will create 200 union jobs, and permanent positions will be advertised later this year. Clearway is planning a pilot project training program for workers who have coal mining or other energy experience.West Virginia is coal country. According to the US Energy Information Administration, as of 2018, it was the second-largest coal producer in the US after Wyoming and ranked fifth among the states in total US energy production – that’s 5%.Coal-fired electric power plants accounted for 91% of West Virginia’s electricity net generation in 2019. Renewable energy resources — primarily hydroelectric power and wind energy — contributed a meager 6%, in contrast. West Virginia depends on the fossil fuel for jobs and revenue – but coal is a lost cause. Maybe that’s why Governor Jim Justice (R-WV) sounds so excited – maybe even a little relieved? – when he announced Black Rock Wind yesterday. Here’s an excerpt of what he said:Gosh, this is so necessary that we have within our state, and this is really good stuff.Today we’re announcing a great move by Blackrock, a great move in the State of West Virginia, and so many, many, many good things that are about to happen here.I’m a complete believer that West Virginia has to be a diversified state. We don’t want to forget how important [our coal mine jobs and our natural gas jobs] are… but we have embraced the all-encompassing thing. And this wind farm will amp up our wind production.We absolutely do not run off and leave our [fossil fuel] jobs, but at the same time, we absolutely want to embrace all the other ways we can move forward with manufacturing and great jobs.You can watch Justice’s full speech here:Justice has to say that about not abandoning fossil fuel jobs because coal is important to West Virginia. More than one-third of the more than 93 million tons of coal mined in West Virginia was exported to foreign markets. It’s also part of the state’s history and culture, even though it kills West Virginians.So the word “diversification” is very diplomatic, and, well… politically astute. He knows the energy industry will change under the Biden administration. Wall Street is looking to renewables now. There is a reason he expresses excitement about the millions in tax income the wind farm will bring to the state in his video.The numbers don’t lie. In 2010, around 21,000 people worked in the coal mining industry in West Virginia. By 2019, that number had fallen to just under 14,000. And those jobs are going to keep on disappearing. That’s why Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) introduced a bill in July 2020 to support communities who have suffered, and will keep suffering, job losses as a result of the death of the coal industry. For example, the largest private coal company in the US, owned by the now-deceased Robert Murray, filed for bankruptcy in October 2019. The EU is this week calling for a worldwide phase-out of coal. West Virginia is dependent on a rapidly disappearing fuel, and it needs other sources of income and jobs, so it does indeed need to “diversify.” Those folks who work in coal in West Virginia need a Plan B. May more solar and wind farms come their way – fast – because Justice can’t bring himself to tell them the hard, scary truth.Photo: Clearway Energy",solar
2021/01/26,"Vineyard Wind 1, slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the US, yesterday asked the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) under the Biden administration to allow the federal permitting process to resume. When the project decided to switch to GE Renewable Energy’s Haliade-X turbines, the most powerful turbine available to developers that have a power rating of 12-14MW, and paused the federal permitting process to determine whether design changes were necessary, the Trump administration’s BOEM abruptly canceled Vineyard Wind 1’s entire review in December.Lars T. Pedersen, CEO of Vineyard Wind, said:Since there are no changes required to the [construction and operations plan], we expect that BOEM can finalize their review based on the extensive analysis and studies of the project over the last three years. We look forward to completing the permitting phase of the project and to finalizing the engineering, contracting, and financing of the first utility scale offshore wind farm in the US.Vineyard Wind 1, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, is an 800-megawatt project located 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. The project will generate electricity for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts and is expected to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1.6 million tons per year. Pending permit approval, the developers are still expecting to reach financial close in the second half of 2021 and begin commissioning the project in 2023.Salient Energy, which develops zinc-ion batteries, today announced that it has received a $1.58 million grant from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to support the design and assembly of its zinc-ion residential  energy storage systems. Salient will use the grant to open an office and engineering facility in Oakland, California, which will commence in the second quarter of 2021. It will also allow hiring a team of engineers to design and assemble zinc-ion residential energy storage systems. The CEC will advise the company throughout the project.Once the zinc-ion batteries are deemed commercially viable, Salient will help strive to meet California’s energy goals of replacing fossil-fuel-powered backup generators.An academic paper in Science Direct points out:Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have recently attracted attention due to their safety, environmental friendliness, and lower cost, compared to [lithium-ion batteries]. They use aqueous electrolytes, which give them an advantage over multivalent ion batteries that require more complex electrolytes. However, as with every new technology, many fundamental and practical challenges must be overcome for ZIBs to become commercial products.California is a leader in energy storage, with nearly 300 utility-scale storage projects. New York and Massachusetts are a distant second with around 40 each.Janea Scott, CEC vice chair, said:Diversifying our storage technology options will help ensure grid reliability and  allow for greater integration of the state’s vast renewable resources as California moves toward  a clean energy future.",solar
2021/01/25,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In 2020, renewables overtook fossil fuels as the EU’s main source of electricity for the first time. Renewables generated 38% of Europe’s electricity, overtaking the 37% market share generated by fossil fuels. The study revealed that Europe’s electricity is 29% cleaner than in 2015. This is according to a new study by think tanks Ember and Agora Energiewende, “The European Power Sector in 2020.”This was driven by wind and solar power generation almost doubling since 2015 to deliver 20% of EU electricity in 2020. The highest shares of wind and solar were in Denmark (61%), Ireland (35%), Germany (33%), and Spain (29%). In contrast, coal power has halved since 2015. In 2020, coal generation fell by 20% to deliver just 13% of Europe’s electricity. In comparison, gas generation fell only 4% in 2020. A robust carbon price meant gas generation was the cheapest form of fossil fuel generation.Europe’s electricity demand was down 4% in 2020, reaching lows in April at the peak of COVID-19 lockdowns. The rise in renewables was robust despite the pandemic, while the fall in fossil fuels was limited by a bounce-back in demand and below-average nuclear generation.Dave Jones, Ember’s senior electricity analyst and the lead author of the report, says:Rapid growth in wind and solar has forced coal into decline but this is just the beginning. Europe is relying on wind and solar to ensure not only coal is phased out by 2030, but also to phase out gas generation, replace closing nuclear power plants, and to meet rising electricity demand from electric cars, heat pumps, and electrolyzers.Researcher Corporate Knights today released its 17th annual Global 100 report, “2021 Global 100: How the world’s most sustainable companies outperform.”The green company league table ranks more than 8,000 publicly listed companies that generate annual revenues of over $1 billion by sustainability. Here are the top 10:Corporate Knights points out:Rather than abandon sustainability pledges, governments around the world have seized on the opportunity presented by the need to kick-start their economies to inject trillions of dollars of green investments into their stimulus plans.This shift in attitudes has come about in part because of the astonishing fall in the costs of renewable energy, which is now the cheapest source of new power in many parts of the world. From 2009 to 2019, the cost of solar fell 89%, as did batteries, while onshore wind is 70% cheaper.The Corporate Knights Global 100 index continues to demonstrate that sustainability is good business and enables companies to outperform their peers.No. 1 French tech company Schneider Electric offers technology and energy solutions needed for efficiency and sustainability by such companies as Walmart, Marriott, and ArcelorMittal to meet their climate targets. Schneider operates in 100 countries and has more than doubled its market value in the last two years to more than €70 billion ($85 billion).In contrast, Corporate Knights reports:26 companies left the index, including Toyota, which was weighed down by its dependence on internal-combustion-engine vehicles, and chemicals giant BASF, flagged by UK-based InfluenceMap for lobbying against measures to combat climate change.In terms of global regions, here’s how the index broke down:On an individual country basis, the US, with 20 companies, and Canada, with 13, are the best represented, but regionally, Europe continues to dominate the Global 100 with almost half the companies (46) to North America’s 33. The Asia Pacific region hosts 17 of the index’s members, while Latin America (two), Africa (one), and the Middle East (one) continue to lag.",solar
2021/01/22,"Boeing today announced that it will begin to deliver commercial airplanes capable of flying using 100% biofuel, or sustainable aviation fuel, by 2030.In order to power aircraft with biofuel, or fuel derived from living matter, Boeing will need to work with engine makers and change its aircraft systems, and also achieve safety certification by global regulators. The International Air Transport Association has a goal of cutting carbon emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050, so Boeing’s biofuel target is 2030, as jetliners typically stay in service for around 20 years.Commercial flying currently accounts for about 2% of all carbon dioxide emissions and about 12% of all transport emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group. Around 80% of aviation emissions are emitted from flights of over 932 miles (1,500 kilometers), for which there is no practical alternative mode of transport.Boeing has successfully flown using 100% biofuel before. In May 2018, it achieved the world’s first commercial airplane flight from Seattle to Memphis round-trip using 100% biofuel on a FedEx Corp 777 freighter. Check it out, and how the flight came about, in this video from Seattle TV station King 5:Biofuels are already mixed with conventional jet fuel up to a 50/50 blend, which is the maximum allowed under current fuel specifications. That will have to be adjusted to allow for the biofuel increase.FlightGlobal reports:Biofuels are produced from ‘bio-based feedstock’ like agricultural and forestry residues, chicken tallow, and cooking oils.Biofuel’s benefits can be negated if land must be cleared of vegetation to grow crops used to produce biofuel, according to the US Energy Information Administration. However, IATA says sustainable fuel, as it defines the term, cannot be produced from ‘anything that diverts land use from food crops, or destroys forests, or consumes too much fresh water, because that’s simply not sustainable.’The globe’s carriers burned only about 18.9 million liters (5 million US gallons) of sustainable fuel in 2019 – less than one-tenth of a percent of the 364 billion liters burned by all airlines.Boeing director of sustainability strategy Sean Newsum says of the company’s timeline:Sometime in the 2030s and 2040s, when we are accelerating the use of sustainable fuels, and the volumes get to be large, we want to make sure the airplanes in the global fleet are not inhibiting the global sustainable fuel adoption.We will be sharing progress as we go. We don’t have any of the specific steps or timelines we ready to state right now.Photo: Shoval Zonnis/Pexels.com",solar
2021/01/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson released his 10-point plan for a “green industrial revolution” in November. So why would the country plan for Europe’s largest gas power station?The UK is developing a 3.6 GW natural gas plant in Drax in North Yorkshire. Lawyers for ClientEarth, which legally challenged the UK government’s approval of the plant on the grounds that it breaches the government’s planning and climate change recommendations, say it could account for 75% of the UK’s power sector emissions when fully operational.Their challenge failed in the court of appeal. In 2019, the Planning Inspectorate recommended that ministers refuse permission. Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy at the time of the planning application, approved the project anyway in October 2019. The high court rejected ClientEarth’s initial legal challenge in May 2020.Representatives from the courts argued that major UK energy projects should not be rejected on climate grounds under the current planning frameworks, reports edie.net.ClientEarth said in a statement that this justification allows decision-makers to ‘hide behind planning policy to justify business-as-usual approvals of highly polluting projects.’ However, the organization will not be escalating the case to the Supreme Court.Greenpeace UK’s director of policy Doug Parr said:The government must U-turn and halt climate-wrecking projects, while the onus is also on Drax to do the right thing and take this project off the table.Drax will need to secure a capacity market contract from the government before starting construction. Proceeding also depends on Drax’s investment decisions. Watch this space.Meanwhile, there’s a very different dialogue going on on the Continent about natural gas.The European Investment Bank (EIB) has committed to stop financing fossil fuel projects by 2021. And at a press conference on the EIB’s annual results, EIB president Dr Werner Hoyer said on Wednesday:To put it mildly, gas is over.This is a serious departure from the past, but without the end to the use of unabated fossil fuels, we will not be able to reach the climate targets.The EU previously said in May 2020 that gas would be needed to help coal-reliant countries transition to clean energy, so the EIB’s commitment is going to impact that previous declaration in May.Euractiv reports:Under their climate bank road map published in 2020, the EIB plans to use 50% of its activity to support climate and environmental sustainability, unlocking €1 trillion for green funding by 2030. It will also ensure that all activity is aligned with the Paris Agreement.The UK is no longer eligible for EIB funding as a result of Brexit.

2021/01/21,"Sixty-six percent of registered US voters say developing sources of clean energy should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress. That’s according to a study released last week by Yale University and George Mason University’s climate change communication programs.Nearly 1,000 registered voters from across the political spectrum — Republicans, Democrats, and independents – were surveyed in December. Here’s what the researchers found out about energy policies overall, according to the executive summary (and click on the link above to see more results). In descending support order:And it looks as though President Joe Biden’s decision to have the US rejoin the Paris Agreement is going to be a popular one, because 75% of those polled last month said they supported it. Further, 79% supported a president – now Biden – hosting a meeting of the leaders of large industrialized nations to urge them to do more to reduce global warming, and yesterday, he announced that would happen on April 22.One result Electrek readers may find particularly interesting: only 44% support requiring that, by 2030, all new cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in the US are electric vehicles. So unlike the UK, which is implementing just that with Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson at the helm, US voters aren’t as bullish on switching over to all electric vehicles just yet and still want to hold onto their gas guzzlers.So tax rebates and funding research were the big favorites. Is that because those things are already familiar? Policies aimed at regulating industry saw slightly less support, and that was particularly unpopular among conservative Republicans, unsurprisingly, with only 29% supporting eliminating all carbon pollution from coal, oil, and gas.Liberal Democrat support for all of the above was consistently above 90%, and moderate Democrats tended to be in the 80% range, apart from research, at 91%. For moderate Republicans, anything that required change in the economy dropped into the 50s and 60 percentage point range.Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",solar
2021/01/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Researchers at China’s Southwest Jiaotong University unveiled the new 69-foot (21-meter) prototype maglev (magnetic levitation) train and 540 feet (165-meter) test track in Chengdu on January 13. The prototype train can run up to 385 mph (620 km/h). The developers hope to eventually boost its speed to 497 mph (800km/h).That means it could transport passengers between Beijing and Shanghai in just three and a half hours.  It takes around two hours nonstop to fly the same journey in an airplane.A maglev train uses one set of magnets to repel and push the train up off the track, and another set of magnets to move the elevated train ahead. It makes it look as if the train is floating. It doesn’t create direct emissions and is much quieter than regular trains. China, South Korea, and Japan use maglev trains.The prototype train runs on high-temperature superconducting power. The South China Morning Post explains:Superconductivity occurs where electrical resistance approaches zero when cooled to a very low temperature. The superconducting state would be key to support faster and more efficient maglev vehicles.The train could be operational within three to 10 years.Check out this video that showcases the new prototype and what could be coming down the pipeline for emissions-free, high-speed train travel in China:Ocean Wind, a 1.1 gigawatt offshore wind farm that Danish wind powerhouse Ørsted is developing about 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the coast of southern New Jersey, will use GE Renewable Energy’s powerful Haliade-X offshore wind turbines.The contracts cover the GE Haliade-X 12 MW wind turbine with an option for Ocean Wind to use the 13 MW variant.GE will provide the world’s most powerful wind turbines, the 14 MW Haliade-X turbines, for the first time to Dogger Bank, off England’s northeast coast, as Electrek reported on December 18.Ocean Wind could first provide power in late 2024.

2021/01/19,"Since COVID-19 officially arrived in the US, average electrical usage increased 9.3% from April through August 2020 compared to 2019, a reflection of people using more electricity while they stayed home, combined with wildfires in the West and heat waves across the US. Electricity demand rose by 22% from March 10 to April 10 as people stayed home. This was based on an analysis of anonymized energy data in more than 5,200 homes that have Sense home energy monitors. From April to September 2020, home electricity use continued to be higher than 2019, as per the graph below:Through spring and summer, US consumers paid an additional $1.21 billion on their monthly electricity bills in 2020 due to the combined impacts of the pandemic and climate change. The average additional cost is trending to $127 per household by year’s end.But the costs varied across the country. Sense did an analysis of states with disparate circumstances and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and here’s a quick look at three states with some of the largest populations in the US: New York, California, and Florida.New York had some of the highest increases in electricity usage through the spring and summer due to being hit by severe COVID-19 surges and shutdowns to slow the pandemic. New York residents that were monitored used 12.7% more electricity compared to 2019, which translated into $27 more per month, and cost an additional $190.8 million statewide each month. By the end of the year, New Yorkers are forecast to spend $243 extra on electricity in 2020, mostly related to COVID-19 impacts.On March 19, Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) issued a statewide stay-at-home order, due to COVID, one of the first states to mandate the policy. During a late-May heat wave, home electricity usage peaked at 21% higher than 2019. In August, wildfires tore across the state and air quality dramatically deteriorated, forcing residents indoors, and electricity usage spiked yet again, by 16%. Energy consumed during the end of the August heat wave was 31% higher than the highest week in 2019.Over the course of spring and summer, California residents in the study paid $19.60 more per month on average. By the end of 2020, residents are forecast to spend $176 more on their utility bills compared to a year ago.Florida has had looser COVID rules under Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL), apart from a 30-day stay-at-home order in April, which was widely criticized for being tardy. For example, the state recommends but does not require face masks. Home energy usage spiked by 18.6% in March when the East Coast experienced the first wave of the pandemic and people stayed at home voluntarily. By summer, the electricity usage was close to 2019 levels. Overall, Florida residents used only 3.9% more electricity in the spring and summer than they had in 2019 for an additional monthly cost of $8.40.As climate change will only continue to impact temperatures and the pandemic is far from over, US residents can take steps to reduce the cost of their electricity by taking such steps as opting for residential solar (see below), and monitoring and reducing their energy usage with devices such as smart thermostats and energy monitoring tools. Sometimes, it’s just as simple as turning off unnecessary lights and unused or idling appliances and adjusting the temperature of your home.

Canada’s CBC News was the first outlet to report yesterday that Biden intends to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit via executive action on his first day in office.CBC writes:A purported briefing note from the Biden transition team mentioning the plan was widely circulated over the weekend after being shared by the incoming president’s team with US stakeholders. The words ‘Rescind Keystone XL pipeline permit’ appear on a list of executive actions supposedly scheduled for Day 1 of Biden’s presidency.  The list shown to stakeholders is a lengthier version of a list already reported in the media based on a memo released publicly over the weekend by Biden’s chief of staff Ronald Klain. That publicly reported memo from Klain did not mention Keystone XL, but cautioned that the memo was not a complete list of planned actions.The Canadian government wants the Keystone XL project to proceed. Canada’s ambassador to Washington Kirsten Hillman said to Politico Sunday evening:The government of Canada continues to support the Keystone XL project.Keystone XL fits within Canada’s climate plan. It will also contribute to US energy security and economic competitiveness.Alberta Premier Jason Kenney vowed to work with Keystone XL developer TC Energy “to use all legal avenues available to protect” Alberta’s interest in the pipeline, according to a statement he released.Environmentalists celebrated Biden’s anticipated move. Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) tweeted:The Keystone pipeline is & always has been a disaster. I'm delighted that Joe Biden will cancel the Keystone permit on his first day in office.

We have however observed a positive shift over recent years reducing the gap. Based on our dialogue with API’s leadership we expect further progress.Equinor will remain a member of this organization and engage in further developing API’s climate position.For example, the API is keen to promote natural gas “as a foundation for a cleaner future,” and its report summary doesn’t even mention renewables. It takes the usual watered-down concession stance of “support the environment” (which you can’t do if you’re drilling it) and affordable energy, and energy efficiency. It does, however, actually use the words “climate change.” First off, American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers is in favor of drilling on federal land, which is in direct conflict with the beliefs of President-elect Joe Biden and incoming Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland (D-NM). In fact, he cited Haaland’s state of New Mexico’s Permian Basin, and argued that a restriction of drilling would cost the state jobs and money. (Did he not hear about the utter flop that was the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling auction last week in which no one bid but Alaska?)As Electrek has previously reported in November 2020, Sommers said the API would use “every tool at its disposal” including legal action in order to frack on federal lands, which he says are meant for “multi-use.”Sommers said this at the API’s event this week:I hope that the new secretary of Interior, despite her previous positions on our industry, comes to understand the importance of development of our federal lands.Further, Democratic progressives want the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipelines banned. Sommers’ take on that, besides also declaring that the US would need even more pipelines in the future?Each one of them is a magnet for obstruction and litigation.Further, President-elect wants to make the US grid emissions free by 2035. So Sommers cited California’s blackouts last summer during heatwaves as a cautionary tale, and the API’s solution is natural gas. Instead of suggesting putting effort into updating the grid to be able to transmit green energy, he said:California is trying to force an energy change that it simply isn’t ready for and technology doesn’t exist to support, putting its residents at risk.No one should be surprised when reality keeps interfering.That last sentence may turn out to be ironic.More than 100 elected officials in US western states have called on President-elect Joe Biden, Deb Haaland, and Congress in a letter, asking them to protect lands, fight the climate crisis, and support western communities.The letter, which can be read here on The Mountain Pact’s website, who organized the letter, includes calls to halt new oil and gas leases and industry bailouts; support local governments in relief packages; restore protections for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante national monuments and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; increase environmental and public health safeguards; and work to conserve 30% of US lands and waters by 2030.Here’s an excerpt from the letter:Our communities are shouldering the burden of increased unemployment, added public lands infrastructure needs, and costly climate impacts. To address this untenable situation, the Biden administration and the new Congress should prioritize adopting reforms that will reverse the devastating impacts that the “energy dominance” agenda has had on Western mountain communities over the past four years. Public lands should no longer be given away for pennies on the dollar, financial support should be provided to local governments amidst the pandemic, and meaningful actions should be taken to both address the climate crisis and protect our public lands.Some local officials weighed in on how climate change has affected their communities. Mayor Jonathan Godes of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, said:2020 was a hard year for Glenwood Springs. Between the quarry expansion and the Grizzly Creek Fire, our community has been dramatically impacted by a warming planet and the extraction industry. Our Federal government should prioritize helping small communities and businesses across the country, and focus on the new renewable energy economy.Town of Hailey, Idaho council member Kaz Thea, said:We have had significant wildfire impacts in our community and our entire community has been evacuated twice from large wildfires in the past several years. We have also seen flood impacts and early snow run off with spring conditions coming earlier and nights are overall warmer so our snow does not last as long. We have also been trending in a drought condition for many years which has impacted insect and disease infestation in our forests which then also increases wildfire risk. It’s a vicious cycle. Our mountain community will eventually lose its snow and lose our livelihood as being a skiing mountain town based on tourism if we do not reverse the impacts of climate change.City of Moab, Utah Council Member Kalen Jones said:COVID has been hard for a number of reasons and our community could use smarter federal help. Stimulus money, especially for small businesses and local governments, is still needed as we progress through the pandemic. Pre-2020 our vibrant economy was built on visitation to our beautiful public lands. Royalty relief and rampant leasing to subsidize fossil fuels sends counterproductive market signals, undermines Moab’s economy, is a distraction for our staff, council, and nonprofit partners, and is counter to our efforts to avoid the worst case outcomes of climate change.",solar
2021/01/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):A scientific study out of East China Normal University in Shanghai has found that solar cells treated with capsaicin, a component of chili peppers that makes them hot,  appear to be more efficient at converting solar energy, thus increasing solar panel efficiency.Researchers added capsaicin to ultra-thin perovskite solar cells during the manufacturing process in order to boost their ability to retain heat. They then exposed them to artificial light and measured the electrical current running through them.The New Scientist reports:Capsaicin made the solar cells more efficient, yielding a power conversion of 21.88%, versus 19.1% without capsaicin. The team then analyzed the solar cells with spectroscopy while conducting energy and found that the addition of capsaicin did indeed lead to a greater number of free electrons available to conduct current at the solar cells’ surface. This reduced energy leakage via heat.The exact mechanism behind this improvement is still being debated. [Scientist Qinye] Bao and his colleagues hypothesize that capsaicin molecules react with the lead ions in the solar cell to free up more electrons to conduct current.So, why capsaicin? Bao said:It is our priority to select sustainable forest-based biomaterials. Capsaicin is low-cost, natural, sustainable, and earth-abundant.Poland’s Senate yesterday unanimously passed the Offshore Wind Act. It will regulate the development of offshore wind farms in the Polish Baltic Sea. It’s now cleared Poland’s legislative branch, and Polish president Andrzej Duda is expected to sign it into law imminently. It will become active at the end of this month or early next month.The act allows for 5.9 GW of offshore wind capacity. Projects that are furthest along in development stages will be allocated capacity, and some of those projects could be online by 2025. According to offshoreWind.biz:The second phase of development will include two auctions, the first in 2025 and the second in 2027, both for 2.5 GW of capacity, bringing Poland’s total offshore wind capacity either operational or under development to 10.9 GW by 2027.Kamila Tarnacka, vice-president of the Polish Wind Energy Association, said [via offshoreWind.biz]:This is a historic moment and a key act not only for our energy, mostly based on fossil fuels, but also for our economy.The energy potential of the Baltic Sea is enormous and the conditions in the Polish part of the sea are among the best for this type of investment. We should take advantage of this. Ultimately, we can connect up to 28 GW of capacity in offshore wind farms to the Polish system and thus become the region’s leader.While this is a positive step forward for Poland in adopting green energy, the country is one of Europe’s biggest producers of coal, and relies on the fossil fuel for almost 80% of its electricity production. It does not expect to improve its plan to close its coal mines by 2049, despite the fact that the European Union member states agreed to cut emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, boosting the previous 40% target.Photo: Tom Swinnen/Pexels.com",solar
2021/01/13,"In an exclusive, Reuters reports that Siemens Gamesa and Siemens Energy will develop commercial offshore wind turbines that can produce hydrogen via electrolysis. “It is the renewable industry’s most concrete plan yet to capitalize on an expected boom in hydrogen demand.”Siemens Energy owns 67% of Siemens Gamesa, the world’s largest offshore wind turbine maker. The two companies are investing €120 million ($146 million) in the project. Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis, in which renewable energy sources — in this case, offshore wind — split water into hydrogen and oxygen.Siemens Gamesa chief executive Andreas Nauen said [via Reuters]:We have to completely retool the turbine, which has been designed for electricity production.We’re looking at our 14 megawatt turbine, which will be our bread-and-butter product by the mid 2020s.From the mid-2020s, they’re planning on targeting large industries such as steelmakers and chemical firms who need to decarbonize as part of Europe’s efforts to meet its Paris Agreement targets. They’re considering Germany, which borders the North and Baltic Seas, as the location for a first commercial project of around 100-200 megawatts in size. Clients will need to be near the source of green hydrogen production – the offshore wind turbines – as the hydrogen will be transported by pipelines.The German government said today that it would contribute €700 million in support of three of the companies’ model projects by 2025. Germany is planning to become a global hydrogen leader. It has designated €9 billion to launch a national hydrogen industry.Christian Bruch, chief executive of Siemens Energy, said [via Reuters]:It’s really about developing a commercially viable product.I don’t know any other company that combines wind energy, electrolysis, and offshore high voltage technology all in one enterprise.Hydrogen is a key topic but there’s no silver bullet here.“Although most projects across the continent are at pilot stage, the EU estimates investments in green hydrogen in Europe could reach €470 billion by 2050 and create up to 1 million jobs,” Reuters writes.Photo: Siemens Gamesa",solar
2021/01/13,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):As the world gradually transitions from fossil fuels to green energy, it’s important that we monitor our air quality for the foreseeable future in order to protect our health. For example, Electrek reported last year that air pollution increases COVID-19 deaths.Grenoble, France-headquartered sensor tech company eLichens has just introduced eLsi (pictured above) at CES 2021. It’s a battery operated indoor air quality monitoring station. It measures and provides highly accurate real-time indoor air quality data. It can also be used for HVAC control and as part of building management systems. eLsi comes with a dedicated dashboard and a mobile application available on Android/iOS. The application allows users to see real-time data and history per pollutant, and alerts in case of unhealthy air detection. It has a 3.5-inch touchscreen and LED status indicator, online data storage and a building management dashboard, and outdoor air quality data. It even gives you instruction to improve your air quality, such as “open your windows.”Its gas sensors measure:eLsi is a standout product because it’s an all-in-one solution, it consumes low amounts of power, and it features high data accuracy. It’s brand new, so the price is not yet listed; just that it’s “coming soon.”Eight solar projects producing up to 16 megawatts – 2 megawatts each – have just come online in mid-Michigan’s Genesee and Saginaw counties. Five are in Genesee, and three are in Saginaw. Each have 20-year agreements to supply energy to public utility Consumers Energy, which provides electricity to 6.7 million of Michigan’s 10 million residents.US solar farm developer Pine Gate Renewables, headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina, built all eight sites and will operate them. The solar farms are owned by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors. The eight solar farms include a total of 56,313 solar panels and around 240 local workers worked on them during construction.Pine Gate Renewables CEO Ben Catt said:We’re excited to be a part of developing renewable energy in Michigan. Each solar project provides tax revenue, jobs, and clean energy to the local communities.Consumers Energy’s Clean Energy Plan intends to eliminate coal, reach net-zero carbon emissions, and meet 90% of customers’ energy needs through clean sources like green energy, energy waste reduction, and energy storage.Consumers Energy has agreements to purchase energy from six additional Kayne Anderson solar projects elsewhere in Michigan that are scheduled to begin operating this month.To date, solar has not played a major part in Michigan’s power makeup, but that looks set to shift. “In 2019, renewable resources provided more than 8% of Michigan’s electricity net generation, with 60% of that provided by wind. Michigan ranks 15th among the states in wind-powered electricity generation,” according to the EIA.Photo: eLichens",solar

2021/01/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In Hawaii, a power purchase agreement (PPA) has been signed between local electric utility Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) and energy company AES Corporation for the West Kauai Energy Project (WKEP). The PPA will provide a large-scale solar PV system with pumped hydro energy storage on the island of Kauai.The system could meet up to 25% of Kauai’s energy demand, boosting its green energy in its energy mix to more than 80%. Kauai reached 55% green energy by the end of 2019.As Energy Storage News explains:The WKEP project, which will combine a 35MW solar PV system with 240MWh of pumped hydro storage, will take that percentage much further. The facility will also include some battery storage to help control the time-shifting of stored solar energy into the island’s evening peak as well as hydropower generation to contribute further renewable generation capacity.The pumped hydro facility will be able to output 24MW of power on average per day and store energy for up to 12 hours.Hawaii is aiming to reach 100% green energy by 2045. It has the highest amount of solar capacity deployed per capita.The UK’s national grid reported yesterday that the country had its best green energy year on record in 2020.The National Grid’s Electricity System Operator said:Significant periods of coal-free electricity generation and record-breaking levels of power from zero carbon sources were key factors…while record low electricity demand during the nation’s lockdown also contributed.The record for the highest-ever level of wind generation was broken several times during the year – most recently on December 18 (17.2GW) – while August 26 saw wind contributing its highest-ever share to the electricity mix (59.9%).Solar also set new records for its highest-ever level of generation (9.7GW) and its highest share in the mix (34%), providing one-third of Britain’s electricity supplies on several occasions in May.Reuters reports:Measures on homes and business to contain the novel coronavirus curbed electricity demand last year.The country was powered coal-free for over 5,147 hours in 2020, compared with 3,666 hours in 2019, National Grid ESO said.

2021/01/11,"The addition of utility-scale solar capacity is expected to set a new record by adding 15.4 GW of capacity to the US grid in 2021, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) announced today.Solar leads the 2021 pack with 39% of total new US electricity generating capacity. It’s followed by wind (31%, or 12.2 GW), natural gas (16%, or 6.6 GW), battery storage (11%, or 4.3 GW), nuclear (3%, or 1.1 GW), and Other, at 0.2 GW.2021’s expected 15.4 GW of solar will exceed 2020’s nearly 12 GW increase, based on reported additions through October (6 GW) and scheduled additions for the last two months of 2020 (5.7 GW).Four states will be home to more than half of the new utility-scale solar photovoltaic capacity: Texas (28%), Nevada (9%), California (9%), and North Carolina (7%). As Electrek previously reported, Texas will host the largest solar project in the US, the Samson Solar Energy Center, which will be constructed in five phases over the next three years, with each phase commencing operation upon completion in 2023. Another 12.2 GW of wind capacity is scheduled to come online in 2021. Last year, 21 GW of wind came online. Texas and Oklahoma account for more than half of the 2021 wind capacity additions. The 12-MW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) pilot project, located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, is also scheduled to start commercial operation in early 2021.Natural gas is a dirty fossil fuel. Planned natural gas capacity additions are reported at 6.6 GW, mainly in Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.EIA expects the capacity of utility-scale battery storage to more than quadruple; 4.3 GW of battery power capacity additions are expected to come online by the end of 2021. This is because battery storage goes hand-in-hand with green energy.The world’s largest solar-powered battery (409 MW) is under construction at Manatee Solar Energy Center in Florida; the battery is scheduled to be operational by late 2021. In the annual survey, EIA asks respondents to provide planned online dates for generators coming online in the next five years.

2021/01/11,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Scientists have managed to successfully convert raw coal powder into nano-graphite, which is used in lithium-ion batteries, among other things, according to a study, “Converting raw coal powder into polycrystalline nano-graphite by metal-assisted microwave treatment,” published in the journal Nano-Structures & Nano-Objects.Previous research has shown that microwaves can be used to reduce the moisture content of coal and remove sulphur and other minerals, but in this latest experiment, the only treatment required was to grind raw Wyoming’s Powder River Basin coal into powder, reports mining.com.The coal powder was put on copper foil and sealed in glass containers with a gas mixture of argon and hydrogen, before being placed in a microwave oven.Chris Masi, lead author of the paper, said:By cutting the copper foil into a fork shape, sparks were induced by the microwave radiation, generating an extremely high temperature of more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit within a few seconds.The study’s abstract states:Specifically, four major factors are identified for successful conversion: (1) high temperature; (2) reducing environment; (3) catalyst; and (4) microwave radiation.The high temperatures, copper foil, and gas then transformed the coal powder into polycrystalline graphite.Battery University explains how graphite works in Li-ion batteries here.A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled “The value of inter-regional coordination and transmission in decarbonizing the US electricity system,” published in Joule, asserts that “streamlining the planning and permitting process for new transmission and coordinating decarbonization at the national (rather than state) level could enable a more efficient and rapid transition to a zero-carbon electricity system.”The four highlights of the study noted were:US electricity demand can be met with currently available zero-carbon technologies.Inter-regional coordination and transmission construction significantly reduce cost.Nuclear, if available, plays a smaller role than renewables at central cost projections.Nationally planned decarbonization is more efficient than state or regional approaches.MIT researcher Patrick Brown says it’s cheaper to increase links and transmission network capacity rather than overbuild green energy and storage. Brown says [via GreenTech Media]:It has a huge impact. The costs are relatively small, and it delivers oversize benefits.It’s important to consider the contingency options with technology we can deploy at scale now.GreenTech Media continues:There are two main reasons for this. First, nationwide transmission allows power-sharing across regions facing widely different weather systems that drive variation in wind and solar generation. This geographic diversity reduces the likelihood that renewables won’t be able to meet demand, thereby decreasing the amount and duration of energy storage required to cover those gaps, he said.Second, it allows wind and solar development to be concentrated in the sunniest and windiest parts of the country so that more clean energy can be supplied by less installed generation capacity, as well as requiring it to be curtailed less often, Brown said.",solar
2021/01/08,"Robots aren’t going to take over the world, but they can definitely make life a lot easier for humans. And that was the aim of BladeBUG, a UK startup that has developed insect-like robots to inspect, maintain, and repair offshore wind turbine blades without the need for rope access.BladeBUG’s founder and CEO, Chris Cieslak, has a background in wind turbine blade design. His company spotted a gap in the market: How will the offshore wind industry maintain and repair the giant turbine blades once they’re swooshing through the air, high above the water, without requiring wind turbine workers to dangle precariously above the sea? (Who’s going to want to hang off the giant 14 MW Haliade-X Dogger Bank turbine blades? Yikes.) Not only does the robot make it safer for rope access technicians; it also saves money for the wind turbine companies, as it’s expensive to have humans climb out onto turbine blades.So the now seven-person, London-based startup invented BladeBUG, a six-legged robot with suction cups on its feet that can change shape as it crawls along wind turbine blades. The robot has cameras so the operator can see what’s going on, and it’s steered by a gaming controller from the top of the turbine. It uses sensors to find damage or anything hindering the wind turbines’s efficiency. It can even make small repairs.And for an extra dose of cool, drones can carry the BladeBUG robots to the offshore wind farms.The young company was funded by the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a UK government industrial innovation program. As a result, BladeBUG was able to form a partnership with the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, the UK’s leading technology innovation center for offshore wind, wave, and tidal energy.In October 2020, the BladeBUG robot successfully walked on an offshore wind turbine in Scotland (pictured above left).The BladeBUG will undergo commercial trials in 2021 and is expected to go to market in 2022.

The $175 million plant in Rochester, New York, will be on the site of what was the Eastman Kodak complex and will create 100 new jobs. Li-Cycle plans to begin construction on the facility in 2021.IEEE Spectrum writes:The plant will have an eventual capacity of 25 metric kilotons of input material, recovering 95% or more of the cobalt, nickel, lithium, and other valuable elements through the company’s zero-wastewater, zero-emissions process.Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle’s cofounder and CEO, says:We’ll be one of the largest domestic sources of nickel and lithium, as well as the only source of cobalt in the United States.As lithium-ion battery production rapidly grows – global EV sales are expected to climb from 1.7 million in 2020 to 26 million in 2030 – Li-ion battery recycling becomes a growing priority. Of the 180,000 metric tons of Li-ion batteries available for recycling worldwide in 2019, just a little over half were recycled. Li-ion battery recycling mostly takes place in China and South Korea, but there are a couple dozen startups in North America and Europe and more are in the works.Jeff Spangenberger, director of the ReCell Center, a battery-recycling research collaboration supported by the US Department of Energy, says:Recycling batteries is better than if we mine new materials and throw the batteries away.But recycling companies have trouble making profits. We need to make it cost effective, so that people have an incentive to bring their batteries back.The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on the North American auto industry has a 2030 requirement of 75% locally produced content, and use of recycled battery materials could help North American EV manufacturers achieve that. Tim Johnston at Li-Cycle writes:This North American recycling solution could be a game changer for the regional EV industry as it helps the environment by removing waste materials and also assists North American companies meet USMCA’s regulations.Vietnam saw a huge leap in rooftop solar installations in 2020.

That’s about one-third of a cut.The deadline for bids was yesterday. And the number of offers were… one, from the Alaska Industrial Development and Industrial Authority, a state agency. In other words, Alaska was the sole bidder in its own auction. No oil giants placed bids, as they are increasingly focusing their shift to green energy in an oil slump.Alaska governor Mike Dunleavy tried to put a positive spin on the auction results:Bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities. Alaskans have waited two generations for this moment; I stand with them in support of this day.#akgov #akoil #AlaskaAs the Alaska Wilderness League explains, Eleven tracts received complete bids totaling just more than $14 million, well below the $1.8 billion (or less than 1%) in revenue promised by drilling proponents in the lead up to passage of the Tax Act in 2017. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority was the leading bidder. All in all, just over 550,000 acres of the 1.6-million-acre coastal plain received bids.Instead of the federal treasury and the state of Alaska making billions, today the state of Alaska had to spend money to make an Arctic Refuge lease sale happen.Nearly all of the land sold for the minimum price of $25 an acre.Adam Kolton, executive director, Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement:This lease sale was an epic failure for the Trump administration and the Alaska congressional delegation. After years of promising a revenue and jobs bonanza they ended up throwing a party for themselves, with the state being one of the only bidders. We have long known that the American people don’t want drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the Gwich’in people don’t want it, and now we know the oil industry doesn’t want it either.Ultimately, we believe the courts will find the Trump administration’s Arctic Refuge drilling scheme to be illegal, violating bedrock environmental laws and ignoring its responsibility to protect the food security of Indigenous peoples and the refuge’s irreplaceable wildlife and wilderness values.President-elect Joe Biden has opposed any development on the refuge, and may be able to overturn drilling now that the Democrats have control of the US House and Senate.",solar

So sustainable mining of lithium is becoming increasingly important and even required.Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia are known as the “lithium triangle,” because the three countries contain more than 70% of the world’s reserves of lithium beneath its salt flats. Australia is also a big source of lithium. So, as American Metal Market points out, “A key point of focus over the course of 2020 was the consumption of water in the lithium extraction process in South America.”American Metal Market reports, for example:In October, incumbent Chilean lithium producer Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) unveiled its sustainable development plan intended to reduce the environmental impact of its operations.The miner pledged to immediately reduce the use of fresh water at its operations in Chile’s Salar de Atacama region by 30% in comparison with 2019 levels. It aims to raise this reduction to 50% by 2030.The announcement followed renewed scrutiny of SQM’s use of fresh water and the effects that its operations have on the ecosystem of the western part of the Salar de Atacama area. A number of indigenous communities had raised concerns about its operations.This is a result of pressure from Europe: The EC proposes that from July 1, 2024, only rechargeable industrial and EV batteries for which a carbon footprint declaration has been established would be allowed entry into the European Union market.Further, Mercedes-Benz said in November 2020 that it will only use batteries with materials from mines certified as sustainable. BMW has also just commissioned a study on sustainable lithium extraction in South America.Here’s a HyperClips YouTube interview from July 2020 with former Tesla battery supply chain manager Vivas Kumar about the environmental impact of lithium extraction:Photo: An artist’s rendering of Consumers Energy’s community solar farm at Grand Valley State University, Michigan",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2021/01/04,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Japan aims to get rid of fully gas-powered cars and other vehicles in the next 15 years, the government announced over the holiday break. It’s part of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s green growth strategy to create around $2 trillion a year in green growth and reach net zero by 2050. This is confirmation of a plan Electrek reported on last month. The plan, however, still allows for conventional hybrids.To increase the switch to electric vehicles, the Japanese government is working to cut the cost of vehicle batteries by more than half to $97 (10,000 yen) or less per kilowatt-hour by 2030.Further, as Reuters reports:It aims to boost hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes by 2030 and to about 20 million tonnes by 2050 from 200 tonnes in 2017, in areas such as power generation and transportation.Massachusetts bipartisan state legislative negotiators yesterday agreed on a plan, bill S.2995, called “An Act creating a next-generation roadmap for Massachusetts climate policy.” The comprehensive bill will now be put before the state’s House and Senate. It includes the following, according to MassLive:The bill calls for utilities to purchase an additional 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind generation, raising the total state authorization to 5,600 megawatts.The Department of Public Utilities would also need to alter its approach to regulating the electric and natural gas utilities under the bill.The legislation is also designed to ensure that at least 40% of the state’s electric power will be renewable by 2030, by making incremental changes in the state’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard each year from 2025 through 2029.The bill requires that gross emissions by 2050 must fall at least 85% below 1990 levels.South Korean president Moon Jae-in announced today that the country will replace all diesel passenger trains with an electric bullet train, the KTX-Eum, by 2029. This move will cut around 30% of emissions from rail travel.Moon traveled on the KTX-Eum between Wonju in Gangwon Province and Jecheon in North Chungcheong Province. It will go into public service tomorrow.The six-car KTX-Eum (electric multiple unit) is an electric multiple unit train built by Hyundai Rotem Co. It produces around 70% of emissions of diesel-powered trains. It can go up to 162 mph. It uses distributed traction with driving trailers at each end and six powered intermediate carsReuters reports:Korail chief, Son Byung-seok, told Moon that the company aims to expand high-speed services from 29% of all routes to 52% by 2024, as part of the government’s plans to funnel 70 trillion won ($64.7 billion) into rail networks.Moon said: If roads were the arteries of economic development in the 20th century for us, railways are the main arteries of economic and social development in the 21st century.A green energy plan is central to South Korea’s pandemic stimulus plan, as Electrek reported in July.",solar
2021/01/01,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Christopher Flavelle at the New York Times wrote an article published today about “how Trump tried, but largely failed, to derail America’s top climate report.” Flavelle’s article is based on interviews with nearly a dozen current and former government officials. It’s quite a compelling (and slightly horrifying) post (click here to read it) about the Trump administration’s attempt to bury the National Climate Assessment, which “assesses the science of climate change and variability and its impacts across the United States, now and throughout this century.”A new National Climate Assessment is required by law every four years, and the fourth assessment was released in 2018. You can read it here. The 2018 assessment unequivocally states throughout that climate change is a threat to all aspects of life and the environment, and also asserts:Global action to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions can substantially reduce climate-related risks and increase opportunities for these populations in the longer term.So of course the above statement released during the Trump administration contradicts Donald Trump’s simultaneous attempt to prop up the fossil-fuel industry — and he didn’t like that so much. These Obama-era scientists had this to say to Flavelle:‘Thank God they didn’t know how to run a government,’ said Thomas Armstrong, who during the Obama administration led the US Global Change Research Program, which produces the [The National Climate Assessment, America’s premier contribution to climate knowledge]. ‘It could have been a lot worse.’John Holdren, who as science adviser to President Obama helped oversee the climate assessment process, said he believed the Biden administration would be able to get it back on track and push aside anyone trying to undermine it.‘Holdover climate wafflers from the Trump period, in any of the relevant agencies, will be removed,’ Dr. Holdren said. ‘Or if that’s not possible, told to butt out.’S&P Global Market Intelligence did an analysis of a forecast of wind and utility-scale solar projects in the US through 2024. The 2020 pandemic caused record job losses in the renewable industry, but also saw strong capacity additions for wind and solar.The US Energy Information Administration said in November that wind increased to 8.8% of US electricity generation in 2020. Wind is the largest source of green energy in the US.Solar power made up 1.8% of US utility-scale generating capacity in 2019. (Yes, that’s tiny.) But S&P Global says solar is about to make a big leap:[S]olar has a more robust development pipeline than wind power as its use surges in the US Southeast, Texas, and California and as developers increasingly pair solar power with battery storage projects.Going forward, S&P’s analysis “shows a pipeline of 172.5 GW of capacity for wind and solar projects through 2024. Of that, 75.7 GW are wind power projects while 96.8 GW are solar power projects, the data shows.”Wind and solar projects totaling 30.7 GW of capacity are now under construction. Meanwhile, 18.2 GW of projects are in advanced development, 109.3 GW are in early development, and developers announced 14.1 GW of new projects.More than 5.4 GW of wind projects under construction are scheduled for completion in 2021, while 4.3 GW of solar projects under construction are scheduled for completion in 2021, the data shows.Most of the capacity in the pipeline for wind power projects, 40.6 GW, is in early development.Like wind power, most of the capacity in the solar power pipeline, 68.6 GW, through 2024 is in early development.Photo: Glacier National Park/National Climate Assessment",solar
2020/12/31,"In 2019, US annual energy consumption from green energy sources exceeded coal consumption for the first time in 134 years, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Monthly Energy Review.How was this major milestone achieved? Simply put, coal is declining and wind and solar are growing. Coal consumption in the US decreased by nearly 15% in 2019, and total renewable energy consumption grew by 1%, compared with the previous year.The EIA explains:In 2019, US coal consumption decreased for the sixth consecutive year to 11.3 quadrillion Btu, the lowest level since 1964. Electricity generation from coal has declined significantly over the past decade and, in 2019, fell to its lowest level in 42 years. Natural gas consumption in the electric power sector has significantly increased in recent years and has displaced much of the electricity generation from retired coal plants.Total renewable energy consumption in the United States grew for the fourth year in a row to a record-high 11.5 quadrillion Btu in 2019… In 2019, electricity generation from wind surpassed hydro for the first time and is now the most-used source of renewable energy for electricity generation in the United States on an annual basis.Wood was the main source of US energy until the mid-1800s. Then the first hydropower plants began to produce electricity in the 1880s. The US used coal in the early 19th century to fuel steam-powered boats and trains and manufacture steel. It was later used to generate electricity in the 1880s, and 90% of its consumption is now used primarily to generate electricity. Renewable energy is more broadly consumed by every sector in the United States. About 56% of commercially delivered US renewable energy is used in the electric power sector, mostly from wind and hydroelectric power, but different types are also consumed in the industrial (22%), transportation (12%), residential (7%), and commercial (2%) sectors.Well, this is a nice New Year’s Eve reminder from the EIA, which originally posted this announcement in May. It’s nice to reflect on something positive from the past year.Keep in mind that these are the EIA’s statistics from 2019, so 2020, as weird as it was as a whole due to the pandemic and the turbulent US election, is going to have even better green energy versus coal/fossil fuel statistics due to COVID-19 lockdowns.But the US has got to get that natural gas consumption down, as no matter how hard gas companies try to sell it as clean, it’s not. Once the Biden administration takes its collective seat and gets to work on its climate change plan, we are optimistic that future EIA reports are going to look even greener when it comes to renewables.",solar
2020/12/31,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):A new innovation outlook report about thermal energy storage from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) defines it as the “temporary storage of energy by heating or cooling a storage medium so that the stored energy can be used at a later time for power generation. Thermal energy storage is tested and deployed in a variety of applications, such as utility-scale power generation, industry, district heating and cooling, buildings and cold chain logistics.”IRENA states that the “global market for [thermal energy storage] could triple in size by 2030, growing…  to over 800 GWh within a decade. Thermal energy storage investments can help to fulfill long-term climate and sustainability goals.”The University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) in Queensland, Australia, has already proven that thermal energy storage is effective. The system (pictured above) was switched on in August 2019, and it’s the first of its kind among Australian universities. It has a three-story thermal energy storage tank built by environmental solutions company Veolia that functions as a “battery,” and around 6,500 solar panels across campus rooftops and parking garages. The 2.1 MW solar PV system produces enough energy to cool 4.5 megaliters of water. The cooled water is stored and used for air conditioning, which consumes around 60% of the university campus’ electricity.A year and a half later, USC has released the system’s performance figures, and it’s been a big success. It generated more than 3 GWh of electricity in its first 12 months of operation. It also put an additional 2 GWh of electricity into Queensland’s energy grid.The project, which is expected to have a 25-year life, will save USC AU$100 million in electricity costs. USC’s goal is to become carbon neutral by 2025.Here’s a video that explains more about USC’s system:Mason County, Illinois, just north of Springfield, is going to get a 185 MW wind farm called Glacier Sands. Cordelio Power awarded the project to White Construction, a subsidiary of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives Inc. (IEA), an infrastructure construction company. The 43-turbine wind farm is expected to be completed in October 2021.IEA has constructed more than 20 GW of renewable energy projects across North America to date.North American Windpower provides the state’s wind power context:Illinois ranks sixth in the nation for installed wind capacity according to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), with over 5,800 MW of wind online.

2020/12/24,"A Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) research team published a paper in the journal Science earlier this month on the development of a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell that achieved 29.15% efficiency. That’s a new world record.This beats the previous achievement of 28% efficiency. The long-term efficiency target for a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is 30%, so this is an excitingly close step to that goal.And even better, scientists are optimistic that 30% for this type of panel can be surpassed, thus achieving even greater solar energy efficiency.Silicon is currently the standard material in solar cells, and perovskite and silicon have been developed separately as semiconductor materials for solar panels. Scientists see perovskite as having untapped potential, and they’ve been experimenting with it by combining it with other materials.In this case, the scientists combined it with silicon and got a result they were pleased with.Eike Köhnen, PhD student and shared first author of the study, said:29.15% efficiency is not only the record for this technology but is at the very top of the entire Emerging PV category in the NREL [National Renewable Energy Laboratory] chart.So why did the perovskite/silicon combination work so well? HZB explains:Solar cells consisting of two semiconductors with differing band gaps can achieve considerably higher efficiencies when used in tandem compared to the individual cells on their own. This is because tandem cells use the solar spectrum more efficiently. In particular, conventional silicon solar cells primarily convert the infrared components of light efficiently into electrical energy, while certain perovskite compounds can effectively utilize the visible components of sunlight, making this a powerful combination.Also, using perovskite and silicon together doesn’t increase the cost of the solar panels, which is really important as the world scales up the use of solar energy.The research team used a 1 cm x 1 cm (0.4 inch x 0.4 inch) panel, so of course scaling up is needed, but the research team is confident this is doable. Further, after 300 hours of simulated use, the tandem solar cell retained 95% of its original efficiency.Illustration: Composition of the tandem solar cell. Eike Köhnen/HZB",solar

The US’ largest wind farm will have the capacity to power up to 660,000 homes.This next step follows the completion of Dominion’s pilot 12 MW offshore wind project in Virginia. They were the first offshore wind turbines approved by regulators in federal waters.Dominion Energy Virginia is required to be 100% carbon-free by 2045 by the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which was passed in April. The project could create around 900 jobs and $143 million in economic impact annually during construction, and 1,100 jobs and almost $210 million in economic impact annually during operation of the turbines.US utility Ameren Missouri, a subsidiary of Ameren, has acquired Missouri’s largest wind farm. It’s Ameren’s first foray into wind power, and a welcome one, as the company is currently dominated by coal. Ameren’s chairman and president Marty Lyons said the acquisition was “just the beginning… [of] a transformational advancement toward more renewable wind and solar generation.”Missouri is a coal-hungry state: The fossil fuel “provided 73% of Missouri’s electricity net generation in 2019, and more coal was consumed for generation in Missouri than in any other state except for Texas and Indiana,” according to the US Energy Information Administration.The High Prairie Renewable Energy Center in northeastern Missouri is a 400MW, 175-turbine wind farm, and one of two that Ameren Missouri is going to acquire.Renews.biz reports:The company recently released plans to invest approximately $4.5bn (€3.63bn) in 3100MW of renewable generation by 2030.This includes $1.2 billion for the planned acquisitions of this project and a 300MW site in Atchison County, Missouri.Ameren Missouri expects High Prairie to produce enough energy to power 120,000 homes in 2021.St. Louis-based Ameren Missouri aims to reduce emissions by half in the next 10 years, compared to 2005 levels, and to reach net zero by 2050.",solar

It will be built at the Paulsboro Marine Terminal in Gloucester County in South Jersey and will create more than 500 high-paying jobs at full build out. Murphy said:Offshore wind is a once-in-a-generation opportunity that allows us to protect our environment while significantly expanding and securing the state’s economy for the immediate and long term. This is the largest industrial offshore wind investment in the United States to date and will create hundreds of high-paying jobs at a time when New Jersey’s economy has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.Construction on the facility will break ground next month, and production will begin in 2023.In June 2020, Murphy announced plans to develop the New Jersey Wind Port in Lower Alloways Creek, a first-in-the-nation infrastructure investment that will provide a location for essential staging, assembly, and manufacturing activities related to offshore wind projects on the East Coast. The New Jersey Wind Port and the new manufacturing facility at the Paulsboro Marine Terminal position New Jersey as a leader in offshore wind and green energy procurement.Dan Cosner, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) 351 and South Jersey Building Trades, said:I’m proud to be part of this landmark event that will provide long term sustainable jobs for the southern New Jersey economy, while also helping the governor meet his goals for his Energy Master Plan and providing another milestone project that provides green energy.Monopile foundations extend the turbine tower underwater and into the seabed. Curious about how offshore wind farms are built? Check out this video:This is exactly the kind of thing that gets me excited when I write green energy stories, and what I’m hoping to see a lot more of in the new few years. New Jersey is creating long-term, well-paid jobs with this huge offshore wind manufacturing initiative. With the help of expert companies from Europe, it’s creating US-made renewable components that will facilitate offshore wind farm development in the US.I would love to see similar initiatives in areas previously powered by fossil fuels in order to provide green energy jobs for those workers, too. This is what Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) identified is needed in a bill she introduced in July to support communities who have suffered job losses as a result of the demise of the coal industry.

2020/12/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):If you are a US homeowner and are considering installing rooftop solar panels, there’s good news. Congress has extended the current rooftop solar tax credit incentive of 26%, which was about to expire at the end of 2020, for two years.The solar tax incentive extension was included in a $1.4 trillion omnibus package Congress passed along with the $900 billion COVID relief package. Under the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar projects, the residential solar tax credit will remain at 26% for 2021 and 2022. The ITC will then drop to 22% for projects that begin construction before the end of 2023. This extension replaces the old household solar plan that dropped the credit to 22% in 2021 and then to zero after 2021.Forbes explains how the new plan works in a hypothetical example:Say you have a contract for a $40,000 16kW LG Solar system for your home in Connecticut. The 26% federal credit would give you $10,400 off, compared to $8,800 off under the 22% credit. That’s an extra $1,600 savings. You get the credit (dollar for dollar) off your income taxes for the year when you install the solar panels, and it’s applied to the cost after state incentives.The credits are due to fall to 10% for large solar projects and to 0% for small solar projects in 2024. But Ravi Manghani, head of solar research for Wood Mackenzie, said [via GreenTech Media]:[The bill] provides the industry a full extra year to negotiate longer-term tax credits or tie renewables directly with future carbon policies with the friendly Biden administration.According to analysis from independent research firm Rhodium Group, the US government’s omnibus package saw “the most significant action on climate and energy in over a decade.”In addition to the above solar tax credits, wind power also got a boost. The package extends the production tax credit and ITC for onshore wind for one year at 60% of the project’s full value, and gives offshore wind projects, for the first time, a 30% ITC for projects that began construction starting January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2025. Rhodium details other package standouts:The highest-impact provisions focus on phasing down superwarming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and advancing carbon capture and storage. Over the next 15 years, the HFC phasedown [an 85% cut] will reduce 900 million metric tons (MMt) of carbon dioxide equivalent — more than the total annual emissions of Germany. Over that same period, additional carbon capture projects could reduce as much as 585 million tons — more than the annual emissions of Australia.The energy package authorizes nearly $40 billion in new research, development and demonstration funding for clean energy. It also overhauls major parts of the Department of Energy’s RD&D programs to focus on a wider array of clean technologies. Axios points out that “the cumulative 15-year effect of the HFC and CO2 sequestration credits would more than counteract the impact of two big Trump-era decisions: weakening vehicle emissions standards and rolling back methane rules for the oil-and-gas sector.”Sam Ricketts, cofounder of the environmental group Evergreen Action, said:[T]his legislation is a down payment on the clean energy economic recovery that President-elect Biden will realize in full, starting next year.Biden has made addressing climate change one of his central priorities, but he will face big challenges from the Republicans.",solar
2020/12/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):On November 17, Electrek reported that Donald Trump’s administration was bulldozing through a last-minute gas and oil drilling-rights auction in Alaska’s 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.Biden vowed to block oil exploration in the largest national wildlife refuge in the US. Biden’s interior secretary nominee, Deb Haaland, who is Native American, also opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Late last week, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) suddenly announced that it would slash the 1.56 million acres that it originally planned to auction off by 457,000 acres, which are in the southeastern corner of the Coastal Plain. That’s about one-third of a cut.The BLM said [via the Anchorage Daily News]:In addition to tract nominations, BLM received and reviewed over 40,000 comments during the nomination and comment period, the vast majority of which were opposed to leasing of any tracts in the Coastal Plain.Drilling opponents say fossil-fuel drilling will harm wildlife such as caribou and polar bears. The BLM began accepting bids today. Will any oil companies bother to bid? Former Alaska governor and senator Frank Murkowski (the father of the current Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski) doesn’t seem to think so.The reduction of the size of the land up for auction won’t stop the four lawsuits filed that oppose the drilling entirely. Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, said [via Reuters]:Any disturbance or disruption to the coastal plain is a direct attack on the Gwich’in way of life and the Gwich’in people.“A federal judge in Alaska said last week that she hopes to rule by January 6, the day of the scheduled lease sale, on a restraining order that could pause the plan,” Reuters reports.Los Angeles-based EV manufacturer Xos Trucks, who currently supplies trucks to UPS and Loomis and is teaching Dickinson Fleet Services how to service electric vehicles, is partnering with Dutch-headquartered global asset finance company DLL to provide financing for electric trucks. The financing partnership between Xos and DLL will further enable the transition from traditional diesel trucks to electric.Dakota Semler, CEO and cofounder of Xos Trucks, says:With increased attention on climate change and the West Coast coming off its worst year of wildfires in history, transitioning to zero-emission electric vehicles is more important now than ever.We understand making this investment is challenging, so we want to help fleets make this transition as easy as possible.Xos Financing will offer full-service operating leases of the company’s electric vehicles and charging equipment to fleets, helping them to reduce energy, field, and maintenance costs.

2020/12/21,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Vermont’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has lowered net metering rates by 3 cents. Net metered solar operators are currently paid between 13.4 cents to 17.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The rate would be reduced by 2 cents per kilowatt on Feb. 1, 2021, and by an additional 1 cent on September 1, 2021. As VTDigger explains:Solar industry officials say the rate change and the end of federal solar tax credits next year will hurt expansion of solar in Vermont and will likely lead to the loss of jobs in the sector. Because of incentives offered by the state and federal governments over the past decade, solar development has mushroomed quickly and now generates about 7% of Vermont’s electricity needs. That’s enough to power 58,000 homes. Much of that electricity comes from the state’s net-metering program, which allows public utilities to pay individuals and companies for solar electricity.Why the cut? The PUC and Vermont utilities argue that net-metering is driving up retail electricity prices for those without solar, as houses with solar generate their own power. Further, Vermont’s grid is outdated and needs to be upgraded.Dan Clapp of New England solar company ReVision Energy told VTDigger:Our legislators need to work to improve on policies… not work to tear them down.James Moore, one of the cofounders of SunCommon, the largest solar company in Vermont, said:We are addressing a climate crisis, and here in Vermont we’ve had this increasingly go-slow approach.It’s time to put the pedal to the metal and get policies in place to accelerate this clean energy transition.Electrek’s Take: What strikes us is that Vermont is Senator Bernie Sanders’ state, and he pushes hard for green policy. Indeed, he’s called for a transition to 100% green energy. In 2016, Sanders met with solar workers in Reno, Nevada, and said Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission’s then decision to roll back net metering rates was “exactly the wrong decision.” So we wonder whether he’s going to have anything to say about the rollback of solar incentives in his own state?Hydro-Québec, Canada’s largest electricity producer that uses mainly hydro, is a public utility that manages the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Québec, as well as the export of power to parts of the Northeast US.  Hydro-Québec has launched EVLO Energy Storage Inc. (EVLO), a subsidiary that designs, sells, and operates green energy storage systems.The storage systems are intended mainly for power producers, transmission providers, and distributors, as well as the commercial and industrial markets for medium- and large-scale storage. Their modular design means that they can be scaled to meet a wide variety of needs. EVLO systems also include power control and energy management software.EVLO uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which can be recycled using a process that allows 99% of the active materials to be recovered and reused.EVLO’s first global project is in France — an installation of a 9-megawatt-hour storage system in the transmission system operated by France’s national transmission provider, RTE.Hydro-Québec President and CEO Sophie Brochu said:Energy storage will play a crucial role in the energy transition.We firmly believe that the know-how Québec has acquired with regard to batteries will help develop solar and wind power. Our products will also have useful applications in existing power grids, such as in managing consumption peaks.Windy weather in the UK on Friday resulted in the country breaking records for green energy, which made up more than 40% of its electricity that day.Wind turbines generated 17.3GW on Friday afternoon, beating the previous record set in early January.The Guardian reports:Wind power generation reached a record share of almost 60% of electricity use in August as demand for power fell by more than a fifth compared with the year before.The abundance of clean electricity caused the carbon intensity of the electricity grid in March fell to an all-time monthly low of 143g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour, and annual figures are expected to confirm that 2020 was the greenest year.",solar
2020/12/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Update 12/18: The Navajo Generating Station smokestacks were demolished this morning. Here’s a video that captures the moment they fell:December 16: The 2,400-MW Navajo Generating Station (NGS) in northeastern Arizona — the largest coal plant west of the Mississippi River — shut down over a year ago, in November 2019, as Electrek reported.And this Friday, December 18, the 775-foot-tall smokestacks at the NGS will be demolished with explosives as part of the decommissioning process at around 8:30 a.m.The smokestack demolition is a symbol of how dramatically the energy landscape has shifted in a few short years. Several months prior to announcing in February 2017 that they would close NGS by the end of 2019, its utility owners were in federal court arguing for the right to run the plant into the 2040s. In just three years, Arizona’s two biggest utilities — Arizona Public Service (APS) and Tucson Electric Power — have committed to abandoning all of their coal assets and working toward 100% carbon-free electricity. On top of that, the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates the utilities, has also pledged to reach net zero by 2050.However, much still remains to be done to ensure a just and equitable transition for the Navajo and Hopi. While APS proposed $144 million in November to support affected tribes and surrounding communities in the transition from coal and toward green energy, other utilities have not yet stepped up to offer help in the form of funding. Navajo and Hopi community leaders recently issued a report card that evaluated the state of the transition:  You can access details of the report card here.A group of 21 major global and US-based companies, including Amazon, AT&T, Best Buy, DHL, IKEA, Siemens, National Grid, and Uber, have banded together and called themselves the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance (CEVA). The group is led by the sustainability nonprofit Ceres. CEVA was formed in January 2020 to accelerate the business transition to EVs in all vehicle segments, from light-duty passenger cars to heavy-duty trucks.CEVA yesterday released its first set of cross-sectoral fleet electrification principles that provide guidance on what auto and truck manufacturers, regulators, policymakers, and utilities must do to advance the commercial EV market.This timing of this action to decarbonize the US transport sector is no coincidence, with the election win and upcoming inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has pledged support for electric vehicles and vowed to rejoin the Paris Agreement on the first day of his presidency (cc Pete Buttigieg, who Biden has chosen for transport secretary).Here are the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance’s principles, and full details on each principle can be found here:Badar Khan, the president of National Grid, US, said:To fight climate change, we must address the transportation sector. That starts with companies like us electrifying our own fleets, thereby reducing GHG emissions in our everyday business, and helping our customers do the same.We will convert to a 100% electric fleet by 2030 for our light-duty vehicles while also pursuing the replacement of our medium- and heavy-duty vehicles with zero carbon alternatives.Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic via azcentral.com",solar

That’s 95 wind turbines for each phase.As Electrek previously reported, A and B was the largest single order ever for offshore wind turbines, according to Dogger Bank Wind Farm. Turbine installation is expected to commence in 2023 at Dogger Bank A.And GE Renewable Energy today announced it has been confirmed as the preferred turbine supplier for Dogger Bank C as well, but they’re going to go even bigger. GE will provide an upgraded 14MW version of its Haliade-X turbine for phase C, which will become the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines. A turbine supply agreement and accompanying service and warranty agreements between GE and Dogger Bank C is expected to finalize in the first quarter of 2021.Installation of the Dogger Bank C turbines is set to begin in 2025 ahead of completion of the whole project in 2026.Each 1.2 GW phase — 3.6 GW in total — is expected to generate around 6 TWh of electricity annually, and the entire project will be capable of powering up to 6 UK million homes each year once it’s complete.Steve Wilson, Dogger Bank Wind Farm project director at SSE Renewables, said:[We are] delighted to be working with GE Renewable Energy on all three phases of our development, as the first wind farm in the world to install their innovative and record-breaking Haliade-X turbine technology.Together with GE we are continuing to lead the way on innovation in the offshore wind industry and we’re proud that Dogger Bank will now use a 14MW turbine at Dogger Bank C alongside the 13MW turbine already confirmed for phases A and B.",solar
2020/12/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), the main governing body of auto racing worldwide, has announced that Formula One will go carbon neutral by 2021 and net zero by 2030.In addition, Formula One (F1), the premier auto racing series, will use “sustainable biowaste fuel” starting next year in order to work toward reducing carbon emissions in racing. The FIA will also provide these sustainable fuels to other FIA-sanctioned racing series if they choose to use them.The FIA’s first commitments rely on measuring their total impact across freight, business travel, and other activities (approx. 18,500 tons in 2019) and purchasing carbon offsets to immediately reach carbon neutrality. FIA will follow up in subsequent years by reducing their emissions by 20% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, and will become net zero by investing in carbon removal technologies to remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as they produce by the time 2030 rolls around.F1 itself has moved gradually toward “greener” racing in recent years. In 2009, cars started using “KERS” (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) to recapture braking energy and use it for a corner exit boost from an electric motor. This essentially meant that cars using KERS were “hybrids.” In 2014, F1 moved from a naturally aspirated 2.4 liter V8 to a turbocharged 1.6 liter V6 with integrated kinetic and heat recovery systems, increasing energy efficiency by approximately 30%.There have even been rumblings about F1 going electric. In 2018, former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone urged the series to consider electric racing as early as 2021. This won’t be happening, but F1’s biggest star and current world champion Lewis Hamilton says he’s trading in his Maybach for an electric car and recently announced that he will field a team (as owner) in the new Extreme E all-electric off-road racing series.Click through to see a presentation on the FIA’s full 2020-2030 plan on their website. —By Jameson DowHyPoint, a Silicon Valley-based, VC-backed manufacturer of zero emissions, next-generation hydrogen fuel cell systems, was this week named one of three winners of the 2020 NASA iTech Initiative Cycle II, in which inventive technologies were ranked based on criteria that included technical viability, likely impact on future space exploration, benefits to humanity, and commercialization potential. NASA curates technologies through the iTech Initiative that could help it accomplish future exploration goals and seeks to connect innovators with technical experts and potential investors. This year’s cycle called for innovative technologies in power generation and energy, integrated photonics, advanced engineered materials, and miniaturized systems.

2020/12/16,"President-elect Joe Biden is expected to name Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan, as secretary of energy. She is a huge advocate for electric vehicles. Biden’s choice was confirmed by four people to the Associated Press.Granholm is currently an adjunct professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley. According to the Washington Post, she has “argued that the United States risks being left behind by other countries if it doesn’t develop alternate energy technologies.” Granholm, originally from Canada, moved to California as a young child, and has a background in promoting and developing alternate technologies.In November, she wrote an op-ed for the Detroit News calling for Michigan’s auto industry to invest in a low-carbon economy, stating that “the time for a low-carbon recovery is now.” The two-term governor, who was in power during the auto industry bailout during the recession, wrote:A low-carbon recovery plan could create 1.7 million new jobs in the US. State automakers like Ford and General Motors are producing a greater number of EVs, but policy incentives are needed to ensure that the cost-saving and environmental benefits are available to everyone.The Department of Energy’s mandate has historically been focused on nuclear, as the nuclear program consumes around 75% of the department’s budget, or $27 billion. But the DoE is likely to step up research under Biden. Granholm does not have a nuclear background, so will have to rely on deputies for expertise in that sector.Granholm sits on the board of heavy-duty electric bus company Proterra.Michigan Environmental Council president/CEO Conan Smith said of Granholm’s nomination in an email to Electrek:During Jennifer Granholm’s years as Michigan’s governor, our state experienced a transformation in its energy sector.

Last year it installed 13.3 GW of capacity,” Reuters reports.The rebound is a result of utilities looking to adopt more solar in order to reduce emissions and the rapidly declining cost of solar technology.New US utility projects announced during the third quarter resulted in the SEIA revising its installation forecast for 2021 to 2025 upward by 10 GW to 107 GW. Residential installations are expected to be up 7% this year. Just 3% of US electricity is now generated by solar. SEIA hopes that will rise to 20% over the next 10 years.After pressure from investors to act in order to fight climate change, ExxonMobil agreed to cut emissions for every barrel of oil it produces by 15-20% per barrel by 2025, compared with 2016 levels.The Financial Times points out:Unlike many European producers, Exxon’s new targets apply purely to its scope 1 and 2 emissions — those produced by its own operations and its power providers. They do not apply to its scope 3 emissions — those produced by burning its oil.However, Exxon did say it would start to publish scope 3 emissions figures annually.The company also vowed a 40-50% cut to the intensity of its methane emissions, a steep drop in the practice of flaring natural gas by 2025, and an end to “routine flaring” by 2030.Andrew Logan, an oil expert with the sustainable investment advocacy group Ceres, told Axios:There are some things to like in here, particularly around the flaring and methane commitments, but overall this is underwhelming and fails to address ExxonMobil’s main source of risk — its product emissions.This set of commitments would have been leading edge five years ago, but at a time when even US peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net zero ambitions for their operational emissions (and are also committing to address scope 3) this feels grossly inadequate.Unlike a number of its European counterparts, Exxon has not made a pledge to become net zero by 2050.Avangrid Renewables has filed a construction and operations plan to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for the first phase of its wholly-owned Kitty Hawk Offshore Wind project, which will be situated around 27 miles from the Outer Banks.Bill White, Avangrid Renewables’ head of US offshore wind, said:We’re proud to be the first to submit a federal permit for a commercial scale offshore wind project in Virginia and the Carolinas.Dominion Energy completed construction of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project earlier this year. It precedes the proposed much larger 2.64 GW Dominion Energy Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind commercial project.The first phase of the total 200-square-mile project, which is expected to begin construction in 2024, will be able to generate approximately 800 megawatts of electricity. When complete by the expected date of 2030, Kitty Hawk Offshore Wind is expected to have a total generation capacity of up to 2.5 GW or enough to power 700,000 homes.Kitty Hawk is expected to create nearly 800 jobs in Virginia and North Carolina and drive $2 billion in economic activity.",solar
2020/12/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):China’s President Xi Jinping vowed at Saturday’s UN virtual Climate Ambition Summit to nearly triple the country’s wind and solar capacity during the next decade.The UN summit, hosted by the UK, included more than 70 heads of state. It marked the Paris Agreement’s fifth anniversary. The Paris Agreement commits countries to take action to limit temperature rises to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels and keep them to 1.5C.The Financial Times reports:President Xi’s appearance was the most anticipated, as he pledged China would cut its carbon intensity, which measures emissions relative to gross domestic product, by more than 65% by 2030. This was an increase from its previous goal of 60-65%.It would also increase wind and solar installed capacity to 1200GW by 2030, Mr Xi said, up from 415GW at the end of 2019.China is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2060, a target it announced in September, and Mr Xi’s comments on Saturday were the first indication of what paths the country will take to reach that goal.Environmental activists feel that China, the world’s largest CO2 emitter, could do more. Li Shuo, a climate adviser at Greenpeace, said:[China’s new target] demonstrates good will.However, Beijing has the potential to do more. Making its emissions peak earlier than 2025 is still something it should strive for.The US is the world’s second-largest CO2 emitter. It did not have a representative at the UN summit over the weekend. That’s because Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement. But President-elect Joe Biden released a video demonstrating that the US will rejoin the Paris Agreement immediately after Biden is inaugurated:Under a Biden-Harris Administration, we will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one and lead the world in the fight against climate change. pic.twitter.com/dHSsXRk35hBiden has committed to net zero by 2050 and chose John Kerry as the US’ “climate czar.” The US will hold a climate summit that will include the world’s major economies early next year, and Biden sent a written statement to the summit shortly before it began [via the Guardian]:I’ll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office … We’ll elevate the incredible work cities, states, and businesses have been doing to help reduce emissions and build a cleaner future. We’ll listen to and engage closely with the activists, including young people, who have continued to sound the alarm and demand change from those in power.We’ll do all of this knowing that we have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world.UN Secretary-General António Guterres said: It is a very important signal. We look forward to a very active US leadership in climate action from now on as US leadership is absolutely essential. The US is the largest economy in the world, it’s absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.Did the summit move the needle? Sort of; it really depends on what the US does next, and large economies like Russia, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil need to get their acts together. Nathaniel Keohane, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said:The [Climate Ambition] Summit captured and reflected the momentum of recent months, but didn’t push much beyond it. The world is waiting for Biden to bring the US back into the Paris agreement, and will be looking for how ambitious the US is willing to be in its [nationally determined contribution] NDC.NDCs are detailed national plans that set out emissions curbs.",solar
2020/12/11,"One of Europe’s largest vertical farms is up and running in a warehouse near Copenhagen, and it’s powered by wind. That’s not surprising, since Denmark has the highest proportion of wind power in the world.Vertical farms, which can be found all over the world, use LED lights and carefully controlled indoor environments to grow produce with much less water, space, and fertilizer than traditional growing environments use.Danish vertical agriculture startup Nordic Harvest closed its first investment round of DKK 62 million ($10 million) in November in order to grow sustainable, local, high-quality produce.The 7,000-square-meter (75,347-square-feet) warehouse in the Taastrup area houses crops of salads and herbs grown on shelves that are 14 stories high. Robots on wheels deliver aluminum trays of seeds to growing shelves:This week, the first crops, which will be harvested 15 times a year, are ready to be delivered to Danish consumers.Around 200 tonnes of produce will be harvested in the first quarter of 2021. Nordic Harvest’s farm will be able to deliver 1,000 tonnes of salads and herbs by the end of 2021, grown in an area equivalent to a large football field. The total Danish consumption of this type of green is about 20,000 tonnes per year, and two-thirds are imported. So if there were 20 of these types of vertical farms in Denmark, it would cut down the transport carbon footprint, and they’d provide fresh, locally grown produce.The company uses more than 20,000 LED lights, and those lights are powered by wind. Anders Riemann, founder and chief executive of Nordic Harvest, explains what makes the farm sustainable [via Techxplore]:In our case, we use 100% energy from windmills which makes us CO2 neutral. The amount of electricity you consume in one year is equivalent to the electricity produced by numbered windmills offshore.A vertical farm is characterized by not harming the environment by recycling all the water and nutrition or fertilizer.The EU regulation dictates that the word organic is linked to the word ‘soil’ so if you take soil out of the equation you can’t name it organic anymore. We grow on the same terms as organic: we don’t use pesticides or insecticides.Further, this vertical farm in Denmark uses one liter of water per kilogram of produce. That’s 250 times less water used in fields.Unsurprisingly, traditional farmers aren’t huge fans of vertical farms — they kinda put them out of business. But what if those farmers were given incentives to farm vertically and then plant trees on their land? Then the farmers could grow year-round, and if the LEDs were powered by wind and produce was local, transport costs would come way down. However, such issues as pollination would, of course, need to be addressed, along with many other details. But it appears as though Nordic Harvest is going to be successful in its growth of greens and herbs.Vertical farming seems like a positive, sustainable approach to agriculture to us. What do you think? Let us know down in the comments below.Photos: Nordic Harvest",solar
2020/12/11,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Future Earth’s Global Carbon Project released this year’s Global Carbon Budget, which comes ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. The worldwide COVID-19 lockdowns caused global emissions to drop by around 2.4 billion tonnes in 2020, or 7% lower than in 2019, which is unprecedented.Transport emissions make up the largest share of the global decrease. Those from surface transport, such as cars, fell by around half during peak lockdown. By December 2020, emissions from road transport and aviation were still below their 2019 levels by approximately 10% and 40%, respectively, due to continuing restrictions. In a sampling of individual countries, emissions reduced as follows:Restrictions in China were put in place in early 2020 and were shorter, giving the economy more time to recover. Globally, the peak of the emissions decrease in 2020 occurred in the first half of April, when lockdown measures were at their maximum, particularly across Europe and the US. Researchers say it’s too early to say how much emissions will rebound during 2021 and in the future, as that will depend on actions to stimulate the global economy in response to the pandemic. Lead researcher Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, of the University of Exeter, said:Although global  emissions were not as high as last year, they still amounted to about 39 billion tonnes of CO2, and inevitably led to a further increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. The atmospheric CO2  level, and consequently, the world’s climate, will only stabilize when global CO2 emissions are  near zero.Josh Tewksbury, interim executive director at Future Earth, said:Given that we need to reduce global emissions by more than 7% year over year through 2030,  this analysis shows that social responses alone will not drive the sustained reductions needed to effectively combat climate change.Alongside energy transformations, smart policy in areas like emissions-free transportation and the future of work may help lock in these observed reductions.Amazon has announced that it has invested in an additional 3.4 GW of green energy, and declared that it’s now the largest corporate purchaser of renewables in the world.GreenTech Media notes, “Amazon’s renewable energy investments are a mixture of power-purchase agreements, new-build utility-scale projects, on-site installations, and participation in renewable certificate and guarantee programs.”Its total investment in green energy in 2020 is 35 projects and more than 4 GW of capacity — the largest corporate investment in green energy in a single year. The addition of 26 new utility-scale wind and solar projects in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the US bring Amazon’s total number of green energy projects to 127. Its energy investments to date will supply 6.5 GW of wind and solar capacity — enough to power 1.7 million US homes for one year.In the US, Amazon has now enabled wind and solar projects in California, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia. The projects will supply green energy for Amazon’s corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services data centers.Amazon has declared a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2040 and 100% green energy by 2030.Last year, Amazon and Global Optimism cofounded The Climate Pledge, a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. The pledge now has 31 signatories, including Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft, and Best Buy. ",solar
2020/12/10,"Michael Phillips, the CEO of Sense, a technology company that makes a home energy monitor (pictured above) to track efficiency, cost, and reliability, told us about his predictions for six 2021 home energy trends.Michael Phillips, CEO of Sense, explained his choices to Electrek:In 2021, home energy will be transformed by decisive action on climate change at the federal, state, and utility level, combined with significant breakthroughs in smart home technology. For example, global energy leaders like Schneider Electric and Landis+Gyr are building energy intelligence into homes and utility infrastructure. These trends will enable consumers to control energy use in their homes and help them adopt clean energy and reduce their carbon impact.Here are Phillips’ six predictions:Smart homes. 2021 will be the year smart homes have energy intelligence built into them that will be key in the fight against climate change. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Zigbee are collaborating on interoperability standards that connect smart devices. The next step is energy awareness. Homes will shift from point solutions like smart LED bulbs and smart thermostats to become smarter in ways that matter from an energy perspective. That means the ability to track how much electricity the entire home is using and give the homeowner feedback about how to reduce energy waste and live more responsibly.Solar adoption. With prices for solar dropping and solar mandates from states like California, there will be a strong incentive for homeowners to go solar. Over the next year or so, we expect to see homeowners embrace solar as part of a total solution for clean energy homes, encompassing battery storage, energy efficiency upgrades, and electric vehicles. Utilities will continue to roll out programs that support solar adoptions, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s July 2020 decision on net metering will keep those policies in place for consumers in solar-friendly states. Resilience and backup power. As we saw with the wildfires in California and rolling blackouts, as well as concerns from homeowners about power surges with more people working from home, there will be more pressure on utilities to make the grid more resilient. Consumers may add backup generators to ride out blackouts or battery backup for solar systems in order to supply electricity during peak demands. Utilities will be expected to do a better job anticipating peak demand and avoiding rolling blackouts. Carbon reduction. Many states and utilities have already stepped up with aggressive carbon reduction mandates tied to climate change goals, and this will continue in 2021, accelerated by leadership from the Biden administration. Utilities will have a really strong interest to reach their carbon reduction goals. There are even utility companies that tie compensation for executives to decarbonization. This commitment from utilities will translate to programs and rebates for consumers.Electrification. Rewiring America has taken a deep dive into how electrifying the country can create millions of good-paying jobs, save households thousands of dollars per year, and cut our energy use in half. The organization reports, “Nearly 40% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from what’s in our households and garages. If we electrify everything in our houses, we go a long way to confronting climate change.” This will be the year when people realize burning things in your house is an antiquated way to use energy. From a transition to heat pumps for heating and cooling to the adoption of EVs, going electric will gain serious traction this year.Carbon intensity. People will begin to think more carefully about the carbon intensity of their home energy use depending on the time of day. As more utilities transition to time of use (TOU) rates, consumers will look to smart home energy systems for insights that will guide them to shift the time of day when they run their dishwasher, do their laundry, or charge their EV because those changes will make a real difference to their utility bills. As this information is provided in real-time by dynamic energy monitoring systems, consumers can actively reduce the carbon footprints of their homes without compromising their comfort and take a bigger role in combating climate change.Photos: Sense",solar

2020/12/09,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Financial Times reports that Royal Dutch Shell executives are quitting due to frustration with the depth and speed of the oil giant’s push into green energy:Some executives have pushed for a more aggressive shift from oil but top management is more inclined to stick closer to the company’s current path, according to four people familiar with the matter.The head of solar, storage, and onshore wind businesses who worked in the distributed energy division and an energy transition strategy team leader have left the company recently. The vice-president for offshore wind is due to depart. Several other top green energy executives also plan to exit in the next few months.Not every move is known to be linked to frustration about the pace of change but people familiar with the internal debate said there were deep divisions over the timeframe for reducing the company’s dependence on oil and gas revenues, which had influenced at least some of the departing executives.‘People are really questioning if there will be any change at all,’ said one of the people familiar with the internal tensions. ‘Part of the frustration is that you see the potential, but the mindset isn’t there among senior leaders for anything radical.’Shell is due to detail how it will become a net zero company in February in its strategy update, so this internal conflict is going to complicate things. As the FT points out, it’s getting pressure from its investors to become net zero, and now it’s getting pressure from its own staff.In other Shell green energy news, Silicon Ranch, the company’s US solar platform, has begun construction on two solar projects in southern Georgia. The utility-scale solar facilities include the 107-megawatt Snipesville II in southeastern Georgia and the 80 megawatt Lancaster Solar in the southwestern area of the state.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/12/08,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):With the arrival of the mobile phone, phone boxes are now obsolete. So, what to do with all those boxes and their infrastructure? Ireland is applying adaptive reuse of the well-positioned phone booths by turning them into EV chargers.Irish telecoms company Eir and EV charging network EasyGo will replace 180 phone boxes with EV rapid charge points. EasyGo will use DC rapid chargers developed by Australia-based Tritium.Gerry Cash, director of EasyGo, explains the reason for the innovative collaboration:We’ve a culture of going into towns and places of convenience. Typically, the locations of the phone boxes are in those types of places. And that’s what we want to do — the make the experience of charging a car easy, comfortable, and safe for people.EasyGo currently has more than 1,200 charge points around Ireland, and locations of EV chargers to go live under this initiative will be announced after consultation with local authorities.The goal of the Irish Climate Action Plan 2030 is to have 936,000 electric vehicles on the road.Denmark and Norway are joining forces to build what will be the world’s largest and most powerful green hydrogen-fueled ferry by 2027. It will be capable of transporting 1,800 passengers between Copenhagen and Oslo. The two countries have applied for EU funding for the groundbreaking project. The fund targets “highly innovative technologies and big flagship projects.”The vessel, which will be named Europa Seaways and operated by DFDS, will also be able to carry vehicles, either 380 cars or 120 trucks, on the 48-hour-long round trip. It will be powered by a 23-megawatt fuel cell, which is larger than any other current propulsion system.Danish wind giant Ørsted will provide the green hydrogen using offshore wind power. According to Euractiv, “the ferry would avoid 64,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year, the same as taking more than 13,000 passenger cars off the road.”Torben Carlsen, CEO of DFDS, said:The largest fuel cell systems today produce only 1-5 MW, and the development of such large-scale fuel cell installations for an electric ferry is a monumental task.We can only succeed in partnerships with companies that together can muster some of the globe’s finest expertise in design, approval, building, financing, and operation of innovative vessels.According to data from Norway’s OFV (Information Council for Road Traffic), the plugin vehicle market share jumped from 60% in November 2019 to 80% in November 2020. Norway has the highest electric vehicle market penetration per capita in the world.Here’s how Norway’s November 2020 passenger auto registrations broke down:The fossil-fuel sales of a combined 10.5% was a new record low. In September 2019, fossil-fuel-run cars made up 27.1% of new-car sales.The most popular battery electric vehicles sold in Norway in November 2020 were the Volkswagen ID.3 (986), the MG ZS (644), and the Audi e-tron (569).Photo: Flickr",solar
2020/12/07,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Denmark’s parliament on Friday agreed to secure financing — $407.6 million — for at least 775,000 electric cars in Denmark by 2030 (that includes hybrids). The broader plan is to have up to 1 million electric and hybrid cars on the road in Denmark by the same year. That is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2 million tons.Denmark intends to achieve that electric car goal by increasing taxes and levies on fossil-fuel cars, depending on how much CO2 they emit. That will replace a mileage-based system.Tax Minister Morten Boedskov said [via Reuters]:The average electric car will be significantly cheaper in the coming years.The Scandinavian country currently has around 20,000 electric cars out of a total of around 2.5 million cars.The country is one of 11 EU countries that ultimately want to eliminate ICE cars by 2030 across the EU, and Denmark has an ambitious target to reduce emissions overall by 70% by 2030.Last week, Boise, Idaho’s City Council approved a new building code that will require every new single-family home or townhouse with garages to include a higher voltage circuit. That way, the homeowner will be able to easily install a home charging station for an electric vehicle.According to Boisedev.com:This is part of Boise’s goal to have all homes, businesses, and other buildings 100% powered by renewable energy by 2035 approved in 2019. The city also has a goal for all city buildings to be renewably powered by 2030. Earlier this year, Boise’s Public Works Department created a new division focused on addressing climate change.Two-fifths of Idaho’s population live in Boise. On a state level, according to the US Energy Information Administration, more than two-thirds of the energy Idaho consumes comes from out of state. Idaho typically generates more than three-fourths of its in-state electricity from renewable energy, primarily from hydroelectric sources, and wind potential is growing. Idaho has some of the best geothermal potential in the US due to hot springs and other geothermal sources.The Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus in December 2015. So on its fifth anniversary, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Coalition for Action is urging governments to step up their efforts toward a green recovery.

2020/12/04,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Ørsted is partnering with Maryland’s Maritime Institute of Technology and Graduate Studies (MITAGS) to provide a new virtual reality (VR) offshore wind energy training program starting next year. Ørsted is one of two developers working to bring a 120-megawatt wind farm online by 2023 off the Ocean City, Maryland, coastline. It will feature up to 12 wind turbines.Offshore wind students will navigate through a simulation of Ørsted’s Ocean Wind and Revolution Wind projects that are being built off the New Jersey and Rhode Island coasts using virtual reality.Ørsted and MITAGS are using VR because the US currently only has Block Island in Rhode Island online, so students would have to travel to Europe. Ørsted provided MITAGS with a grant and project specifications to develop the model used in the simulator, according to the Baltimore Business Journal. Anyone who works in either building or maintaining wind turbines will be required to complete the new course. The Atlantic Coast offshore wind project pipeline is expected to support up to 86,000 jobs, according to the US Department of Energy.The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) — yes, you read that right — is “a voluntary CEO-led initiative that aims to accelerate the industry response to climate change.” It represents around 30% of global oil and gas production, with 62 participating companies. The report claims to have driven change across four areas:Electrek’s Take: It’s really hard to not be cynical about this group. Just the name, “Oil and Gas Climate Initiative,” seems ridiculous. Exxon isn’t even trying, and the only true way to reduce emissions and address the climate crisis is to switch to green energy. Methane reduction is great, but those targets need to be stronger. Further, “exploring feasibility” in decarbonizing transport comes across as completely inert. However, the UN Environment Program is a bit more optimistic. It feels that collaborative programs are positive, as the fossil fuel industry can be fragmented. It wants “everyone on board.” In other words, it’s easier to keep an eye on them if they’re together in a group. Fair enough. But this is only 30% of the oil and gas industry. The Environmental Defense Fund’s president, Fred Krupp, said of the initiative:Thanks to the 62 companies for committing to measure, report, and reduce pollution from their core operations and joint ventures. This will be the basis for robust standards in Europe, and beyond, that ensure the oil industry takes the practical actions urgently needed for our climate.So it’s better than nothing.

2020/12/04,"Researchers at the UK’s Lancaster University studied a crystalline material — a solid material with parts such as atoms, molecules, or ions that are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure — and discovered it has properties that allow it to capture solar energy. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.With further development, these materials could offer the potential to capture solar energy during the summer months and store it for use in winter when less solar energy is available.This would prove invaluable for such things as heating systems in off-grid systems or remote locations or as an environmentally-friendly supplement to conventional heating in houses and offices. It could potentially also be produced as a thin coating and applied to the surface of buildings.The study, titled “Long-Term Solar Energy Storage under Ambient Conditions in a MOF-Based Solid–Solid Phase-Change Material,” was published by the journal Chemistry of Materials.The crystalline material is based on a type of “metal-organic framework” (MOF), which consists of a network of metal ions — atoms or molecules with a net electric charge — linked by carbon-based molecules to form 3-D structures. MOFs are porous, so they can form composite materials by hosting other small molecules within their structures. The MOF composite is a solid, so it is chemically stable and easily contained.The Lancaster research team wanted to find out if a MOF composite known as DMOF1, previously prepared by a research team at Japan’s Kyoto University, could be used to store energy. That had never been researched before.The MOF pores were loaded with molecules of azobenzene, a compound that strongly absorbs light. These molecules act as photoswitches that can change shape when an external stimulus, such as light or heat, is applied. The researchers exposed the material to UV light, which caused the azobenzene molecules to change shape to a strained configuration inside the MOF pores, like a bent spring. The narrow MOF pores trap the azobenzene molecules in their strained shape, so the potential energy can be stored for long periods of time at room temperature.When external heat is applied as a trigger to “switch” its state, the energy is released again, like a spring snapping straight. This provides heat that can be used to warm other materials.The exciting part is that further tests showed the material was able to store the energy for at least four months.Dr. John Griffin, joint principal investigator of the study, said:The material functions a bit like phase change materials, which are used to supply heat in hand warmers. However, while hand warmers need to be heated in order to recharge them, the nice thing about this material is that it captures ‘free’ energy directly from the sun. It also has no moving or electronic parts and so there are no losses involved in the storage and release of the solar energy. We hope that with further development we will be able to make other materials which store even more energy.The next step is to research other MOF structures as well as alternative types of crystalline materials with greater energy storage potential.Innovations like these are urgently important as we rapidly shift to green energy and away from fossil fuels. Imagine having PV panels and the ability to store the solar power that came from those panels for months. What a game-changer that would be in the energy world, and particularly for people who live in seasonal climates, like in Northern Europe, where it tends to be sunny in the summer and gray in the winter. This is a very exciting development, and definitely one to watch to see what the next step forward is.Photo: Pixabay/Pexels.com",solar

The letter was organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions as part of its Climate Innovation 2050 initiative.The companies include big hitters in the power, automotive, tech, finance, manufacturing, chemicals, oil and gas, cement, mining, food, and retail sectors, to include Ford, Walmart, Bank of America, Danone North America, National Grid, Morgan Stanley, Shell, and Unilever United States.The letter can be read in full here, but here’s an excerpt:Recognizing these risks and opportunities, seeing the broad public support for clean energy andclimate protection, and hearing the concerns of our investors, customers, communities, andemployees, our companies view climate action as a business imperative. We are each taking majorsteps to reduce our climate impact. We have publicly declared ambitious goals and are investing inclean technologies and other climate solutions.With the election of a new president and Congress, we now have a critical opportunity to significantlystrengthen these efforts. We stand ready to work with stakeholders on all sides and with our electedleaders to seize this moment and achieve ambitious, durable climate solutions.This is a timely plea, seeing how a study published yesterday in the Lancet called on lawmakers to slow the rise of emissions in the next five years, as it asserts that rising temperatures and pollution is already endangering the health and well-being of Americans.Vote Solar, the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and solar provider Sunrun (Nasdaq: RUN) conducted a study that found that if just a quarter of US households were powered by local rooftop and community solar and storage, Americans would benefit financially and environmentally overall in a very big way.The study was conducted by using an advanced grid planning tool called WIS:dom®-P that laid out a roadmap to cost effectively transition to a clean grid by 2050. Energy grid modeling firm Vibrant Clean Energy developed the tool.Here are some of the main findings of the report, called, “Why Local Solar for All Costs Less: A New Roadmap for the Lowest Cost Grid”:Japan may ban sales of new ICE cars by the mid-2030s in favor of hybrid or electric vehicles, public broadcaster NHK reported today.Japan’s industry ministry will finalize a formal target following expert-panel debates as early as the end of 2020.Reuters reports:The likelihood of state interventions to lower carbon emissions is fuelling a technological race among carmakers to build electric cars and hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles that will lure drivers as they switch from gasoline models, particularly in the world’s two biggest auto markets, China and the U.S.Measures already in place in Japan mean Japanese automakers, particularly big ones such as Toyota Motor Corp with greater research and development resources, could use electric vehicle technology they have already developed at home.",solar
2020/12/02,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern declared a climate emergency in the country yesterday. As part of New Zealand’s government goal to make the entire public sector carbon neutral by 2025, it will require all its agencies and ministries to exclusively buy electric vehicles. It will also mandate all public sector buildings to be up to a “green standard.”Ardern has also suspended all new offshore oil and gas exploration in New Zealand waters, but has been criticized by groups like Greenpeace for not addressing methane in the agricultural sector.In 2019, New Zealand committed to become net zero by 2050 and switch to green energy by 2035. Ardern, who said the climate emergency declaration was based on science, said in Parliament:In those cases where we do issue declarations, it is often where there is a threat to life, a threat to property, and civil defence emergencies.If we do not respond to climate change, we will continue to have these emergencies on our shores.Ardern doesn’t just talk the talk, but also walks the walk – she’s been driving a Hyundai Ioniq Electric for some time now, though recent reports indicate she’ll be trading it in for an Audi e-tron in the near future.Around 300 homes in Fife, Scotland, are going to be fitted with free hydrogen boilers, heaters, and cooking appliances to be used for more than four years in the largest — and world’s first — test of whether green hydrogen could advance Britain’s net zero goals. The houses will be fitted out from the end of 2022.The Guardian writes:Green hydrogen is a central part of the government’s plan to wean Britain off fossil fuels because it can be used in the same ways as fossil fuel gas but produces no carbon emissions. This is particularly important for central heating, which makes up almost a third of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions because 85% of homes use a gas boiler.Energy regulator Ofgem has awarded £18 million ($24 million) to British gas distribution company SGN to develop the green hydrogen project. The Scottish government is contributing £6.9 million ($9.2 million).Ford is bringing a major regeneration project to Detroit with its new mobility innovation center, Michigan Central.

2020/11/24,"Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money, cofounder of the Street, and former stockbroker and hedge fund manager, spoke with Katherine Ross, correspondent at the Street, earlier today. Here’s what Cramer had to say to Ross about Joe Biden, Janet Yellen being chosen for secretary of the treasury, green energy, General Electric, and Big Oil.Jim Cramer talked about Yellen, which impacts energy — and frankly, everything on Wall Street: I’m very impressed that Janet Yellen may be treasury secretary. She is one of my absolute favorites. She’s brilliant, she’s reasonable, she knows what needs to be done, she’s got a heart…I think if Janet Yellen goes in, it’s one of the reasons why you see the market doing what it’s doing [the Dow Jones industrial average today topped the 30,000 mark for the first time]… Janet Yellen has long been considered a very strong, very smart advocate for the working person.Cramer called Biden the “savior of oil companies.” What did he mean by that, since he’s usually thumbs down on fossil fuels? He explained to Ross:I think that you can continue to buy Pioneer, Parsley, which is very well run and is a growth story… and you can buy Chevron because the dividend is good. The others, for the most part — maybe Conoco — are not that investable, I think, because, what happens is, they need oil substantially higher than it is. And they’re counting on more driving, on less oil. That may be why they’re going up. What’s going to happen… is that Biden is going to stop the process of massive drilling where there’s a lot of methane. And that means that you’re going to end up with the companies that have a lot of oil doing well, but not a lot of growth in the oil business. On green energy, and why Cramer considers General Electric (GE) a “Biden stock”:I’m glad you asked me that. What does Biden stand for? Clean energy. There’s an article today in the [New York] Times that you have to be focused on clean energy or he doesn’t really want to hire you. The best renewable play is GE. We want to get rid of coal plants, that’s GE’s [wind] turbines. We know that there’s going to be… I think… a very good rapprochement… not necessarily on the terms that the Chinese want, or on the terms that the United States want, but there’s going to be some better blood. The poke in the eye strategy wasn’t the way I wanted it with China.You can watch the entire segment here:Incredible how much changes not only in a year but even a day. Cramer has previously stated, as Electrek wrote in January, that fossil fuels are “done.” So it’s interesting, for example, that he’s changed his tune slightly on Chevron. He who dies with the most “toys” wins, is basically what Cramer is saying about Big Oil. He previously said:That’s why I said, Mike Wirth [chairman and CEO of Chevron] is trying everything he can, but in the end, they make fossil fuels, and… we’re in the death knell phase.Chevron has a lot of catching up to do with the European fossil-fuel giants, but at least it’s started to increase renewable activity. If it wants to survive, it’ll need to transform itself faster and more radically.In the meantime: Welcome to the new dawn of green energy in the US. That’s why Electrek endorsed Joe Biden, and clearly, Wall Street currently doesn’t have a problem with the future under the Biden administration, either. Wall Street looks forward, not backward.And Jim Cramer: We at Electrek would be happy to send you cans of cranberry sauce and some green beans (see the last five minutes of the clip). Happy Thanksgiving. ",solar
2020/11/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Arizona utility regulators have approved new rules that will require electric companies to provide 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. It will become the seventh state to pass measures that lead to 100% renewable or carbon-free electricity.The bipartisan Arizona Corporation Commission approved a plan with a 4-1 vote last week. Arizona’s elected commission has broad powers over utility rates, unlike in other states. It will go through a public comment period in January, followed by a final vote sometime next year by the newly elected commission.Due to some political horse trading to ensure the new commission passes it, the current commission did not require utilities to use a set amount of renewable energy.AZCentral explains how it will work:The new rules update the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff that an all-Republican commission passed in 2006 and requires utilities to get 15% of their power from renewables by 2025, as well as the 2010 energy-efficiency requirements for them to use efficiency measures to meet 22% of their energy demand by this year.Electric utilities now will have to phase out coal- and natural-gas-burning power plants, and they will need to start soon. The plan has interim requirements that utilities cut carbon emissions in half by 2032 and 75% by 2040.The carbon reductions are based on how much carbon a utility’s power plants emitted on average from 2016 to 2018.Under that new rule, utilities must implement enough energy-efficiency measures by 2030 to equal 35% of their 2020 peak demand. The new rule also includes interim requirements to ensure utilities are working toward that annually.John Kerry has been named special presidential envoy for climate change on the National Security Council — aka “climate czar” — by US president-elect Joe Biden. It’s a brand-new position. As secretary of state in the Obama administration, Kerry played a key role in negotiating the Paris Agreement and made climate change a core issue in the state department. He’s been involved in climate efforts for decades, including launching the bipartisan World War Zero coalition last year.Biden wrote in an email to supporters in which he announced Kerry’s appointment:This role is the first of its kind: the first cabinet-level climate position, and the first time climate change has had a seat at the table on the National Security Council. There could be no one better suited to meet this moment.Kerry said:America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat that it is.Greenpeace climate campaign director Janet Redman said:In addition to the Kerry appointment, Biden must empower a climate council to act on the substantive changes we need to survive. We deserve a world beyond fossil fuels — a world in which workers’ rights, community health, and our shared climate come before corporate profits. Right now, John Kerry has an unprecedented chance to lay the groundwork.St. Petersburg, Florida, launched AVA, a fare-free, electric autonomous vehicle yesterday.

We’re gonna put the miners back to work. We’re gonna get those mines open.So did he succeed? No. S&P Global reports:Despite a slight increase in coal production in the third quarter compared to the previous one, the period marked a new low in average coal mine employment with just 40,458 jobs, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis of available data. Average quarterly coal mining employment fell 23.6% from the first quarter of 2017, when Trump took office, to the most recent quarter. Coal production is down 31.5% in the third quarter compared to the first quarter of 2017.In October 2019, Murray Energy Holdings Co, the largest private coal company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy. May, Electrek reported that US coal-fired electricity power fell to a 42-year low. And in May, we reported that April 2020 was the first month in US history that renewables generated more electricity than coal on every day of the month.An American Electric Power Co. Inc. spokesperson said:Our customers, particularly larger commercial and industrial customers with sustainability goals, have made it clear that they want cleaner energy resources to power their businesses and lives.In July, Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) introduced a bill to support communities hurt by the loss of coal.The UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved a ban on Friday of ships’ use and carriage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) in Arctic waters after July 1, 2024. However, since it includes loopholes — exemptions and waivers — a complete HFO ban wouldn’t come into effect until mid-2029.The Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 21 nonprofits, called this outcome an utter disappointment. Dr. Sian Prior, lead adviser for the Clean Arctic Alliance, said:By taking the decision to storm ahead with the approval of this outrageous ban, the IMO and its member states must take collective responsibility for failing to put in place true protection of the Arctic, Indigenous communities, and wildlife from the threat of heavy fuel oil.In its current form, the ban will achieve only a minimal reduction in HFO use and carriage by ships in the Arctic in mid-2024, when it comes into effect. It is now crucial that Arctic coastal states do not resort to issuing waivers to their flagged vessels.The ban… will mean that a full three-quarters of the ships using HFO today will be eligible for an exemption.The Clean Arctic Alliance urges IMO Member States to seriously consider how the ban can be strengthened ahead of formal adoption next year, and for individual states to examine domestic options for providing the protection required for the Arctic from the risks of HFO use and carriage, such as Norway’s recent proposal to ban HFO from the waters around SvalbardAs Electrek reported on October 16, “90% of the world’s goods are moved by sea. Between 2% and 3% of emissions are generated by shipping. This is a bigger climate story than anything Australia, the UK, Germany, or Brazil individually does on climate.”There are currently around 10 million ironing carts in use in India, which use a total of about 50 million kg of charcoal daily. Vinisha Umashankar, 13, from Tiruvannamalai, in India’s southern Tamil Nadu state, created a solar-powered ironing cart in response to the problem. And as a result, she won this year’s Clean Air Category Children’s Climate Prize. The Swedish energy company-backed prize includes $11,600 to further develop the project.“When fully charged — which takes just under five hours in bright sunshine — each battery can power the iron for six hours, she said, providing power on cloudy days, though the cart can also run on grid electricity or a generator in a pinch,” reports Gulf News.Umashankar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation:I calculated the enormous quantity of charcoal being used, the pollution from it that worsens climate change, damages Mother Earth and human health. I wanted to create a renewable resource to replace charcoal.The Children’s Climate Prize jury said:With a smart design and a strong understanding of the problem of charcoal as an air pollutant, Vinisha has managed to combine science, innovation, and technology to design and create the solar powered ironing cart. If implemented on a large scale, this is an invention that can have a significant positive impact on India’s air quality and people’s health, while reducing unsustainable use of wood. The jury is impressed and sees a young scientist and entrepreneur with a strong passion for clean air that can bring multiple benefits to both society and the environment.",solar
2020/11/20,"Invenergy, a Chicago-based global developer and operator of green energy generation and storage, announced a 1,310-megawatt solar farm in northeastern Texas on Wednesday. It will be the largest in the US upon completion.The solar farm is currently under construction. The Samson Solar Energy Center, as it’s called, will support five major consumer brands and supply power to three Texas municipalities:Located in Lamar, Red River, and Franklin counties, Samson Solar is a $1.6 billion capital investment and will support up to 600 jobs over the course of the 36-month construction period. Additionally, the project will bring more than $250 million in landowner payments and support local communities through nearly $200 million in property tax payments over the life of the project.Samson Solar will be constructed in five phases over the next three years, with each phase commencing operation upon completion. The full project will be operational in 2023. When complete, it will produce enough energy to power nearly 300,000 American homes.Scott Mair, president of AT&T Technology & Operations, said:At AT&T, we believe renewable energy is good for the planet, for our business, and for the communities we serve.With more than 1.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, our portfolio delivers clean electricity to the grid, helps to create jobs and community benefits, and supports the transition to a low-carbon economy. We’re excited to participate in Invenergy’s Samson project through the largest corporate solar energy deal in the US.Solar is projected to be the fastest-growing contributor to Texas’ power grid in the next three years, as Electrek reported in February. Solar developers are expected to add 3.5 GW of capacity from new utility-scale solar projects this year and 5.5 GW in 2021.",solar
2020/11/20,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party introduced a bill yesterday to help the country reach net zero by 2050. The bill requires the Canadian government to create new targets, and a plan on how it will achieve those targets, every five years between 2030-2050. There are no penalties if it fails to miss targets. Canada is part of the Paris Agreement, which also requires countries to report on progress every five years.Environmental groups welcomed the announcement, but are skeptical about whether it will be effective. Canada, a big oil producer, has not met environmental targets for more than a decade. The bill does not contain targets or specific actions. Trudeau insists Canada will meet its 2030 goals, but there is no data to suggest it’s possible. The BBC explains the problem:The bill does not provide any kind of enforcement mechanism, or attach any additional spending to achieve its goals. The bill also does not detail how the country will meet its five-year targets, it simply says the government will be required to come up with a plan.In 2011, then-prime minister Stephen Harper pulled Canada out of the Kyoto Protocol. The country had fallen well behind its targets, and was facing billions in penalties if it remained.Mr Trudeau ‘s Liberal Party hold a minority in parliament, and the bill would need support from at least one other party in order to become law.The opposition Conservative Party fears that Trudeau plans to dramatically increase carbon taxes.Boston mayor Marty Walsh, who this week was appointed chair of the Climate Mayors, debuted the Massachusetts capital’s “Zero-Emission Vehicle Roadmap” this week. The city has a net zero by 2050 target, and the plan details how to support electrification across all travel modes, including EVs making up nearly 25% of every vehicle purchase by 2025 and the electrification of most of the municipal fleet over the next few decades.While prioritizing policies and programs that support public transit, active transportation, and shared trips, all residents who must drive personally owned vehicles will be encouraged to choose ZEVs [zero-emission vehicles] over internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.The plan calls for “charging stations in municipal lots in every Boston community by 2023 and an electric vehicle car share facility or charging station “within a 10-minute walk” of every household by 2040.”Transport causes almost one-third of Boston’s emissions. The city ranks 10th in electric vehicle sales among the US’ most populous metro areas and currently has more than 700 publicly accessible charging stations.Chris Osgood, the city’s chief of streets, said [via Masslive]:In addition to encouraging more people to walk, bike, or take transit, an essential path to reaching carbon neutrality is switching from gas-powered to electric vehicles.This Zero-Emission Vehicle Roadmap identifies concrete steps we must take to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.The independent, bipartisan nonprofit Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) released an issue brief titled, “How Coal Country Can Adapt to the Energy Transition.” Moving away from coal is the right thing to do for energy generation, health, and the planet as a whole, but there are still implications for whole communities who rely on fossil fuel for jobs and income.Under the section, “Opportunities for Transition,” the EESI spells out the following steps that can be taken to transition American fossil-fuel workers into cleaner jobs:The report concludes:It is important to provide support for the people and communities that will be dramatically affected by a transition to a clean energy economy.Dedicated efforts are necessary to support these communities as they move away from single-industry economies toward more diversified, sustainable economies.The federal government must recognize the very real and pressing needs of economically distressed communities bearing much of the burden of the energy transition, and take steps to support historically coal-dependent regions so that they will not be left behind.",solar
2020/11/19,"Sonnen has released sonnenCore, a cost-effective, all-in-one home battery solution. Germany-headquartered sonnen, a subsidiary of Shell, is a global market leader in smart residential energy storage and virtual power plants.sonnenCore provides customers with access to reliable emergency backup power, and it switches so fast that you or your appliances won’t even notice, at around 0.4 seconds. It features remote app control and round-the-clock access to stored solar with an easy-to-install, competitively priced system. It can also be used with the regular grid (although, of course, we at Electrek advocate for solar).The system is equipped with 4.8kW/10kWh of maximum usable capacity and pairs with new and existing photovoltaic systems. It uses long-lasting, cobalt-free, recyclable, safe lithium iron phosphate batteries and has a warranty of 10 years/10,000 charge cycles. sonnenCore costs $9,500, excluding installation, and is available now.The compact, all-in-one, modular configuration allows for simplified site design and installation, making it a cost-effective home battery option for residential projects, including solar retrofits.Adam Gentner, sonnen’s VP of premium products and projects, explained to Electrek what’s unique about this new home battery solution:With sonnen’s 10 years of experience in the residential energy storage space, we are confident that this technology is uniquely suited for use in the home over decades of use. On the platform of this battery chemistry, sonnen has completely designed our own module, BMS, inverter, and controller, making sonnenCore one of the first, if not the only, batteries on the market completely designed by one company so that all components work seamlessly together.  This allows us to exercise a greater control over every component in the system, to update any part of the battery to meet the future needs of our customers, and to truly maximize the value that our customers get out of this battery. As such, the sonnenCore is one of the most attractively priced batteries, and certainly the most attractively priced lithium iron phosphate battery, on the market.  Looks like sonnenCore is going to give Tesla Powerwall (it’s slightly smaller than the Powerwall, which holds 13.5kWh), LG Chem, and Enphase some competition. The Powerwall is cheaper than the sonnenCore at $7,000, but as Electrek‘s Fred Lambert pointed out in October, with the accompanying hardware and installation, the Powerwall’s price goes up. sonnenCore will also have installation costs.With natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes becoming more intense and challenging the power grid’s reliability, public demand for affordable home battery systems on solar is only going to grow. According to a study from residential solar and battery storage company Sunrun, 45% of American homeowners say backup power like a battery or generator would have made them feel more prepared. So sonnenCore should do well.Photos: sonnen",solar
2020/11/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Danish green energy group Ørsted (ORSTED.CO) and North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) yesterday announced a deal to train an offshore wind construction workforce to build Ørsted’s pipeline of US East Coast projects. The NABTU represents 3 million workers.Ørsted North America CEO David Hardy told Reuters:We are working to proactively develop a plan to transition organized labor into the offshore industry.We want to work with the NABTU to create a framework for an offshore wind construction workforce for all offshore wind farms we will operate.Ørsted and NABTU said they will together identify the necessary skills for the offshore workforce, and partner on training and certification. They have not yet disclosed how many jobs would be created.NABTU president Sean McGarvey said:This will show how as we move and transform our energy production in North America, it can be done at middle-class wages and good benefits packages. Anything else is not acceptable.Ørsted operates Block Island off Rhode Island (pictured), the US’ first and only utility-scale offshore wind farm. It was built with union labor.Reuters reports:The United States offshore wind industry holds 15 active commercial leases that, if built, could generate another 30GW of electricity, create 83,000 jobs and drive $25 billion in annual economic output in the next decade, according to the American Wind Energy Association.US president-elect Joe Biden has set a goal to achieve net zero in the electricity sector by 2035.The Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians will protect the Soboba Fire Department against grid outages caused by wildfires in Southern California with a microgrid project that consists of 50 kW of solar and a 0.5 MWh Vanadium Flow Battery, supplied by Invinity Energy Systems. The system will be able to provide a minimum of 10 hours of continuous backup power. The $1.7 million project developed by nonprofit solar installer GRID Alternatives will ensure uninterrupted power.During wildfires, the Soboba fire station serves as the incident command center and emergency shelter as well as the point of distribution for food, equipment, and supplies — making uninterrupted power vital for community resiliency.Tribal residents live in a district identified by the California Public Utilities Commission as a “Tier 3 – Extreme” threat area and have experienced multiple outages linked to wildfires over the last two years. The number of blackouts across California is expected to increase as preemptive Public Safety Power Shutoffs events become more common, so the Soboba Band is planning on expanding services at the fire station site by building a medical center and community building, along with additional battery backup and microgrid systems for those facilities. ",solar
2020/11/18,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has released his 10-point plan for a “green industrial revolution.” Yesterday, Electrek wrote about the government’s plan for the UK’s electric vehicle transition by 2030. Here are the green energy highlights.The plan will allow the UK to forge ahead with its net zero by 2050 plan in the run-up to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.It will mobilize £12 billion of government investment to create and support up to 250,000 highly skilled green jobs in the UK, and spur over three times as much private sector investment by 2030.The Northeast, Yorkshire and the Humber, West Midlands, Scotland and Wales will serve as centers for the green industrial revolution. Here are some green energy objectives of the plan:Offshore wind. Produce enough offshore wind to power every home, quadrupling how much the UK produces to 40GW by 2030, supporting up to 60,000 jobs. The UK aims to be a world leader in wind energy production.Hydrogen. Aim to generate 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for industry, transport, power and homes, and aim to develop the first town heated entirely by hydrogen by the end of the decade. Up to £500 million will be devoted to hydrogen innovation and development, including trialing homes using hydrogen for heating and cooking. This will start with a Hydrogen Neighborhood in 2023, move to a Hydrogen Village by 2025, with an aim for a Hydrogen Town – equivalent to tens of thousands of homes – before the end of the decade. Of this funding, £240 million will go into new hydrogen production facilities.Greener ships and planes. £20 million for a competition to develop clean maritime technology, such as feasibility studies on key sites, including Orkney and Teesside. Support difficult-to-decarbonize industries to become greener through research projects for zero-emission planes and ships.Homes and public buildings. £1 billion in 2021 into making new and existing homes and public buildings more efficient, extending the Green Homes Grant voucher scheme by a year and making public sector buildings greener and cutting bills for hospitals and schools, as part of the Public Sector Decarbonization Scheme.Johnson said:Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the Northeast, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands, and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future.Just as an observation, the plan doesn’t mention solar, but it’s the UK. You have to work with what you’ve got, and what they’ve got is wind. Nuclear also factors heavily, but we’ll deal with that in a separate post.It’s not a perfect plan, and we just stuck to a briefing of the green energy aspects here. But however imperfect it is, it’s a plan, and it’s progress. It’s a big improvement on what preceded it, which was not a lot. It’s a great example of the bigger-picture fact that governments and businesses are actively working on real climate action — and that it truly is the beginning of a green industrial revolution, not only for the UK, but for the world. With plans like this coming from the UK’s Conservative Party, and Biden’s impending presidency, we think things are going to start to change for the better. It’ll be messy, but it sure is exciting.",solar
2020/11/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Top US solar trade group the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) yesterday laid out its list of priorities for the incoming Biden administration. Its goal is to provide 20% of US electricity by 2030, up from just 3% currently.It’s an extremely comprehensive legislative and executive agenda for 2021 and beyond. It’s organized around three strategic principles:SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper said, via Reuters, that the solar industry wants the steep tariffs on imported solar panels, imposed in 2018 by Donald Trump, to be lifted with an executive order issued by Joe Biden. Imported panels dominate US supplies.The tariff at first increased the price of imported panels by 30% and have dropped by 5% every year. They are scheduled to fall to 18% next year before ending in 2022.The solar industry also wants Congress to extend solar tax credits by five years, rather than phase them out. It wants the credit to hold at the original 30% level for five years, SEIA said, and are want a similar credit for energy storage.Four other top priorities include pushing Biden to appoint a “climate czar” who would advance an environmental justice agenda, name Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners who support clean energy, incentivize development of renewable energy on federal lands, and develop policies that would invest in domestic manufacturing.On November 7, Ross Hopper said:I want to personally congratulate Joe Biden for his apparent victory in the 2020 presidential election. President-elect Biden’s plan to combat climate change enables our industry to create hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs across the country. We will seek progress with the new administration and all members of Congress on solar policies that achieve our environmental and economic objectives and that lift every community in ways that create a better future for all Americans.Virginia is ripe for widespread adoption of electric transportation, but low electric vehicle inventory and other barriers are preventing the state from doing so, according to a new report from green energy nonprofit Generation180. Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions in Virginia.Fifty-three percent of Virginians said they were likely or very likely to consider an EV for their next car. Virginia ranks 13th in the nation for EV sales, despite the fact that Virginia does not have pro-EV policies in place.Report authors also found availability of EVs at new-car automotive dealers was 44-54% lower in Virginia cities than in comparable cities in neighboring Maryland, which has more supportive EV policies.Stuart Gardner, Generation180’s Electrify Your Ride program director, told Electrek:Electric vehicles represent a great opportunity for Virginia. We need policies that will make these innovative products available to Virginians so we don’t get left behind on the benefits they provide for our climate, health, and economy as we transition to a clean energy future.Report authors recommend Virginia legislators enact three pro-EV policies: Generation180 is hosting online events today, which are free and open to the public, to discuss its report and the benefits, barriers, and policies needed to spur widespread EV adoption. These events — Why EVs Matter and Electrifying Virginia’s Transportation Policies — are free and open to the public.",solar

The Solar Cow installed in their school is a solar system that provides families in off-grid areas with power in return for school attendance. This has boosted attendance rates by an average of more than 8%, and increased new student registrations by about 10%.Many low-income families rely on kerosene lighting and relatively expensive charging stations to meet their energy needs.

But Donald Trump, unsurprisingly, is working to rush through a drilling-rights auction before Biden takes office.Trump’s administration announced yesterday that it would sell leases to oil companies, and the Federal Register today published a “call for nominations and comments” from the Bureau of Land Management for oil and gas leases in about 1.5 million acres along the Arctic Ocean coast. The American Petroleum Institute (which, incidentally, acknowledged Joe Biden’s win in a press release), said [via the New York Times] that the announcement was “long overdue and will create good-paying jobs and provide a new revenue stream for the state — which is why a majority of Alaskans support it.” But it might just be a waste of time. Bloomberg explains why:It’s unclear how many oil companies would have the appetite to mount costly operations in the remote Arctic wilderness amid low crude prices, steep public opposition, and regulatory uncertainty. Major US banks have sworn off financing Arctic drilling projects, and conservationists are also pressuring oil executives to rule out work in the region.Even if leases are sold and issued before January 20, companies will need permits governing air pollution, animal harm, water usage and rights of way that the new administration could stall or deny.A new poll conducted for environmental organization Pacific Environment by Yale University, George Mason University, and Climate Nexus finds that 74% of American voters would be more likely to shop at companies that use cleaner ways to ship their goods. The poll finds that 70% of American voters would continue to shop at these brands even if using clean ships raised the price of their goods. These findings also demonstrate a strong American preference to shop at companies taking action to address the outsized impacts from maritime shipping, which transports around 80% of all global freight by volume. About three-quarters of voters feel more favorably toward a company that imported their products using the cleanest fuel available (75%), was the first to ship their products on a zero-emissions ship (73%), or reduced shipping-related emissions by just a third (72%). More than 8 in 10 (84%) agree that the shipping industry should be doing more to reduce the impacts of shipping goods around the world.At almost 1 billion tonnes of climate emissions per year, the shipping industry emits roughly the same as all the coal plants in the US combined. The sector could account for 17 to 18% of all global emissions by 2050 if corrective policies are not put in place. The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency that regulates shipping, has set a goal of cutting shipping emissions at least 50% below 2008 levels by 2050, but recently bowed to industry pressure to weaken the rules governing pollution from the shipping industry. Photo: Yolk",solar

It has boosted power generation from nuclear, hydro, and solar facilities and is replacing coal-fired plants with combined-cycle natural gas generators. It’s planning on adding more solar and also uses wind.Miami-based solar developer Origis Energy will build a 705-acre solar farm in Obion County in northwestern Tennessee to supply Google in Tennessee and northwestern Alabama with energy from solar. Silicon Ranch Corp. is building another solar farm in Tullahoma to supply Vanderbilt.Johan Vanhee, Origis Energy chief commercial officer and chief procurement officer, said:This Tennessee solar milestone is another demonstration of the success of TVA’s Green Invest partnership.Such utility innovations are helping Google reach its aim to be the first major company to operate carbon free by 2030.But as the Chattanooga Free Times Press reports:Despite the recent solar additions in parts of the Valley, Chattanooga gets only about one-third as much electricity from solar power as the average of all utilities in the Southeast.Nonetheless, the long-range power plan adopted by the Tennessee Valley Authority last year envisions the federal utility and its customers adding as much as 14 gigawatts of additional solar generation by 2040, which would be more than 20 times the amount of solar generation now in the Valley.The TVA now gets more than 40% of its power from its seven operating nuclear reactors in Tennessee and Alabama, and about 10% of its power from its 29 power-producing dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries.The TVA, which serves 10 million customers in seven states, was created during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal in 1933 to bring power and economic development to one of the areas of the US hit hardest by the Great Depression.In 2019, the TVA cut the price it pays customers who generate solar power below the retail rate, and that was bad for Tennessee.

2020/11/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Prime Minister Boris Johnson is this week expected to announce that the sales of new ICE cars will be banned by 2030, moving the deadline forward from 2035, as Electrek reported in February. This is an attempt to jump-start the market for EVs in the UK and accelerate the momentum toward reaching the country’s Paris Agreement goal of net zero by 2050. This is needed, as the Guardian reports that “electric cars still only make up around 7% of new vehicles bought in the UK last month, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show.”However, 2035 is expected to be kept for an end to the sale of hybrid cars.Justin Rowlatt, BBC News’ chief environment correspondent, has a video report on the news: “Would UK be ready for a new petrol car ban in 2030?”As Electrek reported in December 2019, “Nearly half of US states impose fees on EV owners or will consider adding fees in 2020. The ill-conceived idea is to make up for gaps in roadway infrastructure investments usually derived from gasoline taxes.” Next up? Texas. Texan EV owners would be required to pay an extra registration fee of $200 and an additional renewal fee annually from September 1, if the Texas Legislature approves bill HB427 filed by State Representative Ken King (R) last week. Hybrids would pay an extra $100 for registration and renewal. Their argument is that the fees would provide funds for the state’s highway fund. It’s a response to falling gas tax revenues, as Electrek previously reported about Illinois in June 2019. The Texas Comptroller reports that the highway fund had $14.2 billion in 2019 and is projecting $14.6 billion in 2020.Electrek’s Take: As of December 2018, there were 22,600 registered EVs in Texas. There are 22 million registered vehicles in Texas. Talk about penny wise, pound foolish.

Wagner power plants in Curtis Bay in south Baltimore by the end of 2025, after pressure from the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. Talen Energy’s president Alex Hernandez said:Talen’s combination of renewables, zero-carbon nuclear, and battery storage assets will provide a clean, affordable, and reliable power solution to our customers.In 2019, Maryland generated 11% of its power from green energy. Its goal is to reach 50% by 2030.As the Baltimore Sun writes, “The Port of Baltimore was the second-largest US exporter of coal in 2019, with one-fifth of the nation’s coal passing through the port.”Doug Meyers, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland scientist, said:There’s a definitive link between air pollution and water pollution. Ending coal burning at these power plants will prevent millions of pounds of nitrous oxide from entering the air and, as a result, reduce the nitrogen pollution that enters the Bay.Photo: WildEarth Guardians",solar
2020/11/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, who served as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, had an unsuccessful run in the Democratic primaries for the 2020 US presidential election. Bloomberg is also a well-known champion of action to combat climate change. He wrote an op-ed yesterday with the headline, “Biden’s Big Climate Opportunity,” and gives examples of ways that Biden can make a difference, even without Congress’ help. Here’s an excerpt:This time, it’s imperative that President-elect Biden take a whole-government approach to climate action right from the get-go. To his credit, his ambitious climate plan recognizes that there is much he can accomplish without Congress — and some of the most important steps he can take have nothing to do with the Environmental Protection Agency. The president-elect should expect each member of the cabinet to prioritize climate action and integrate it throughout the agency’s operations. For instance: … The Department of Housing and Urban Development can raise environmental requirements for construction projects it funds. And all agencies can integrate climate-change considerations into their procurement processes, lowering the carbon footprint and environmental impact of the goods and services that taxpayers buy through the federal government.Increased and uniform disclosure of climate risk is one of the most powerful tools we have in reducing emissions, because more transparency will create stronger incentives for companies to take action, by driving more private investment to those that do.There is also an enormous amount that the Biden administration can accomplish by empowering its strongest allies: U.S. cities, states and businesses, all of which have taken big strides to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and are eager to do more.The Federal Reserve’s “Financial Stability Report,” which usually examines how economic and market forces could impact banks, insurance companies, and other firms, has addressed the implications of climate change for financial stability for the first time. The US central banking system, known as The Fed, doesn’t yet get specific from a regulatory standpoint, but the fact that it’s acknowledging the real impact of climate change is significant. The two-page section in the report, which is included in the section “Near-Term Risks to the Financial System,” states:Climate change adds a layer of economic uncertainty and risk that we have only begun to incorporate into our analysis of financial stability.The Federal Reserve is evaluating and investing in ways to deepen its understanding of the full scopeof implications of climate change for markets, financial exposures, and interconnections between markets and financial institutions. It will monitor and assess the fi nancial system for vulnerabilities related to climate change through its financial stability framework. Moreover, Federal Reserve supervisors expect banks to have systems in place that appropriately identify, measure, control, and monitor all of their material risks, which for many banks are likely to extend to climate risks.According to CNBC, Fed governor Lael Brainard first brought up the need to address climate change a year ago:It is vitally important to move from the recognition that climate change poses significant financial stability risks to the stage where the quantitative implications of those risks are appropriately assessed and addressed.The government of the Philippines will no longer accept proposals to build new coal power plants — that is, coal plants that have yet to be approved.Energy secretary Alfonso G. Cusi said:As the Philippine Department of Energy re-evaluates the appropriateness of our current energy mix vis-a-vis our energy goals, I am optimistic that this would lead to more opportunities for renewable energy to figure prominently in our country’s energy future.We are also pushing for the transition from fossil fuel-based technology utilization to cleaner energy sources to ensure more sustainable growth for the country.Coal accounted for nearly half of electricity production in 2019 in the Philippines. It’s followed by natural gas and hydro. There is currently a pipeline of 12GW of new coal projects under various stages of construction. The moratorium is likely to put a stop to 8GW of pre-permit coal projects.Red Constantino, executive director of the Philippines-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, told Climate Home News:It’s not going to be enough but it’s a big step in the right direction.Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters",solar
2020/11/11,"The green energy industry is obviously delighted about Joe Biden’s US presidential win. Biden wants to rejoin the Paris Accord, rapidly accelerate green energy, and create millions of green energy jobs. Here’s what five CEOs had to say about the president-elect.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO, Solar Energies Industries Association: I want to personally congratulate Joe Biden for his apparent victory in the 2020 presidential election. President-elect Biden’s plan to combat climate change enables our industry to create hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs across the country. We look forward to working with his administration and Congress on policies that reduce carbon emissions including tax policies that pave the way for greater adoption of solar energy and energy storage.I also want to congratulate Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on the historic nature of her election and all who won election to Congress. Solar consistently has a 90% approval rating and the majority of Americans on a bipartisan basis support taking action on climate change. Solar power creates jobs in red districts and blue districts alike and improves the environment.In the coming weeks, we will outline our 100-day plan with the new administration and with members of Congress. The plan includes executive branch policies and legislative proposals to lay the foundation for a strong clean energy economy. The 100-day plan is organized around three strategic principles: clean energy and climate policy; infrastructure and workforce development; and ensuring markets are competitive and open to clean energy.Tom Kiernan, CEO, American Wind Energy Association: We look forward to collaborating with his administration and Congress as we work together to shape a cleaner and more prosperous energy future for America.The president-elect and his team have laid out an ambitious, comprehensive approach to energy policy that recognizes renewable energy’s ability to grow America’s economy and create a cleaner environment, while keeping electricity costs low and combating the threat of climate change.The US wind sector and its growing workforce of over 120,000 Americans stand ready to help put that plan into action and support the Biden administration in delivering on the immense promise of renewable energy to add well-paying jobs to the U.S. economy and reach the President-elect’s 100% target for a carbon-free America by the middle of this century.Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy:  The American Council on Renewable Energy congratulates President-elect Joe Biden for his victory in this historic election. The nation’s renewable energy sector looks forward to working with the new administration and Congress to realize the clean energy future that Americans want, and scientists say we need.We commend President-elect Biden for his pledge to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement immediately. The time has come for the US to move beyond climate denial and resume a global leadership role in the fight against climate change.An accelerated transition to renewable power provides both climate protection and economic prosperity. With more than $60 billion in annual investment, and two of the nation’s fastest-growing job categories — wind turbine technician and solar power installer — renewable energy can help power America’s economic recovery, as it did in 2009.Liz Burdock, CEO, Business Network for Offshore Wind: The American electorate voted for a future that focuses on climate change solutions, reengages on the international stage, and commits to addressing racial and social inequity across our nation.The election of President-elect Joe Biden puts the offshore wind energy industry on the precipice of substantial growth with the support of an Administration that promises to put significant focus back on renewable energy, offshore wind among the beneficiaries. Dr. Stephen A. Smith, executive director, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE): The people have spoken by casting more votes for Joe Biden than any other presidential campaign in history. The differences between the candidates in this year’s election could not have been more stark, and Biden’s election is a victory for climate as time is running out to address serious climate disruption. Clean energy and climate change became prominent issues with voters in this election, and President-Elect Biden has committed to invest in clean energy solutions to ensure our well-being for generations to come. SACE is hopeful that President-Elect Biden’s belief in science, acknowledgment of the government’s role in solving the climate crisis, and commitment to doing so in an equitable and fair way will play a pivotal role in moving us collectively to a safer, healthier, more vibrant future. We also hope President-Elect Biden will prioritize appointments to the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors so that the largest public power entity in the United States can be a living laboratory for clean energy innovation.It’s now time that we come together to ensure that the will of the people prevails, and to support the Biden-Harris Administration as they begin the important work of improving our economy and environment through clean energy solutions.None of these opinions from five green energy heads come as a surprise, but their official statements certainly need to be heard. They reinforce what Electrek has asserted all along: That Biden’s presidency, assuming he can reach across the aisle and get the Republican-majority Senate to cooperate, will benefit and promote the green energy industry in the form of funding, business, and jobs. And ultimately, it will be good for the climate and the planet.",solar

Production is expected to start in 2024.The project will produce green hydrogen at the Lingen refinery in northwest Germany by using North Sea wind power.BP and Orsted initially plan to build a 50 megawatt (MW) electrolyzer to replace 20% of natural gas-based hydrogen at the plant. The project could be expanded to up to 500 MW at a later stage to replace all of Lingen’s fossil fuel-based hydrogen, Louise Jacobson Plutt, BP’s senior vice president for hydrogen, told Reuters. BP aims to expand its hydrogen output to 10% of the market by 2030.Anders Nordstrom, Orsted vice president for hydrogen, said:We see a path to [price] parity with gray hydrogen [ie, hydrogen produced with natural gas] by the end of the decade.Connecticut has released its “Connecticut Clean Energy Industry Report.” The report found that more than 44,000 people, an increase of 9.1% from 2015, made up the green energy workforce in the state in 2019. In total, green energy jobs accounted for 2.6% of all jobs and a gross state product of $6.5 billion in 2019.Employment in this report is broken out into five categories: energy efficiency; clean energy generation; alternative transportation; clean grid and storage; and clean fuels. By clicking on the link above, you can see the report in full, but here are a few highlights:Connecticut’s Department of Labor has created the Connecticut Green Occupations website, which provides information about green energy jobs, pathways, education, salary range, health care, and retirement benefits. Rose M. Mutiso, the research director for the Energy for Growth Hub, lays out a compelling argument in this Ted Talk on why Africa’s energy — including even, temporarily, natural gas — needs to be allowed to grow while richer countries must curb their emissions. In other words, Africans need more resilient infrastructure and the ability to develop energy in order to fight climate change.Forty-eight African countries combined are responsible for less than 1% of accumulated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Mutiso was a senior fellow in the Office of International Climate and Clean Energy at the US Department of Energy (DOE), where she led DOE’s engagement on technology and policy dimensions of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar

It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/11/10,"Wind and solar capacity will double over the next five years globally and surge past both gas and coal, according to a new International Energy Agency (IEA) report published today, “Renewables 2020,” which is an analysis and forecast to 2025. Green energy used for generating electricity will grow by almost 7% in 2020 — its fastest growth in the last six years — despite the pandemic. In contrast, the pandemic has accelerated the closure of older fossil-fuel infrastructure.The Guardian reports:The IEA report published on Tuesday says almost 90% of new electricity generation in 2020 will be renewable, with just 10% powered by gas and coal. The trend puts green electricity on track to become the largest power source in 2025, displacing coal, which has dominated for the past 50 years.Driven by China and the US, new additions of renewable power capacity worldwide will increase to a record level of almost 200 gigawatts this year. India and the EU will be the driving forces behind a record expansion of global renewable capacity additions of nearly 10% next year – the fastest growth since 2015. The IEA recently described solar as being the cheapest source of power in history.Global energy demand is set to decline by 5% in 2020 due to COVID-19 and electricity demand by 2%. Dr Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, said:Renewable power is defying the difficulties caused by the pandemic, showing robust growth while other fuels struggle.The resilience and positive prospects of the sector are clearly reflected by continued strong appetite from investors — and the future looks even brighter with new capacity additions on course to set fresh records this year and next.Governments can tackle these issues to help bring about a sustainable recovery and accelerate clean energy transitions. In the United States, for instance, if the proposed clean electricity policies of the next US administration are implemented, they could lead to a much more rapid deployment of solar PV and wind, contributing to a faster decarbonization of the power sector.",solar

And in the auto industry, here’s the plan:Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry, domestic auto supply chains, and auto infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century; and invest in US auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union.Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, issued the following statement:Now it’s time to turn promises into progress, with policy solutions and sound investments that cut climate pollution, create millions of good-paying jobs, protect the health of our people, and advance justice and equity for us all. That’s how we will get the economy humming again and get our workers back on their feet. It’s how we will improve people’s health nationwide, which is more important than ever in the middle of a respiratory pandemic, especially for communities of color who are being hit the hardest. It’s how we get our arms around the climate crisis that’s upending more and more lives from the heartland to the sea. And it’s how we build a world we can be proud to pass on to our children and our grandchildren.This is not going to be easy, but there is great potential. There is a lot of focus in the mainstream media on impending bipartisan political wrangling in Washington, and, of course, that will have a direct impact on how much can be achieved to implement green energy and climate change policies. But climate change doesn’t recognize national borders — and there is great international support and encouragement for the US’ journey ahead.For example, in the UK, which will host COP26, the UN climate change summit, in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson weighed in, hoping to use the common cause of climate change to bring the two countries closer:The US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security.The US will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of the Biden presidency, which brings the US back into the global fold. It can also quickly reverse the Trump administration’s energy rollbacks, make climate change part of COVID relief, and revise fossil-fuel production rules. Further, according to the New York Times, “[Biden] has said on the first day of his administration he will sign an executive order to conserve 30% of United States land and waters by 2030.”",solar
2020/11/09,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In the next decade renewables are set to double and coal power to halve, but seven countries will cause the EU to miss its emissions targets.Analysis by UK-based independent climate think tank Ember reveals the seven countries that are blocking Europe’s electricity transition. Together they will be responsible for 80% of the EU’s power sector emissions by 2030 due to their reliance on coal and fossil gas and insufficient deployment of zero-carbon electricity. As a result, the EU is not on track to deliver the Commission’s recommended 55% reduction in total emissions by 2030, let alone the EU Parliament’s target of 60%.Ember reviewed every EU country’s National Energy and Climate Plan, which sets out how each country expects to generate its electricity by 2030 as the EU moves toward net zero emissions by 2050. The analysis reveals that green energy will double in the next decade to deliver 60% of EU electricity demand in 2030. Across the EU, 40% of electricity will be generated by wind and solar, with leading countries Denmark, the Netherlands, and Spain targeting more than 60%.Fossil fuels are still expected to generate 25% of EU electricity by 2030, and Europe is not on track for a Paris-aligned coal phase-out by 2030. Coal generation is expected to fall by just 53% by 2030 compared to 2018, with nearly all (~90%) of coal generation by 2030 occurring in Poland, Germany (pictured), and the Czech Republic. Natural gas generation sees even less progress, with little change in the next decade, as countries including Italy, Germany, and Belgium plan an increasing role for gas. Charles Moore, Ember’s European program lead, said:Although our analysis finds that many EU countries already have ambitious plans to decarbonize their electricity systems, we also identified seven key countries that are blocking overall progress in the EU. Unless they change course, reaching a 55% emissions reduction will be extremely challenging — let alone 60%.President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were declared the winners of the US election on Saturday, and their climate change overview has already been published on the Biden-Harris Transition website. We excerpt the key points here:[Biden] is working to launch a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future.It has exacerbated historic environmental injustices.

The trial will last approximately eight weeks.Keltbray is testing Green D+ Biofuel, which is a hydrogenated vegetable oil that can cut carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 90%. The trial consists of running two identical Caterpillar 25tonne machines, one on standard red EN590 diesel and one on Green D+ fuel.To further reduce the carbon emissions, the fuel will be stored on-site in bowsers with telematics that communicate with the supplier, Speedy, to indicate when the tanks need topping up. This in turn reduces the frequency of fuel deliveries to sites.",solar
2020/11/06,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) announced yesterday that it was closing its oil refinery in Convent, Louisiana. It’s the largest such facility in the US and the first on the US Gulf Coast to shut down since the pandemic struck.Shell will shut down the refinery, which is midway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, in November, as it failed to find a buyer. It opened in 1967 as a Texaco refinery. It says it will help its 700 workers and 400 contract workers find work at other Shell locations if possible.The oil giant released the statement:Shell has announced the shutdown of its Convent Refinery in Louisiana. The decision is part of the company’s global strategy to invest in a core set of uniquely integrated manufacturing sites that are also strategically positioned for the transition to a low-carbon future. That’s a slightly different message from “failed to find a buyer,” but we’ll take it.On September 30, Electrek reported that Royal Dutch Shell will cut up to 9,000 jobs by 2022 due to the pandemic and lack of oil demand.President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday, a Russian public holiday, that orders the Russian government to work to meet the Paris Agreement. However, he said that actions must coincide with ensuring strong economic development. (Hopefully, he’ll soon embrace the fact that green energy is actually very good business.)Putin’s decree “formally ordered the government to work toward a cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 70% against 1990 levels by 2030,” according to Reuters.Putin has to date accepted the Paris Agreement, but this is a commitment to targets. Russia is the world’s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, so this is significant.Russia’s economy is very invested in fossil fuels and mining. But ironically, as Reuters points out, “some of that infrastructure is built on permafrost, which is vulnerable to rising temperatures.”SearchScene launched in March 2020.

2020/11/05,"As Electrek reported, on November 4, the US formally left the Paris Agreement, the 2015 pact between 197 countries to stop global warming “well below” 2C, and work to hold it at 1.5C. The outcome of the US presidential balance is still unknown, and the race is very tight. If Donald Trump wins, the US would not rejoin the Paris Agreement.If Joe Biden wins, he previously stated that he would re-enter the Paris Agreement with an executive order on his first day in office. He reiterated yesterday on Twitter that the US would rejoin the Paris Agreement on inauguration day, Thursday, January 20:Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it. https://t.co/L8UJimS6v2Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess said today that a Joe Biden win in the US presidential election would boost the German automaker’s efforts to manufacture electric vehicles globally.Diess said on a Bloomberg webcast [via Reuters]:A Democratic program would be more aligned with our worldwide strategy to fight climate change to go electric.The United States, when it comes to market share, is the weakest region in the world.VW is globally rolling out electric vehicles in Europe, China, and the US. As Electrek has previously reported, Biden’s plan for electric cars includes significant investments in charging infrastructure and updating government vehicle fleets to electric vehicles in order to increase demand.In the US, VW is on track to start production of the ID.4 at the Chattanooga factory in early 2022.

Headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, Volkswagen Group of America employs around 8,000 people in the US, with its manufacturing center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Unbound Solar is a residential solar installation company in the Pacific Northwest that is 100% employee-owned. It conducted a survey of 1,000 homeowners who have either had solar installed in the last 10 years, or have begun to research the possibility of installing solar. In the resulting study, Unbound Solar found that 86.38% of people surveyed list cost as a reason for avoiding solar, and sticker shock could be causing that perception. (53% rated it as a high concern, and 33.38% has a moderate concern.) Further, 65.62% of people surveyed replied that “It will take too long to see ROI” as a hesitation/concern (31.87% rated it as a high concern, and 33.75% as a moderate concern). And 29.38% of people thought it would take six or more years to see ROI (20.75% thought it would take 6-10 years and 8.63% thought it would be 11+ years).So then Unbound Solar sent over their own data, which counters those beliefs:Electrek consistently and regularly reports on studies and installations that demonstrate how solar’s cost is dropping rapidly and will soon be the leading source of not just green energy, but energy. So why is there a perception problem among American homeowners of solar cost? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below, and here’s Unbound Solar’s “Solar Power 101″ guide if you want to learn more.",solar
2020/11/04,"Wind and solar costs declined by more than 10% in 2019, according to the 22nd edition of Capgemini’s latest World Energy Markets Observatory (WEMO) report. Renewables now account for more than half of the worldwide electricity generation investments. Meanwhile, Li-ion batteries used in stationary storage and electric vehicle markets dropped by 19%. There are 115 mega-factory battery projects, and 88 of those are in China. Japan, China, and South Korea are dominating the battery market.It also reports that generation from green energy and storage technologies are maturing quickly. However, grid stability has become an industry concern. Further, pressure on oil giants has forced them to diversify and commit to net zero by 2050.And finally, Europe is leading the charge on hydrogen development. In July 2020, the European Commission decided to invest between €180 and €470 billion by 2050 in order to reach a share of 12-14% in 2050 for green hydrogen in the European energy mix. Key Biscayne, an island-town in Miami-Dade County and one of Florida’s wealthiest towns, is also very vulnerable to rising seas. And last night, in the 2020 election, it soundly voted to approve a $100 million bond to protect itself from sea-level rise. Its decision driver? Staving off dropping property values.The “Village of Key Biscayne,” as it’s known, which is made up of around 7,100 households and expensive hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton, released a “Flood Vulnerability Assessment & Adaptation Report” in April 2017. Unsurprisingly, the low-lying town is in Evacuation Zone A, which means that homeowners pay very high insurance, and it’s one of the first areas to be evacuated in a serious storm. The report’s conclusion states:The regions vulnerable to tidal flooding will increase substantially over the next 30 years as sea levels continue to rise. By 2045, if no adaptation steps are taken, most roads within the Village will experience tidal flooding during king tides, as will many low-lying residential and commercial properties. Increasing sea levels will also increase the likelihood of rainfall-induced flooding as the water table rises, thereby reducing the water holding capacity of the ground.So what drives the residents of Key Biscayne to spend $100 million on their resiliency plan? Their property values. Shame green energy or climate change isn’t mentioned anywhere in the town’s report.In what was probably thought up by oil giant Shell’s marketing department/social media team, Shell decided to hold a “Great Energy Debate” on Twitter on Monday. It turns out they didn’t quite read the Twitter room carefully enough.Shell posted a green energy poll, in which a large majority of the nearly 200 people (and that’s not very many, seeing how there were 7.5K quote tweets) said they’d embrace renewable electricity. But Shell then tweeted that the “energy system requires everyone to play their part.” That’s the bit where it all went wrong.Changing the energy system requires everyone to play their part. That’s what today’s #EnergyDebate was about. As for our part, we said last week that Shell will reshape its portfolio of assets and products to meet the cleaner energy needs of its customers in the coming decades.Journalism initiative Covering Climate Now, which is made up of over 400 media outlets, tweeted in response:Here’s a textbook example of “greenwashing” + corporations making it seem like climate change is a symptom of everyday people's inaction. Journalists beware! https://t.co/soZtQK8QGQMore pointed responses to Shell included:Last time I checked I'm not planning numerous new fossil fuel projects, nor have I spent billions delaying and denying climate action. I reckon most of my part is to make you play your part.It requires energy producers to play their part, and everyone else to deal with it. No amount of buying an electric car will fix things if the power plant is still burning oil.And a special mention came from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY):I’m willing to hold you accountable for lying about climate change for 30 years when you secretly knew the entire time that fossil fuels emissions would destroy our planet 😇 https://t.co/ekj1Va1Cp0To see more reactions, search Shell’s own hashtag, #EnergyDebate.

And last night, in the 2020 election, it soundly voted to approve a $100 million bond to protect itself from sea-level rise. Its decision driver? Staving off dropping property values.The town also voted in three new council members, all of whom supported the bond, out of 10 candidates. Some residents feel there isn’t a clear-enough plan for the pot of money, while others argue that there needs to be a fund from which to draw. In other words, some feel the bond plan is too reactive.The “Village of Key Biscayne,” as it’s known, which is made up of around 7,100 households and expensive hotels such as The Ritz-Carlton, released a “Flood Vulnerability Assessment & Adaptation Report” in April 2017. Unsurprisingly, the low-lying town is in Evacuation Zone A, which means that homeowners pay very high insurance, and it’s one of the first areas to be evacuated in a serious storm.

Increasing sea levels will also increase the likelihood of rainfall-induced flooding as the water table rises, therebyreducing the water holding capacity of the ground.In other words, if there is no climate change or resiliency plan, then the whole place is going to become increasingly vulnerable to sea-level rise.The Miami Herald writes:The island community is particularly vulnerable to the two feet of sea level rise expected by 2060, as well as storm surge from hurricanes strengthened by climate change.So the report recommends drainage and seawall improvements, elevating roads and low-lying properties, and notes that the steps to become more resilient are costly.The interesting part is what the report doesn’t say: The words “climate change.” Any inkling of a mention of reducing carbon emissions, which is causing sea-level rise, by adapting to green energy such as solar, which, of course, is a clean energy source that suits Florida perfectly.So what drives the residents of Key Biscayne to spend $100 million on their resiliency plan? Their property values. The Miami Herald reports that they’ve dropped nearly 5% in three years, “and although no one has directly linked it to sea level rise, multiple studies indicate that climate change risk is affecting property values in Miami-Dade County.”Shame that the most vulnerable state in the US to sea rise voted for a presidential candidate last night that has no climate change, green energy, or resiliency plan.

The company says the goal will cover emissions from both energy production and final consumption. It plans to present an updated strategy in June 2021. Carbon capture technologies will play a key role in its new strategy.Yesterday’s announcement was timed to coincide with new CEO and president Anders Opedal’s first day. Opedal said [via Business Green]:Equinor is committed to being a leader in the energy transition. It is a sound business strategy to ensure long-term competitiveness during a period of profound changes in the energy systems as society moves toward net zero.In April, Equinor quit the oil lobbying group Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) due to its lack of climate-change policy. As Electrek has previously reported, Equinor officially recognizes that climate change is real, and publicly states that it intends to align with the Paris Agreement. But it still “expects to deliver an average annual oil and gas production growth of around 3% from 2019 to 2026,” says Business Green.As of midnight Eastern, the US leaves the Paris Agreement, the 2015 pact between 197 countries to stop global warming “well below” 2C, and work to hold it at 1.5C.

The timing in relation to the US election is coincidental, but the outcome of the election will impact what happens next.What happens next if Donald Trump wins: The US, the second-largest polluter in the world, stays out of the Paris Agreement, and thus out of climate geopolitics.

Exxon earlier this month reported that it was cutting 1,600 positions in Europe through the end of 2021. This is due to the pandemic, the lack of demand for oil, and the transition into green energy.CNBC reported:The company anticipates 14,000 contractors and employees to be affected by the already announced programs. As of the end of 2019, Exxon had a global workforce of 88,300, which included 13,300 contractors.Exxon has repeatedly said that its dividend remains a priority.This morning, Exxon (XOM) reported its third-quarter earnings. For the third straight quarter, it reported losses. This quarter it was a loss of $680 million.CNBC reports today:On an adjusted basis, Exxon lost 18 cents per share during the quarter while generating $46.2 billion in revenue. The Street was expecting a 25 cent loss per share and $46.01 billion in revenue, according to estimates from Refinitiv.A year earlier, the company earned 75 cents per share on $65.05 billion in revenue. During the second quarter of 2020, Exxon lost 70 cents per share on an adjusted basis, while revenue came in at $32.61 billion.Electrek reported in March about how Exxon’s refusal to evolve isn’t working financially. As we wrote then:If they stay on their current path of justification for refusing to emulate their European counterparts by investing in green energy and steering away from fossil fuels, it’s just financially not smart. Just ask Jim Cramer, who declared fossil fuels “done” on January 31.In August, Exxon was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and there has been no indication of change of direction, the way that BP has chosen to do. The penny hasn’t yet dropped at Exxon.Twenty-two leading experts from around the world held an urgent virtual workshop about the connection between the degradation of nature and increasing pandemic risks.The resulting report (which you can read here) states that future pandemics will do more damage than COVID-19 unless we reduce human activities that drive the loss of biodiversity by greater conservation of protected areas, according to a major new report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).The majority (70%) of emerging diseases are caused by microbes of animal origin. These microbes “spill over” due to contact among wildlife, livestock, and people.Dr. Peter Daszak, a zoologist, and president of EcoHealth Alliance and chair of the IPBES workshop, said:There is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic — or of any modern pandemic. The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment. Changes in the way we use land; the expansion and intensification of agriculture; and unsustainable trade, production, and consumption disrupt nature and increase contact between wildlife, livestock, pathogens, and people. This is the path to pandemics.In other words, we’ve got to stop doing things that result in biodiversity loss, such as deforestation and wildlife trade.A new report from global technology company Wärtsilä, “Aligning Stimulus with Energy Transformation,” has modeled scenarios where key G20 countries, including the US and the UK, focus their entire current stimulus packages for energy on cost-optimally increasing green energy, aligning economic recovery with decarbonization. For example, in the US, if all of the current stimulus money going to fossil fuels ($72 billion) was allocated to advance green energy, the country could achieve more than 100 GW of new capacity. This could result in over 500,000 new green energy jobs — 175% more new jobs than if the stimulus was focused on fossil fuels.Wärtsilä modeled a scenario for a net-zero electricity sector for the US by 2035. The model demonstrates that a cost-optimal, carbon-neutral power system could be achieved with 1,700 GW of new wind and solar, supported by battery energy storage and flexible gas-fired power capacity operating on renewable bio- or synthetic fuels. The system could create 8.7 million jobs in green energy alone and would cost around $1.7 trillion. In other words, it’s achievable. You can read the full report here.",solar
2020/10/29,"Donald Trump hates wind turbines, and he repeats this constantly. He regurgitated his false gripe about the green energy source killing birds yet again last week during the final presidential debate.So just how threatening are wind turbines to our feathered friends? There are much bigger threats to the global bird population than this green energy source.Update 10/29: Donald Trump still persists with the lie about birds and wind turbines, despite the world’s rapid adoption of wind power. During last week’s debate with Joe Biden, Trump said to Biden in a discussion about climate change:I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It’s very intermittent. Got a lot of problems.This is a repetition of what Trump told a group of students at the Turning Point USA student action summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, in December 2019:I never understood wind. I know windmills very much, I have studied it better than anybody. I know it is very expensive. They are made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none, but they are manufactured, tremendous — if you are into this — tremendous fumes and gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right?So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right spewing, whether it is China or Germany, is going into the air.They’re noisy, they kill the birds…A windmill will kill many bald eagles… After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off, that is true. By the way, they make you turn it off. And yet, if you killed one, they put you in jail. That is OK. But why is it OK for these windmills to destroy the bird population?How are you going to win Texas when you say, we’re going to get rid of all petroleum?And clearly Trump, who claims to know “windmills” — which are not the same thing as wind turbines — “better than anybody,” was ignorant (or just lied) about a number of important facts. (And I can’t even get into the ridiculous “expensive” assertion here, as that would be an essay unto itself — suffice to say, wind is cheaper than fossil fuels.)Texas leads the nation on generating wind power. They are No. 1. More than 25,000 people are employed in the wind industry in the Lone Star State. And guess what? They love it. Politics don’t come into play for Texan wind workers.Further, as far as China and Germany dominating the wind turbine manufacturing industry goes, here are the facts.Germany-headquartered Siemens comes in first, Danish Vestas comes in second, and American-parented GE Renewable Energy is third in the world for manufacturing the most wind turbines. Nordex at No. 5 and Suzlon at No. 8 also has manufacturing plants in the US. Only two Chinese companies made the top 10 list of wind turbine manufacturers.As for “fumes are spewing into the air” — If he means the manufacturing of wind turbines in that particular rambling — according to factcheck.org in March 2018:The ‘life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from solar, wind, and nuclear technologies are considerably lower and less variable than emissions from technologies powered by combustion-based natural gas and coal,’ says the NREL [National Renewable Energy Laboratory].Coal’s carbon footprint is almost 90 times larger than that of wind. The footprint of natural gas is more than 40 times larger.Besides, Trump doesn’t care about carbon emissions, anyway (or the climate crisis that the kids he’s talking to will face). He subsidizes fossil fuels and increases pollution from cars. So, on to the birds.Trump has brought up bald eagles as victims of wind turbines more than once, so let’s put this to rest.Of course we all want to protect bald eagles. But Trump’s claims are exaggerated.Here’s Politifact‘s assessment of Trump’s assertion about the birds of prey:Trump is correct that California wind farms are a threat to eagles but not on the magnitude he suggested. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.Further, for those of you who might be worried in general about the welfare of these majestic birds, the State of the Birds 2019 report explains that the population of bald eagles has made a successful comeback from, according to the US Fish & Wildlife Service, “habitat destruction and degradation, illegal shooting, and the contamination of its food source, due to use of the pesticide DDT”:In 1970, only a few hundred bald eagle pairs remained in the lower 48 states. Federal and state protections sparked a remarkable recovery. The bald eagle was delisted as an Endangered Species in 2007, and today 30,000+ eagle pairs live in the USA.Do birds get killed by wind turbines? Yes. We at Electrek wrote about this in August. Factcheck.org says 750,000 bird deaths from wind turbines could be currently possible. (Research shows wildly varying estimates of bird deaths, as of course it’s rather difficult to get an exact number, no matter what the cause of fatalities.)Is the wind energy industry working on ways to protect birds? Yes. The American Wind and Wildlife Institute was formed in 2008. Members include the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, and the Environmental Defense Fund, as well as GE and the Union of Concerned Scientists. And in August, we at Electrek wrote about a simple fix that makes wind turbines more bird-friendly.In general — not because of wind farms — the US and Canada have lost more than 1 in 4 birds since 1970, according to the Guardian. Here are three general categories that describe the causes of what kills a lot more birds:Agriculture, deforestation, and urbanization. Simply put, it’s habitat destruction. And let’s include pesticides here, under the category of agriculture. According to Sibley Guides, “Pesticides may kill 72 million birds per year or possibly many more. The sub lethal effects of pesticides may also make the birds more susceptible to predators or unable to reproduce, essentially killing them.”Fossil fuels and climate change. Oil fields could kill up to 1 million birds a year, according to the Bureau of Land Management via factcheck.org. Oh, and climate change, of course, which threatens 2 out of 3 bird species in the US. As the Guardian explains, “Climate change compounds those problems by altering bird habitats.”Sibley Guides estimates oil fatalities at an even higher rate. The bird reference guide says:Oil spills kill hundreds of thousands of birds a year or more. Some of this occurs in dramatic large spills, but most probably occurs in thousands of small incidental spills that are never reported or documented.Oil and wastewater pits may kill up to 2 million birds per year.The Audubon Society wrote about the threats wind turbines pose to birds, and suggests putting wind farms in locations where birds are less likely to fly. They also list ways wind-farm manufacturers try to scare birds away. They conclude the article by saying:In a warming world, where more and more birds are going to be threatened by climate change, a pragmatic approach to energy creation and safeguarding the planet’s birds might be the one we have to accept.And a Science Direct-published study published in January 2013 stated:Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20,000 birds in the United States in 2009 but nuclear plants killed about 330,000 and fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million. The paper concludes that further study is needed, but also that fossil fueled power stations appear to pose a much greater threat to birds and avian wildlife than wind farms and nuclear power plants.While part of the discrepancy is due to fossil fuels’ greater usage, the study also concluded that wind is responsible for 0.3-0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour, while fossil fuels are responsible for 5.2 per gigawatt-hour — about 15 times as much per unit energy. If we swapped fossil fuels for wind, we would save millions of birds. The phrase is “canary in a coal mine,” not “canary on a wind farm” — for a reason.Cats and windows. In 2014, Treehugger [via USA Today] listed the greatest threats to birds by fatality numbers. According to the 2014 State of the Birds Report (the most recent report with these statistics), wind turbines came in eighth. The top threat to birds is cats (2.4 billion), followed by windows (599 million), cars (200 million), power lines — collision (25 million), communication towers (6.6 million), power lines — electrocution (5.6 million), agricultural chemicals (US number unknown, Canada is 2.7 million), and wind turbines (234,000).So, even if the current number of bird deaths is the highest estimated number of 750,000, that’s still a lot lower than the next category up.We hope that the wind industry continues to make meaningful strides to protect birds. We are passionate about protecting the earth and all living things.I do wonder, though — if cats were threatening the fossil fuel industry, would we get rid of cats? How about windows?And does Trump have plans to become a vegetarian, if he’s worried about birds? Apparently he really likes KFC’s chicken.In November 2019, Trump lost a court battle with the Scottish government over a wind farm. He felt the wind farm near his golf course was unsightly. He had to pay £225,000 in court fees, and the wind farm stayed.At any rate, his many false statements about “windmills” are, frankly, for the birds.Photo: Nathan Lemon/Unsplash",solar
2020/10/29,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Trump administration has overturned protections for the Tongass forest in Alaska to allow road building and logging.The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule, which had 95% support in public comments, protects more than 58 million acres of roadless national forest lands across the US. The US Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday that it would exempt more than 9.3 million out of 17 million acres of Tongass from the 2001 rule. That’s 55% of the forest.The Tongass is one of the world’s largest intact temperate rainforests. This is yet another rollback by Trump — and there are many — as he sees environmental protections as obstacles to industrial growth. And this one is particularly ironic, seeing how Trump signed the One Trillion Trees Initiative executive order two weeks ago.Tongass’ trees, some of which are up to 1,000 years old, absorb at least 8% of carbon emissions from the mainland US.As Earthjustice explains:The Tongass, America’s largest and wildest national forest, draws outdoor adventurers, boaters, birders, hunters, and anglers. An intact Tongass supports a robust Southeast Alaskan economy through tourism, commercial, and sport fishing, and small businesses. Its old-growth trees provide irreplaceable wildlife habitat for myriad species including wild Pacific salmon, Alexander Archipelago wolves, and Sitka black-tailed deer.Niel Lawrence, Alaska director and senior attorney for the Nature program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:The Tongass is our largest expanse of undisturbed forest, rich with wildlife that is imperiled elsewhere in the country, and key to thriving runs of all five salmon species. We’ve fought for decades to protect the Tongass, and we’ll keep on suing if that’s what it takes to fend off this outrageous move.A hydrogen-powered terminal tractor is being tested in the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands following two years of development by Dutch specialized vehicle manufacturer Terberg.Terberg collaborated on the hydrogen tractor with zepp.solutions, a tech company that specializes in hydrogen fuel cell systems.The hydrogen tractor is pulling the same loads as the diesel terminal tractors and being remotely monitored in order to collect data.The hydrogen terminal tractor is based on Terberg’s recently introduced electric YT203-EV. It features four 150-liter hydrogen fuel tanks containing 14.4 kg hydrogen, which enables a full day of operation and allows for quick refueling. It performs just as well as the diesel models, but of course without emissions.After trials at a number of locations, Terberg will then finalize its design of the terminal tractor.The Environmental Protection Network (EPN) was launched in January 2017 by more than 500 former EPA officials to provide informed rebuttals against efforts to undermine the protection of public health and the environment under the current EPA, headed by former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler. Today, the EPN released an updated version of the “Trump Environmental Record,” a snapshot of the most significant decisions or proposals by the Trump EPA, and their expected negative effects on people’s health and environmental conditions. The EPN released the first version of this report in April of this year. The report, which you can read in full here, is divided by categories such as water quality, chemical hazards, and air quality & climate change. Significant rollbacks are dated and listed under each category, with an explanation of what occurred, and what the repercussions will be.For example:Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emissions Standards for New, Reconstructed and Modified SourcesReview (Methane Rule)In August 2020, the administration finalized the rollback of 2016 methane regulations, which rescindsemissions limits for methane during oil and gas production and processing, and removes methanetransmission and storage from regulation.Methane, a major component of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) that contributes to climate change. Approximately 1/3 of methane emissions from human activities come from oil production and the production, transmission and storage of natural gas. In addition, volatile organic compound emissions from oil and gas facilities can increase ground-level ozone levels and have a significant effect on people’s health, increasing the frequency and seriousness of asthma attacks,contributing to respiratory problems and heart disease, and even causing adverse symptoms in otherwise healthy people. The rule will increase GHG emissions equal to the carbon pollution from one million cars.The EPN stated in an email to Electrek:The rollbacks and efforts to weaken the rules have serious and measurable consequences, especially for already overburdened low-income communities and communities of color. Increased air pollution will lead to more respiratory illness and heart disease, and shorten people’s lives. Decreased water quality threatens our drinking water and the rivers, lakes, and streams that support fisheries and support outdoor recreation in every state. Reduced Superfund cleanups are leaving communities peering through fenced properties at acres of contaminated land. And climate change and its devastating consequences have been left largely unchecked. Photo: Alan Wu via flickr, (CC BY-SA 2.0)",solar
2020/10/28,"Independent think tank RethinkX, which “analyzes and forecasts the speed and scale of technology-driven disruption,” has released a report that says that most of the world is technologically capable of achieving 100% wind, solar, and storage electricity grids in 10 years.RethinkX is led by Stanford University futurist Tony Seba, who, for example, declared at the Swedbank Nordic Energy Summit in Oslo in 2016 that fossil fuels and nuclear would be obsolete by 2030, and that solar will dominate. Check that video out here:RethinkX’s newest Energy report declares in its executive summary:We are on the cusp of the fastest, deepest, most profound disruption of the energy sector in over a century. Like most disruptions, this one is being driven by the convergence of several key technologies whose costs and capabilities have been improving on consistent and predictable trajectories — namely, solar photovoltaic power, wind power, and lithium-ion battery energy storage. Our analysis shows that 100% clean electricity from the combination of solar, wind, and batteries (SWB) is both physically possible and economically affordable across the entire continental United States as well as the overwhelming majority of other populated regions of the world by 2030.Adoption of SWB is growing exponentially worldwide and disruption is now inevitable because by 2030 they will offer the cheapest electricity option for most regions. Coal, gas, and nuclear power assets will become stranded during the 2020s, and no new investment in these technologies is rational from this point forward.RethinkX also states that we need to make the right choices and that there must be policy support for technological innovation:We as individuals, communities, industries, regions, and entire nations need to make the right choices today. That process must begin with an understanding of what is possible.Further, the report says that green energy will produce a larger amount of energy overall, which will in turn lower cost and create opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship. It compares the green energy revolution to the rise of the internet: “What happened in the world of bits is now poised to happen in the world of electrons.”Australia’s Renew Economy points out that Seba was “one of the few analysts to correctly forecast the plunging cost of solar over the last decade.” Dr. Adam Dorr, a report co-author, says [via Renew Economy]:There is a misconception that too much solar and wind energy is a problem.That is looking at the equation through the old fossil fuel system lens, and doesn’t recognize the fundamentals of disruption. Sunlight and wind are free, and it is irrational to curtail the nearly costless clean energy we produce with them. As with other technology disruptions, it is a mistake to ask how the existing system will accommodate SWB.The grid as we know it will rapidly evolve into a larger, more flexible, diverse, and capable system, just like the landline telephone network evolved into the Internet. Instead we must ask, ‘How can a new energy system based on SWB minimize costs and maximize benefits at every level of society and the economy’?This disruption approach is pretty exciting stuff. The internet/landline telephone network comparison is an effective way to convey RethinkX’s message. Who would have thought we’d no longer need landlines or cable television? Or could make international phone calls — by video, no less, Jetsons-style — for free through the internet? AT&T Et al. probably aren’t happy about that, but there’s nothing they can do but adapt — and they have — because most of the world has Wi-Fi now, along with apps that allow us to make those calls and watch those shows. And technology continues to evolve quickly. So if we apply this thinking to green energy and energy sources, what’s holding us back from rapid evolution? We need to shift our thinking, break up monopolies, change our policies, and embrace change. It’s time for utilities and fossil-fuel giants to adapt — just as BP declared that it’s time to adopt renewables in September — and innovators, keep on innovating. You’re doing great things.",solar
2020/10/28,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):In July, as Electrek reported, South Korea announced a plan to spend $95 billion to help its economy recover from the pandemic and create jobs. The plan set a goal of net zero by 2050, an end to funding of overseas coal plants, and the introduction of a carbon tax.Today, South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in announced that Asia’s fourth-largest economy is formally committing to reach net zero by 2050. The green energy transition plan momentum in East Asia in the last two months has been rapid: South Korea follows Japan, who made its own net zero by 2050 pledge earlier this month, and China, who committed to net zero by 2060 at the end of September.In a speech to the National Assembly, Moon said:The government has pushed for strong policy to shift energy [sources] so far, but we still need to improve many things. We will go toward carbon neutral by 2050, taking action on climate change.We will replace coal power with renewable energy, creating new markets and industries as well as jobs.Nikkei Asia reports that KB Financial Group, Samsung C&T, and Kepco have announced exits from thermal coal power projects.Australia has responded to the momentum of its neighbors with a refusal to set emissions targets. China, Japan, the UK, and South Korea account for more than AUD $310 billion (US $218 billion) in Australian annual trade — and they all now have net zero targets. Yet coal and natural gas alone are worth more than 25% (AUD $110 billion, or US $77 billion) of Australia’s exports. One would think that would be a serious concern for the Australian government — but nope. The Sydney Morning Herald reports:Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he will not be dictated to by other governments’ climate change goals, declaring he is not worried about the future of Australia’s exports despite four of the country’s top trading partners adopting net-zero emissions targets.The Morrison government has argued it will comply with the terms of the Paris climate agreement by reaching net zero by sometime in the second half of the century but has not set a firm target.Morrison’s response on Wednesday to Korea’s announcement and a personal plea from UK prime minister Boris Johnson to take “bold action” and set targets was:I am not concerned about our future exports. Australia will set our policies here. Our policies won’t be set in the United Kingdom, they won’t be set in Brussels, they won’t be set in any part of the world other than here.One thing the British Prime Minister and I agree on is that achieving emissions reductions shouldn’t come at the cost of jobs in Australia or the UK.Gas mining and exploration make up 0.2% of the Australian workforce.Governor Ralph Northam (D-VA) signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act in April, so expect to see a lot of green energy activity in the mid-Atlantic state. The latest solar farm to be completed is in Danville, a town that sits on the North Carolina border.Danville Utilities, in partnership with EPC energy firm CS Energy, solar independent power producer Navisun, and clean energy investment company TurningPoint Energy, has completed a 14 MW DC utility-scale solar farm. The 100-acre project is made up of two adjoining sites. It will generate an estimated 23,551 MWh annually for the community. It equates to about 3% of Danville Utilities’ yearly energy output, or enough to power 1,500 homes each year.Jason Grey, director of utilities for the City of Danville, which has a population of around 41,000, said:These solar farms will… contribute to the city’s current renewable power supply portfolio and help us meet our long-term goal of being completely independent of fossil-fueled generation.Danville is a great example of green energy initiatives at the local level across the US, which are rapidly increasing.",solar
2020/10/27,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):Two of the US’s largest automakers have known since the 1960s that car emissions cause climate change, according to an exclusive months-long investigation by E&E News.E&E writes:Researchers at both automakers found strong evidence in the 1960s and ’70s that human activity was warming the Earth. A primary culprit was the burning of fossil fuels, which released large quantities of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide that could trigger melting of polar ice sheets and other dire consequences.A GM scientist presented her findings to at least three high-level executives at the company, including a former chairman and CEO. It’s unclear whether similar warnings reached the top brass at Ford.The findings by E&E News reveal that GM and Ford were ‘deeply and actively engaged’ since the 1960s in understanding how their cars affected the climate, said Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law.Ford responded to the investigation by acknowledging that climate change is real. It says it’s now investing more than $11 billion in electrification and will run its manufacturing plants on 100% green energy in 15 years.GM responded by saying it made the electric Hummer, and:There is nothing we can say about events that happened one or two generations ago since they are irrelevant to the company’s positions and strategy today.Oh, OK then.

He had announced his retirement less than a week before.Although no cause of death was officially given, Murray filed for black lung benefits — which he spent most of his career trying to prevent — on October 1, as Electrek reported. In the black lung claim, Murray stated he was heavily dependent on oxygen and was “near death,” the Associated Press reported.Yet Murray also claimed of his illness:It’s idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, IPF. And it is not related to my work in the industry.Murray Energy’s bankruptcy was a drain on the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. As of November, Murray Energy had only contributed $1.1 million of the $155 million it owed to the fund.As CEO of Murray Energy, he routinely opposed regulation across the board. He sent Donald Trump a four-page “action plan” calling for environmental and mine safety regulation rollbacks. Murray was granted around half the items on his action plan, including revoking the Clean Power Plan and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So even as coal is in demise, Murray’s legacy is damage to the environment.67.8% of children in the UK believe that electric vehicles are good for the planet, according to new research conducted by Peugeot UK. More than half of the parents taking part (55.3%) said their children would like them to own an electric car going forward. The study consisted of 1,250 children aged 7-12 and their parents or guardians.Here’s the interesting finding: Those kids have buying power. 72.2% of children said they are consulted or involved in the purchases their parents make — including buying a new car.David Peel, managing director of Peugeot UK, said:It’s great to see the next generation of car buyers so interested in full electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, and to know that they understand the positive impact these vehicles have on the environment. With this in mind, it’s really positive to see through our research how influential children are in the purchase decisions their parents make.The UK has banned ICE and hybrid cars by 2035, and the Labour Party has called for the ban to be moved forward to 2030.Photo: Ford",solar
2020/10/26,"South Australia, a state in southern central Australia and the fourth-largest by area and fifth-largest by population (its capital is Adelaide), has become the first major jurisdiction in the world to be powered entirely by solar.100% of energy demand was met solely by solar panels for just over an hour on October 11. Rooftop solar provided 77% and large-scale solar farms provided the other 23%. 288,000 homes (around one-third) have rooftop solar. Any excess power generated by gas and wind farms on that day was stored in batteries or exported to Victoria via the interconnector, ABC reports. As solar growth continues, 100% solar power will happen more frequently in a state that previously had blackout issues. Australian Energy Market Operator, which manages electricity and gas systems and markets across Australia, is forecasting an additional 36,000 new solar rooftop systems in the next 14 months.There’s gold in them thar solar panels, apparently.Joe Biden and Donald Trump were asked about climate change last week — the first time climate change was ever addressed in a presidential debate. Biden said he would “transition from the oil industry” to solar, wind, and other green energy. He said green energy would create jobs and benefit the economy.And the next day, shares in solar stocks such as Renesola Ltd (SOL.N), Jinkosolar Holding Co Ltd (JKS.N), Canadian Solar Inc (CSIQ.O), and SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) were up between 2% and 3% in premarket trading, according to Reuters. (Shares of oil companies were pretty much unchanged.)But Biden says he won’t ban fracking, and said after the debate:We’re getting of the subsidies for fossil fuels. But we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time… they’re not going to lose their jobs. Besides, a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.On Saturday, Biden was interviewed in an episode of Pod Save America, where discussed green energy and climate change at length. You can listen in the podcast, or watch that discussion here:Four days ago, Electrek reported that Japan was expected to commit to reaching net zero by 2050, according to Nikkei Asia. Today, that expectation became official. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced plans to put the world’s third-largest economy on a path to reaching net zero by 2050. It was Suga’s first policy address to parliament since taking office in September — and he seized the opportunity to tackle climate change.Suga said [via Business Green]:Response to global warming is no longer a constraint on economic growth.We need to change our mind-set that proactively taking measures against global warming will bring about changes to industrial structures, as well as the economy and society, and lead to major growth.Japan’s green energy plan is expected to be announced in summer 2021. Dr. Alison Doig, international lead at the UK’s Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, said:Following commitments made by the UK, EU, Canada, and China, the USA is looking increasingly isolated on the climate agenda as it approaches its election.This will further concentrate the minds of investors, banks, and the entire financial community because with China, Japan, and the EU all setting a course for net zero emissions around mid-century, there’s clearly a very limited future for remaining invested in fossil fuels.",solar
2020/10/26,"On Saturday, Biden was interviewed in an episode of Pod Save America, where he discussed green energy, battery storage, EVs and charging stations, and climate change in depth. He said: “It’s the number one issue facing humanity. And it’s the number one issue for me.”For example, in his conversation, Biden stated:Climate change is the existential threat to humanity… Unchecked, it is going to actually bake this planet. This is not hyperbole. It’s real. And we have a moral obligation…It also presents an enormous opportunity… We need a president who can lead the world as well as do the things we have to do and can do.We can’t be cavalier about the impact it’s going to have on how we’re going to transition to do all this.But I just think it’s a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity to create really good jobs.No one is going to build another oil or gas-fired electric plant. They’re going to build one that is fired by renewable energy… The fastest-growing industries are solar and wind.You can listen to the full podcast here where he discussed it in-depth and watch the discussion below. Biden was interviewed by Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama.Last week, the topic of climate change was included in the presidential debates for the very first time. Biden said he would “transition from the oil industry” to solar, wind, and other green energy. He stated then as well that green energy would create jobs and benefit the economy.But Biden says he won’t ban fracking, and said after the debate:We’re getting of the subsidies for fossil fuels. But we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time… they’re not going to lose their jobs. Besides, a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.A lot of mainstream media are asking whether Biden’s stance on ultimately scrapping oil is going to hurt him in swing states like Pennsylvania and Texas that employ voting fossil fuel workers. Overall, 72% of Americans believe that global warming is real, and 86% want funding for green energy research.But Big Oil is already transitioning away from fossil fuels on their own. For example, Shell announced the cut of up to 9,000 jobs due to an oil demand slump and the pandemic at the end of September, and in April, it announced that it intends to reach net zero by 2050 or sooner by selling more green energy.Why is Shell and other Big Oil companies such as BP making that move? Because green energy is now good business. Biden’s $2 trillion plan that puts the US on a path to net zero from the electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050 will just accelerate that.",solar
2020/10/23,"Transitioning to 100% green energy would save Americans billions in energy costs each year while dramatically reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report, “No Place Like Home: Fighting Climate Change (and Saving Money) by Electrifying America’s Households,” by nonprofit coalition Rewiring America.The average household in every state would be better off economically by electrifying. Annual savings would average between $1,050 to $2,585, and the US as a whole would annually save up to $321 billion.Solar PV is also now consistently cheaper than new coal- or gas-fired power plants in most countries, and solar projects now offer some of the lowest-cost electricity ever seen, as Electrek reported on October 13.And that’s just economic benefits. Electrifying would also benefit health, climate, reduced maintenance costs, and more consistent performance. More than 40% of energy emissions come from home appliances, according to the report, such as heating, electricity, refrigeration, and automobiles.Adam Zurofsky, executive director of Rewiring America, said: As Americans continue to struggle to make ends meet, this analysis provides an exciting and desperately needed road map for a brighter future.If we do it right, electrifying the American household presents a unique opportunity to create millions of jobs, save families thousands of dollars a year, and dramatically slash our carbon emissions in the process.If Joe Biden won the US election — and with congressional support — the US would move to green energy at a much faster pace. But regardless of the outcome, the US is going to transition to renewables, according to a report by S&P Global Platts Analytics. For example, a right-leaning Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions poll found that 67% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters agree that making investments in clean energy are important to rebuild the economy after the pandemic.Market Watch reports:S&P Global Platts Analytics’ expectations for the next few years include a brief rebound in coal as demand and supply are better aligned. Coal is the fading sector of the economy that President Trump pledged to save during the last election even as coal operators themselves had already been closing or migrating to other sources.The Platts forecast includes a pullback in natural gas, the electricity source that has logged an historic cost drop and increased U.S. energy independence. By 2030, coal’s current 21% share of the generation mix would be closer to 5%, under a reference case that assumes a federal carbon price starting in 2026, Platts says. Wind and solar generation in that scenario is seen increasing from 11% of the generation mix in 2020 to 30% in 2030.There is clear movement at the state and local levels to embrace green energy, but a federally implemented green energy plan would give the transition the momentum it needs. And in order to slow climate change, it needs to be as fast as possible.Researchers from Purdue University in Indiana say they have developed a white paint with strong cooling properties that has the potential to reduce reliance on air conditioning. The engineers involved say the impact is achieved by adding different-sized particles of calcium carbonate, an earth-abundant compound commonly found in rocks and seashells:These calcium carbonate fillers absorb almost no ultraviolet rays due to a so-called large “band gap,” a result of their atomic structure. They also have a high concentration of particles that are different sizes, allowing the paint to scatter a wider range of wavelengths.The study found that the radiative cooling paint was able to reflect 95.5% of sunlight and reduce temperatures by 18F — that’s a lot.“The paint would not only send heat away from a surface, but also away from Earth into deep space where heat travels indefinitely at the speed of light. This way, heat doesn’t get trapped within the atmosphere and contribute to global warming,” reports Purdue.Check out the video about the new paint below:",solar

Prime minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to make the announcement in his first speech to parliament next week after taking office last month. This is a major shift in the Japanese government’s position and brings the country in line with the European Union and the Paris Agreement. The old target, which lacked a clear timeline, was to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 and reach “virtually zero as early as possible in the second half of this century.” A major revision will be required to meet the new target.Japan is currently under fire by environmental groups, and the fisheries industry, China, and South Korea are worried, following reports of Japan’s plan to release treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster into the sea. Suga said today in a press conference about the controversy, according to Japan Today:‘We cannot postpone the issue forever. We would like to make a decision responsibly as soon as possible. There has been no decision on when or how to deal with the water.’The government plans to deepen discussions on the matter and work on measures to prevent reputational damage linked to radiation, he added.Queensland in Australia and banking giant HSBC (HSBA.L) said today that they will make a “world-first investment” to protect the UNESCO World Heritage site the Great Barrier Reef, which is under threat from extreme bleaching. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half its coral in the last three decades due to warming seas and poor water quality, as Electrek reported last week.Reuters reports:In an attempt to safeguard the reef, HSBC and the Queensland government said they would buy ‘Reef Credits,’ a tradable unit that quantifies and values the work undertaken to improve water quality flowing onto the reef.Similar to the carbon offset market which incentivizes the reduction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the scheme pays landholders for improved water quality.The investment required to meet water quality targets for the Great Barrier Reef is estimated at A$4 billion ($2.8 billion), according to James Schultz, the CEO of GreenCollar, which developed the Reef Credit Scheme in partnership with landholders, the Queensland government and natural resource management organizations.Neither Queensland nor HSBC have yet said how much they will be investing. The market could be worth more than 6 million Reef Credits by 2030.Environment America Research & Policy Center has released its 2020 report, “Renewables on the Rise 2020,” which has some interesting statistics about the rise of green energy in the US in the last decade.Here are some highlights, and you can read the report in full by clicking the link above:According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the US has the technical potential to meet its current electricity needs more than 75 times over with solar energy and more than 10 times over with wind energy.The US really has no excuse.

2020/10/21,"It looks as though the latest holder of the title, “world’s largest solar farm,” is set to be Newcastle Waters in Australia’s Northern Territory. The solar farm in the Outback will be capable of producing 10 gigawatts and will be so big that it will be able to be seen from space.The Newcastle Waters solar farm, which will sit on a 10,000-square-kilometer (3,861-square-mile) cattle station between Alice Springs and Darwin, will cost US $20 billion. The land is very flat, which is ideal. Sun Cable is the company that will be responsible for the solar farm.A project referral has been submitted to the Northern Territory’s Environmental Protection Authority. It’s the first stage of an approval process that will start with community consultation in late 2020, then construction commencement in late 2023, energy production by 2026, and export by 2027.Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, said [via the Guardian]:It’s on the Adelaide to Darwin rail corridor, which is brilliant for our logistics given the enormous amount of material we’ll have to transport to the site.It’s a bit of a balancing act too, because it’s far south enough to get away from the main patch affected by the wet season, so it’s a steady solar resource throughout the year. There’s plenty of sun and not many clouds.Overhead transmission lines will route the power to Darwin and into the state’s power grid. But two-thirds of the power will be exported to Singapore by high-voltage direct current undersea cables. The Newcastle Waters solar farm and Sun Cable will provide around one-fifth of Singapore’s electricity needs. Singapore is working to move away from fossil fuels. Currently, 95% of Singapore’s electricity is produced using natural gas, while the rest is made up of coal, oil, municipal waste, and solar, reports the US Energy Information Administration.",solar
2020/10/21,"Poland’s largest utility, PGE, which is majority state-owned, wants to get rid of its coal assets, which makes up more than 80% of its electricity generation. It also wants to reach net zero by 2050. Its plans are dependent on the Polish government agreeing to manage the firm’s coal assets and the European Commission approving state aid.Analysts, however, have expressed that PGE should take responsibility for closing down its coal assets, not pass them to another arm of the state, according to Climate Change News.PGE president Wojciech Dąbrowski reportedly said, according to an energy analyst at Polityka Insight via Twitter, that if PGE does not separate its coal assets, it will have to declare bankruptcy in 1.5 years.PGE is aiming to generate 50% of its electricity from green energy by 2030 and 100% by 2050.Poland, the EU’s largest hard coal producer, has said the European Union’s emissions trading system (ETS) should redirect more revenues to poorer countries (e.g., Poland) needing support to cut emissions. More than 70% of Poland’s electricity comes from coal. The EU’s environment ministers will be meeting on Friday to discuss the ETS revamp.You can read Electrek‘s take from September on why Poland is giving up its coal habit here.Continuing with the topic of the EU environment ministers’ meeting on Friday, the ministers will then agree to make the EU’s pledge to be net zero by 2050 legally binding.They would then start negotiations with European Parliament, which must approve it. Reuters explains:A draft proposal for the law, as a basis for Friday’s talks, would set the 2050 net zero emissions target as a goal for the EU as a whole, rather than for individual countries, potentially letting some have higher emissions if others make deeper cuts.Parliament also wants an independent scientific council to advise the EU on climate policy, and a carbon budget to set out the total emissions Europe could emit in future, proposals excluded from the draft.A survey conducted by the New York Times and Sienna College on Tuesday found that 66% of voters polled said they support Biden’s $2 trillion climate plan. The poll was conducted between October 15 and 18, and has a 3.4% margin of error.Biden’s plan includes reaching net zero by 2050, and the electric sector reaching net zero by 2035.Donald Trump has not released a formal climate plan, so the poll did not cover his position on climate change.Biden’s plan does not call for a ban on fracking, but would ban new oil drilling of public lands. Here’s a short video from Brain Stuff — How Stuff Works that explains what fracking is, and why it’s controversial:When it came to fracking, polled voters were split. The Hill reports:44% of those polled said they support the method of oil extraction, while 42% said they are opposed and 14% were neutral.",solar
2020/10/20,"Ways2H converts waste biomass into renewable hydrogen using a patented thermochemical process with a net zero-carbon footprint. The company is a joint venture between US-based Clean Energy Enterprises and Japan Blue Energy Corporation that began operations in 2019. It expects to begin supplying hydrogen to customers by early 2021.It’s working to complete its first two commercial waste-to-hydrogen production facilities in Japan and California. A third project is planned in India. And it’s just closed a second round of funding — a $2.5 million investment from Long Beach, California-based Pacific6, which will help build more green hydrogen production projects in the US, Europe, and Asia. Wired explained how the company’s process works:The Ways2H system is similar to the types of gasification plants that are already used to convert trash into energy around the US, but with a few key differences. First, waste is sorted to remove materials without carbon or hydrogen (think glass and metal), dried, and shredded into one-inch pieces. Then it is fed into a vaporization chamber that heats it to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit to produce syngas — a mixture of hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide — that can be used as fuel or further refined. The Ways2H system increases the hydrogen concentration in the syngas by mixing it with steam, which creates a mixture that is about half hydrogen and half carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then filtered out using a commercial pressure-swing absorption system, a tank filled with absorbent materials that soak up the carbon dioxide like a sponge. The entire system sits in an open air tower that is about seven stories tall [pictured above].Ways2H’s process is a solution for the global $400 billion+ solid waste management market and the rapidly growing hydrogen economy, estimated to reach $2.5 trillion by 2050. New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection called for a ban on gas car sales by 2035 last week. If implemented, that would make the Garden State the second state in the US to enact an EV-only policy, behind California, which is drawing up rules for a 2035 gas car ban.New Jersey’s plan is to reduce emissions 80% by 2050, as stated in its 80×50 Report last week.Either Governor Phil Murphy would need to issue an executive directive or the legislature would enact a law in order for the 2035 ban to be implemented. Murphy said in a press release:The 80×50 Report is a call-to-action for all of us in government and in New Jersey to roll up our sleeves and craft the next generation of climate-focused laws and policies. Our Administration has taken the climate crisis head-on since day one. But the challenge before us demands more. As we have learned from the crisis brought about by COVID-19, we cannot spare a moment in taking the necessary steps that will prepare us for this next crisis. Together, we will meet this moment.E&E News explains:New Jersey’s governor and its Democratic-controlled Legislature have aimed to position the state as a national leader on clean energy, enacting one of the country’s first laws to zero out CO2 emissions from its power sector.Last year, a separate law created new rebates for electric cars, while setting a 330,000-EV sales target for 2025 and requiring all state-owned vehicles to be electric by a decade later.Last week, Electrek wrote about shipping as an enormous polluter, and how the industry needs to embrace new technologies in order to reduce its emissions. Well, here’s one of those new innovations. A wind-powered super sailboat built in Sweden could change how we ship cargo, and in this case, cars, across the Atlantic (we prefer the shipment of electric vehicles, please).Swedish shipbuilder Wallenius Marine is designing the 650-foot (198-meter) OceanBird, which will be able to carry 7,000 cars and will be powered completely by wind. The ship’s hull will feature five telescopic, 260-foot-tall sails that are kind of like helicopter rotors. They’ll be able to rotate 360 degrees and can be retracted to 195 feet.Oceanbird, with a projected top speed of around 10 knots, will be slower than standard car carriers, which can travel at 17 knots. It will take around 12 days, instead of seven, to cross the Atlantic. Wallenius says the ship will emit 90% less carbon dioxide than fossil-fuel-powered car carriers.Wallenius are currently conducting advanced tests on a 23-foot (7-meter) model of the shipPhoto: JBEC/Tsubasa Engineering",solar
2020/10/19,"Honda has stopped selling new diesel cars in the UK, and the last vehicles are expected to be gone from dealerships within a few weeks. That means the company’s UK line is just gas, hybrid, or electric.According to Auto Express, a Honda spokesperson said:Honda has accelerated its plans for all its European mainstream car models to be electrified from 2025 to 2022 and our motor petrol hybrid technology will play a key role in achieving this goal. As such, we plan for European production of diesel powertrains to cease by the end of 2022. However, on a local level in the UK, we have now stopped selling diesel cars.It’s the largest car manufacturer to drop diesel in the UK to date after bringing forward plans to switch to 100% green technology in the next two years. Honda will also phase out gas cars by the end of 2022, rather than 2025 as previously announced, according to the Times.You can check out a video review of the Honda e (pictured above) here.Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the two largest US energy firms, have increased their share of campaign donations to Democrats in 2020, according to the latest filings.Reuters reports:Chevron contributed roughly 28% [$4.9 million] of its political funds to Democratic candidates this cycle, from 26% in 2016. Exxon sent 41% of its contributions to Democratic candidates and parties, up from 32.6% in the last presidential election, the data showed.Why would Chevron and Exxon do this when the Democrats are pushing green energy (but the Dems are in favor of fracking)? Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said:[The contributions are to] support the election of candidates who believe, like we do, in the value of responsible oil and natural gas development and organizations and measures that are aligned with our business interests.Or, in other words, Democrat Joe Biden is leading in the polls. That saying, 85% of all fossil-fuel donations have gone to the Republican Party this election.Dominion Energy has completed the final stage of testing of its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) pilot project. The offshore wind farm is now ready to enter commercial service, and its technical review is expected to be complete by the end of 2020, which will be conducted while the CVOW is online. It’s the only project permitted under the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.It’s a two-turbine, 12-megawatt (MW) facility 27 miles off Virginia Beach capable of providing 3,000 homes with power, as Electrek reported on July 1.Dominion Energy’s big wind project is its proposed 2,600-megawatt offshore wind farm, which is the largest announced offshore wind project in North America. It’s on track to start construction in 2024, and will provide enough green energy to power up to 660,000 homes.In April, Virginia’s governor signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act that requires new measures to promote energy efficiency, sets a schedule for closing old fossil-fuel power plants, and requires electricity to come from 100% green energy.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/10/16,"Danish wind turbine manufacturer, seller, installer, and servicer MHI Vestas Offshore Wind A/S is getting serious about the size of its offshore wind turbines. It’s working on its next-generation wind turbine and will release it to the public within a year, and maybe even before the end of 2020.MHI’s CEO Philippe Kavafyan didn’t say in an interview exactly how large their new offshore wind turbines would be — just that they’ll be competitive with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA’s huge turbine with a rotor diameter of 222 meters (728 feet) — the world’s biggest. Larger blades are more efficient.Kavafyan said:The only thing I can tell you today is it triggers the interest of our customers. It’s difficult to imagine it will be much smaller than our competitors.Electrek’s Take: So, why is this news? Danish offshore wind company builds huge turbines, but we don’t know how big yet? Because we know they’re going to be very large indeed, and it’s yet another clear indicator that there’s a quickly growing market for giant offshore wind projects, and that includes floating wind farms. In other words, green energy is growing fast. But you know that, if you read this roundup regularly.Lots of politicians promote green energy, but which ones actually host it? The website Solar Power Challenge, which was created as a personal project this month by Nick Thorsch, a digital media specialist who works for Powur, looked at governors’ residences in all 50 states using Google Maps. And governors’ mansions in only 10 states have solar.You can check out the website’s politician’s homes solar survey map, which shows aerial views of each governor’s mansion roof. Thorsch’s next step will be checking governors’ personal homes, members of Congress, and presidential candidates.Thorsch explains why he’s conducting this investigation:In past elections, personality has trumped policy. Meanwhile, natural disasters have gotten worse. With the upcoming election on November 3, it’s even more important to enact policies that support the future of our planet, people, and profit. We can encourage politicians on both sides to come together and get solar on their mansions and homes, so they can experience the benefits of cleaner and cheaper solar powered energy. Challenge our politicians on social media to get solar on their homes and to extend the federal solar tax credit. The 26% federal tax credit goes down to 22%, next year, then 0% after that. If you’re a homeowner who doesn’t have solar yet, in case the tax credit isn’t extended, secure your 26% federal tax credit savings by ordering solar now.The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy has released a new brief, “Transportation Electrification in the Southeast,” which demonstrates that while the US Southeast is benefiting from EV manufacturing job creation and economic investment, the region is not actually maximizing the full breadth of opportunities that come from the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.The Southeast accounts for 28% of US EV manufacturing investment and at least 14% of the passenger EV manufacturing jobs while representing 18% of the US population. At least $6.7 billion of $24 billion in current automakers and battery manufacturers’ committed investments are in the Southeast.But in stark contrast, the Southeast accounts for only 10% of national EV sales and 13% of EV chargers. Further, the Southeast accounts for less than 1% of utility investment and only 4% of government funding nationwide.In other words, residents of the Southeast aren’t using what they’re making, and they need to shift this behavior. SACE lists ways Southeast policymakers can support EV growth here. There is also a link there to download the full report.Photo: MHI Vestas",solar
2020/10/15,"Offshore wind farms offer many sustainable benefits — including being hosts for oyster beds. Dutch maritime contracting company Van Oord will install eight reef structures within the offshore wind farm Borssele Wind Farm Site V as part of a research program aimed at expanding the North Sea’s oyster population. It’s been designated as an innovation site.The wind farm is 2 km (1.24 miles) off the Dutch coast. European flat oyster beds have been greatly decimated over the last century due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and disease, but they are now making a comeback due to increasing numbers of marine protected areas and offshore wind farms that host the beds.Borssele Wind Farm Site V’s research program is testing different outplacement methods for live European flat oysters such as contained, loose, and pre-settled. This is being done to determine which method works best for the long-term establishment of oyster reefs on scour protection.

Renewable energy and energy storage are the solution.The combination of Fluence’s integrated hardware, software and digital technology with AMS’ AI software will optimize renewable energy and energy storage assets, deliver more value for asset owners, improve reliability and flexibility for grid operators, and help lower carbon emissions.Together, AMS and Fluence cover nearly 5GW of existing or awarded assets globally.Swedish furniture giant Ikea has announced a new buy-back scheme — called, ahem, Buy Back — where it will purchase old and unwanted Ikea items and resell them to shoppers at discounted rates.Ikea is launching the initiative to help customers “take a stand against excessive consumption.”The program will begin in the UK on November 24, just ahead of Black Friday. It will also run in 26 other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia. But the US isn’t participating. Why not? The New York Times writes that an Ikea spokeswoman said:It is a country decision, and Ikea Retail US will not participate in the buyback program. The US is currently exploring ways to bring Buy Back to the country in the future.This year, they will use the traditional Black Friday to focus on other sustainability initiatives and to promote sustainable living among their customers.(No, I’m not enlightened by that explanation, either — Ed.)Ikea says that well-used items with several scratches will be eligible for a voucher worth 30% of their original value, very good condition will get a 40% voucher, and items in excellent condition can be swapped for 50% of their original value.

2020/10/13,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its World Energy Outlook 2020 (WEO), its flagship publication, and the Paris-based agency says solar has a very bright future indeed.The WEO examines the following decade and explores different scenarios that show how the energy sector could develop. In all four scenarios, which can be read in the report linked above, solar takes center stage and green energy plays a prominent role. In fact, the IEA says renewables will make up 80% of the market for new power generation by 2030.Hydropower is currently the most widely used green energy source in the world, but solar will surpass it because the cost of PV panels and installation is rapidly dropping.Solar PV is also now consistently cheaper than new coal- or gas-fired power plants in most countries, and solar projects now offer some of the lowest-cost electricity ever seen. The IEA rightly points out that there needs to be serious investment in electricity grids in order to support green energy as it grows.Dr. Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, says:I see solar becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets. Based on today’s policy settings, it is on track to set new records for deployment every year after 2022.If governments and investors step up their clean energy efforts in line with our Sustainable Development Scenario, the growth of both solar and wind would be even more spectacular — and hugely encouraging for overcoming the world’s climate challenge.Governments have the capacity and the responsibility to take decisive actions to accelerate clean energy transitions and put the world on a path to reaching our climate goals, including net-zero emissions.🗣 ""I see solar becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets. Based on today’s policy settings, it is on track to set new records for deployment every year after 2022.""@IEABirol launching #WE20 yesterday ➡️ https://t.co/pbW8MFxW7f pic.twitter.com/7kwslCYiVnVancouver, BC-based Portable Electric, which manufactures emissions-free mobile power stations — green generators — that run on solar and li-ion batteries, has partnered with the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) to help local communities affected by the devastating 2020 wildfire season in California. PG&E is the energy provider for nearly 16 million people in Northern and Central California.Several units of Portable Electric’s VOLTstack e-Generators will be delivered to food banks, school cafeterias, and customers with more urgent energy needs by the end of 2020.Portable Electric originally worked closely with the film production industry, but it’s shifted its focus to medical facilities and other sectors in need as a result of the wildfires in California and the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has previously helped in natural disasters in other states, too: In 2018, Portable Electric sent VOLTstack units and solar panels to the Carolinas after Hurricane Florence. It will continue to ramp up its coordination with areas hit by natural disasters.Mark Rabin, CEO and founder of Portable Electric, said:Strategic partnerships like this help us affect real change. We’ve already seen the devastating effects of carbon monoxide poisoning from gas and diesel-powered generators in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. In addition, we know that these wildfires are a result of climate change. The need to adapt is dire, and we all have a responsibility to instill that change.China’s pledge to be net zero by 2060 includes all greenhouses gases, not just carbon dioxide, according to He Jiankun, who chairs the academic committee at the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University. The pre-eminent researcher made the clarification at a conference on Monday where China’s plan to reach its goal was outlined.Further, China’s leading climate think tanks are pushing for cuts to carbon emissions and coal use over the next five years. There was also a call to raise non-fossil-fuel consumption to 25% by 2030.In a keynote speech, He said:China should strictly control coal consumption and the expansion of coal-fired power capacity in the next five years, aiming to cap carbon emission from coal sectors by 2025 and even realize negative growth.China is still expected to see growth of natural gas consumption in 2026-2030, so the growth of carbon emission from gas use should be offset by the reduction from coal sector.Reuters reports:The country, which is responsible for about 29% of global carbon dioxide emissions, is expected to endorse ambitious climate-related goals and possibly lower economic growth targets at the upcoming Communist Party conclave, which will determine development blueprints for 2021-2025.",solar
2020/10/13,"Eight out of 15 deaths in Hurricane Laura on the US’s Gulf Coast were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from portable generators, as NPR wrote in September. And that’s not an isolated incident — 85% of all carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the US are caused by portable generators because people mistakenly run them indoors or in their garage when they lose power.Mark Rabin is the CEO of Vancouver, BC-based Portable Electric, which manufactures emissions-free mobile power stations — green generators — that run on solar and li-ion batteries. Rabin spoke with Electrek via email about the role electric generators can play in natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes and how vital it is to switch to electric generators and off fossil-fuel-powered generators overall, as quickly as possible. Michelle Lewis: Are you sending electric generators to Louisiana in order to help those who have lost power during Hurricane Delta? (Ed. note: Nearly 700,000 lost power from the latest storm in a record-breaking hurricane season that isn’t over yet.)Mark Rabin: At this point, we unfortunately do not have plans to send equipment down to Louisiana. Doing a deployment of this magnitude requires partner organizations on the ground and some amount of preplanning and staging of the equipment in advance of hurricane season.We are looking into what supporting hurricane relief in 2021 looks like. This means we’re looking at potential partner organizations, the logistics of how to get equipment staged in key locations, and identifying support crews. Currently, we are fully committed to the relief efforts in California to support PG&E and its most vulnerable customers [in the wildfires]. We aim to make Public Safety Power Shutoff events easier by providing portable batteries to customers who rely on medical equipment to live. This will not only improve life quality but save lives. We also want to emphasize the need to move away from the old technology, which has been part of the problem for the past 100 years. We are seeing a greater frequency and intensity of natural disasters, and there’s every indication that this is the new normal. It’s therefore paramount that we prepare for the response efforts and invest in mobile, regenerative infrastructure that can provide clean power and save lives, like our VOLTstack solar generators. Can you tell us more about Portable Electric’s role in today’s energy market?Portable Electric fills an important role in offering clean,  solar backup power for off-grid support when there’s no longer access to the grid. These applications are traditionally filled by gas generators, which have issues with carbon monoxide poisoning, and limited access to the fuel supply chain in the aftermath of a disaster. We’re engineering serious machines here, designed for the harshest and most rugged industrial applications. Our VOLTstack e-Generators have the fastest solar charging [2.5 hours] in the portable industrial category and can power all types of appliances, such as communications, pumps, lighting, fridges, clinics, and command centers, without the need for a fossil fuel generator. In addition, our units can act as a mobile UPS [uninterruptible power supply] as backup for sensitive equipment that requires continuous power.What impact will green generators have on the world amid natural disasters?Portable Electric has been leading the charge in the transition from fossil fuel generators, to clean energy power systems — electrifying the industry. We’ve made it accessible to organizations big and small who would never have had the opportunity to rent or own this new and much more efficient technology. All of our electric generators come with onboard telematics and real-time power management via the VOLTstack app, allowing the user to know exactly how much power they are using and how much time left per charge, or how long it will take to charge from solar — even where all of their units are located. This is a game-changer for disaster emergency relief, as traditional generators have zero intelligence, and we are producing some of the first energy data sets from disaster zones.",solar
2020/10/12,"On September 8, Donald Trump signed an executive order that reversed his initial plans for offshore oil drilling until 2032 in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Trump said:This protects your beautiful Gulf [of Mexico] and your beautiful ocean, and it will for a long time to come.Good news all around, right? Not quite. What Trump didn’t say in his speech was, according to the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management:The withdrawal includes all energy leasing, including conventional and renewable energy.No new leases will be issued offshore North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, for a 10-year period beginning July 1, 2022.In other words, it also bans offshore wind farms. Chris Carnevale of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said [via the Post and Courier]:I think almost no one was expecting that it would affect offshore wind.Paul Gayes, a professor of marine science at Coastal Carolina University, said:The potential [for offshore wind power] is enormous.We’ve been working on this for 15 years and have a pretty firm belief that it is important for our state [of South Carolina], as a state where we’re at such risk from the changes we’re seeing in our environment.North Carolina has good momentum in both solar and wind — they have the first and only Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (REPS) in the Southeast, which requires utilities to generate a portion of electricity from green energy sources. Florida is focusing on solar, and solar is also growing in Georgia. But Georgia is home to the largest coal-fired power plant in the US and hosts two of the top four coal plants. Plus, Georgia is building the only two nuclear plants currently under construction in the US.South Carolina has no green energy plan.Electric cars will triple their market share in Europe this year as a result of EU car emissions targets, according to a new report released today from Transport & Environment (T&E), a European umbrella for nongovernmental organizations working in the field of transport and the environment that promote sustainable transport in Europe.T&E analyzed sales and carmakers’ compliance strategies in the first half of 2020. It found that despite the pandemic, EV sales have surged since January 1, just as the emissions standards kicked in, and will go from 3% to 10% this year and rise to 15% in 2021. However, it may only rise to 20% four years later if the current CO2 regulation is not revised, the analysis shows. Norway shows how fast the EV market can grow: from 6% of sales in 2013 to almost 50% five years later, in 2018.Julia Poliscanova, senior director for clean vehicles at T&E, said:Electric car sales are booming thanks to EU emissions standards. Next year, 1 in every 7 cars sold in Europe will be a plug-in. EU manufacturers are back in the EV race, but without more ambitious CO2 targets in 2025 and 2030 to spur them on, they’ll run out of steam as soon as 2022.Electric vehicles currently only occupy around 2% of market share in the US, but their popularity is quickly growing, and in California, they’re at 8%, for example. A big factor for car owners is cost, and EVs are cheaper to run, according to a new study from fintech firm Self Financial.Self Financial broke down such factors as fuel, energy, mileage, insurance, EV incentives, taxes, registration fees, maintenance, emissions tests, and more to work out the complete running cost of EV versus non-EV cars in each state. It found that across the US the average annual cost of running an electric vehicle is $2,721.96, while gas vehicles cost an average of $3,355.90 per year to run — a difference of $633.94 annually.Here are some of their main findings:",solar
2020/10/09,"Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewer in the world. So it’s a pretty big deal that the beer giant is going to launch a new range of low-carbon cans. They’ll be made from aluminum produced by Elysis in Montreal, which produces aluminum with a net-zero smelting process using hydroelectricity. A-B’s kickoff plan is to produce 1 million low-carbon cans of Michelob Ultra.The hydroelectric smelting technology has the potential to generate 30% less carbon emissions than traditional cans. It uses an inert anode — the positively charged electrode by which the electrons leave a device — instead of a carbon anode, meaning it emits pure oxygen instead of the carbon dioxide normally released at smelters.Anheuser-Busch has made a commitment to reducing emissions across its value chain by 25% by 2025. It also estimates that 70% of its aluminum is currently recycled.Since the majority of the world’s aluminum is made in Chinese coal-fired plants, Elysis’ and A-B’s hydroelectric plan is a welcome initiative.HSBC (HSBA.L) chief executive Noel Quinn, in an exclusive today with Reuters, told the news outlet that HSBC will become net zero across its entire customer base by 2050 at the latest. Quinn also said the banking giant will provide between $750 billion and $1 trillion in financing to help clients make the transition to net zero. HSBC aims to achieve net zero emissions in its own operations by 2030.Reuters notes:The pledge is the strongest statement by Europe’s biggest bank on climate change to date, although it met with criticism from some environmental groups for not taking more immediate action to curb its fossil fuel financing.Quinn said:COVID has been a wake-up call to us all, including me personally. We have seen how fragile the global economy is to a major event, in this case a health event, and it brings home the reality of what a major climate event could do.JPMorgan (JPM.N) earlier this week became the latest major bank before HSBC’s announcement to say it would work toward net zero by 2050.The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the public agency that operates most public transport services in Greater Boston, will sign a three-year electricity contract that will power the agency’s commuter rail, buses, subway, stations, and other facilities on 100% green energy. Its transit system is the largest electricity consumer in Massachusetts.And bonus: The MBTA’s costs will drop to $12.7 million annually, compared to its current, fossil-fueled electricity contract, which is $15.5 million. Renewable energy credits will provide assurance that the power comes from certified green energy power plants.Commonwealth Magazine reports:Andrew Brennan, the T’s senior director for energy and environment… said the T is also exploring a number of other ways to embrace renewable energy. He said the T currently has wind turbine projects in Kingston and Bridgewater, solar projects at two subway stations, a geothermal project at the Hingham ferry terminal, and a solar canopy project with the potential to produce 25 megawatts of electricity.The switch will take place on January 1, 2021.",solar
2020/10/08,"Residential geothermal company Dandelion Energy yesterday announced that it’s hired a new vice president of drillings whose name is Jeremy Smith. What’s unique about Smith? The exec comes from a fossil-fuel background.Smith brings more than 18 years of experience in the natural gas and oil industries to Dandelion’s geothermal drilling operations. Before joining Dandelion, Smith was the consulting drilling manager for Shale Petroleum Ltd. in Alberta, Canada. Prior to that, he worked in drilling operations leadership positions with various natural gas and oil extraction companies.Electrek asked Smith why he chose to leave the fossil fuels and join the green energy sector. He replied:Moving to geothermal and away from fossil fuels was all about a better opportunity for myself and my family. There is no question that there is more economic opportunity in green energy than oil and gas. Fossil fuel extraction is a shrinking industry that often requires people to move and work in places on the edge. With Dandelion, I’m joining a fast-growing company that allows me to build a future.Electrek recently had a Q&A with Dandelion Energy founder Kathy Hannun about why home geothermal systems are affordable, convenient, and energy-efficient, which you can read here. Dandelion was spun out of Alphabet’s X (formerly called Google[x]) in May 2017, and it’s growing like crazy. The whole world is rapidly transitioning to green energy, and the sector will create thousands of good jobs and help the fight against climate change. Jeremy Smith just reiterated that — the operative word he used being “opportunity” — and his transferrable drilling experience will be used for good. He’s a great example of how fossil-fuel professionals can move into a cleaner career — and again, in Smith’s words, “build a future.”In August, we reported that green energy leads new US generating capacity in 2020. Post-election, the next US administration needs to embrace green energy fully — and that includes the abandonment of fracking.To learn more about whether Dandelion Energy would work for you, you can click my referral link here.",solar
2020/10/08,"UK-based industrial technology and products company RS Components has analyzed data from the US Energy Information Administration to reveal the most popular green energy sources in every country in the world, as well as the countries that produce the most of each type of renewable energy.Hydropower is the most-favored option by a huge margin, with 122 of the countries analyzed generating most of their renewable energy from this source. China is currently the leading country for hydropower, at 1,145.5 billion kWh, significantly above Canada and Brazil, who are the second and third largest producers with 388.6 billion kWh and 367.2 billion kWh, respectively.China is home to the world’s largest hydroelectric gravity dam, the Three Gorges Dam, and the country produces over a quarter of the world’s installed capacity. China is also the top producer of hydropower, solar, wind, and biomass. The US leads in geothermal, producing 15.9 billion kWh, with geothermal power plants present in seven states in 2019, despite hydropower being the country’s main green energy source overall. But geothermal power is the least popular source of energy — it’s the main renewable source for only the Philippines, Kenya, and Nicaragua.With solar and wind growing at a rapid rate, such as the UK announcing a big boost for wind this week, these stats will likely shift rapidly in the near future.Online solar and energy storage marketplace EnergySage has released its 11th semiannual Solar Marketplace Intel Report that examines solar and storage trends they’ve gleaned from their own data from July 2019 to June 2020. Here are three standout trends they observed:Solar prices continue to decrease, but at a slower rate. The first half of 2020 saw the median quoted solar price dropping 1.4% over the second half of 2019. However, the 2.4% decrease between July 2019 and June 2020 is a slower rate of decline than observed in previous 12-month periods. (Ahem. Pandemic.)  Tesla’s Powerwall 2 is the most quoted and least expensive storage option on EnergySage. Over half of the energy storage quotes on EnergySage include the Tesla Powerwall. It’s followed by LG Chem’s RESU 10H. On a cost per kilowatt-hour basis, the Powerwall 2 is also the least expensive storage option being quoted.Resilience drives interest in energy storage. Nearly two-thirds of customers are driven by wanting backup power, which isn’t surprising in the face of more frequent and intense weather catastrophes such as wildfires and hurricanes that knock out power. Further, nearly 50% of EnergySage shoppers that want storage are interested in financial savings. Residential geothermal company Dandelion Energy yesterday announced Jeremy Smith as the company’s vice president of drillings.

2020/10/06,"It’s been such a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic that we’ve run out of hurricane names. We are currently on the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. Delta is the 25th named storm of 2020 and the 10th to hit the US this year. (Electrek wrote about the brutal Hurricane Laura in August, and how climate change caused the storm to double its wind speed in 24 hours.)Delta reached hurricane strength last night, and it could become a Category 3 storm as it reaches Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula — which was just hit by Tropical Storm Gamma a couple of days ago. Hurricane Delta is due to hit the US’s Gulf Coast between Louisiana and Florida on Friday, where it could pack wind speeds of around 100 mph and result in 30-foot seas. It will likely shut down oil and natural gas production off the Louisiana coast. It also poses a threat to shipping and onshore refineries. Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist with the Energy Weather Group, said [via Bloomberg Green]:Expect widespread shut-ins of rigs and platforms across the upper Gulf Coast over next two days.Significant impact and disruption to the US energy production area of the upper Gulf is likely as the week wears on.Fossil fuel producers Chevron Corp (CVX.N), BP PLC (BP.L), BHP Group (BHP.AX), and Occidental Petroleum OXY.N have begun to remove staff and secure offshore facilities, according to Reuters. (Meanwhile, Forbes ran a story in September about wind turbines that can withstand hurricane/typhoon-force winds — and harness the wind to create energy. There’s an idea for the Gulf of Mexico.)In a small bit of good news for storm-battered Louisiana, local shipbuilding company Edison Chouest Offshore will build and operate a ship that will help run and maintain offshore wind farms in the northeastern US. The project is expected to create 300 construction jobs in the Bayou State.UK prime minister Boris Johnson declared today that the UK would become “the world leader in clean wind energy” at the Conservative Party conference. He committed £160 million to upgrade ports and factories in northern England, Scotland, and Wales in order to build wind turbines.The plan includes the creation of 2,000 clean energy construction jobs and the support of 60,000 more. The government is boosting its target for offshore wind power capacity by 2030 from 30 to 40 gigawatts.Johnson said:Your kettle, your washing machine, your cooker, your heating, your plug-in electric vehicle — the whole lot of them will get their juice cleanly and without guilt from the breezes that blow around these islands.The wind announcement is the first stage of the British government’s 10-point plan for a “green industrial revolution” from the government.

2020/10/05,"While European oil giants like BP and Shell are busy trying to formulate a net zero plan and transition to renewables, Exxon is in a time warp and making plans to increase its emissions, according to internal documents obtained by Bloomberg Green:Exxon’s own assessment of its $210 billion investment strategy shows yearly emissions rising 17% by 2025, according to the internal documents.The planning documents show for the first time that Exxon has carefully assessed the direct emissions it expects from the seven-year investment plan adopted in 2018 by Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. The additional 21 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year that would result from ramping up production dwarfs Exxon’s projections for its own efforts to reduce pollution, such as deploying renewable energy and burying some carbon dioxide.Bloomberg Green says the rise is equivalent to the entire emissions output of the country of Greece, or 26 coal-fired plants.The fossil fuel giant wrote in its document:As demand returns and capital investments resume, our growth plans will continue to include meaningful emission mitigation efforts.Electrek’s Take: Exxon has ambitious and unrealistic growth plans that look backward, not forward, and its “mitigation efforts” are anything but meaningful. Exxon, you’ve gotta get with the program — you’re living on your own polluted planet.On September 25, Democratic state senator Pete Harckham from New York’s Hudson Valley introduced a bill that would require all New York State sales of new cars and trucks to be zero emissions by 2035.Harckham’s bill also requires that all New York sales of off-road vehicles and power equipment be zero emissions by 2035, and medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks reach net zero by 2045. Harckham said he hoped the switch to electric could happen even sooner.The bill specifies that the New York Climate Act‘s 22-member Climate Action Council and state agencies speed up the development of affordable charging for EVs. It focuses on ensuring access to charging in low-income communities.It also asks that regulatory processes to transition away from fossil fuel production facilities be expedited, with progress to be reported by July 15, 2021.Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, at 28% in 2018. Light-duty vehicles make up the largest percentage of that, at 59%. And in New York State, transport makes up around 36% of New York’s emissions. The UK’s green energy tech firm Octopus Energy has announced it will create 1,000 new clean technology jobs across the UK, primarily in London, Brighton, Warwick, and Leicester. This hiring spree would double Octopus’ workforce by the end of 2021. The positions are primarily for STEM graduates.It will also set up a new technology, data science, and artificial intelligence hub in Manchester. Octopus says it wants to make the UK the “Silicon Valley of energy.” As Business Green reports, the center would be “dedicated to developing smart grid technologies that can help the UK’s carbon intensive transport and heating industries cut costs as they transition from fossil fuels to clean electricity.”As Electrek reported in May, Octopus’ cloud-based energy platform Kraken allows customers to pay less when clean energy generation is high, and avoid paying high costs when generation is low.Octopus aims to have 100 million energy accounts on its Kraken platform by 2027, up from its current 17 million.Photo: AP/Matthew Brown",solar

And in New York State, transport makes up around 36% of New York’s emissions.As my colleague Jameson Dow recently pointed out about California’s ban:Other states have proposed more aggressive bans than [the California ban] (2030 in Washington and Hawaii, to name a couple), but none have been put into place yet.This [California] ban could and should be more aggressive, and should act to influence the industry and consumer behavior into more rapid change than would come naturally. In Electrek’s view, it’s already a bad idea to buy a new gas car. On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden spoke to members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union at its Grand Rapids, Michigan, headquarters, where he said:Leading in the world on electric vehicles and building 500,000 electric charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state. The introduction of this bill in New York State was a “speak softly, carry a big stick” moment. It’s barely been reported by media outlets, but if it goes through, it’d be a major triumph. And as California governor Gavin Newsom predicted, if California acted, other states would be emboldened to act.  Electrek would love to see New York keep up its momentum of the Climate Act, which mandates an 85% reduction in emissions by 2050, by passing this latest bill. And we’re with Harckham: We hope it happens sooner, too.If Biden wins, electric vehicles, the infrastructure needed to run them, and clean energy are going to get a big boost — and jobs would come with it. Further, it’s exactly what the entire world needs environmentally, seeing how the US is the second-largest polluter in the world, behind China — and the largest per capita polluter. US fossil fuel companies need to follow European Big Oil and move to renewables. Oil and gas are on their way out.",solar
2020/10/02,"After a five-year pressure campaign by students, environmental groups, academics, and politicians, Cambridge University in the UK has announced that it will divest its £3.5 billion ($4.5 billion) endowment fund from fossil fuels. All future research funding and other donations will also be “scrutinized.” The university has one of the largest university endowments in Europe.Vice Chancellor Stephen Toope said that Cambridge would divest from all direct and indirect investments in fossil fuels by 2030 and reach net zero by 2038:The university is responding comprehensively to a pressing environmental and moral need for action with an historic announcement that demonstrates our determination to seek solutions to the climate crisis.The Guardian shares the details:The step-by-step changes, which the university hopes will inspire other institutions, will lead to the endowment fund:● withdrawing investments with conventional energy-focused public equity managers by December 2020● building up significant investments in renewable energy by 2025● divesting from all meaningful exposure in fossil fuels by 2030● aiming to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its entire investment portfolio by 2038.The University of Oxford cut its ties to fossil fuels at the end of April this year.Vice President Joe Biden announced his transition team ethics plan yesterday, and fossil fuel execs aren’t going to be a part of it. The plan is a normal part of preparation, should the Biden/Harris team win the US presidential election.The Ethics Plan states in the first paragraph on page one:In addition to instituting a robust code of ethical conduct, Vice President Biden aims to ensure that those who serve are aligned with his values and policy priorities, and have not, for example, been leaders at fossil fuel… companies.Lobbyists also will not be allowed to be on the transition team. In the Code of Ethical Conduct section, it states:I will disqualify myself from involvement in any particular Biden-Harris Transition Team matter which to my knowledge may directly conflict with a financial interest of mine, an immediate family member, partner, client, or other individual or organization with which I have or have had a business relationship within the past 12 months. Work on a particular matter directly conflicts with a financial interest where it would have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest.According to E&E News, a spokesman for the team said:No lobbyist for the fossil fuel or private prison industry has been given permission to work on the transition.Teesside, an industrial region in northeastern England historically associated with heavy industry such as chemical manufacturing and steel, has been named the UK’s first Hydrogen Transport Hub by the British government. Teesside’s port is among the 10 largest in Europe, so is set up well for manufacturing.The £14 million ($18 million) center will partner with Teesside University and develop and test new hydrogen technologies and bring together industry, academics, and the national government.According to Teesside Live, “Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who secured the transport hub, said the scheme would pump £7 billion into the region’s economy and create thousands more jobs between now and 2050.”Houchen said:We already produce more than 50% of the UK’s hydrogen, so by becoming the home of the National Hydrogen Transport Centre, we can properly utilize this and fully unleash our area’s potential.Hydrogen and Net Zero Teesside aren’t just a key part of my plan for jobs — a plan to create good quality, high skilled local jobs for local people across Teesside, Darlington, and Hartlepool — but they will create the clean jobs which are essential for our future.Teesside has led the world in steel manufacturing and engineering for generations.

2020/10/01,"The US Army’s Fort Bragg in North Carolina will soon be home to the largest floating solar plant in the Southeast. It will be a 1.1-megawatt system as part of a Utility Energy Service Contract awarded to Duke Energy. It’s a $36 million contract. Ameresco, Duke Energy’s prime contractor, will build it on Big Muddy Lake at Camp Mackall. Fort Bragg will own and operate the system once construction is completed. Construction is expected to begin in November.Fort Bragg has 50,000 active duty personnel — the largest population of any military installation in the Department of Defense.The floating solar installation will be paired with a 2 MW battery energy storage system. The system will supplement power to Fort Bragg from the local grid and provide backup power during electric service outages. The post will also see lighting and water upgrades, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, and boiler system improvements.The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory researchers estimate that installing floating solar photovoltaics on the more than 24,000 manmade US reservoirs could generate about 10% of the US’s annual electricity production.Twenty percent of Americans have HVAC systems that cost the homeowner an extra $882 annually on average to keep their homes cool — almost four times as much as the most efficient similar homes, according to a new study conducted by smart home energy company Sense.But here’s the surprising finding: The 20% of homes with the highest cooling account for 45% of all cooling consumption nationwide.Updating these inefficient homes could save 8% of US residential electricity usage overall. Updating and weatherizing the least efficient homes could save consumers $15.3 billion annually while moving the US closer to climate change goals. Incentive programs that updated the 20% of homes with the highest cooling usage would eliminate 115 billion kWh of electricity usage annually. By comparison, in 2019, the US generated 107 billion kWh from solar and 300 billion kWh from wind.Sense CEO Mike Phillips said:Once we crunched the data, we were surprised to see that improving that 20% least efficient group of homes could save energy equivalent to all solar generation in 2019. What’s changing is that we now have smart home data that can guide policymakers and utilities to get the biggest impact from their clean energy programs.The UK’s National Health Service today announced a multi-year plan to become the world’s first net zero national health system.The NHS has adopted two targets, according to Business Green: For emissions under its direct control to reach net zero by 2040, with an interim reduction target of 80% by 2028-32; and for its wider supply chain footprint to reach net zero by 2045, with an 80% reduction target set between 2036 and 2039.The report issued by the NHS, which you can read in full here, “provides a detailed account of the NHS’ modeling and analytics underpinning the latest NHS carbon footprint, trajectories to net zero, and the interventions required to achieve that ambition. It lays out the direction, scale, and pace of change. It describes an iterative and adaptive approach, which will periodically review progress and aims to increase the level of ambition over time.”It details such changes as completing a £50 million LED lighting replacement program, working toward road-testing for what would be the world’s first zero-emission ambulance by 2022, and working with suppliers to ensure that all of them meet or exceed the NHS’ commitment on net zero emissions before the end of the decade.The NHS is Europe’s largest employer as well as the UK’s largest emitter. NHS chief executive Sir Simons Stevens said:It is not enough for the NHS to treat the problems caused by air pollution and climate change — from asthma to heart attacks and strokes — we need to play our part in tackling them at source.",solar

Sense’s analysis of home energy data supports the potential impact of the plan on the US’s energy picture and climate change goals, and it goes a step further by identifying the homes that will have the biggest impact overall. It’s already being done in other countries. As of this week, homeowners in England can apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their homes more energy-efficient through the government’s Green Homes Grant scheme. Improvements could include home insulation or installing low-carbon heating.Updating and weatherizing the least efficient homes could save US consumers $15.3 billion annually while moving the US closer to climate change goals. Incentive programs that updated the 20% of homes with the highest cooling usage would eliminate 115 billion kWh of electricity usage annually. By comparison, in 2019, the US generated 107 billion kWh from solar and 300 billion kWh from wind.Sense CEO Mike Phillips said:Focusing on home upgrades and weatherization is a smart move because it can lead to significant impacts on climate change goals.

What’s changing is that we now have smart home data that can guide policymakers and utilities to get the biggest impact from their clean energy programs.Sense’s study used anonymized data to analyze electricity use for air conditioners in nearly 15,000 homes across the US. Sense is working closely with Schneider Electric and Landis+Gyr to digitize electricity in the home.Kevin Self, senior vice president strategy, business development & government affairs at Schneider Electric, said:Energy efficiency remains the first, best tool to use when driving residential energy optimization.  And as our world becomes more digitized and connected, solutions like Sense provide us real time and actionable information that we as homeowners can use to reduce our energy spend and ultimately our carbon footprint.",solar

For example, if a building is getting too hot or too cold, the Smart Motor System can slow the speed of the motor, lowering the output of conditioned air and eliminating excess energy waste and cost. Turntide’s technology integrates software that allows for Internet of Things control system capabilities and data collection delivering ongoing value over time, monitoring for degradation, temperature, and speed. The motor is a “drop-in” solution.Turntide’s Smart Motor Systems are being manufactured, shipped, and installed at scale across the US, Canada, and the UK, with further international expansion planned in 2021. It has pilots in the Middle East, Asia, and Mexico.Nest founder and Future Shape principal, who also invests in Turntide, among others, said:Turntide delivers electrical motors that are 25% more efficient. That changes the $100 billionmotor industry. And, it will change the future of our climate. You can learn more about Turntide’s smart motor in the video below:Turntide chairman and CEO Ryan Morris said:As the world warms and more fossil-fuel powered machines switch to electricity, the demand for electricity will only continue to grow. There is no path to 100% renewable energy sources without drastically reducing the amount of energy that we use.With the support of our global coalition of investors, we are able to continue the Smart Motor System’s market expansion.

2020/09/30,"British-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is to cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs as a result of the pandemic and a slump in demand for oil. 1,500 of those job cuts will be a result of voluntary redundancy. Shell employs 83,000 people worldwide.At the end of April, Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II. Its first-quarter net income fell 46% to $2.9 billion, and second-quarter income fell 82% to $638 million. Shell expects third-quarter earnings to be “at the lower end of the $800 million to $875 million range,” according to the BBC.On April 16, as Electrek reported, Shell announced that it intends to reach net zero by 2050 or sooner by selling more green energy to reduce its carbon emissions. It plans to offset CO2 emissions from its own oil and gas production by 2050. Those emissions do not include the bigger category of greenhouse gases emitted from its products such as gasoline and jet fuel. The plan includes an interim target to cut those emissions by more than 33% by 2030, up from 20% previously.Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the company has to change the type of products it sells:[Shell has to be] a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organization that is more nimble and able to respond to customers.We will have some oil and gas in the mix of energy we sell by 2050, but it will be predominantly low-carbon electricity, low-carbon biofuels, it will be hydrogen, and it will be all sorts of other solutions too.Yesterday, Shell announced plans to tap hydrogen fuel cells and liquified natural gas to wean its shipping business off heavy fuel oil.Turntide Technologies, which manufactures the Smart Motor System, a sustainable electric motor with digital DNA, announced a recently completed $33 million funding round with support from the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund.Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, which was announced in June 2020 and has an initial $2 billion in funding, “will invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.”Turntide’s Smart Motor System’s digital motor is software-driven, intelligent, and sustainable.

And even better, this could possibly eliminate the need for fossil-fuel-powered generators, which often causes fatalities due to carbon monoxide poisoning. As NPR reported on September 1, “More deaths associated with Hurricane Laura were caused by the improper use of portable generators than the storm itself.”",solar
2020/09/29,"New Jersey has banned plastic bags and utensils, polystyrene foam containers… and even paper bags. And truth be told, it could afford to be even stricter.Were you impressed by Maryland’s announcement that it was to become the first state to ban polystyrene foam containers as of October 1? New Jersey’s response: Maryland, hold my beer.Last week, the Garden State’s state legislature voted to ban both plastic and paper single-use bags, and polystyrene foam food containers, plates, cups, and utensils. It’s the most wide-ranging ban on plastic products and paper bags in the US.The ban would begin 18 months after the bill goes into effect, and Governor Philip Murphy is expected to sign the bill. Businesses that violate the bill would get a warning on first offense, a fine up to $1,000 for a second offense, and a fine of up to $5,000 for a third or subsequent offense.And it’s probably not a shock to hear that polystyrene, plastic, and paper bag manufacturers aren’t jumping up and down with glee.If you think New Jersey is being draconian, note that there are exemptions. The New Jersey Herald breaks down the details of what’s still going to be allowed, and it really gets you thinking:Looking at the above exemption list, some make sense and others don’t. (If you’re going to buy a goldfish, I guess you could bring your own goldfish bowl to fetch “Cleo”? … Hmmm.) Fruit and vegetables can be put into reusable mesh bags — they’re cheap, easy to purchase, and no harder to remember to take to the store than your bigger grocery bags. There are reusable straws.As Electrek stated yesterday, cardboard and paper products are viable alternatives for food containers and break down within weeks to months. The paper bag ban pushes people to use reusable bags made out of sustainable materials, so it takes it further. (It’s not hard. I’ve done it for years. And the pandemic argument doesn’t fly: Just clean your bags.)Linda Doherty, president of the New Jersey Food Council, said:Without a [paper bag] ban, consumers will simply move to paper single-use bags and we will not address the underlying goal of reducing our reliance on single-use products.But there are still a lot of kinks that we as a world need to work out in order to find fully comprehensive viable alternatives for plastic. New Jersey — or heck, anyone — should run an innovation contest for sustainable replacements for more challenging plastic things like newspaper bags and supermarket meat trays. (If you’ve got ideas for alternatives to the above exceptions list, we’ve love to hear about them in the comments section.)Plastic was invented in 1907, and in 1937, the Dow Chemical Company introduced polystyrene products to the US market. Maybe we need to re-examine history for ideas on how to wean off this convenient yet environmentally destructive material? People did survive without plastic for a lot longer than we’ve actually had it.Eight other states have bans that are either in effect or will soon be implemented on single-use plastic bags. Here’s a reminder of why this is so important, and even the trailblazer state can improve — and hopefully others will quickly follow. (I’m looking at you, peninsula, water-surrounded Florida, with your ridiculous and irresponsible ban of local governments’ attempts at banning plastic bags.) The New Jersey Herald writes:More than 80% of litter picked up at annual beach cleanups from Cape May to Sandy Hook by volunteers for Clean Ocean Action has been plastic in recent years.A 2016 report by NY/NJ Baykeeper estimated that there were almost 166 million pieces of microscopic plastic floating in the waterways of New Jersey and New York.Scientists have found microplastics in some of the most pristine rivers and creeks, including the upper Raritan and Passaic rivers.That’s why.",solar

The plan sees a gradual transition over the next 15 years, and then a rapid acceleration after 2035.It increases green and nuclear energy and phases out coal by 2050. China would need to boost its share of non-fossil fuel energy to 20% by 2025, five years earlier than originally planned.The share of non-fossil fuels in total energy demand will grow from around 15% in 2019 to 20% by 2025, 24% in 2030, 62% in 2050, and 84% in 2060, Bloomberg reports. Solar would see a positive percentage change of 587% by 2060, nuclear 382%, and wind 346%.Power generation would nearly double from 2025 to about 16.4 terrawatt-hours in 2060, with electricity making up 80% of total energy consumption by 2060. Wind, solar, and nuclear power will have to be boosted to offset the decline of dirty power as total electricity demand keeps increasing.China is the world’s largest green energy and electric vehicle market.Were you impressed by Maryland’s announcement that it was to become the first state to ban disposable foam containers as of October 1? New Jersey’s response: Maryland, hold my beer.Last week, the state’s legislature voted to ban both plastic and paper single-use bags, and disposable polystyrene foam food containers and cups. That makes the Garden State one of the strictest in the US when it comes to dealing with plastic and packaging.The ban would begin 18 months after the bill goes into effect, and Governor Philip Murphy is expected to sign the bill.So what are shoppers supposed to use?

The leaders describe the pledge as a ‘turning point’ by which future generations will judge their willingness to act on environmental destruction.All signatories to the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, launched virtually in New York, have committed to putting wildlife and the climate at the heart of post-pandemic economic recovery plans, promising to address the climate crisis, deforestation, ecosystem degradation, and pollution.The announcement comes ahead of a major UN biodiversity summit, which will be virtual from New York, on Wednesday.BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin writes:World leaders have often come together to strike deals over climate change, but a top-level commitment on nature is much more rare.Environmentalists are delighted — they say nature is in freefall and urgently needs protection as roads, railways, housing, and farmland cover the Earth.The presidents of the US, Brazil, China, and Australia have not signed the pledge.Maryland will become the first US state to ban the use of foam containers for take-out as of October 1. The change is biggest for restaurants and schools. The original ban date was July 1 but it was pushed back to the fall due to the pandemic. If restaurants violate the ban, they will face a $250 fine.Foam products cannot be recycled. Sciencing explains why the petroleum-based material is so bad for the environment:Styrofoam, a brand name for polystyrene foam, takes a hefty toll on the environment. Styrofoam is commonly used in disposable products that are only used once. These products can persist in the environment for more than a million years, however, since polystyrene is not biodegradable. Though it is slow to break down chemically, Styrofoam does however fragment into small pieces, choking animals that ingest it, clogging their digestive systems. Styrofoam and other plastics currently make up about 30 percent of the landfill volume in the United States.The ban includes items such as plates, cups, containers, and trays, and while some Maryland counties already have foam bans in place, this now makes it statewide. Cardboard and paper products are viable alternatives and break down within weeks to months.",solar

2020/09/24,"Major banks have continued to pour money into fracking companies in recent years despite numerous warnings that the sector is financially unsustainable — on top of the environmental, health, and climate impacts of the dirty industry, according to a new report by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and Oil Change International.The study reveals that Wells Fargo is the biggest banker of US frackers since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2016, and JPMorgan Chase comes in a close second. Together, they provide almost 40% of financing.The 51 US fracking-focused companies analyzed in this report received $224 billion in financing since the Paris Agreement was adopted, and US banks dominated. Combined with Citi and Bank of America, these four major Wall Street banks provided over half of financing for US fracking-focused companies since 2016. The fracking industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with dozens of bankruptcies so far this year, but its troubles long predate COVID. The fracking companies analyzed have $120 billion in debt set to mature from 2021 to 2025, much of which now seems unlikely to ever be repaid. In fact, 72% of the bonds issued by these companies were rated non-investment grade when brought to market, compared to only 17% of US bonds issued economy-wide.Karen Feridun, founder of Berks Gas Truth, a grassroots citizens’ group fighting to bring an end to unconventional natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania, said:Continuing to prop up an industry that was failing even before the pandemic hit means more devastation that will be on the backs of Pennsylvanians to clean up.IBM Research has announced its annual 5 in 5: Five ways technology will change our lives within five years. This year’s futurist list focused on the question, “How can we use technology to reinvent materials design and discovery to find more sustainable solutions to everyday problems?”This year’s IBM 5 in 5, timed to coincide with the first-ever virtual UN General Assembly, showcases the ways IBM’s research community is applying technologies like AI, quantum and high-performance computing to scale scientific thinking and accelerate discovery to find more sustainable solutions to these challenges. IBM identified the following five core areas in the next five years:Accelerating discovery to capture and transform CO2’s harmful emissions to mitigate climate change, rethinking batteries and energy storage, finding more sustainable ways to grow crops to feed our surging population, and develop new materials that will help create better antivirals and more sustainable electronic devices.This year’s 5 in 5 supports a larger IBM initiative that launched today around the Urgency of Science, about the critical need to implement scientific thinking at all scales.

When Bulb started, 1% of the UK energy market was renewable. That figure is now 10%.With its entry into the Texas market, Bulb aims to make energy simpler for Texans with lower and fairer prices, transparency, and excellent service.Texas is one of the most complex energy markets in the country. Some providers offer as many as 30 different plans. One result of this is that 1 in 5 Texas households switch their energy provider each year. Bulb will provide one plan. It will also add 25 new Texas jobs by 2022.Hayden Wood, cofounder and CEO of Bulb, said:Texas has always been an energy leader. Now it’s becoming the model for renewable energy, as the country’s top producer of wind energy and a growing solar hub. However, Texan households have not been guaranteed affordable green energy and great service. That’s why we’re looking forward to learning from and supporting people here while providing them with 100% homegrown renewable energy at better prices.Photo: Les Stone/Reuters",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/09/21,"General Electric Co (GE.N), one of the world’s largest makers of coal-fired power plants, said today it will stop making new coal-fired power plants. The US industrial conglomerate will shift its focus to green energy. GE said the exit from the coal business could include divestitures, site closures, and layoffs.CNN Business points out that this decision is a huge pivot for the company:The move marks a dramatic reversal for GE. Just five years ago, the company doubled down on coal by acquiring Alstom’s power business, which makes coal-fueled turbines.That $9.5 billion deal, GE’s biggest-ever industrial purchase, proved to be a disaster because coal has been crushed by the rise of natural gas and a shift toward solar, wind and renewable energy. Since then, GE has laid off thousands of power workers, slashed its dividend to a penny, fired two CEOs, and sharply written down the value of its power business.However, GE will continue to service existing coal power plants, and it’s still in the natural gas business.GE Power CEO Russell Stokes said:With the continued transformation of GE, we are focused on power generation businesses that have attractive economics and a growth trajectory.Airbus has today revealed three concepts for the world’s first emissions-free commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035. Each concept explores different technology pathways and aerodynamic configurations to achieve net zero — and all use hydrogen.The three concepts are all codenamed “ZEROe.” The three concepts are:Upper left in photo: A turbofan design (120-200 passengers) with a range of 2,000+ nautical miles, capable of operating transcontinentally and powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen, rather than jet fuel, through combustion. The liquid hydrogen will be stored and distributed via tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead. Bottom center in photo: A turboprop design (up to 100 passengers) using a turboprop engine instead of a turbofan and also powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines, which would be capable of traveling more than 1,000 nautical miles, making it a perfect option for short-haul trips.Upper right in photo: A “blended-wing body” design (up to 200 passengers) concept in which the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft with a range similar to that of the turbofan concept. The exceptionally wide fuselage opens up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution, and for cabin layout. Airports would require significant hydrogen transport and refueling infrastructure to meet the needs of day-to-day operations. Support from governments would be required to meet these ambitious objectives.The wealthiest 1% of the world’s population is responsible for more than twice as much pollution between 1990 and 2015 as the 3.1 billion people who made up the poorest half of humanity. Those 25 years is when humanity doubled the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Over one-third of the emissions of the richest 1% — people with net income over $109,000 — are linked to Americans, with the next biggest contributions coming from citizens of the Middle East and China. This is according to a new report from Oxfam, called “Confronting Carbon Inequality: Putting climate justice at the heart of the COVID-19 recovery.” The report found:The richest 10% accounted for over half (52%) of the emissions added to the atmosphere between 1990 and 2015. The richest 1% were responsible for 15% of emissions during this time — more than all the citizens of the EU and more than twice that of the poorest half of humanity (7%).During this time, the richest 10% blew one-third of our remaining global 1.5C carbon budget, compared to just 4% for the poorest half of the population. The carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide that can be added to the atmosphere without causing global temperatures to rise above 1.5C — the goal set by governments in the Paris Agreement to avoid the very worst impacts of uncontrolled climate change.Tim Gore, head of climate policy at Oxfam and author of the report, said:The overconsumption of a wealthy minority is fueling the climate crisis, yet it is poor communities and young people who are paying the price. Such extreme carbon inequality is a direct consequence of our governments’ decades-long pursuit of grossly unequal and carbon intensive economic growth.The report estimates that the per capita emissions of the richest 10% will need to be around 10 times lower by 2030 to keep the world on track for just 1.5C of warming. This is equivalent to cutting global annual emissions by a third.Photo: Airbus",solar

2020/09/18,"The UK’s Labour Party has called for the Conservative Party-led government to bring forward the phasing out of ICE cars from 2035 to 2030. Labour wants to ensure the country meets its Paris Agreement targets and also more rapidly reduce air pollution.The government originally banned the sale of new ICE cars from 2040. In February, Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved the ban forward to 2035. A large number of Conservative members of Parliament support the Labour Party’s call for a quicker move to electric vehicles.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said:Hats off to Labour for backing a 2030 ban for all new petrol, diesel, and hybrid cars and vans.They have joined the chorus of businesses and councils that have also been calling for a more ambitious phase-out date and policies to support workers to transition, in order to dramatically reduce emissions and help secure a future for the UK automotive industry.Now that Labour and over 100 Conservative MPs have thrown down the gauntlet, will the government live up to their claims of being a world leader on climate, and back a 2030 ban too?Microsoft put a shipping container-sized data center on the sea floor off the coast of Scotland’s Orkney Islands. It’s known as Project Natick, a two-year pilot program, reports the World Economic Forum. The tech giant wanted to see whether it could reduce energy consumption and costs of data centers. It can cost around $4 million a year to power a large data center’s servers and cooling systems. Energy makes up around 60% of the operating costs.The Orkneys are powered by 100% wind and solar, and the renewables easily met the power needs of the submerged data center.Microsoft pulled the data center up out of the water at the beginning of the summer and spent the last couple months studying it to see if it worked.The data center operated with better power efficiency due to the lack of a need for artificial cooling — the cold water took care of that. In fact, the data center worked so well that the servers proved to be up to eight times more reliable than their land-based counterparts.Microsoft hopes that it can increasingly use “submarine servers” to provide fast cloud services to coastal users. Nearly 40% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of the coast.Scottish Power’s wind and solar farms will help produce green hydrogen to run buses, ferries, and trains.ScottishPower Renewables, ITM Power, which manufactures integrated hydrogen energy equipment, and BOC, which specializes in compressing and distributing gases and will help transport the hydrogen gas to councils, will create the facilities needed for vehicles to be fueled by hydrogen. The three companies seek to create an end-to-end solution.The Construction Index explains how they’ll work together:The partnership’s first project is ‘Green Hydrogen for Glasgow.’ A proposed green hydrogen production facility located on the outskirts of the city would be operated by BOC, using wind and solar power produced by ScottishPower Renewables to operate a 10MW electrolyzer, delivered by ITM Power.  The project aims to supply hydrogen to the commercial market within the next two years.The plans are expected to be replicated across the country. Lindsay McQuade, the head of renewables at Scottish Power, said:Our revolutionary approach — which really will be a game-changer — fully supports the large-scale transformation needed to replace heavy diesel vehicles with cleaner, greener alternatives.",solar
2020/09/17,"The first hydrogen-powered dual-fuel engine with a capacity of 1 megawatt has been launched by BeHydro, a joint venture between Belgian-based ABC and CMB.Engine builder ABC and container shipping line CMB’s BeHydro engine runs on a much higher proportion of hydrogen than previously achieved: Up to 85%, with the rest standard Marine Gasoil. Larger engines of up to 10 MW can also be produced.This opens up a faster and cheaper decarbonization pathway for the shipping sector and dovetails with the EU (and impending UK) Green Deal strategy that prioritizes green hydrogen. Green hydrogen is achieved when an electrolyzer, which uses electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen, is powered by green energy such as wind or solar instead of fossil fuels.The European Parliament this week voted in favor of including international shipping in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This would apply a carbon price (currently around €25-30 per tonne of carbon dioxide) on all ship voyages via EU ports, from 2022. Part of that revenue will go into a fund to incentivize the uptake of fuels like green hydrogen.In its first phase, 100 hydrogen-powered engines can be produced annually. And even better, BeHydro is developing a fully hydrogen engine that will be ready by the second quarter of 2021.Tim Berckmoes, CEO of ABC, said:BeHydro has already received its first order for 2 x 2 MW dual-fuel engines that will be installed on board the HydroTug. This vessel is the very first hydrogen tugboat in the world, and will be deployed by the Port of Antwerp.A 1 MW BeHydro hydrogen-powered motor can supply green electricity to 3,000 families in Belgium. It reduces CO2 emissions by 3,500 tons per year. It can also be used to convert 13,600 diesel locomotives in Europe to hydrogen. It can produce as much energy as one wind turbine of 3 MW or 36,000 solar panels.The shipping industry now has to step up to the emissions-reduction plate in Europe, and it helps to give it the tools to do so. The buried lede in this story is that BeHydro is developing that fully hydrogen engine that will be ready next year.All sources of green energy have their supporters and detractors, but every innovative step to reducing emissions in power generation is worth celebrating.",solar

What innovation have you brought with you to the more traditional geothermal heating and cooling industry from your previous experiences?Kathy Hannun: Geothermal had different categories of innovation that it needed in order to push the industry forward: business model, financing, and technology.Typically, this industry operates with really small contractors who install a small number of custom systems. That makes things very expensive. So, the fact that [Dandelion] really focuses only on geothermal gives us a lot of cost advantage we can pass on to the customer.We allow our homeowners to pay for the system upfront or with a loan that lasts for the lifetime of the system. It’s affordable and practical for a mainstream audience. There is opportunity, though, for further innovation.The mission of the company is to figure out a solution so that there are no more barriers for people to switch [to geothermal].One of the big shifts in selling to a mainstream audience is that they have to be less expensive than the alternative. We have to do everything we can to make the economics work well for the homeowner. (To learn more about whether Dandelion works for you, click here.)SW: Dandelion moved into Connecticut after working in New York State. What made you go to Connecticut, and what are the incentives and the mix of fossil fuel energies they’re using?KH: Connecticut was a very natural place for first expansion because it borders New York. So it was very easy to send our drilling crews right across the border. And there are similar incentives. In the near term, we’ll continue to expand according to those sorts of criteria.Con Edison is partnered with Dandelion [in New York] and really promoted geothermal heat pumps to their natural gas customers because their natural gas system is constrained. So they provided incentives [for geothermal]. But I think if gas wasn’t constrained, then a gas company might see us as a competitor.We’re seeing a policy movement against expansion of natural gas in the Northeast, because a lot of towns don’t want to continue to invest in that fossil infrastructure. And so it does present an opportunity for us.Michelle Lewis: Could you possibly go to hot states for cooling?Nevada, for example — not the first place you think of for geothermal, it’s very water constrained.So they use a lot of cooling towers for their air conditioning, which evaporate water. But if you use geothermal, you would save a lot of water.Seth Weintraub: You recently moved into the role of president from CEO. Has that allowed you to change your work?KH: Dandelion is an operationally intensive business because we have many people selling many geothermal systems to many homes. I am a very product-focused person.So I decided to hire Michael [Sachse] to become CEO so I could spend my time pushing our product and technology forward and looking at how to make geothermal increasingly cost-effective and mainstream. And I get to focus on that all the time now, which has been a really great change for me.The transition that COVID has really started in the business world in general of making remote, distributed work more mainstream is very convenient for Dandelion, as we were going to have to figure out all those problems anyway.SW: [Dandelion’s] model is a little like Solar City, which is now Tesla. Can you talk about the similarities in the way that you work? Tesla sells the solar battery system, and those kinds of people are probably good customers for geothermal solutions as well.KH: Solar and [geothermal] are perfectly complementary products.Your solar system makes your home electricity use renewable, and for many homes, especially in the Northeast, you don’t use electricity today to heat; you use a fuel like oil. By converting to geothermal, they’re able to use solar to run their geothermal heat pump.So, I think we’ll see more solar systems working in tandem. And we as a company have relationships with solar companies, as early adopters for geothermal are already interested in solar and vice versa. And in future, there will be increasing coordination between those systems.SW: You’re drilling a little bit differently than other geothermal companies. You go straight down. Why do you do that?KH: You’re right, there are different ways to install the ground heat exchanger, also called the ground loop. And a lot of companies do it by excavating a large area, like for a [swimming] pool, for example. The reason we’ve standardized a vertical six-inch-diameter borehole is because many homes don’t have space for the horizontal pipe. And a lot of homeowners don’t really want their entire yard excavated.It’s helpful to innovate on geothermal technology as a venture-backed startup with more resources. We prototyped and tested three different drilling approaches, and that’s just one example. It would have been very difficult outside of a place like Alphabet, where the resources exist purely for innovation.ML: How long is a geothermal system’s lifespan? And what would customers expect to change when they switch from oil to geothermal?KH: The heat pump in the house lasts about 20 to 25 years. The ground loop lasts essentially forever. So once you get the ground dug, that house will never have to use oil again. The cost of replacing the heat pump is like replacing a central air conditioner.You have one heat pump that can run in one direction for heating and then the internal circuits reverse and it cools. So you don’t need a separate furnace or compressor outside your house. It’s quieter. A heat pump operates steadily and maintains it at the temperature you want. And because it’s not heating that air as high as a furnace does, the air doesn’t lose all of its moisture. You also have no combustion particulates so you don’t even need a carbon monoxide detector anymore. There’s no chance that you can accidentally poison yourself with a heat pump.SW: I’m adamant about getting off fuel oil. What should homeowners like me expect when we contact Dandelion?KH: Over time, Dandelion will increase the types of homes [we work with]. The reason that we’ve narrowed it to homes with existing ductwork throughout the house today is those are the simplest homes to serve with our product line. And so we’re really working on making the experience of those homes perfectly seamless so that we can have a very skilled solution.When you have a product that you want to scale, it’s important that that product can be the same for many customers. But our mission is to decarbonize heating. We want to be able to serve all the homeowners that want to switch off of fossil fuels.[It should be noted that Seth Weintraub’s New York home was eventually turned down by Dandelion.] ML: What are the misconceptions about geothermal that you want to dispel?KH: For example, the fear that it’s not going to heat someone’s house warmly enough or cool it enough. We’re lucky to have a large-enough customer base that can talk to prospective customers about the fact that it’s actually more comfortable than their system was before.When people hear geothermal, sometimes they think, are we going down to the Earth’s core? And so we often have to explain, the sun shines on the earth every day and a lot of that heat hangs out in the shallow underground. And we’re collecting and concentrating that heat so that homeowners can use that to heat.We ask homeowners at the beginning what temperatures they like their house to be. We just need to make sure that we put the right size unit in to accomplish that.On a 95F day, it’ll still be 50F in the ground because the ground always stays at around 50 degrees in New York. It’s much more efficient to reject heat from the house into the ground than it is into the 95 degree air. Anything you can do with an air conditioner and cooling, you should be able to do much better with the geothermal system.SW: Where does Dandelion ultimately want to get to?KH: I would like to use Dandelion as a force to decarbonize. It’s going to be a very important thing to do if we’re going to be able to limit climate change. So I want Dandelion to put in heat pumps at as rapid a pace as they can, and also invest in moving the technology forward.And it’s already the most cost-effective option to switch to renewable heating, and that has been hugely gratifying to see for me. How rapidly that adoption happens will be a function of the decisions that policymakers make. We don’t have the benefit of time.Bonus question! SW: Is there a way to supercharge your growth?We will be looking for capital to supercharge our growth. We have figured out our business model. We’re coming up to a really exciting time.There are lots of investors that are looking at ways to get a return while still making progress on the climate problem. It’s not just because they know it’s the right thing to do ethically, but because they know it’s a smart thing to do financially.All of our investors to date have been venture investors without a specific focus on the environment. But they were really interested because they see that the potential economically.If you can align the economic incentive with the environmental incentives, you have the opportunity for massive impact. That’s really what attracted me to geothermal heat pumps to begin with. My job [with Alphabet] was to look for opportunities to create businesses that would have a positive impact.And if it felt like a pretty uncommonly good opportunity to align everyone’s incentives, which is why I ended up pursuing it. I studied civil engineering and computer science. Never thought that I would have a career that combines those two things. But it worked out.Thank you to Kathy Hunnan for talking with us.

2020/09/17,"Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is entering into phase five — the final phase of its expansion. It’s the world’s largest single-site solar farm.Nextracker, which provides smart solar PV systems technology, and Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group, a large integrated equipment manufacturing group, will be working together to complete this phase.Financed for USD $564 million, the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) is currently entering phase five through ACWA Power. The solar park, which is 31 miles (50 km) south of Dubai, has a planned production capacity of 1 gigawatt for phase five and 5 gigawatts in total. It was commissioned in 2013 and is expected to be completed next year.Dan Shugar, Nextracker CEO, said at the signing ceremony today:This is an important project for all companies, to help accelerate lower-cost renewable power for all communities. My children are concerned for their children with devastating pollution caused by recent California fires — I am also personally dedicated to this work to provide solar power at affordable cost to all consumers.The park is the centerpiece of Dubai’s Clean Energy Strategy.BeHydro, a joint venture between Belgian-based ABC and CMB, has launched the first hydrogen-powered dual-fuel engine with a capacity of 1 megawatt. Engine builder ABC and container shipping line CMB’s  engine runs on a much higher proportion of hydrogen than previously achieved: Up to 85%, with the rest standard Marine Gasoil. Larger engines of up to 10 MW can also be produced.This opens up a faster and cheaper decarbonization pathway for the shipping sector and dovetails with the EU (and impending UK) Green Deal strategy that prioritizes green hydrogen.Green hydrogen is achieved when an electrolyzer, which uses electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen, is powered by green energy such as wind or solar instead of fossil fuels.The European Parliament this week voted in favor of including international shipping in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This would apply a carbon price (currently around €25-30 per tonne of carbon dioxide) on all ship voyages via EU ports, from 2022. Part of that revenue will go into a fund to incentivize the uptake of fuels like green hydrogen.Tim Berckmoes, CEO of ABC, said:BeHydro has already received its first order for 2 x 2 MW dual-fuel engines that will be installed on board the HydroTug. This vessel is the very first hydrogen tugboat in the world, and will be deployed by the Port of Antwerp.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has called for the EU to cut emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 in her State of the Union report. She pledged to use green bonds to finance its climate goals.Von der Leyen said ambitious action on climate could create millions of jobs and aid Europe’s recovery from the pandemic.Reuters reports:The EU’s current 2030 emissions target is for a 40% cut. Experts say a 55% cut is the minimum effort needed by 2030 to put the EU on track for its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050.Von der Leyen knew her call would not be universally celebrated. She said:I recognize that this increase from 40 to 55 is too much for some, and not enough for others.Poland, which is the only EU country to not have yet pledged to achieve net zero by 2050, complained that the EC had not delivered a plan for the new target. But the commission will publish analysis today on the steps needed to deliver the goal. It will include huge investments in transport and energy.",solar
2020/09/16,"Net metering allows residential and commercial customers who generate their own electricity from solar power to sell the electricity they aren’t using back into the grid. That saves money on electric bills. But electric companies perceive that they make less money as a result, and they’re not so keen on that. So in Florida, utilities want to roll net metering back — and there’s a hearing about it tomorrow.Right now, Florida is one of 47 states that has a net metering policy that allows solar homeowners to receive a credit for electricity sent back to the grid. Florida’s policy was initiated by an executive order in 2007 under Governor Charlie Crist and was memorialized in a 2019 Florida statute. The law states:It is in the public interest to promote the development of renewable energy resources in the state … and innovative technologies.As the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy explains:Rooftop solar power provides benefits to the utility’s system that can lower power bills for everyone, such as reducing the fuel burned by the utility to generate its own power and transmission and distribution (grid) benefits. Plus it drives economic development and jobs while making our communities cleaner and more resilient to weather events.In 2016, Florida voters rejected Amendment 1, a utility-backed measure to limit rooftop solar expansion. But big utilities using fossil fuels in Florida are still pushing back, despite the No vote in 2016. Florida utilities think they and their shareholders are losing out on profit to net metering from solar. In January, according to Mike Morina, the executive director of the Florida Home Partnership, writing in the Tampa Bay Times yesterday, a utility front group called Energy Fairness issued a report claiming that net metering is unfair to ratepayers. Morina writes:Florida has room for growth on solar; there are fewer than 60,000 net-metered systems in the state. As solar grows, it helps avoid the need to build expensive power plants, making it a win-win for everyone.But tomorrow, the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) — the utilities regulation agency — will hold a workshop to review the status of the state’s net metering rule, which could lead to establishing a rule-making docket in order to rewrite the rule. If the rule was rewritten, it could severely hinder rooftop solar development in one of the sunniest states in the US. It would only take three of the five PSC commissioners to make that negative change happen.“I don’t live in Florida. Why should I care?” you might be thinking. A couple reasons: One, Florida has a population of 21.48 million. That’s a lot of people — and a lot of energy consumption and emissions. And that affects not only every American but the entire world. (Florida may be a peninsula, but none of us are an island.) So while I do happen to live in Florida, I’d still be just as concerned about this potential rollback if I lived anywhere else in the world — and I’ve lived a lot of places.It’s the Sunshine State, for heaven’s sake — it’s currently ranked third among states for producing electricity from solar — and it should be doing everything it can to promote further adoption of solar.Two, all states should be actively promoting the switch to clean energy. For example, Virginia is requiring its utilities to adopt green energy and holding them accountable with landmark legislation that passed in March. Dominion Energy Virginia must be 100% carbon-free by 2045, and Appalachian Power must be 100% carbon-free by 2050. If you live in Florida, you should fight this whether you have solar or not. Because eventually, you will, either on your household or through community solar. Fossil fuels are bad for your health, and we don’t need any more respiratory health challenges in a pandemic. You can watch the PSC workshop on net metering starting at 9:15 a.m. ET on the PSC website here tomorrow, September 17.

2020/09/16,"Danish toy giant LEGO announced yesterday that it would start to use recyclable paper bags instead of plastic bags in its toy sets. The bags are used to hold loose LEGO bricks. The company intends to completely phase out plastic bags in the next five years as part of Lego a $400 million sustainability initiative it announced yesterday.Why this decision? Because children asked LEGO to switch to paper in letters. LEGO CEO Niels B. Christiansen said:We have been exploring alternatives for some time and the passion and ideas from children inspired us to begin to make the change.And to state the obvious, LEGO bricks are still made of plastic, but it’s working on trying to create bio-bricks out of sugarcane. About 2% of its pieces, such as LEGO trees and bushes, are currently made of sugarcane. LEGO’s target is to make all of its products from sustainable materials by 2030. It currently encourages people to donate their used Lego bricks for reuse or recycling. LEGO sources 100% green energy across the group.EV silicon lithium-ion battery technology company Enevate has reached a milestone of more than 300 patents issued and in process. It has more than double the number of battery technology patent families compared to its competitor with the second-largest portfolio. Enevate now has patents in jurisdictions covering over 95% of EV sales globally.Enevate, which was founded in 2005 at the University of California, licenses intellectual property and transfers technology to EV automotive and battery makers worldwide. It’s currently working with multiple auto and EV battery manufacturers to commercialize its technologies.Earlier in 2020, the company announced its fourth-generation XFC-Energy technology that provides a path to produce extreme fast-charge EV batteries at low cost and high-volume production.Enevate founder and chief technology officer Dr. Benjamin Park said:Our patent portfolio represents continuing innovations by our scientists and engineers to develop cutting edge, cost effective EV silicon-dominant Li-ion battery technology in support of the growing global EV industry.In November 2018, Electrek reported that the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance invested in Enevate.The 175-year-old magazine Scientific American has never before backed any US presidential candidate. But, in the editors’ own words, “This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly.” The magazine has published an editorial in which it endorses Democratic candidate Joe Biden. You can read the full op-ed if you click the link, but here is an excerpt that explains why the magazine staff made the unprecedented decision to endorse a candidate for the very first time in nearly two centuries:The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the US and its people — because he rejects evidence and science.Trump also keeps pushing to eliminate health rules from the Environmental Protection Agency, putting people at more risk for heart and lung disease caused by pollution. He has replaced scientists on agency advisory boards with industry representatives. In his ongoing denial of reality, Trump has hobbled US preparations for climate change, falsely claiming that it does not exist and pulling out of international agreements to mitigate it. The changing climate is already causing a rise in heat-related deaths and an increase in severe storms, wildfires, and extreme flooding.On the environment and climate change, [Joe] Biden wants to spend $2 trillion on an emissions-free power sector by 2035, build energy-efficient structures and vehicles, push solar and wind power, establish research agencies to develop safe nuclear power and carbon capture technologies, and more. The investment will produce 2 million jobs for US workers, his campaign claims, and the climate plan will be partly paid by eliminating Trump’s corporate tax cuts. Historically disadvantaged communities in the US will receive 40% of these energy and infrastructure benefits.It is not certain how many of these and his other ambitions Biden will be able to accomplish; much depends on laws to be written and passed by Congress. But he is acutely aware that we must heed the abundant research showing ways to recover from our present crises and successfully cope with future challenges.",solar
2020/09/15,"One in four cars produced in Europe will be fully electric by 2025, according to a study by Germany’s automotive research center the Chemnitz Automotive Institute (CATI).European factories will produce more than 2 million electric cars within five years. More than half will be made in Germany, which leads Europe in auto manufacturing. EVs have reached almost 4% of new registrations in Germany. The German government hopes to get 10 million EVs on the road by 2030, despite pandemic setbacks.The CATI report states:We currently see a scale-up of e-mobility, but this still happens with the brakes on. But this will be changing in the next two years.Democratic Europe reports:In 2019, about 276,500 [EVs] were produced at 17 locations in eight European countries, and the researchers say there will be a doubling of capacity by 2022 at 35 locations in 11 countries. By 2025, Germany alone will produce about 1.1 million [EVs] per year.The UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Environment (APPG) has announced today that it is making the Green Alliance its secretariat.The Green Alliance, which was founded in 1979, is an independent think tank and charity that has a strong, wide network with NGOs, businesses, and politicians. It founded the Greener UK coalition in 2016 to defend and strengthen environmental protections as the UK renegotiates its relationship with the EU. The Green Alliance’s projects include research, advocacy, and events.The APPG will inform members of parliament from all parties and scrutinize environmental and energy legislation.Mark Carney, United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance (and former governor of the Bank of England), will address Parliament on the need for a green economic recovery in the aftermath of COVID-19 at a virtual event today. He is expected to discuss what global governments can do to ensure that the post-COVID economic recovery accelerates progress toward the Paris Agreement goals and what can be expected of the postponed COP26 climate summit that will take place in Glasgow in November 2021.Anthony Browne, MP, chair of the APPG for the environment, said:I am determined to raise the profile and understanding of environmental issues across the House of Commons and House of Lords, as well as more widely across government and policy-making circles. Relaunching the APPG, fueled by the impressive expertise of Green Alliance, is a key way of doing that.Their long history working with NGOs and legislators, as well as their politically neutral evidence-based approach, will be essential as we look to ensure environmental priorities are at the heart of government policy.The Scottish government will extend the Low Carbon Transport Loan to cover used EVs for the first time, starting on September 28. The extension will enable an individual or business to obtain a loan of up to £20,000, interest free, over five years.The loan is being expanded to help people who may otherwise be put off by the purchase price of electric vehicles.Delivered through the Energy Saving Trust, the loan will enable people and businesses to benefit from cheaper running costs compared with petrol and diesel vehicles while supporting Scotland’s net-zero target.To date, more than £85 million has been provided to help people make the switch to electric vehicles. Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said:The global shift toward electric vehicles means that prices are coming down year on year, but the price point for new vehicles remains high for many. We want to make it easier for people to switch by providing interest free finance options for used vehicles.No one who requires a vehicle should be left behind from the benefits these modern vehicles can bring, both in terms of running costs and the  environmental benefits.Support is also available through Energy Saving Trust for e-bikes including e-cargo bikes.",solar
2020/09/14,"BP stated in a forecast published today that oil may have reached its peak due to the pandemic and that renewables will take the place of fossil fuels.BP has released its 2020 Energy Outlook, which is remarkably different from its 2019 report, when BP’s base case only expected oil consumption to grow over the next decade, reaching a peak in the 2030s. The report looks at three scenarios to explore energy transition to 2050. BP writes that “the scenarios help to illustrate the range of outcomes possible over the next 30 years, ‎although the uncertainty is substantial and the scenarios do not provide a comprehensive ‎description of all possible outcomes.‎”BP’s three scenarios are Rapid Transition (carbon emissions from energy use to fall by around 70% by 2050), Net Zero (carbon emissions from energy use fall by ‎over 95% by 2050), and Business-as-usual (emissions in 2050 less than 10% below 2018 levels). But what unites all three scenarios is this:As a result of these policies and shifts in societal preferences, there is a decline in the share of ‎hydrocarbons (coal, oil, and natural gas) in the global energy system in all three scenarios. This is ‎matched by a corresponding increase in the role of renewable energy as the world increasingly ‎electrifies. The scale of this shift varies significantly across the three scenarios, with the share of ‎hydrocarbons in primary energy declining from around 85% in 2018 to between 70-20% by 2050 ‎and the share of renewable energy increasing to between 20-60%.‎In BP’s first two scenarios, COVID-19 accelerates the slowdown in oil consumption, leading to it peaking last year. In its Business-as-usual scenario, oil demand peaks by 2030.BP chief economist Spencer Dale said:[The energy transition] would be an unprecedented event. Never in modern history has the demand for any traded fuel declined in absolute terms.[Meanwhile,] the share of renewable energy grows more quickly than any fuel ever seen in history.Let’s just take a minute to fully absorb the enormity of this report: BP is a global oil giant. And it is stating that fossil fuels will be replaced by green energy such as wind, solar, and hydropower because oil has reached its peak as a result of the pandemic.So it’s no surprise, as Electrek reported September 11, that BP invested $1.1 billion in offshore wind in the US. It’s good environmental sense. It’s good business sense. BP isn’t being benevolent; it knows that’s where the market is going.BP also thinks that overall global economic activity will slow in the next 20 years. Why? The impact of climate change on the economy.We can only hope that the world unites to achieve the Net Zero scenario. If nothing else works, money will always talk.",solar

So that means Google won’t just offset; it’ll actually come up with tangible green energy solutions.As of today, Google is the 1st major company to eliminate our entire carbon legacy, including before we became carbon neutral in 2007. We’re also proud that by 2030, we aim to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy in our data centers & campuses worldwide. https://t.co/j9HlkWrB2XReuters reports:Wind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for 61% of Google’s global hourly electricity usage last year. The proportion varied by facility, with carbon-free sources fulfilling 96% of hourly power needs at Google’s wind-swept Oklahoma data center compared with 3% at its gas-reliant Singapore operation.Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions. It also said Monday that its estimated 1 million metric tons of emissions between 2006 and its 1998 launch now have been offset.For perspective, Google uses more power as a whole than all the households and businesses in the US state of Delaware — so this announcement is impactful good news.",solar
2020/09/11,"BP entered the US offshore wind market yesterday, in a big way. The oil giant made a $1.1 billion deal to buy 50% stakes in two US developments from Norway’s offshore wind company Equinor. The deal is expected to close in early 2021.The deal includes the Empire Wind project off New York (to go live in the mid-2020s) and Beacon Wind off Massachusetts. Together they could generate up to 4.4 GW, which is enough power for more than 2 million homes. Equinor will remain the operator of these projects. The turbines used at each site are each expected to have an installed capacity of more than 10 MW.BP and Equinor have also agreed to work together to develop further offshore wind projects in the US. BP already has an onshore wind business in the US, but this is their first foray into offshore wind.Reuters reports:The deal challenges any assumption that renewable projects can’t offer returns on the scale offered by oil and gas, and is likely to increase the market’s confidence in Equinor’s offshore wind business, Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nilsen said.BP “plans to give further details on how it plans to make the shift from ‘oil major’ to ‘energy company’ in a series of investor presentations scheduled for early next week,” according to the Guardian.Reversing an initial decision to let two Chinese firms explore for coal at its wildlife-rich Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe this week banned mining in all of its national parks. Hwange is home to more than 40,000 elephants and the endangered black rhino.The reversal was the result of campaigners taking the government to court to prevent “ecological degradation” in parks.The Zimbabwean government also announced a ban on mining along most river beds, which will affect small-scale Chinese and local gold miners.Shingai Nyoka of BBC News, Harare, commented on the decision:The decision is unlikely to affect relations between Zimbabwe and China. Both governments are acutely aware of the sensitivities around conservation and the outcry would not have surprised either.But for some Zimbabweans the ban does not go far enough. They point out that years of gold mining along rivers has caused environmental degradation. They, therefore, want the ban to be enshrined in law so that this does not happen again and the environment is protected.Montreal has the honor of hosting the world’s biggest rooftop greenhouse.

It has been the only country in the European Union to refuse to agree to reach net zero by 2050. It claimed it needed more time and money to make the shift. But its hand has been forced by the rising costs of emissions permits required by the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, the EU’s other increasingly ambitious climate policies, and the pandemic, which caused a fall in the use of power. Reuters reports:In an update of its energy strategy by 2040, the climate ministry said Poland plans to invest 150 billion zlotys ($40 billion) to build its first nuclear power plants, with 6-9 GW of capacity eventually. The first 1-1.6 GW facility would be up and running by 2033.It also plans to build 8-11 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2040 with investment estimated at 130 billion zlotys ($35 billion). The development of renewable and nuclear energy facilities will create 300,000 jobs, it said.The climate ministry said that coal’s share in electricity production will fall to 37%-56% in 2030 and to 11-28% in 2040, depending on the carbon emission costs.Compare this to November 2019, when Poland had expected the share of coal at 56%-60% in 2030 and at 28% in 2040.Here’s an interesting financial side effect of Poland’s pivot: When the Polish government made the coal phaseout announcement, utility shares jumped on the stock market.But Greenpeace has said its plan still isn’t good enough:The plan assumes maintaining a high share of coal-fired energy in energy production in 2030 and does not specify the date of Poland’s departure from coal.So perhaps, like the cost of emissions permits, the Polish government will be motivated by the stock market’s reaction to tighten up its plan even further and faster. And if that doesn’t work, then even more expensive emissions permits surely will.Photo: Andrzej Grygiel/EPA",solar
2020/09/10,"The number of connected charging points in Europe and North America is expected to reach 4.4 million in 2024, according to a new report from Swedish market research firm Berg Insight.The number of connected EV charging points in Europe and North America reached around 0.9 million units in 2019. Europe represents the largest share, with around 0.6 million. In North America, about 0.3 million of the total number of charging points were connected.Growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%, the number of connected charging points in the two regions is expected to reach 4.4 million in 2024.Adam Bjorkman, IoT analyst at Berg Insight, said:The number of connected charging points has in the last year grown significantly, and as long as the electric vehicle fleet continues to grow rapidly the demand for connected charging stations will be steady.The number of connected home charging stations is still relatively limited in both regions, but expected to increase in parallel to the general trend of our homes becoming smarter.Greece will stop the use of coal in power generation by 2028, and spend €5 billion ($5.9 billion) to offset the impact of that and cut carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement target of 2050.The Greek government has pledged to switch off 80% of state utility Public Power Corp’s (PPC) coal capacity by 2023 to reduce its carbon footprint.The spending will be funded by state money, EU funds, and European Investment Bank loans. Reuters reports:The funds will be spent on infrastructure projects, subsidies to new businesses, and training, to help western Macedonia and Megalopoli in Southern Peloponnese switch to green energy, agriculture, and tourism.Those regions are the main suppliers of the cheap and abundant lignite [brown coal] resources Greece has relied on for power generation for more than half a century.Around 16 expected private investments in green energy and related activities are expected to help create more than 8,000 jobs in western Macedonia and Megalopoli.PPC has already shut two coal units in Macedonia and will switch off the remaining 10 by 2023.The Polish government announced on Tuesday that it would be moving away from coal and toward green and nuclear energy.Poland has been the only country in the European Union to refuse to agree to reach net zero by 2050.

But when it comes to green energy spending within those packages, it comes in last, according to a study by independent research provider Rhodium Group.The US, the European Union, China, and India together make up two-thirds of global GDP and over 50% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To date, here’s what each economy has devoted to green energy spending as a share of stimulus, from largest to smallest:And here’s the discretionary stimulus as a share of 2019 GDP, from largest to smallest:Rhodium Group writes:The International Energy Agency and other experts argue that building back better, if done right, can create new jobs and even begin to address long-standing environmental injustices.It’s World EV Day today, and to mark it, the UK government has announced a series of initiatives to support electric vehicles.The Department for Transport will deliver a £12 million funding package that will enable a series of EV technology competitions. It’s also considering policy recommendations put forward by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) that are meant to speed up EV adoption.According to Business Green:The recent OLEV report proposed moves to install more chargepoints at popular destinations such as tourist sites, standardize public signage for drivers on UK roads, and provide guidance to local authorities on painting EV parking spaces green.Further, Highways England has launched a £9.3 million scheme that will allow businesses to try EVs for free before they buy. They will work with local authorities to offer businesses with diesel van fleets a free trial of electric vans for two months.Mattress maker Tempur Sealy International yesterday announced that it has committed to sourcing 100% green electricity for its US and European Tempur-Pedic and Sealy manufacturing operations beginning this year. As Environment + Energy Leader reports, “Tempur Sealy will source the renewable energy certificates (RECs) from wind farms across the US and will be the largest bedding manufacturer in the world to purchase RECs sufficient to power the vast majority of its operations.”Tempur Sealy’s largest mattress manufacturing operation is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and that location will complete the installation of the solar in the first half of 2021. The solar panels are expected to generate enough energy to power all of Albuquerque’s mattress assembly lines.Finally, Tempur Sealy announced that it is committed to achieving zero landfill waste for its US and European manufacturing operations by the end of 2022. Currently, more than 90% of process by-products, packaging and other materials from Tempur Sealy US and European operations are recycled or used in energy generation.

2020/09/08,"The majority of solar panels that are produced in ever-increasing quantities use silicon. Solar panels that usually have a service life of 25 to 30 years tend to degrade and produce less electricity over time, making silicon waste recycling a hot-button issue. Scientists at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Moscow have figured out how to convert silicon into silicon oxide nanoparticles, which can then be recycled. This method can be used to avoid a huge amount of waste by 2050. Their findings were published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.Lead researcher Stanislav Evlashin explains:The used panels are converted into nanoparticles using hydrothermal synthesis in an aqueous environment. The good thing about this process is that nanoparticle sizes can be controlled within a range of 8 to 50 nm without using a lot of equipment.And Julia Bondareva, a Skoltech PhD student, continues:The vast majority of methods used to synthesize silicon oxide nanoparticles are based on the bottom-up approach and, therefore, use alkoxides as a precursor. By contrast, ours is a top-down method that uses bulk silicon as a source, which creates a wealth of advantages, such as simplicity, scalability, and controllable particle size distribution. Temperature and hydrolysis time are the key parameters of the synthesis that influence the particle size distribution. We noticed that an increase in pH has a strong effect on the particle formation rate. This is why we used ammonia, which made the reaction in an aqueous medium much faster.Alongside pure silicon, the scientists used industrial solar panels based on the Si-ITO heterostructure that behaved in the same way as silicon panels and were successfully converted into nanoparticles. This research marks a major milestone toward environmentally safe recycling of silicon waste and creating new sources of silicon oxide nanoparticles.South Korean President Moon Jae-in announced virtually, at the first International Day for Clean Air for Blue Skies, that in a $17 billion investment, the country will boost the number of electric cars from the current 110,000 to 1.13 million by 2025, and increase the number of hydrogen vehicles from 8,000 to 200,000. Seoul’s environment ministry said it will do this with government subsidies. The country also intends to add 45,000 charging stations by the same date. Moon’s administration says this will create 151,000 jobs and invest $17 billion.And in more good news, South Korea will more than triple the number of solar and wind power facilities by 2025 compared with last year. It will also close 10 existing coal power plants by the end of 2022 and another 20 by 2034.Moon’s Green New Deal initiative intends to create 660,000 jobs. The initiative will cost $61.43 billion (73 trillion won) through 2025. By the end of this 2020, Korea will present a net zero road map by 2050 and will set new emissions reduction goals for 2030.Scotland’s Arbikie Distillery in Arbroath has designed a pea-based “climate-positive” vodka that it claims creates a carbon saving of 1.53kg CO2e per 700ml bottle, reports Business Green. Arbikie claims a reduction in emissions that offsets the CO2 created by its manufaturing process.So how do they do this? Peas. Business Green explains:Firstly, peas — like other legumes — produce much of their own nitrogen thanks to a symbiotic relationship with bacteria that fix nitrogen from the air for the plant. As a result, they do not need the synthetic fertilizer typically used to grow cereal crops such as corn, wheat, or rye.Secondly, peas contain significantly more protein than cereal crops, which leads to the creation of by-products, known as pot ale, that can be reused leading to further emissions reductions.Arbikie also distills a climate-positive gin, and both spirits are branded “Nàdar.” Iain Stirling, distillery director at Arbikie, said:Sustainable products, particularly in the area of food and drink, are undoubtedly the future, and they will be the major economic driving force in the years to come, not just in Scotland, but across the world.",solar

2020/09/07,"When around 1,000 young people aged between 13 and 23 were asked about pursuing careers in the energy sector, respondents said they’d most like to work in solar and wind, at 50% and 43%, respectively. They were polled by Morning Consult about green energy and climate change from August 21-23.In order of energy sector desirability, solar and wind were followed by hydropower (41%), nuclear (30%), natural gas (29%), and coal (15%).“When Gen Zers do look to the future, it seems that participating in sectors whose emissions contribute to climate change holds little appeal,” the report states.This is consistent with the industry’s own polling in 2017, which has prompted concern from energy executives about how to recruit new talent in the coming decades.Conversely, young people are developing a growing distaste for the fossil-fuel industry, and are concerned about climate change — and how to address it. 49% of those surveyed believe that climate change can be slowed (but not stopped), and 26% believe it can be stopped completely.A new report from global energy consulting group Wood Mackenzie suggests that US presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden’s $2 trillion climate plan could help the US achieve power sector decarbonization by 2035. That’s 15 years ahead of the Paris Agreement targets.For example, according to Wood Mackenzie, current US-based solar module supply stands at around 4.7 GW. Under Biden’s plan, US module demand would be more than 100 GW per year. Similarly, the potential demand for battery supply is 600 GWh per year, vastly exceeding the current 46 GWh.Dan Shreve, Wood Mackenzie research director, said:Most production in the US is focused on assembly, with structural components and equipment imported from countries where manufacturing costs are low. But to satisfy Biden’s potential ‘Made in America’ requirements, domestic wind, solar, and storage would need to expand rapidly.Biden’s plan teeters between achievable and aspirational but the backing of energy sector giants could tip the balance and once again establish the US as a leader in the fight against climate change.A report from the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley suggests the US is currently on track to reach 50% net zero by 2035. According to David Wooley, executive director of Berkeley’s Center for Environmental Public Policy, reaching 95% green energy by 2035 should be possible, even with minimal or no additional cost, if Biden were able to establish a national clean energy standard.Food and drinks giant Nestlé reported today in a media briefing that it has increased the share of recyclable or reusable plastic packaging to 87%.

2020/09/04,"Swedish startup EV maker Volta Trucks has launched the Volta Zero — what it calls the world’s first purpose-built full-electric 16-tonne commercial vehicle. It’s designed specifically for inner-city parcel and freight distribution.The Volta Zero will start operator trials with European parcel delivery and logistics companies in the first half of 2021. Companies are placing orders, and the vehicles are expected to be delivered when production starts in 2022.Most of Volta Trucks’ business is in the UK. It expects to sell 500 Zeros in 2022, rising to 5,000 in 2025.Design-wise, the Volta Zero has 220 degrees of direct vision around the vehicle, which is useful in busy cities for safety purposes. It also has rear-view cameras that replace traditional mirrors, a 360-degree bird’s-eye camera that shows the driver their complete surroundings, and blind-spot warning systems. The driver, who sits in the center of the cab, will sit lower than in a conventional truck, with their eye-line at around 1.8 meters, making it easier to see pedestrians. Further, the Volta Zero will be the first road vehicle to use a sustainably sourced natural flax material and biodegradable resin in its exterior body panels. The Volta Zero will use 160-200 kWh of battery power and will run on Li-Ion Phosphate batteries. At the end of the battery’s life, it can be recycled and reused as an energy storage device. The Zero has an operating range of between 95 and 125 miles (150 to 200 km).Volta Trucks reports in its press release:The Volta Zero offers a payload of 8,600kgs, with an overall volume of 37.7m3 and is designed to accommodate 16 Euro pallets. A refrigerated cargo box will also be available, without reducing overall volume as a result of the vehicle design. Volta Trucks is integrating the use of the vehicle’s battery for the cooling and refrigeration unit of the cargo box that’s normally diesel-powered, thus further reducing CO2 or particulate emissions from commercial vehicle operations.Frost & Sullivan analyst Kevin Kelly said [via Forbes]:The range doesn’t sound much but the hub and spoke delivery philosophy means it is perfect for the role Volta is aiming at. Electric trucks like this will take goods from huge, centralized hubs and deliver into cities using predictable routes and return to the same charging point.Global financial firm The Carlyle Group clearly feels that green energy is worth investing in, as it has announced the acquisition of Maine’s largest portfolio of solar development projects. It’s also one of the largest solar portfolios in the US Northeast. Carlyle is acquiring the solar portfolio through Acadia Renewable Energy LLC from the global solar independent power producer BNRG. It is a $130 million capital investment.The portfolio consists of eight solar projects across southern Maine. The solar farms will sell power to Central Maine Power and Versant Power under 20-year power-purchase agreements. The solar farms will generate more than 100 MW, enough to supply around 19,000 Maine homes with solar power.Construction on the portfolio kicked off in June 2020 and is expected to be finished by third-quarter 2021.France has announced its €100 billion stimulus plan, called “Relaunch France,” and €30 billion of that will be devoted to green energy policies.Much of the stimulus plan’s green investment focuses on weaning off fossil fuels in the industrial, transport, and construction sectors, with €9 billion. The hydrogen industry will get €2 billion over two years to develop green hydrogen technologies and a national hydrogen economy. Hydrogen is used to store and transport energy created by wind and solar.There will also be one-off measures such as temporary cuts to tolls for rail freight and long-term investment such as around €8 billion for the renovation of buildings and €1.2 billion for public transport, reports Politico.France’s goal is to reach net zero by 2050, as part of the Paris Agreement.",solar

Home repair and improvement company HomeServe operates in the UK, US, Canada, France, Spain, and Japan.The survey found that the vast majority of electric car owners (88%) charge their EVs at home, and the choice of charging method for most is a Level 2 charger (75%). But when it comes to setting up and installing home charging, it is less clear for vehicle owners, with 29% of survey respondents expecting their electric utility to assist, and 27% believing that vehicle manufacturers should help.While many electric utilities provide rebates and incentives for customers to purchase electric vehicles and install chargers at home, only 54% of owners surveyed were aware of a rebate or incentive from their provider. However, of those who were aware, 84% took advantage of the program. This suggests that if more people were aware of such offers, more would take advantage of them.Ørsted, an offshore wind giant, is making a big pivot in 2021: All of the new power plants it completes will be onshore, and most will involve solar.The Danish company has never before completed a major solar project anywhere in the world.

It will be extended to all retailers in order to curb plastic waste pollution. So why can’t the US work to ban bags at a national level?The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said that the 5p charge has been “hugely successful” since it was introduced in 2015. Major supermarkets have reported a 95% drop in plastic bag sales.To date, only retailers employing 250 or more staff have had to impose the 5p charge, but from April 2021, all retailers in England will have to comply with the 10p levy.Environment Secretary George Eustice said:We have all seen the devastating impact plastic bags have on the oceans and on precious marine wildlife, which is why we are taking bold and ambitious action to tackle this issue head on.The UK is already a world leader in this global effort, and our carrier bag charge has been hugely successful in taking billions of harmful plastic bags out of circulation,” he said. “But we want to go further by extending this to all retailers so we can continue to cut unnecessary waste and build back greener. I hope our pioneering track record on single-use plastics will inspire many more countries to follow suit, so we can take on plastic waste together and implement lasting change.From October, a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds will be implemented by DEFRA.The average person in England now buys four bags a year from supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014, government statistics show.So, as is the case with nearly everything in the United States, it varies from state to state. There is no national fee or ban in the US. Only the states of California, Hawaii, New York, and Oregon ban plastic bags, as per above.Why is there no cohesive policy? Plastic industry lobbying — the American way. The American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance lobbies against US local and state plastic-bag bans and taxes.And in a particularly galling move, Arizona and Florida passed laws that said plastic bags couldn’t be banned at a local level. To state the obvious, Florida is surrounded by water. How is this good policy?Further, the US is trying to push its terrible plastic habit on other countries because Big Oil is in trouble, as the New York Times reported this week:According to documents reviewed by the New York Times, an industry group representing the world’s largest chemical makers and fossil fuel companies is lobbying to influence United States trade negotiations with Kenya, one of Africa’s biggest economies, to reverse its strict limits on plastics — including a tough plastic-bag ban. It is also pressing for Kenya to continue importing foreign plastic garbage, a practice it has pledged to limit.Publix, one of the largest regional US supermarket chains, located in the south, always offers plastic bags first at checkout. In fact, they downright push them on you. (I always bring my own reusable canvas bags.) But pre-pandemic, before I got fed up with this policy and stopped shopping at Publix (in Florida), I polled numerous cashiers why they do that, and why they keep paper bags hidden away. Their answer was always the same: “That’s what they tell us to do.” And a lot of cashiers downright resented it.Photo: Brian Yurasits/Unsplash",solar
2020/09/02,"The Journal of ACS Applied Materials has published new research that describes a breakthrough in optimizing solar window technology. A team of scientists at UbiQD, an advanced materials company in Los Alamos, have achieved landmark efficiency for solar windows without compromising on aesthetics.Solar windows passively produce solar power, and they could be a game-changing clean-energy technology. Up to now, solar windows available today have lacked transparency due to electronic components embedded in the glass. These new windows (pictured above) are more translucent.The study is titled, “Optimizing the Aesthetics of High-Performance CuInS2/ZnS Quantum Dot Luminescent Solar Concentrator Windows.” Here’s the abstract:Laminated-glass, luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) offer localized and sustainable power generation combined with the customizable transparency needed for windows. Successful commercial deployment of LSC technology depends on the demonstration of economically viable efficiency, while maintaining excellent aesthetics. In this work, multiple-interlayer CuInS2/ZnS quantum dot LSC devices comprised of laminated glass are presented. Three-interlayer LSC designs demonstrated a certified electrical power conversion efficiency of 3.6%. Furthermore, a method of combining dyes and QDs is presented for tuning color towards true-gray from brown. These advances aim to enable LSC technology to be more rapidly adopted in the next generation of energy-efficient buildings.Most solar panels sold in 2020 have efficiencies between 15% and 20%, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), so 3.6% isn’t exactly awesome, but this is a step forward in figuring out how to turn windows into clean energy generators while not compromising on transparency.A new study from the University of Oxford that looked at more than 3,000 utilities found that only 1 in 10 of the world’s electric utility companies are prioritizing investment in green energy over fossil fuel power plants.Most remain heavily invested in fossil fuels, and some are even growing fossil fuel capacity. The research, which was published in Nature Energy, found that only 10% of the companies in the study are expanding their green energy capacity at a faster rate than their gas- or coal-fired capacity. As the abstract states:Strikingly, 60% of the renewables-prioritizing utilities had not ceased concurrently expanding their fossil-fuel portfolio, compared to 15% reducing it. Ten percent of utilities are favoring growth of natural gas power plants, particularly in the US, Russia, and Germany. Only 2% of utilities are actively growing coal, and that’s dominated by Chinese utilities, followed by India and Vietnam.The majority of companies prioritizing green energy are in Europe.Report author Galina Alova said [via the Guardian]:Utilities’ continued investment in fossil fuels leaves them at risk of stranded assets — where power plants will need to be retired early — and undermines global efforts to tackle climate change.The UK government has raised the 5p charge on plastic bags in England to 10p, which will be effective from April 2021.

He realized it could be used on a global scale to recycle wastewater into clean water, energy and nutrients. Water is treated for irrigation and flushing toilets; organic waste is converted into plant fertilizer, and methane gas is captured as an energy source.Built into a mini-shipping container with attached solar panels and a hydroponics system, the NEWgenerator’s technology has been licensed out to companies in India and South Africa, which will manufacture NEWgenerator units locally. This follows the successful completion of pilot programs in India and South Africa in 2016 and 2018-2020, respectively.The team will work with partners in other countries to design localized, bespoke versions of the NEWgenerator systems. NASA has also taken an interest in the NEWgenerator’s potential as a compact wastewater recycling system.",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

And today, that technology is being put to the test at a pilot plant for the first time in Lulea, northern Sweden.It’s the world’s first fossil-free hydrogen-powered steel plant. It’s run by Swedish-Finnish steel company SSAB, Swedish mining company LKAB, and Swedish government-owned multinational power company Vattenfall, and the three together created HYBRIT.SSAB aims for the first fossil-free steel to be commercially available by 2026, and to become fossil-free in its operations by 2045. It could reduce Sweden’s carbon dioxide emissions by 10% and Finland’s by 7%, respectively, according to H2 View.Forty organizations have formed New England for Offshore Wind, which describes itself as “a growing regional coalition of businesses, academic and research institutions, associations, environmental organizations, and labor unions.” Its aim is to:Drive New England governors and legislatures to support regional collaboration and more offshore wind procurements, building political will to power every home in New England with offshore wind. Build public support to enable offshore wind projects to come online in a timely, responsible way.Campaign partners include the Environmental League of Massachusetts, the Vermont Natural Resources Council, Maine Conservation Voters, Tufts University, and LCV. It does not include wind development companies because the group says it wants to be independent.The coalition sent a letter last week to the six New England governors that asked them to issue a joint resolution in support of regional collaboration on offshore wind, according to WCAI.Rhode Island hosts the first US commercial offshore wind farm, Block Island, with five turbines, while Massachusetts is expected to host Vineyard Wind, with around 84 turbines.Waterbury, Vermont-based whiskey distillery WhistlePig has custom-branded their 56kW of solar panels with their logo on a “whiskey barrel” backdrop by working with SpeedPro, a large-format printing company and Sistine Solar, which uses SolarSkin, an aesthetic overlay that transforms the look of any solar panel.SolarSkin can make the panel blend in with a homeowner’s roof, turn it into a branding opportunity for businesses, be used as signage, or function as a canvas for art. Sistine Solar says SolarSkin “uses selective light filtration to simultaneously display a vibrant image and transmit sunlight to the underlying solar panel with minimal loss in efficiency.”Here’s a quick promotional video that takes a look at how it works (and just for the record, I am personally fine with the aesthetics of “traditional solar,” even though this is pretty neat, and good innovation is always to be celebrated): Ollie Parker, owner of the SpeedPro Boston North studio, said:Sistine Solar’s custom-branded solar signage is designed to add visual appeal for panels while minimizing efficiency loss at an estimated 15%. Solar signage is an extremely viable option for homeowners who want their panels to match their roofs or companies who want more brand visibility and advertising.Sistine Solar says SolarSkin costs approximately an additional $2,400 for a 6kW installation.",solar
2020/08/28,"Greenhouses have played a major part in growing plants, fruit, and vegetables for hundreds of years. The controlled environment keeps out pests and controls humidity and temperature. But industrial-scale greenhouses can be energy- and resource-intensive.Dutch horticultural firm Van Der Hoeven is working on transitioning greenhouses to green energy, since they are now required by the Dutch government to be climate neutral from this year. Marc Middeldorp, manager for design and engineering at Van Der Hoeven, told CNBC’s Sustainable Energy:There is a demand, definitely, for clients to build sustainable greenhouses with efficient use of energy and to reduce as much as possible the use of fresh water, electricity. And that’s where our challenge lies at the moment.The Dutch government says that challenge can be met with geothermal and solar power. Delft-based sustainable tech company Solho has developed Solar Powered Horticultural Off-grid Unit (SPRHOUT). Adriano Desideri, Solho’s CEO and cofounder, said [via CNBC]:[SPRHOUT] uses solar energy as an input to generate all the energy flows required to operate the greenhouse farm: heating, cooling, and electricity.We store it in our thermal storage which we call the TESMOD.And then from here, we harvest this thermal energy: either for heating, or for cooling through a thermal chiller, or for electricity through a power unit.The Dutch are on to something here, as this approach to growing food needs to be adapted globally in the near future due to climate change.What’s a virtual power plant (VPP)? According to German VPP operator Next, it’s “a network of decentralized, medium-scale power generating units such as wind farms, solar parks, and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, as well as flexible power consumers and storage systems.”And 3,000 California apartments are about to get VPPs consisting of solar and batteries, thanks to German energy storage company Sonnen, which is is partnering with real estate developer Wasatch Group. That means the apartments can run on solar backup during blackouts, the VPP takes pressure off the grid, and it can also be tapped during peak hours.The first apartment complex to be retrofitted will be the 417-unit Heron Pointe in Fresno, according to the Verge, which charges average rent per unit for the area. Blake Richetta, chairman and CEO of Sonnen, said:We wanted to prove that we could do this kind of clean energy, carbon-neutral, resilient community of decentralized batteries and solar in an average middle class, [or] low to middle income apartment community.The VPP will save tenants around 10% on their electricity bills. Residents will pay their landlords for electricity costs instead of a utility company, as it comes included with the apartment.Energy intelligence service WattBuy has launched the first-ever calculator that estimates the electricity cost and carbon footprint impact for nearly every home in the US.The calculator helps prospective buyers quickly learn what a home’s electricity costs are by simply entering an address, and existing homeowners see how changing their electricity fuel source can significantly affect their carbon footprint. And because WattBuy is making this tool available to other companies as an application programming interface (API), it could be valuable to platforms like Zillow and Realtor.com as well as solar installers, electricity suppliers, and others.  WattBuy’s electricity estimation calculator incorporates US Energy Information Administration residential electricity usage data at a sub-state level, along with building profile correlations from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Building Performance Database. It also incorporates building characteristics from Zillow as well as individual county assessment data to determine specific housing characteristics.WattBuy also incorporates several open and proprietary data sources including recent hourly temperature and weather data from Dark Sky, climate data for historical trends from a typical meteorological year from the US Department of Energy Open Energy Data catalog, and several other proprietary data sets. Ben Hood, WattBuy’s chief technology officer, said:Consumers can use these insights to choose cheaper, greener electricity options and make individual decisions around solar rooftops or other energy efficiency improvements that can have a positive impact on reducing a home’s carbon impact.Photo: John Lambeth/Pexels.com",solar

2020/08/26,"California had an energy crisis last week, and they’re not out of the woods (not to mention the awful wildfires that continue to burn). Residents on a stressed power grid can do what electric vehicle drivers already know: Energy consumption during off-peak hours saves money. It also reduces strain on the grid, which can help prevent rolling blackouts. California faced a record-breaking heatwave last week that boosted energy consumption. (Air conditioning, people.) So utilities implemented rolling blackouts, which is when electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. As Reuters explained on August 17:The controlled power disruptions, with alternating blocks of utility customers losing electricity for one or two hours at a time, are designed to prevent excess demand from triggering a more widespread collapse of the grid that could last days.The full extent of outages is a moving target that hinges largely on how much energy customers might conserve during the day as part of a Flex Alert declared by the [Independent System Operator]… urging consumers to voluntarily scale back electricity use.This will be a problem that comes up again, and not just in California, as extreme weather (and lots of other things) puts stress on power grids — and we’re getting a lot more of that lately. According to home energy monitoring company Sense, residents can turn up their thermostats throughout the day or cool their home earlier in the day when renewable energy is abundant on the grid and then turn up the thermostat during the evening hours.Sense analyzed energy data in 1,100 California homes, which was collected from July 10 to August 18, to show how people use electricity in the critical evening hours of 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. It found that 55% of electricity usage in the evening time frame could be shifted to other times during the day, or reduced. 88% of consumption came from air conditioning. Other energy that could be consumed at other times of day included water heaters, washers and dryers, pool pumps, and EV chargers — all of which could be turned off or used during off-peak hours.In the future, the electricity grid will be connected to peoples’ homes and automatically control loads in response to high demand. However, today’s smart home technology, like the Sense Home Energy Monitor, already provides insights to consumers that can prompt them to reduce or shift consumption when energy supplies are constrained, reducing the risk of rolling blackouts.So find out when off-peak hours are and make a conscious decision to shift your energy habits if you don’t have an energy monitor.

2020/08/26,"Dandelion Energy, a rapidly-growing residential geothermal company that was originally a project at Google’s parent company Alphabet, is expanding into Connecticut from New York, where it partners with Con Edison.Single-family geothermal energy systems use underground pipes to harness the earth’s energy for heating and cooling buildings, and emit no greenhouse gases. They circulate water and propylene glycol, a type of nontoxic alcohol. Here’s how it works:Dandelion’s Connecticut expansion is initially available in parts of Fairfield County. Increased incentives to replace oil and gas with geothermal are being introduced by Energize Connecticut sponsors, energy provider Eversource, and electric distribution company United Illuminating, which will provide thousands of dollars in rebates.Looking at the Connecticut Geothermal Association’s website, there are currently only 12 installers in the state, so this is a welcome expansion.Homeowners in Connecticut who pay cash and switch from fuel oil or propane heating are expected to save approximately 50%% in annual heating and cooling operating costs and have less than seven-year payback.Each new installation includes a heat pump, underground pipes to utilize the earth’s natural heating and cooling, a buffer tank for capturing geothermal warm water, and a smart thermostat.

All three wind farms will add 229 MW of energy to the Irish grid annually.The 115MW wind farm project will be in Ardderroo in County Galway and support Amazon Web Services’ Irish data centers. The wind farm will be online by 2022 and is expected to host 27 turbines.The Galway wind farm joins Amazon’s existing projects in Esk in County Cork and Meenbog in County Donegal. The County Cork wind farm is due to go live from next month, and the County Donegal site will become operable in early 2022. Once all three wind farms are up and running, Amazon said it will be Ireland’s largest single corporate buyer of green energy. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) June 2020 Energy Infrastructure Update reports that green energy sources (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower) dominated new US electrical generating capacity additions in the first half of 2020.Green energy made up 57.14% (7,859 MW) of the 13,753 MW of new capacity added during the first six months of 2020. Natural gas came in second, with 42.67% (5,869 MW). So, that’s a total percentage of 99.81%. The balance? Coal (20 MW) and “other” sources (5 MW). There were no new additions of oil, nuclear, or geothermal to date in 2020.So that means green energy now makes up 23.04% of the US’ total available installed generating capacity, compared to coal, at 20.19%. Wind and solar alone are now at 13.08% of the US total, and that’s excluding rooftop solar.Environment & Energy Leader reports:Analysis by the Sun Day Campaign, a nonprofit research organization, shows that,  five years ago, FERC reported that total installed renewable energy generating capacity was 17.27% of the nation’s total with wind at 5.84% (now 9.13%) and solar at 1.08% (now 3.95%). Thus, over the past half-decade, wind’s share of the nation’s generating capacity has expanded by nearly 60% while that of solar is now almost four times greater.Photo: Greene King",solar
2020/08/24,"Grist recently asked the pertinent question: What happens to solar panels when they’re no longer useable?By 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that up to 78 million metric tons of solar panels will have reached the end of their life, and that the world will be generating about 6 million metric tons of new solar e-waste annually. So clearly we need to develop a global plan now for recycling, seeing how the life span of a panel is around 25 years. Plus, the panels have lead in them, so we don’t want that sitting in landfills. Grist explains how it’s mostly done at present:Even when recycling happens, there’s a lot of room for improvement. A solar panel is essentially an electronic sandwich. The filling is a thin layer of crystalline silicon cells, which are insulated and protected from the elements on both sides by sheets of polymers and glass. It’s all held together in an aluminum frame. On the back of the panel, a junction box contains copper wiring that channels electricity away as it’s being generated.At a typical e-waste facility, this high-tech sandwich will be treated crudely. Recyclers often take off the panel’s frame and its junction box to recover the aluminum and copper, then shred the rest of the module, including the glass, polymers, and silicon cells, which get coated in a silver electrode and soldered using tin and lead.Here’s the current situation globally: In the EU, producers are required to ensure their solar panels are recycled properly. In Japan, India, and Australia, they’re coming up with a recycling plan. And in the US,  with the exception of a state law in Washington that requires manufacturers to recycle the panels, there is no plan. (At least Senator Angus King (I-ME) introduced the Battery and Critical Mineral Recycling Act of 2020 in March. The bill aims, as it simply states, “to support the reuse and recycling of batteries and critical minerals, and for other purposes.”)There’s a cost problem in the US because it’s way more expensive to recycle than it is to dump. It costs less than $1 to dump a panel in a landfill and between $12-25 to recycle it, but only $3 is paid out for recovered aluminum, copper, and glass.In order to recover the silver and silicon, the most valuable components, which would improve the cost-to-revenue ratio, a bespoke solution is needed.According to [Sam] Vanderhoof, Recycle PV Solar, [one of the only U.S. companies dedicated to PV recycling], initially used a “heat process and a ball mill process” that could recapture more than 90% of the materials present in a panel, including low-purity silver and silicon. But the company recently received some new equipment from its European partners that can do “95 plus percent recapture,” he said, while separating the recaptured materials much better.So how is this problem solved? Grist writes:For the solar recycling industry to grow sustainably, it will ultimately need supportive policies and regulations. The EU model of having producers finance the takeback and recycling of solar panels might be a good one for the US to emulate. But before that’s going to happen, US lawmakers need to recognize that the problem exists and is only getting bigger. Like the climate crisis, this is a future problem that must be addressed now. Renewables are absolutely the way forward when it comes to producing clean energy. But we don’t want a gigantic pile of old solar panels creating even more landfill. So the industry needs to figure out a way to reuse panels’ components and keep a whole lot of waste from piling up. Because the onus shouldn’t be on the consumer.Thanks to Grist for exploring this vital question.",solar
2020/08/24,"The Chinese state-owned company Shanxi Coal International Energy Group is making a big investment in solar manufacturing. Shanxi will lead a joint venture to build a 3-gigawatt solar manufacturing plant for 3.19 billion yuan ($461 million). The project will grow to 10 gigawatts.Shanxi Coal will own an 88.5% stake in the venture, Shanxi Coal International Photovoltaic Power Technology. It says it’s made this move into solar to “help with the province’s energy transition and meet the need for state firms to get behind strategic emerging industries,” according to Bloomberg Green.Ironically, China leads the world in the production of both coal and solar — it’s the largest producer and buyer of solar panels. But it refuses to give up coal because of energy demand and employment. China’s industrial sector is by far the largest consumer of coal.Grist recently asked the pertinent question: Where do solar panels go when they die?By 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency projects that up to 78 million metric tons of solar panels will have reached the end of their life, and that the world will be generating about 6 million metric tons of new solar e-waste annually. So clearly we need a plan, and silver and silicon need to be recovered from the panels, because they’re valuable. Plus, the panels have lead in them, so it would be a terrible thing if they ended up in landfills.

2020/08/21,"A study from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) found that painting one out of four white wind turbine blades black reduces the number of birds killed by the blades by 72%.Why does this work? The scientists say it’s because of something called “motion smear.” The movement of the all-white blades makes them appear invisible to birds, who have excellent peripheral eyesight, but they can’t see as well when they look forward. So having one black blade is easier for the birds to spot.The study, which is published in Ecology and Evolution, was conducted on Norway’s island of Smøla for 7.5 years before the blades were painted and 3.5 years after treatment.  Of the eight wind turbines used in the research, four were painted and four were left bare. There were a total of 1,275 searches by sniffer dogs conducted for dead birds between 2006 and 2016. The birds that benefited the most from the painted blade were large birds and birds of prey, such as eagles and vultures.Wind turbines killed six white-tailed eagles before they were painted, but no deaths were recorded after the black blade was added.   Further, painting the towers black helped, too. “We painted the lower part of 10 turbine towers black. This reduced the mortality for willow ptarmigan by almost 50% compared to unpainted wind turbines in the same area,” says NINA researcher Bård Stokke.We at Electrek have written about birds and wind turbines before. Of course every bird that can be saved is a huge win, so this is a simple yet innovative solution that should just become standard practice and make green energy even better. But wind turbines are not a leading cause of bird deaths. Here’s what is:Agriculture, deforestation, and urbanization. Simply put, it’s habitat destruction. And let’s include pesticides here, under the category of agriculture. According to Sibley Guides, “Pesticides may kill 72 million birds per year or possibly many more. The sublethal effects of pesticides may also make the birds more susceptible to predators or unable to reproduce, essentially killing them.”Fossil fuels and climate change. Oil fields could kill up to 1 million birds a year, according to the Bureau of Land Management via factcheck.org. Oh, and climate change, of course, which threatens two out of three bird species in the US. As the Guardian explains, “Climate change compounds those problems by altering bird habitats.”Sibley Guides estimates oil fatalities at an even higher rate. The bird reference guide says:Oil spills kill hundreds of thousands of birds a year or more. Some of this occurs in dramatic large spills, but most probably occurs in thousands of small incidental spills that are never reported or documented.Oil and wastewater pits may kill up to 2 million birds per year.Cats and windows. In 2014, Treehugger [via USA Today] listed the greatest threats to birds by fatality numbers. According to the 2014 State of the Birds Report (the most recent report with these statistics), wind turbines came in eighth. The top threat to birds is cats (2.4 billion), followed by windows (599 million), cars (200 million), power lines — collision (25 million), communication towers (6.6 million), power lines — electrocution (5.6 million), agricultural chemicals (US number unknown, Canada is 2.7 million), and wind turbines (234,000).A couple of blue jays keep flying into my living room window — and they get my (indoor-only) cat all riled up.

2020/08/21,"Singapore’s Public Utilities Board (PUB) and marine and utilities group Sembcorp Industries have begun to build a 60 megawatt-peak (MWp) floating solar photovoltaic farm. It’s on the Tengeh Reservoir in the Western Water Catchment in the West Region of Singapore.Singapore has opted for a floating solar farm because the island has a scarcity of land. The solar farm will occupy an area equivalent to 45 football fields when it’s finished. It will power water treatment plants and offset 7% of the PUB’s energy needs. It will go live in 2021.It uses double-glass PV modules mounted on high-density polyethylene floats. The PV panels are UV-resistant in order to prevent sunlight damage.PUB said that the solar farm will “have minimal impact on the reservoir’s water quality and biodiversity.”A study from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research found that painting one out of four white wind turbine blades black reduces the amount of birds killed by the blades by 72%.Why does this work?

In the last 10 years, scientists around the world have been locked in a race to engineer chemical compounds based upon the perovskite crystal structure but that are able to generate more renewable electricity at a lower cost.A silicon solar cell can convert around 22% of available solar energy into electricity. Oxford PV’s perovskite-on-silicon solar cell can reach a level of up to 27.3%.Oxford PV aims to start manufacturing the perovskite panels by the end of 2020 and start selling them within the next year.Photo: PUB",solar
2020/08/13,"Wind and solar reached a record-high market share of 10% of global electricity in the first half of 2020, up by 14% compared to the same period in 2019, according to a new report from think tank Ember, which focuses on accelerating the global energy transition. This is despite a 3% drop in power demand globally due to the impact of COVID-19. Wind and solar have doubled their market share since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.Many key countries now generate around a tenth of their electricity from wind and solar: China (10%), the US (12%), India (10%), Japan (10%), Brazil (10%), and Turkey (13%). The EU and UK were substantially higher with 21% and 33%, respectively; Germany rose to 42%. (Russia is the largest country to so far shun wind and solar, with just 0.2% of its electricity coming from them.) This year, for the first time, the world’s coal fleet ran at less than half of its capacity. Coal dropped by 8.3% in the global electricity mix from the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020. The drop was led by major falls in the US (-31%) and the Europe Union (-32%). For the first time ever, the existing global coal fleet ran at less than half capacity. In the US, existing coal plants ran at less than a third of their capacity (32%). In contrast, China’s coal fell only 2%, meaning its share of global coal generation rose to 54% so far this year, up from 50% in 2019 and 44% in 2015. But here’s the important part: The global electricity transition is off track for 1.5 degrees. Coal needs to fall by 13% every year this decade, and even in the face of a global pandemic, coal generation has only reduced 8% in the first half of 2020. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 1.5 degree scenarios shows coal needs to fall to just 6% of global generation by 2030, from 33% in the first half of 2020. The IPCC shows in all scenarios that most of coal’s replacement is with wind and solar. Six former US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrators from both Democratic and Republican administrations joined a prominent group of former EPA officials to raise a bipartisan call for a new forward-looking direction at the EPA in an open letter.Administrators Lee M. Thomas, William K. Reilly, Carol M. Browner, Christine Todd Whitman, Lisa P. Jackson, and Gina McCarthy discuss their concerns about the far-reaching impacts of climate change, new toxic hazards and other emerging health risks, and the disproportionate burdens that pollution and global warming place on lower-wealth communities, communities of color, and indigenous people. They write:As EPA approaches its 50th anniversary this December, we believe the time has come to reset the future course for EPA in a new, forward-looking direction to address the environmental challenges we face today and those that lie ahead.They cite a new report, “Resetting the Course of EPA,” from the Environmental Protection Network, a bipartisan group of more than 500 former EPA senior managers and employees. It provides a comprehensive set of recommendations to guide the EPA in addressing the most significant and emerging threats to public health and the environment.It covers 10 action areas, from reducing emissions from vehicles, to safeguarding drinking water, to restoring science as the backbone of agency decision-making, to elevating environmental justice in all aspects of EPA’s work.Siemens eMobility solutions announced this week that it will field test new EV charging technology, a Meter Integrated Charger (MIC), in New York. The MICs measure the quantity of electricity needed to charge EVs so that drivers, utilities, and others can track and manage consumption. The standard utility meter can be used to record the energy usage, and the meter will send the data back to the utility, which can then be shared with the customer. The data could be used to bill the EV on a separate rate in the future.German multinational conglomerate Siemens is partnering with New York utility Con Edison to recruit up to 20 residential customers in New York with smart meters to participate in the project.John DeBoer, head of Siemens eMobility solutions and Future Grid Business in North America, said:Currently, for most customers who own EVs, EV energy consumption is mixed in with all other usage in the owner’s electricity bill, making it impossible to identify the energy costs from charging the EV versus the home’s air conditioning or lighting. With the MIC, the power used for the EV will show up separately. Siemens is working to promote EV adoption with our full range of charging equipment and solutions, and this could be a game-changer for EV drivers in understanding their fuel savings when they switch to EVs.Con Edison will collect information on the charging habits of the participating customers and share it with Siemens. The project is supported by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.",solar
2020/08/12,"The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday in its Short-Term Energy Outlook that US electricity consumption will drop 3.4% in 2020. This is due to COVID-19 lockdowns causing businesses to close. When it comes to green energy, the report says:EIA forecasts that renewable energy will be the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in 2020. EIA expects the electric power sector will add 23.2 gigawatts (GW) of new wind capacity and 12.9 GW of utility-scale solar capacity in 2020. However, these future capacity additions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and EIA continues to monitor reported planned capacity builds.Both nuclear and renewables will top coal for the first time in 2020. On the fossil-fuel front, Reuters reports:EIA said natural gas’ share of generation will rise from 37% in 2019 to 40% in 2020 before dropping to 35% in 2021 as gas prices increase. Coal’s share will slide from 24% in 2019 to 18% in 2020 before rising to 22% in 2021.According to the Earth Observation Group at the Payne Institute for Public Policy, gas flaring in the US has declined by 70% in the last 12 months, despite hitting its highest level in a decade last year, according to the Financial Times.Investors drove the drop by demanding greater capital discipline from a sector that has earned a reputation for prioritizing growth, and as a result, activity has dropped, particularly among smaller operators who don’t have the capital to improve environmental outcomes. The shale sector is also expected to be consolidated.In 2018, drilling began to slow along with a dropping oil price. (This included drilling in the Permian basin, where half of US tight oil production occurs.) In August 2019, completion activity peaked at 1,425 wells. In May 2020, 461 wells were completed.Gas flaring, which is the controlled burning of natural gas used to regulate pressure in plants, generates a significant amount of greenhouse gases that contribute to overall global warming.Global payments technology giant Visa has announced a $500 million green bond offering.

2020/08/11,"Three houses in Northwest Baltimore were destroyed by a natural gas explosion on Monday, killing one person and seriously injuring at least six others. Children were also trapped in the rubble. More than 200 rescue personnel attended the scene of the explosion.Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is used to produce almost 25% of US electricity. In Maryland, it heats around 50% of homes.Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. (BGE) is the nation’s oldest gas utility, dating back to 1817. Chris Burton, BGE’s vice president for gas distribution, said in May that one-third of its gas distribution mains, one-quarter of its gas services, and half of its transmission mains are over 50 years old, according to the Baltimore Sun.In September 2019, the Baltimore Sun published a story titled, “Baltimore’s natural gas system is increasingly leaky, raising concerns about safety and global warming,” in which Scott Dance writes:More and more natural gas has been leaking out of aged pipes in and around Baltimore in recent years, likely diminishing the fossil fuel’s relative Earth-friendliness [Electrek‘s note: Natural gas is not Earth friendly at all] and creating hazards that can lead to explosions…Leaks are so frequent that nearly two dozen of them are discovered each day, on average, according to data the Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. reports to federal authorities. The number of leaks increased by 75% from 2009 to 2016 — amid what officials called a “dramatic” increase in the failure of pipe joints dating from the 1950s and 1960s.Beyond the immediate safety concerns, the leaks contribute to the greenhouse effect that has been warming the planet for decades. And new research suggests more natural gas from Baltimore and other older cities is reaching the atmosphere than previously thought.Natural gas emits methane, which is is the second most long-lived greenhouse gas, and it currently makes up 10% of emissions in the US.Speaking of methane, the New York Times reports that the EPA is expected to roll back controls on the release of methane, which were put in place by the Obama administration. This announcement is expected to be made on Friday.The New York Times writes:The EPA’s new methane rule eliminates federal requirements that oil and gas companies must install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from wells, pipelines, and storage sites.EPA officials say the new, weaker methane rule is needed to free the oil and gas industry from what they call crippling regulations at a moment when companies are suffering from plummeting prices and falling demand driven by a sharp global economic slowdown. The weakening of the rule, however, has been in the works for more than a year.In August, Andrew Wheeler, the head of the EPA, made public a draft of the methane rule, saying at the time that it ‘removes unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry.’Electrek’s Take: OK, let’s just mull over Wheeler’s quote for a minute. He’s concerned, not about people whose houses blew up, or the health of Americans, or the warming planet. Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who is now the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is interested, first and foremost, in what’s best for the oil and gas industry. Pennsylvania is a crucial swing state in the US election, so it’s being closely watched and polled. Natural gas development is a major industry in the Keystone State. A new CBS News poll found that 52% of registered voters in Pennsylvania oppose fracking, and 48% favor the oil-and-gas extraction method.Unsurprisingly, 48% said that Donald Trump would do a better job on issues surrounding oil and gas exploration, compared to 42% for Joe Biden. Further, Pennsylvania Republicans polled favored fossils heavily over Democrats.Biden released his green energy plan in July and put job creation at the heart of his “Build Back Better” agenda. Biden would be wise to really drive that point home in Pennsylvania, where fossil-fuel energy workers will be worrying about staying employed as the world moves rapidly toward green energy.Biden’s plan states on his website:We need millions of construction, skilled trades, and engineering workers to build a new American infrastructure and clean energy economy. These jobs will create pathways for young people and for older workers shifting to new professions, and for people from all backgrounds and all communities.The investments will make sure the communities who have suffered the most from pollution are first to benefit — including low-income rural and urban communities, communities of color, and Native communities.Photo: Baltimore Sun",solar

Some good advice… If you buy an electric trail bike, read the manual before you ride it for the first time.Cowell is British and splits his time between his homes in the UK and the US. And as UK micromobility retailer Pure Electric points out, there’s a big difference between what’s allowed in the UK and the US when it comes to e-bikes:US e-bikes:UK e-bikes:So e-bike riders in the US have access to a lot more power, and regulations are looser. US people (and you too, UK folks), read the manual, wear a helmet, and ride carefully.But let’s keep it real here.

2020/08/07,"A wastewater treatment plant west of Adelaide, Australia, is using stale beer to generate biogas, which in turn can power up to 1,200 homes.Water utility SA Water’s Glenelg Wastewater Treatment Plant combines old beer with sewage sludge. That combo creates a biogas, which is naturally produced from the decomposition of organic waste that then powers the entire plant. SA Water is owned by the South Australian government and provides services to around 1.5 million people.So where is SA Water getting the influx of stale beer? From pubs, bars, restaurants, and clubs that have been shut as a result of the pandemic, and it’s putting it to good use. As Euronews explains:The beer biodegrades under high temperatures in large digester tanks, using natural bacterial processes which release biogas. This biogas, in turn, generates electricity.The wastewater plant has been repurposing 150,000 liters of expired beer every week… As a result, the plant has seen renewable energy generation boosted to 654 megawatt hours in a single month.The plant generated a record 355,200 cubic meters of biogas in May and another 320,000 cubic meters in June, according to Energy Live News.SA Water senior manager Lisa Hannant said:Glenelg’s co-digestion program adds high strength organic waste from industry to sludge from the sewage treatment process.Harnessing the power of biogas through our onsite gas engines creates renewable energy for the treatment plant and a sustainable alternative for industrial waste that’s otherwise difficult to dispose of and treat.The industry has remained resilient and adapted to ensure their resources aren’t wasted, while enabling an outcome for the environment.The wastewater treatment facility normally generates enough biogas to power around 80% of its energy needs.The alcohol industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. For example, Champagne producers have said they’ve lost an estimated €1.7 billion ($2 billion) in sales this year. There are more than 100 million unsold bottles of fizz. So there is a very good chance that the grapes may end up as hand sanitizer. (And that is an absolute tragedy, as I am a big Champagne lover, but we do need hand sanitizer, sigh.)It’s also a shame for the hospitality and beer industry to be struggling like this, but at least the stale beer has been put to good use. Perhaps this model of reusing stale beer for clean energy is something that can be adapted for the long term.",solar

Out of a total of 5,153 public-sector diesel vehicles currently being used, 3,586 will be replaced with green vehicles.The city is working with carmakers on the development of green models for fire trucks, ambulances, and cleaning vehicles, and diesel taxis, airport buses, and city tour buses will also be dropped for green vehicles. The government intends to replace 30% of diesel buses with e-buses by 2023.Newark, Delaware, the home of the University of Delaware, is launching a nearly $10 million green energy project that will quadruple its solar power generation and reduce its energy needs.The project will be financed with a loan, and savings from the upgrades will pay for the project over 20 years. The work is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.The city will install between 1,000 and 1,376 kW of solar panels on city buildings and in fields. The Newark Post explains:The city operates its own electric utility, so the solar power will reduce the amount of wholesale power the city needs to purchase, saving more than $130,000 each year. The city will also generate more than $65,000 each year by selling solar renewable energy certificates to the Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation.The city received a $1 million grant from the state, used $175,000 from the McKees Solar Fund and received an $8.5 million loan from Bank of America.Newark will also install LED lighting in city buildings and parking lots, new LED pedestrian lights, new high-efficiency transformers, and a waste oil generator as part of the project.Brick and mortar retail is suffering globally due to the pandemic, but micromobility is bucking the trend. UK micromobility retailer Pure Electric opened its 13th store this week, in central London, near Holborn station.Pure Electric’s newest store is selling leading brands of e-bikes and scooters and has a workshop where customers can get their e-bikes, conventional bikes, and folding bikes serviced.Peter Kimberley, Pure Electric CEO, said:We’re committed to becoming the leading micromobility retailer, not just in the UK but across Europe too. We’ll be opening several more UK stores before the end of this year and we’ve got our sights set on our European outlets too, starting in France and Spain.This is such an exciting time in micromobility retail; we’re still just at the start of a revolution in our transport habits and the growth potential for the next few years is immense.The government is getting behind this revolution, with bold plans for example on infrastructure and changes to the Highway Code, but more needs to be done. Electric scooters need to be legalized now; the country can’t wait another 12 months for the trials to end. We’d also like to see the Cycle to Work scheme promoted more actively.Photo: Uwe Schwarzbach/Flickr",solar
2020/08/06,"EDP Renewables (EDPR), one of the largest wind energy producers in the world with a presence in 14 countries, has completed the construction of its 200 MW Harvest Ridge wind farm in Douglas County, Illinois (pictured above). The wind farm is now operational. It consists of 11 Vestas V136 3.7 MW wind turbines and 37 Vestas V150 4.3 MW wind turbines.Harvest Ridge will generate enough electricity to power around 68,000 Illinois homes. It cost about $280 million and will disburse up to $50 million in cumulative payments to local governments throughout the life of the project. The project created 250 jobs during construction and 10 permanent jobs, and the landowners will be paid for hosting the wind turbines.EDPR has other six operational Illinois wind farms, which cumulatively produce enough clean energy to power around 412,000 Illinois homes annually. Walmart is one of the businesses that will be purchasing power from Harvest Ridge.The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled yesterday that the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) does not have to be shut and drained, as per a lower court order on July 6. It’s able to keep operating for now. However, the Court of Appeals yesterday also ruled that regulatory officials may still need to issue another environmental assessment for DAPL before deciding whether the pipeline can keep operating.The DAPL is a 1,172-mile-long, 570,000-barrel-per-day oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois.Earthjustice lawyer Jan Hasselman, who represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against Dakota Access said:The bottom line is that the fight continues. We’re right on the law and we’re not giving up until this pipeline is shut down.California-headquartered, global EV charging network ChargePoint yesterday announced that is has closed $127 million in incremental equity financing. The funds will accelerate the expansion of ChargePoint’s global commercial and fleet businesses.Investors include American Electric Power, Braemar Energy Ventures, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Chevron Technology Ventures, Clearvision, GIC, Linse Capital, and Quantum Energy Partners.ChargePoint will use the latest funding to expand its commercial and fleet portfolio in North America and Europe and continue to scale policy, marketing, and sales efforts.Interest in electric vehicles and infrastructure continues to grow despite the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Europe, as EVs are built into stimulus plans.Pasquale Romano, president and CEO of ChargePoint, said:The shift to electric drive is intensifying for mainstream businesses and fleet operators, a transition poised to be one of the most significant transformations in modern history. With more than a decade of category leadership, ChargePoint is well positioned to continue the buildout of 21st century mobility infrastructure that will pave the way to the mass adoption of EVs.",solar
2020/08/05,"In its first corporate sustainability report, the federally owned utility Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) says it’s on track to reduce emissions by 70% below 2005 levels by 2030. But on Monday, Donald Trump fired two members of its board of directors, including its chair, on the grounds that it’s hiring low-cost foreign labor. The TVA says that’s not true. So what’s really going on?The TVA, which serves 10 million customers in seven states, was created during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal in 1933 to bring power and economic development to one of the areas of the US hit hardest by the Great Depression.It shut down its last operating unit at its Paradise Fossil Plant in western Kentucky in February, along with the Bull Run Steam Plant near Oak Ridge by 2023, as Electrek reported.The TVA has already cut its carbon output by 60% in the past 15 years. It has boosted power generation from nuclear, hydro, and solar facilities and is replacing coal-fired plants with combined-cycle natural gas generators. It’s planning on adding more solar and also uses wind.The TVA now gets more than 40% of its power from its seven operating nuclear reactors in Tennessee and Alabama and about 10% of its power from its 29 power-producing dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries.On Monday, Donald Trump issued an executive order and fired TVA chair James “Skip” Thompson, who was actually appointed by Trump, along with board member Richard Howorth, whose term expired in May. Howorth was never replaced, so he continued to serve, as per board bylaws. That leaves the TVA’s board with five members and four vacancies.Trump’s reason? “Unfairly replacing American workers with low-cost foreign labor.” That’s because the TVA is outsourcing around 200 high-skilled IT jobs (although half of those 200 TVA employees being replaced have found other jobs within the TVA, retired, or left). The TVA employs around 10,000 people.TVA stated in response: All TVA employees are US-based citizens. All jobs related to TVA’s Information Technology department must be performed in the US by individuals who may legally work in this country.TVA contracts, like all other federal agencies, do not specify whether the contractors use US workers or skilled foreigners working in the United States legally. But the Intercept reported in May that the TVA does actually outsource to companies headquartered abroad, to Capgemini (France), CGI (Canada), and Accenture (Ireland):While TVA claims the jobs will remain in the United States, citing the existence of  US-based subsidiaries for some of its vendors, workers say outsourcing labor is baked into these firms’ business model. Further, Trump said on Monday that TVA CEO Jeff Lyash was “ridiculously overpaid.” The board voted to give Lyash an $8.1 million compensation package last year. In April, Thompson issued a memo to all TVA employees and contractors that stated:We are fully supportive of Jeff and of the entire TVA team. It’s unfortunate that ill-informed opinions are now distracting us from our focus on providing reliable power and other vital services during this challenging time.The Chattanooga Times Free Press states that Lyash has the “richest compensation package of any federal employee in America.” Further, the labor union International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers supported Trump’s statement about Lyash’s compensation.The Washington Post reports:But Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) came to TVA’s defense. He said the utility ‘does a very good job of producing large amounts of low-cost, reliable electricity.’ And he said that Lyash’s compensation was ‘in the bottom fourth of what the CEOs of other big utilities earn and is set strictly according to requirements of federal law.’ He added, ‘TVA receives no federal tax dollars.’It’s kind of crappy for the TVA to outsource government jobs right now, in the middle of an economic crisis, legal or not, and Lyash has rightly now said the TVA will reconsider that move. It’s a small proportion of the utilities’ 10,000 employees, but that’s still 100 individuals who are adversely affected. An anonymous administration official told the Washington Post, however, that Trump’s executive order was a “meaningless dog whistle to political constituencies to make clear the administration is ‘tough’ on foreigners.”But there’s something else Trump is angry about — let’s call this the buried lead. When the TVA board voted to close down the two coal plants in February, Trump tweeted his displeasure. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) didn’t support the closures, either. Because, as any regular reader of Electrek or anyone who follows energy news knows, Trump isn’t interested in renewables. He’s only interested in propping up the dying fossil-fuel industry. As the Washington Post writes, “Trump on Monday reiterated his criticism. Citing the TVA board chair, Trump said ‘he could’ve kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn’t do that, did he?'” So clearly, Trump held a grudge about that coal closure. And TVA has done the unthinkable: It’s cited climate change for escalating its move to renewables. So, unsurprisingly, he’s reverted to his usual game-show tactic when he doesn’t get his way: “You’re fired.”Losing jobs is scary for those 100 IT workers. But if Trump and McConnell really cared about creating and preserving American jobs on a large scale, then they would support job creation in the renewables sector, back Senator Tammy Duckworth’s (D-IL) bill to create new jobs for laid-off coal workers and stop pushing fossil fuels.Photo: The Tennessee Valley Authority’s Norris Dam was nearing completion at the time of this photograph on July 22, 1935.

2020/08/05,"In February, Electrek reported that fossil-fuel giant BP announced that it will become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner. One objective it said it would pursue is to “increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time.”BP also said it would restructure, and in June, CEO Bernard Looney announced it would cut 15% of its workforce, or 10,000 jobs. Electrek reported that the decision was due to the coronavirus impact on the economy, and Looney’s plan to shift the fossil-fuel company to green energy.After a huge second-quarter loss of $16.8 billion and dividend cut of 50% to 5.25 cents, BP announced that it will cut oil and gas production by at least 1 million barrels a day by 2030, a 40% reduction on 2019 levels, and invest up to $5 billion a year into green energy. CNN reports:BP’s plan to pivot away from oil after a century of exploration will involve major investments into bioenergy, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. It is also targeting 70,000 electric vehicle charging points, up from 7,500 at present. At the same time, BP will reduce its oil and gas refining portfolio and aims to raise $25 billion by selling assets over the next five years.Looney said the move toward green energy is in the long-term interest of its stakeholders. Mel Evans, senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:BP has woken up to the immediate need to cut carbon emissions this decade. Slashing oil and gas production and investing in renewable energy is what Shell and the rest of the oil industry needs to do for the world to stand a chance of meeting our global climate targets. BP must go further, and needs to account for or ditch its share in Russian oil company, Rosneft. But this is a necessary and encouraging start.In its first corporate sustainability report, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) says it’s on track to reduce emissions by 70% below 2005 levels by 2030. It shut down its last operating unit at its Paradise Fossil Plant in western Kentucky in February, as Electrek reported.The federally owned utility was created during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal in 1933 to bring power and economic development to one of the areas of the US hit hardest by the Great Depression.TVA has already cut its carbon output by 60% in the past 15 years and is planning on adding more solar.

The TVA responded that all of its employees comply with federal requirements, which is that almost all federal jobs on US soil require applicants to be US citizens unless the skill set can only be matched by a foreign citizen. But its CEO, Jeff Lyash, is now reconsidering the layoffs.An Architects’ Journal campaign backed by 14 Stirling Prize winners is calling for incentives to renovate older buildings rather than demolish them. That’s because the construction of new buildings creates a lot of carbon emissions.The campaign calls for the government to change the tax rules that make it cheaper to demolish and rebuild than refurbish an existing building. Value-added tax on refurbishment is 20%, while it’s zero on new builds.According to the BBC:The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) estimates that 35% of the lifecycle carbon from a typical office development is emitted before the building is even opened. It says the figure for residential premises is 51%.Architects’ Journal managing editor Will Hurst said:It’s crazy that the government actually incentivizes practices that create more carbon emissions. Also, if you avoid demolition you make carbon savings right now, which we really need.In the past the government argued that the EU would forbid zero VAT on renovation — but they can’t use that excuse now.The Commons Environmental Audit Committee will review the Architects’ Journal campaign and report back on its findings.",solar
2020/08/03,"Seventy-eight percent of Americans are concerned about their summer energy costs, but only 6 out of 10 are taking steps to reduce energy consumption, according to a new survey of 1,362 Americans by SurveyMonkey and machine-learning technology company Sense, whose products monitor energy use. Nearly all Americans (91%) are staying home more this summer as a result of COVID-19.But the study revealed that a lot of Americans aren’t actually taking steps to reduce their energy bills. And only a fraction of Americans know exactly how much their air conditioner is increasing their utility bill.Less than half (44%) plan to turn up their thermostat settings, which is one of the simplest ways to reduce summer energy bills. A whopping 90% prefer to set their thermostats below 78F, the temperature recommended by the US Department of Energy to stay comfortable while minimizing your utility bill. In fact, the most popular setting was a frigid — and not climate-friendly — 68 to 72F.For those who are trying to cut costs, the most popular energy-saving method is to use fans rather than air conditioning (55%), while 35% plan to turn off their AC entirely and open windows. (Fans use a lot less energy than AC.) Further, only 24% have or plan to install a smart or programmable thermostat for the first time, and only 10% plan to install a home energy monitor.Here are some ways Americans can reduce their energy bills in the summer heat:Parcel giant DPD, headquartered in France, has increased its number of electric vans in the UK from just over 130 at the start of 2020 to more than 700. That makes DPD the biggest electric delivery fleet in the UK. More than 10% of its UK fleet is now electric.Further, the company will trial a fully electric 16-tonne delivery truck in London — the Volta Zero — in early 2021. DPD aims to open five more all-electric parcel depots across London in addition to the three it already has. Dwain McDonald, DPD’s CEO, said that it wants to electrify even faster, but that the company is having a problem sourcing EVs:We would like even more of our new vehicles to be green EVs — we just can’t get our hands on enough of them at the moment.We are calling on the government, and the vehicle manufacturers to do everything they can to encourage the development of more EVs, at affordable prices, so that progressive companies, like us, can become even greener, even quicker.Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson announced plans to decarbonize Scotland’s rail passenger services by 2035 last week. It’s known as the Rail Services Decarbonisation Action Plan.The plan will remove diesel passenger trains from Scottish services between 2025-2035 and speed up line electrification and the rollout of such green power sources as hydrogen and electric battery-powered trains.The Scottish government plans to electrify an average of 130 single track-km per year to reach its 2035 target. As the International Railway Journal explains:Since 2010, around £1 billion has been invested in the electrification of 441 track-km, with electrified services increasing by around 23% since 2018 alone. Around 76% of all passenger journeys [are] now taken on electric services, as well as 45% of all freight services. Lines [that] have already been electrified include the Edinburgh–Glasgow lines via Shotts and Falkirk, and the Stirling–Dunblane/Alloa line.The plan points out the benefits of electrification, such as faster journey times, improved intercity connectivity, lower operating costs, and improved air and sound quality. And let’s not forget a reduction in carbon emissions.The Scottish government plans to reach 75% net zero by 2030, 90% by 2040, and 100% by 2045.Photo: Ava Sol/Unsplash",solar
2020/07/31,"Carlisle in Cumbria will be the first city in the UK to have a road partially built out of waste plastic. More than 3,000 square meters of the road network will be repaved on Lowther Street in the city center (pictured above).Asphalt specialist MacRebur is working with Cumbria County Council and will use around 240,000 single-use plastic bags that would otherwise have ended up in landfill. The plastic will be processed and combined with asphalt to resurface the road.According to MacRebur, plastic in asphalt will be more resistant to movement, reducing cracks and potholes. The plastic also replaces some of the bitumen in the asphalt, lowering the use of fossil fuels and cutting emissions.Cumbria received £1.6 million, as one of eight projects selected, to carry out tests using new technology on local roads in an innovation program called ADEPT SMART Places Live Labs. The Lowther Street resurfacing project will cost around £150,000.MacRebur CEO Toby McCartney said:Implementing waste plastic roads across the country would provide a real opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of road construction.A coalition of organizations representing EV charging hardware and software companies, light-to-heavy-duty EV manufacturers, and aligned non-governmental communities sent a letter to congressional leaders this week — Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) — asking for the following EV incentives in the latest pandemic stimulus package:Our organizations support focusing COVID-19 recovery funding on infrastructure investments that would immediately accelerate job growth and unlock private investment in a cleaner refueling economy and promote a diverse, competitive market place for consumers.Specifically, we ask that you include the following policies in any economic recovery package that Congress may be considering:Establish a rebate program to stimulate private investment in electric vehicle charginginfrastructure in workplaces, multifamily housing, and commercial locations incommunities across the country, as contemplated by Section 33332 of H.R. 2.Extend the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Investment Tax Credit (ITC),which is known as “30C” and increase the cap on business investments to ensure that theITC can be applied to each item of refueling property, as contemplated by the SecuringAmerica’s Clean Fuels Infrastructure Act (S.3735). As with other clean energy taxcredits, allowing for direct payment or refundability to facilitate monetizing tax creditswould enable 30C to be effective in the immediate term, creating additional jobs alongwith the incremental infrastructure deployed.The letter then continued:Providing clear incentives to accelerate industry investment in a competitive and sustainable refueling economy will create thousands of jobs in the auto industry and the EV charging ecosystem, while helping the environment and the American public.The signatories on this coalition letter are Rivian, NEMA, CALSTART, Electrify America, EVgo, ABB, and ChargePoint. Tesla is not part of the coalition because CEO Elon Musk believes that a stimulus package isn’t in the best interest of consumers, but if there is one, it should be a direct payment to consumers. Musk is in favor of universal basic income.Yet Tesla benefited from the government’s original coronavirus stimulus program. Tesla’s second quarter financial filing released Tuesday said:As part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally, we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results.Brussels-based ChargeUp Europe is an alliance representing the EV charging infrastructure sector. It was formed to accelerate the switch to zero emission mobility, and it’s just gained its newest, and eighth member, Energias de Portugal (EDP).ChargeUp Europe founding members Allego, ChargePoint, and EVBox (all based in the Netherlands) have now been joined by GreenWay (Slovakia), Fastned (Netherlands), evway by Route220 (Italy), has·to·be (Austria), and EDP (Portugal).Headquartered in Lisbon, EDP is a multinational utility company with a presence in 19 countries across four continents.

2020/07/30,"The town of Bremervörde in Lower Saxony, Germany, has broken ground on the world’s first hydrogen filling station for passenger trains. Chemical company Linde will construct and operate the hydrogen filling station for the Lower Saxony Regional Transport Company.The station has a daily capacity of approximately 1,600kg of hydrogen, and it will replace the current mobile filling station, according to Railway Technology.Construction is expected to start in September, and the station’s completion is planned for mid-2021.Germany rolled out the world’s first hydrogen-powered Coradia iLint trains, built by French TGV-maker Alstom, in September 2018, in Lower Saxony. The first two trains completed their 18-month test phase in February. They can run for around 600 miles on a single tank of hydrogen. The region is expected to add 14 more hydrogen trains from 2021.Hydrogen trains are more expensive to buy than diesel, but cheaper to run — and of course, much better for the environment. The Guardian explains how they work:Hydrogen trains are equipped with fuel cells that produce electricity through a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, a process that leaves steam and water as the only emissions. Excess energy is stored in ion lithium batteries on board the train.Oil giant Shell and Dutch utility Eneco have won the tender to build a super-hybrid offshore wind farm in the Netherlands. It will consist of two sites located 11.5 miles (18.5 km) off the west coast, near the town of Egmond aan Zee.The Shell/Eneco consortium, CrossWind, will build the Hollandse Kust (noord) project. They will pair the offshore wind farms with floating solar facilities and short-duration batteries. It will also generate green hydrogen via an electrolyzer, according to GreenTech Media. Hollandse Kust (noord) is expected to be operational in 2023 with an installed capacity of 759 MW, generating at least 3.3 TWh per year.Maarten Wetselaar, director of Shell Integrated Gas and New Energies, said:Offshore wind will play a pivotal role in the worldwide energy transition. It will also be another important next step in our ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner, in step with society.The Netherlands intends to reach around 11 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030, and Shell wants to build a green hydrogen plant in Rotterdam.North Dakota will spend $66 million to plug abandoned oil and gas wells as a result of the pandemic fossil-fuel crash. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division is undertaking the project.The money will be provided by the Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.“Well plugging is expected to sustain more than 600 oil and gas service sector jobs, with 300 to 500 additional jobs managing reclamation of the sites,” according to North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources. The Department continues:This project will keep skilled workforce in the state and our neighbors who invested in starting oilfield service companies in business. When fully and properly reclaimed, the wells and sites that have already been confiscated as a part of this process will return over 2,000 acres of land to farming, grazing, or personal use for North Dakota surface owners.Photo: Alstom",solar
2020/07/29,"Randolph County in eastern Indiana has adopted a first-ever solar energy ordinance that includes a pollinator-friendly provision ahead of the construction of Indiana’s largest solar farm.EDP Renewables’ Riverstart Solar Park will have an installed capacity of 200 megawatts (MW), which is capable of powering around 36,000 homes. The project will cost $180 million and create hundreds of full-time jobs during construction and several permanent jobs.Riverstart includes a land stewardship provision that requires the groundcover of this solar farm, and future solar farms in Randolph County, to be native meadow grasses and pollinator-friendly wildflower plants and/or clover. This is to encourage the presence and health of bees, which are crucial for pollination.Purdue University entomologist Dr. Brock Harpur wrote in a letter to county officials ahead of the decision (via Solar Power World):A recent study found that more than 50,000 acres of our Indiana conservation lands — healthy habitat for wildlife — were converted to row crop fields over an eight-year period. During this same time, the health of Indiana pollinators has plummeted. Native pollinator species numbers are lower than the number needed to pollinate crops, and managed species, such as honey bees, experience greater than average losses each year (as many as 63% of colonies are lost annually in Indiana). Among the primary causes of pollinator decline is habitat loss.Conservation groups Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever said:Large-scale solar projects proposed in Indiana have, so far, overlooked a critical opportunity to provide additional — and urgently needed — agricultural and ecological benefits. We see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to encourage land use and stewardship practices that provide healthy food sources for beneficial insects and improve the quality of our precious Indiana soils.Randolph County, Indiana, is to be commended for making such a simple yet incredibly impactful decision. Not only is it adapting solar, which provides clean energy for hundreds of thousands of homes, it’s using that land efficiently by requiring bee-friendly plants. Bees are crucial for human existence. As Greenpeace USA points out, “Seventy out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90% of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.” Honey bees perform around 80% of all pollination worldwide.Humans are largely responsible for the two main causes of the decimation of the bee population with pesticides and habitat loss. So to create a new habitat is a great initiative, and it should be encouraged everywhere.Photo by Pixabay on Pexels.com",solar

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/07/27,"Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) introduced a bill last week to support communities who have suffered job losses as a result of the death of the coal industry.The bill would invest in creating new jobs for former coal workers and create support for those suffering from black lung. Further, the bill would expand Medicare to coal workers who lost their jobs, guarantee free higher education for miners and their families, provide federal home-buying assistance, restore the environment of coal communities, increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and create a redevelopment office. It would require that coal companies pay for health and pensions to their workers and clean up mines before they compensate executives. United Mineworkers of America President Cecil Roberts urged both political parties to support it:This is the first legislation we have seen that takes aim at the tremendous economic problems that already exist in the coalfields of America. Senator Duckworth’s bill is comprehensive and includes several programs and initiatives that would have strong, positive impacts on economically depressed communities in the coalfields, as well as dislocated workers and their families.Duckworth said: Mineworkers spent their days in difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions to provide a good life for their families and help the rest of our country succeed. We can’t afford to leave them behind, which is why I’m introducing legislation to invest in their health and economic security while restoring and securing the future of their communities.The bill does not yet have any co-sponsors.On Sunday, parents involved in Mothers Rise Up and Parents for Future UK gathered outside 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister’s residence. They held bamboo “wind turbines” to symbolize the low-carbon pandemic recovery they want.More than 100 high-profile parents also sent an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking that the response to the COVID-19 will “create jobs for our children today and help ensure a safe climate tomorrow.”The letter letter asks Johnson not to “build our way out of one disaster by supercharging the next.” It was signed by economists, business leaders, scientists, union leaders, musicians, religious leaders, actors, teachers, and doctors, according to the Independent. The letter states:Millions more decent jobs could be rapidly created across the UK through a nationwide program of insulating homes, installing electric vehicle charging  points, re-establishing woodlands, and boosting the rollout of renewable energies.NextEra Energy, the largest developer and operator of wind, solar and battery plants in North America, is planning to build its first green hydrogen plant. Through its Florida Power & Light utility, NextEra wants to locate the $65 million green hydrogen pilot project in Florida. The plant would use a 20-megawatt electrolyzer to produce 100% green hydrogen from solar. The project could be online by 2023 if state regulators approve it. If the pilot is successful, Florida Power & Light would likely retrofit some of its gas facilities.NextEra Energy CFO Rebecca Kujawa said:When we looked at this five or 10 years ago and thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions, we were worried it was extraordinarily expensive for customers.What makes us really excited about hydrogen — particularly in the 2030 and beyond timeframe — is the potential to supplement a significant deployment of renewables [and energy storage]. That last amount of emissions you’d take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen.Green hydrogen is made using green energy to power the electrolysis of water, and that creates no emissions.Photo: Brookings Institution",solar

In February, the UK moved its ICE car sales ban forward to 2035 from 2040, and the country is actively pursuing renewable energy incentives such as wind. The National Grid is expecting at least 3GW of new wind and 1.4GW of solar every year from now until 2050.The UK electricity grid’s carbon emissions could turn negative by 2033 if carbon capture technology and green energy is used, the National Grid said today.

2020/07/24,"The US House and Senate have both passed a historic conservation and public lands bill, the Great American Outdoors Act, which is expected to be signed into law by Donald Trump. It funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which was set up in the 1960s and has been chronically underfunded.The Great American Outdoors Act provides up to $9.5 billion over five years to address priority repairs in national parks and on other public lands. Revenue from renewable energy and fossil-fuel drilling on federal lands and in federal waters will provide the funding. (And yes, we at Electrek want them to stop the fossil-fuel drilling.)The National Park Service will receive 70% of funds, the US Forest Service will receive 15%, and the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Bureau of Indian Education schools will each receive 5%. It will create thousands of jobs.The LWCF is now permanently funded, and it keeps forests intact and preserves open spaces and wetlands.Kabir Green, director of Federal Affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:This is a bright spot for the country at a very difficult time. It’s an investment in jobs that will protect and maintain our public lands and waters — something that is all the more urgent as communities everywhere experience continuing fallout from the climate crisis. Supporting wildlife management and investing in our forests enhances biodiversity and will help sequester some of the carbon that fuels climate change.A new study published in Joule titled, “The Impact of COVID-19-Related Measures on the Solar Resource in Areas with High Levels of Air Pollution,” found that clearer skies had a measurable impact on the output from solar PV panels. As PV Buzz points out:The researchers say this is the first study to demonstrate and quantify the impact of the reduced air pollution on solar output. The researchers focused on Delhi, India, due to the city’s high levels of pollution. They initially identified an approximate 10% reduction in output from solar in Delhi due to its air pollution.However, after the pandemic shutdown in Delhi, pollution levels dropped by about 50%. As a result, the total output from the solar panels was increased by 8.3% in late March (India went into lockdown on March 24), and by 5.9% in April.Ian Marius Peters, one of the researchers on the study, said:[Solar] is helping not only yourself, not only putting money in your pocket, but it’s also helping everybody else out there who already has solar panels installed, as well as everyone else who will install them over the next 20 years.[This effect] is true anywhere where you have some kind of air pollution. If you reduce it, it will have beneficial consequences for solar panels.The city of Oxford in the UK is trialing what it claims is the first “purpose-built fully integrated” electric refuse collection vehicle built by a British original equipment manufacturer. Succinctly put, it’s a bin lorry, or garbage truck for all you Americans out there.The vehicle is produced by Warwickshire-based truck manufacturer Dennis Eagle, with support from the government-backed Energy Superhub Oxford initiative.Oxford City Council’s Oxford Direct Services (ODS), which manages waste collection, is expecting to purchase the zero emission garbage truck in the fall, if all goes well with the trial. The plan is to replace all 27 of the city’s diesel bin lorries with e-bin lorries. That could save 750 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. And bonus: The e-bin lorries are a lot quieter than the diesel bin lorries.According to Business Green, Maria Warner, waste and recycling services manager at ODS, said:That’s why we want to start doing the right thing now — imagine when all the vehicles in the city, not just ours, are electric, what a difference this will make to air, not to mention noise pollution.ODS installed 32 fast 22kW EV chargers and the city’s first 50kW rapid charger at its depot in July.Photo: Sojy John/Unsplash",solar
2020/07/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed new emissions standards for airlines. Sounds great, right? Except here’s the hitch: The standards don’t push the airlines beyond emissions limits that they already set for themselves in 2016 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) — and that they already meet.As the New York Times explains:Critics say the substance of the proposal does little more than codify a set of standards largely created by the aviation industry itself, and is unlikely to diminish the industry’s contribution to global warming.In other words, it’s a sleight of hand by EPA head Andrew Wheeler to just avoid a lawsuit from environmental groups by preventing non-compliance of the US federal government with a legal requirement that it regulate airplane emissions.Further — and this is probably the biggest driver of Wheeler’s decision — countries could ban US-assembled airplanes if they do not meet ICAO standards.Clare Lakewood, climate legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said:This toothless proposal does nothing to meaningfully address the serious problem of airplanes’ planet-warming pollution.Lakewood said the EPA was not estimating any emissions reductions as a result of the “new” emissions standards.

New wind and solar installations and favorable weather conditions drove wind and solar output in the first half of 2020. That growing green energy and a drop in energy demand due to the pandemic caused fossil fuel usage to fall. Wind rose by 11%, solar by 16%, and hydro by 12%.

Every EU country that still uses coal saw a fall in coal generation: Germany led in absolute terms with a drop in coal of 31TWh (39%), Poland (12%), Czech Republic (20%), Bulgaria (20%), and Romania (40%). The highest percentage drop of coal use occurred in the following countries:And Austria and Sweden closed its last coal plants in March.

Further, reports PV magazine:This first solicitation has the potential to bring New York State halfway toward its goal of 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035, while also providing significant headway towards New York State’s mandate to secure 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable energy by 2030.Cuomo said:During one of the most challenging years New York has ever faced, we remain laser-focused on implementing our nation-leading climate plan and growing our clean energy economy, not only to bring significant economic benefits and jobs to the state, but to quickly attack climate change at its source by reducing our emissions.",solar

The awkward member is Poland, who refused to commit to the 2050 climate target at an EU summit in December.Dave Jones, senior electricity analyst at Ember, said:This marks a symbolic moment in the transition of Europe’s electricity sector. Renewables generated more electricity than fossil fuels, driven by wind and solar replacing coal. That’s fast progress from just nine years ago when fossil fuels generated twice as much as renewables.Ember summarizes:It’s now clear that Europe’s coal-to-clean transition is happening quicker than most people expected. On one hand COVID-19 has slowed new wind and solar installations this year, but on the other hand it has shown us that our electricity grids can cope with record shares of wind and solar on the electricity grid, although some inflexibilities have been exposed. Renewables have proved more resilient than fossil fuels in the face of this crisis.Ember’s findings were reinforced by Global Energy Monitor researchers.

Exports in that time period were expected to have reached 33-35 GW.China is the largest producer and buyer of solar panels in the world.The Dutch government’s Socio-Economic Council (SER), an independent advisory board of the Dutch government made up of entrepreneurs, employees, and independent experts, said in a July report that the Netherlands should phase out the use of biomass for generating electricity as soon as possible.Euractiv reports:In the chemical industry, the building sector, and agriculture, biological materials are crucial for the transition to a circular economy, the council writes. But sustainably produced biomass is too scarce to keep using it for the production of heat or electricity, for which other low-carbon and renewable alternatives exist.The SER also says that the billions’ worth of subsidies intended for biomass combustion plants should be phased out as well, and companies who lose out should be compensated.The Dutch government will use the advice to put together a “sustainability framework” for bio-resources.

(BP says it’s aiming to be net zero by 2050 — but it won’t drop fossil fuels.) BP has bought half the wind farm from Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy, making it now the full owner. Fowler Ridge is about 30 miles northwest of Lafayette.According to Inside Indiana Business, Fowler Ridge 1 farm includes 162 wind turbines that can generate 300 megawatts of power.BP now operates the Fowler Ridge 1, 2, and 3 farms that encompass 355 turbines on 42,000 acres. The farms can power 160,000 homes a year. BP is a 50/50 joint partner with AEP Renewables on Fowler Ridge 2.This will increase BP’s wind generation capacity across the US by more than 15%, totaling 1,076 MW of energy. It now operates 970 wind turbines on nine wind farms in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota. It also has a stake in a tenth wind farm in Hawaii. Those wind farms generate enough green energy to power 450,000 homes.BP Wind Energy CEO Al Vickers said:This reflects our confidence in renewable energy, and the possibility for further growth in this sector.",solar
2020/07/21,"Americans’ homes are energy hogs. This is because houses in the US are much larger than houses in other countries, says a new study from University of Michigan researchers. Further, larger, wealthier US households produce around 25% more emissions than their lower-income counterparts in smaller homes.For example, according to 2010 data from the World Energy Council (via Shrink That Footprint):In the US, typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh, and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.The University of Michigan study looked at 93 million homes’ 2015 tax assessor records. The researchers examined houses’ size, age, location, and construction date. The study states that the average US home consumed 147 kilowatt-hours per square meter (kWh/m2) in 2015.The study’s abstract states:Grid decarbonization will be insufficient to meet the 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 due to a growing housing stock and continued use of fossil fuels (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil) in homes. Meeting this target will also require deep energy retrofits and transitioning to distributed low-carbon energy sources, as well as reducing per capita floor space and zoning denser settlement patterns.Benjamin Goldstein, a co-author of the study, says Americans need to rethink how they live:Structural change is going to be important and necessary. We need to have denser and smaller homes.Reuters reports that home sizes have been trending downward since 2015, according to builders, and congressional Democrats unveiled a climate policy blueprint earlier this month that calls for an update of building codes to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Further, there is a growing movement to ban natural gas in new homes; San Francisco recently proposed this measure.And why wouldn’t Americans want to reduce energy consumption right now? In addition to the importance of reducing emissions, people are spending more time at home than ever due to the pandemic, so they’re using more electricity at home, and money is tight for a lot of households.There are a lot of ways to reduce energy consumption and emissions, such as better insulation and either installing rooftop solar or joining a community green energy plan such as Arcadia. Further, turn your air conditioning temperature up this summer and get a smart thermostat.But let’s take a look at some energy-efficient appliances, which have been thrown into the political spotlight recently by Donald Trump as being ineffective. Snopes rated Trump’s claim as false. Here’s how they actually reduce a household’s energy consumption without compromising quality:Toilets: Peter Gleick with the Pacific Institute in Oakland said, “New toilets not only use a tiny fraction of the water the old toilets used to use, but the truth is they flush better — and if you have a bad toilet that doesn’t flush, well, that’s because you have a bad toilet.”Showerheads and faucets: As the Lebanon Democrat reports, “Standard shower heads use up to 8 gallons of hot, steaming water per minute. With a new, low-flow shower head, you will only use 1 to 2 gallons of water per minute. Faucet aerators cost about $5 and work much the same way. You probably won’t notice a difference, but you will on your utility bill.”Water heaters: These use up a lot of your household electricity. Replace old models with tankless water heaters if possible, and comparison shop — here’s Consumer Reports‘ take on the most efficient water heaters. And in the meantime, turn your water heater temperature down to 120F. It’s plenty hot, and it will cut water heating cost by 6% to 10%.Dishwashers: Today’s dishwashers currently use 5 gallons of water per cycle — half the amount of water and energy that standard dishwashers consumed 20 years ago, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. And they clean dishes just fine. Soil sensors in most machines ensure dishwashers take only as long as they need to clean dishes.Light bulbs: Using incandescents are a waste of money and energy. Again, according to the NRDC:LED light bulbs work great and consumers like the light they provide. LEDs are better than incandescents because they use up to 85% less energy to produce the same amount of light. They last 10 to 25 years while incandescents burn out and need to be replaced every year or two. An LED bulb sips rather than gulps electricity, saving consumers $50 to $100 over its lifetime.",solar

The company’s global corporate operations are already net zero. And this new initiative means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will be carbon neutral.In Apple’s 2020 Environmental Progress Report, it lays out its plans to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030 while developing carbon removal solutions for the remaining 25% of its footprint.Included in the plan is Apple’s Impact Accelerator, which “will focus on investing in minority-owned businesses that drive positive outcomes in its supply chain and in communities that are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards.” It’s part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.The tech giant has laid out a detailed, bullet-pointed Climate Roadmap, which can be read here.On the green energy front, “Apple will remain at 100% renewable energy for its operations — focusing on creating new projects and moving its entire supply chain to clean power.” For example, Apple and 10 of its suppliers in China are investing nearly $300 million to develop projects totaling 1 gigawatt (GW) of green energy (pictured above), and new and completed projects in Arizona, Oregon, and Illinois bring Apple’s renewable corporate operations capacity to over 1GW.The European Union today agreed to a €1 trillion, seven-year stimulus package in response to the pandemic after a nearly five-day summit. How much of a part are green energy and climate change playing in the plan?30% of the entire package is going toward fighting climate change. The plan mandates that all spending must contribute to EU emissions-cutting goals.The Just Transition Fund, whose mission is to “alleviate the socio-economic impacts of the green transition in the regions most affected,” will now receive a combined €17.5 billion, instead of the original €37.5 billion. Reuters explains:To access the money, countries must commit to the EU’s goal to become “climate neutral” by 2050 — a condition aimed squarely at Poland. The coal-heavy country is expected to receive the largest chunk of the Just Transition Fund, and was the only country which refused to commit to the 2050 climate target at an EU summit in December.InvestEU, which was intended to help meet green goals, got a big cut — from €31 billion to €4 billion.There will be an EU-wide tax on non-recycled plastic waste scheduled for 2021. Further, there will be levies on polluting imports by 2023, and a scheme to use carbon market revenues to shore up EU funds will be considered in the future.The plan doesn’t yet specify spending safeguards, but it does say that spending must adhere to the principle to “do no harm” to EU green goals. Those safeguards must be put in place to ensure successful implementation of a green stimulus plan.Americans tend to live in abnormally large houses compared to most other countries, and as a result, they’re energy hogs, says a new study from University of Michigan researchers. Further, wealthier US households emit around 25% more than their lower-income counterparts in smaller homes.The study looked at 93 million homes’ 2015 tax assessor records. This included examining houses’ size, age, location, and date of construction. Geographical results varied: East and West Coast homes emitted less than those in the Midwest.The study’s abstract states:Grid decarbonization will be insufficient to meet the 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 due to a growing housing stock and continued use of fossil fuels (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil) in homes. Meeting this target will also require deep energy retrofits and transitioning to distributed low-carbon energy sources, as well as reducing per capita floor space and zoning denser settlement patterns.Reuters reports, however, that home sizes have been trending downward since 2015, according to builders, and congressional Democrats unveiled a climate policy blueprint earlier this month that calls for an update of building codes to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Further, there is a growing movement to ban natural gas in new homes; San Francisco recently proposed this measure.Benjamin Goldstein, a study co-author, says Americans need to rethink how they live:Structural change is going to be important and necessary. We need to have denser and smaller homes.Photo: Apple",solar

It’s part of the plan to make London carbon neutral by 2050.The Tube consumes 1.2 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually. A study by British Business Energy found that it would take 200 wind turbines or 5.6 million solar panels to power the complete network for a year.The Underground is already drawing 16% of its energy from green energy sources. London City Hall has released the Tube’s energy requirements so that it can purchase electricity from green energy suppliers.The Transport for London (TfL) network, which also includes buses, trams, and overground trains, is London’s biggest electricity consumer at 1.6TWh annually, and one of the largest consumers in the UK. The city wants to expand green energy to the entire network, as well as police and fire services.London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said:This work to secure cost-effective and renewable energy for the rail network, with ambitions to include the wider [Greater London Authority] group and beyond, will play a key role in London’s green recovery and accelerating action on the climate emergency.Air conditioning plays an important part in many climates as the planet warms. But as the United Nations reports:Many air-conditioning units emit carbon dioxide, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons (which have thousands of times the warming potential of carbon dioxide), and increasing demand for cooling is contributing significantly to climate change.The solution? Stop using poorly made ACs, and make air conditioners twice as efficient as they are now. And this would make a significant contribution to keeping to the Paris Agreement targets of a global temperature rise of 1.5C by 2050. If we do that:The Cooling Emissions and Policy Synthesis Report, from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), shows that up to 460 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions — roughly the amount produced over an eight-year period — could be cut over the next four decades.Countries can implement minimum energy performance standards, introduce building codes that ensure homes and offices are well insulated and require less cooling, and make temperature-controlled food supply chains more efficient and sustainable.Sixty-five countries ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which came into affect on January 1, 2019. It will reduce the projected production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years. This can can avoid up to 0.4C of global warming by the end of this century.In the meantime, if you’ve got air conditioning, turn your temperature warmer by even a couple degrees. It’ll save energy and reduce emissions.UK-headquartered Vodafone says it will move its European mobile network to 100% green electricity by July 2021.As Business Green reports:The telecoms giant on Friday said it aimed to operate a ‘Green Gigabit Net’ for its customers across 11 European markets powered only [by] electricity from wind, solar, and hydro sources within 12 months, covering countries including the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece.Roughly 80% of the energy used by Vodafone’s fixed and mobile networks will be supplied by renewables via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green electricity tariffs, it explained, with the remained covered by ‘credible’ Renewable Energy Certificates.Around one-third of Vodafone’s network is currently powered by green energy. Moving to 100% green energy by 2021 is three years ahead of the company’s original target.Vodafone said that mobile network base stations and data centers account for 95% of Vodafone’s energy consumption. One base station uses around 78kWh of electricity per day. That’s around the same amount of battery power used in a Tesla Model 3 to travel around 300 miles.Photo: Nick Fewings/Unsplash",solar

Rockefeller, and president of the Rockefeller Family Fund from 2015 to 2019, has died at age 50 of brain cancer.Kaiser was a climate change activist who used his inherited wealth to fight for causes he believed in, such as #ExxonKnew. For an heir of an oil company to confront Exxon Mobil, a successor company to the Rockefeller oil monopoly, was extraordinary. According to the New York Times, journalist and climate change activist Bill McKibben said of Kaiser:It’s hard enough to get anyone to take on powerful interests, but when they’re the powerful interest from which your family derived its wealth, that’s really brave. I can’t think of anything like it in history.In 2016, the Rockefeller Family Fund, under Mr. Kaiser’s leadership, decided to divest from fossil fuels. They posted on their website:While the global community works to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, it makes little sense — financially or ethically — to continue holding investments in these companies. There is no sane rationale for companies to continue to explore for new sources of hydrocarbons. The science and intent enunciated by the Paris Agreement cannot be more clear: Far from finding additional sources of fossil fuels, we must keep most of the already discovered reserves in the ground if there is any hope for human and natural ecosystems to survive and thrive in the decades ahead.The New York Times also wrote that John Passacantando, a philanthropy consultant and a climate-change activist, said in an interview that Kaiser had “done more to change the landscape in the climate fight than anything I have seen in 30 years.”Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) announced late yesterday that New York State will spend $701 million for EV infrastructure and other initiatives in the “EV Made Ready” program. That funds 53,773 Level 2 charging stations and 1,500 Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) stations by 2025.The remaining $48.8 million, which comes from a 2017 settlement with Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) over its diesel emissions cheating scandal, will pay for charging stations and electric school and transit buses.$206 million of the $701 million will be allocated to equitable access and benefits for lower socioeconomic and disadvantaged communities. Further, $85 million will fund three innovative clean transport prize competitions.The EV Make-Ready Program will be funded by investor-owned utilities in New York State. Utilities will cover 90% of the cost of make-ready infrastructure for publicly accessible chargers, 50% for restricted, and 100% in disadvantaged communities.A federal court in California rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to overturn the 2016 Methane Waste Prevention Rule late on Wednesday. The court called the agency action “backwards,” “fickle,” “defectively promulgated,” and “wholly inadequate.”The Waste Prevention Rule was implemented to stop the unnecessary leaking of air pollution from oil and gas facilities on public lands by requiring measures to limit methane venting, flaring, and leaking.A coalition of around 20 conservation and tribal citizen groups, along with the states of California and New Mexico, sued the US Bureau of Land Management in 2018 over its rollback of the rule.The oil and gas sector is the largest US industrial emitter of methane, which is the second-biggest driver of climate change after carbon dioxide.Lissa Lynch, attorney for the Climate and Clean Energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:The Waste Prevention Rule is a common-sense protection that holds the oil and gas industry accountable for uncontrolled leaking of methane — pollution that harms public health and fuels climate change. This blistering opinion is yet another in a string of court rulings telling the Trump administration that no matter how badly it wants to, it can’t ignore procedural requirements and simply throw out safeguards without relying on science and giving the public a meaningful opportunity to weigh in.Photo: Sasha Maslov, STR",solar
2020/07/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Portugal has ended its coal-burning two years ahead of schedule. It’s the third EU country to close its coal plants early in 2020, after Austria and Sweden. Belgium was the first EU country to end coal, in 2016.Portuguese energy utility EDP announced the closure of its Sines coal power plant, which emitted 13.5% of all carbon dioxide in Portugal. Sines (pictured) is south of Lisbon, on the coast. EDP will close one more plant and convert another unit in Spain. The utility is now evaluating the development of a green hydrogen production project in Sines, according to its website.Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, acting executive president of EDP, said:The decision to anticipate the closure of coal power plants in the Iberian Peninsula is thus a natural consequence of this energy transition process, in line with European carbon neutral targets and with the political will to anticipate these deadlines. In this process, in which people have been a fundamental ally, EDP also guarantees that it will fulfill its commitments to all its workers and collaborate on their training and professional integration.Kathrin Gutmann, director at the Europe Beyond Coal Campaign, said:Portugal had already accelerated its coal phase-[out] from 2030 to 2023. The fact that it is being brought forward yet again to 2021 shows just how fast a country can clean up its energy system when it commits to clean energy and climate action.On January 9, Donald Trump announced there would be an overhaul of the US’ landmark environmental law, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Yesterday, he finalized a rollback of the NEPA.This drastically limits the ability of citizens and communities to learn about and give input on major infrastructure projects that could threaten public health and the environment.NEPA has been in place for 50 years and is considered a bedrock environmental regulation. It requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions.The revised plan establishes two-year time limits for environmental impact statements and one-year limits for weakened environmental assessments. This makes it easier to build highways, pipelines, chemical plants, and other projects that pose environmental risks and restricts the ability of agencies to consider a project’s full impact.Up until now, NEPA has required, with the backing of federal courts, that the federal government considers a project’s carbon footprint when it comes to leasing public lands for fossil-fuel projects. Federal agencies will no longer have to consider the impacts of infrastructure projects on climate change.The Trump plan carries out the wishes of energy companies that have lobbied the government to deregulate what they consider laborious permitting requirements.The German city of Wuppertal partnered with Cologne in 2018 to order 40 hydrogen-powered buses made by Belgian manufacturer Van Hool NV. Cologne is running 30 of them, and the remaining 10 will soon be on the road in Wuppertal. It’s thought to be the largest order for hydrogen buses in Europe.The buses have onboard hydrogen fueling systems equipped with high-pressure composite cylinders. The cylinders store enough compressed hydrogen so that each vehicle has a range of up to 217 miles (350 km). The 3-meter-long composite cylinders sit in a roof-mounted frame, and there are five on each bus. Columbus, Ohio, headquartered Worthington Industries supplied the hydrogen fueling systems.Wuppertal is also building hydrogen refueling stations to support the vehicles.Radiša Nunić, Worthington’s director of European sales, alternative fuels/heavy-duty vehicles and gas transport solutions, said:Buses and heavy-duty trucks are the vanguard market for hydrogen vehicles and will pave the way for adoption of the technology in the passenger vehicle market down the road. Therefore, Worthington is expanding its production capacity for onboard fueling systems in Europe. A new state of the art composite cylinder production facility will open in Austria this summer to supplement the output of our existing plant in Poland.Photo: EDP",solar

Investment in electric vehicles and hydrogen cars plays a major part in that plan.It also aims to cut heavy reliance on fossil fuels. As Reuters reports:The plan set ambitious goals of net-zero emissions by 2050, an end to funding of overseas coal plants, and introduction of a carbon tax.South Korea aims to have 1.13 million electric vehicles and 200,000 hydrogen cars on the roads by 2025, up from 91,000 and 5,000 each by the end of 2019.Hyundai Motor Group leader Euisun Chung said flagship Hyundai Motor and sibling Kia Motors aim to sell 1 million EVs in 2025, together targeting more than a tenth of global market share.Seoul, the capital, is planning to have 4,000 EV charging stations and 65 for hydrogen-powered cars by 2035, up from 1,090 EV stations and the four for hydrogen cars it has now.Shares of Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) jumped nearly 8% today in response to yesterday’s announcements. Kia Motors (000270.KS) rose 4.1%.However, some environmental groups feel not enough is being done. Their full statement can be found here on what is missing from the South Korean plan, but when it comes to ICE cars, Greenpeace Korea said:Although the central government’s support policy to increase the supply of eco-friendly vehicles is welcome, it is regrettable that the road map for discontinuing the sale of internal combustion [vehicles] is not included.On July 9, Electrek reported that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s unity task force proposed broad environmental recommendations to aid his presidential bid. Yesterday, Biden announced his climate crisis plan, with specific and aggressive targets, which boosts green energy and infrastructure as part of his “Build Back Better” agenda.Biden said he would spend $2 trillion over four years on clean energy initiatives. His previous plan called for spending $1.7 trillion on clean energy over 10 years.The task force recommended installing 500 million solar panels and manufacturing 60,000 wind turbines. It also recommended the adoption of “strong standards” for clean cars and trucks and the transition of all school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives within five years. (It does not, however, ban fracking or phase out fossil fuels, and Biden is in favor of nuclear power.)The New York Times writes:Mr. Biden’s plan outlines specific and aggressive targets, including achieving an emissions-free power sector by 2035 and upgrading 4 million buildings over four years to meet the highest standards for energy efficiency.The plan also calls for establishing an office of environmental and climate justice at the Justice Department and developing a broad set of tools to address how ‘environmental policy decisions of the past have failed communities of color.’Biden’s aides said he would pay for it in part by undoing Trump’s tax cuts, raising taxes on wealthy Americans, and increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%.

Today, Biden announced his climate crisis plan, with specific and aggressive targets, which boosts green energy and infrastructure as part of his “Build Back Better” agenda.Biden gave a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, yesterday in which he built on the plans released by his task force last week. As Grist rightly pointed out, it’s the most ambitious climate plan a presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has ever taken into the general election.Biden said in his Wilmington speech:These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of both the American economy and the physical health and safety of the American people.When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is ‘hoax.’ When I think about climate change, the word I think of is ‘jobs.’His plan states on his website:We need millions of construction, skilled trades, and engineering workers to build a new American infrastructure and clean energy economy. These jobs will create pathways for young people and for older workers shifting to new professions, and for people from all backgrounds and all communities.The investments will make sure the communities who have suffered the most from pollution are first to benefit — including low-income rural and urban communities, communities of color, and Native communities.Biden said he would spend $2 trillion over four years on clean energy initiatives. This is a turbo version of his previous plan, which called for spending $1.7 trillion on clean energy over 10 years.The task force recommended installing 500 million solar panels and manufacturing 60,000 wind turbines. It also recommended the adoption of “strong standards” for clean cars and trucks and the transition of all school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives within five years.

Inslee said Biden’s plan was “visionary.”And Americans — in both parties — like green energy. As we previously reported:79% of Americans overall say the country needs to prioritize alternative sources, such as wind and solar, over the expansion of fossil fuel production.Is it possible to boost green energy in an economically viable way? Experts say it’s not just political jargon.Bertrand Piccard, founder and chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, which supports 1,000 profitable solutions that protect the environment, said during a virtual event for US-based cleantech innovators:Today it is possible to protect the environment in a financially profitable way. Ten years ago it wasn’t, but today it is.It’s realistic to create jobs in manufacturing, mobility, construction, infrastructure, agriculture and other industries throughout society, supporting both financial profit and the environment.(As an aside, Donald Trump has not signed into law any major infrastructure plans.)In a statement to NBC News, Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund CEO and president Gina McCarthy said that Biden’s plan “by a long shot is the most ambitious we have ever seen from any president in our nation’s history,” a result of him listening to numerous concerns from groups across the country that pushed him make clean energy reforms sooner.How would the government pay for it?

By 2025, this capacity is expected to rise to 25GW. The UK will also connect to Germany and Belgium.Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK’s minister for energy and clean growth, said:It will… bolster our energy security, reduce bills for consumers, and give our homegrown renewable generators a greater chance to export zero-carbon electricity around the world.This is extremely cool. We particularly like the sharing of green energy to balance out the ebb and flow produced by wind and solar. The subsea power cables, known as interconnectors, allow electricity networks to be more adaptable.According to a 2018 paper published in Science Direct, subsea power cable installation increases noise, pollution, turbidity, and physical disturbance. Further, there are uncertainties about electromagnetic field impacts. But overall impacts on ecosystems are considered minor or short-term.The benefits of subsea power cables to exchange green energy outweigh the negatives by far.",solar

2020/07/13,"Last week, the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders climate unity task force put forward a number of recommendations to combat climate change, as Electrek reported on July 9. That followed a huge climate plan from the House Democrats in June to bring the US to net zero by 2050. But are they good preliminary plans?We at Electrek are delighted that there are even plans on the table at the US federal level. Should Biden win the presidency, the new administration can hopefully hit the ground running to implement climate-crisis plans.(And for those who think we’re being politically biased, there simply is no climate-change plan coming from the Republicans, apart from planting trees. They continue to push fossil fuels.)The Democrats’ plan is broad, but it’s a good start. We of course particularly like the significant investment in green energy. We’d like to see a stronger push toward moving entirely to electric vehicles, though, the way that the UK is moving to all EVs, as ICE new-car sales are banned there from 2035.The Washington Post released an op-ed yesterday titled, “Democrats are getting ready to govern responsibly on climate change.” The title implies that the WashPo finds the plan favorable overall, but it would like to see nuclear power kept in the conversation and a carbon tax play a more prominent role. Here’s an excerpt of what its editorial board wrote about the plan. You can read it in full by clicking on the link above:Global warming has not taken a break since the COVID-19 outbreak struck. The Democrats, at least, are treating it like the emergency it remains.If the Democrats win big in November, they would have a shelf fully stocked with pre-written climate policies from which to choose. That alone puts them far ahead of Republicans.To be clear, Democrats deserve credit for listening to scientists on the level of ambition needed, and they have not surrendered to the left flank of the debate, refusing, for example, to strike nuclear power from the conversation. Moreover, the threat of climate change is so large that even second-best policies are better than nothing.

But solar energy firms are finding resilient ways to adapt, and ultimately, solar will prevail.Watch the Reuters video below for an explainer on what’s changed, how companies have adapted, and where rooftop solar is going in the future:Last week, the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders unity climate unity task force put forward a number of recommendations to combat climate change, as Electrek reported on July 9. That followed a huge climate plan from the House Democrats in June.We at Electrek are delighted that there are even plans on the table at the US federal level, and should Biden win the presidency, the new administration can hopefully hit the ground running to implement a plan.(And for those who may think we’re being politically biased, there simply is no climate-change plan coming from the Republicans, apart from planting trees.)The Democrats’ plans are broad, but they’re a good start. We of course particularly like the significant investment in green energy. We’d like to see a stronger push toward moving entirely to electric vehicles, though, the way that the UK is moving to all EVs, as ICE new-car sales are banned from 2035.The Washington Post released an op-ed yesterday titled, “Democrats are getting ready to govern responsibly on climate change.” The title implies the WashPo finds the plan favorable overall. But it would like to see nuclear power kept in the conversation and a carbon tax play a more prominent role. You can read the entire op-ed by clicking on the link above, but here’s a sample of what its editorial board wrote about the plan:Democrats deserve credit for listening to scientists on the level of ambition needed, and they have not surrendered to the left flank of the debate, refusing, for example, to strike nuclear power from the conversation. Moreover, the threat of climate change is so large that even second-best policies are better than nothing. But should he have the chance to govern, Mr. Biden should still aim higher than second-best.China connected a 10MW offshore wind turbine to the grid yesterday — the country’s largest wind turbine to date. The turbine is at Xinghua Bay Wind Farm Phase II off the Fujian province.Dongfang Electric Corporation’s prototype offshore anti-typhoon wind turbine unit is about 115 meters above sea level, installed. It has a rotor diameter of 185 meters and can provide power to 20,000 households annually.Once Dongyang is satisfied with the prototype’s performance, it will mass-produce and install more of them at Fujian’s offshore wind farms.",solar
2020/07/10,"United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres yesterday urged countries to stop financing coal and pledge not to build new coal-fired power plants. Guterres made his statements at an online summit hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which drew over a half-million online viewers.“Coal has no place in COVID-19 recovery plans,” he said. He urged countries to shift to green energy.CNN summarizes:The summit included 40 government ministers from countries around the world, representing 80% of global energy use and emissions. Its aim was to set out plans to reduce global emissions while also boosting economic recovery after COVID-19.He commended governments, such as the EU, Canada, South Korea, and Nigeria, that have committed to green recovery plans. China, which accounts for more than 50% of global coal use, said it was committed to developing its green energy sector.Guterres also called out those governments who have done the opposite:Some countries have used stimulus plans to prop up oil and gas companies that were already struggling financially. Others have chosen to jumpstart coal-fired power plants that don’t make financial or environmental sense.The US’ use of coal in its power mix fell below 20% during the pandemic. US secretary of energy Dan Brouillette attended the IEA’s summit and basically criticized the majority’s approach of linking climate efforts to coronavirus recovery:The top-down approach lets governments do the choosing, which can end up with more taxes, more regulation, perhaps imposing climate risk assessments on companies, so that the government can steer people away from certain energy sources and into the direction of others.He then boasted about the US’ fossil-fuel production — he’s still clinging to his “all-of-the-above” approach to energy. The US has done next to nothing to aid the green energy industry.The IEA stated in its Global Energy Review 2020:We expect global coal demand to fall by about 8% in 2020, the largest drop since World War II, with coal use declining in virtually every sector of every region in the world.The IEA later said, in June, that “failure to act now would risk a repeat of the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, when governments did not prioritize stimulus spending on climate,” CNN writes.Guterres said the business case for green energy renewables was better than coal, and that green jobs and investment in sustainables were vital. He said:We can invest in fossil fuels whose markets are volatile and whose emissions lead to lethal air pollution, or we can invest in renewable energy which is reliable, clean and economically smart.On the industry front, green energy giant Wärtsilä‘s president of energy business Sushil Purohit said:We are hopeful that the IEA Summit will encourage leaders to implement the smart policy needed to scale up existing technologies and accelerate the readiness of emerging technologies — both are needed to underpin the rapid transition to an affordable energy system built with a 100% renewable, flexible energy mix.Of course the United Nations and the IEA can’t make countries invest in green energy and abandon coal. But they serve as a place where countries can convene and coordinate, and have an impact on the decision making of individual countries. Plus, peer pressure often works.It’s vital for the UN to continue to pressure countries to move away from fossil fuels and toward green energy. China is getting the message; the US isn’t listening. So Guterres can’t say it enough.",solar

Green New Deal advocate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and former secretary of state John Kerry lead the group. The Biden-Sanders task force has come up with a series of broad environmental recommendations.On Wednesday, the group proposed the following, according to the Hill:The task force’s broad plan includes a goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035, achieving net-zero emissions for all new buildings by 2030, and making energy-saving upgrades to as many as 4 million buildings and 2 million households within five years.The plan also calls for a significant investment in renewable energy, including installing 500 million solar panels and manufacturing 60,000 wind turbines.The group recommends the adoption of ‘strong standards’ for clean cars and trucks and the transition of all school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives within five years.On July 6, the US District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to be shut down and drained by August 5. The court ordered that the government conduct a rigorous environmental review. But DAPLS’s Dallas-based owner, Energy Transfer LP, refuses to do so.The DAPL is a 1,172-mile-long oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois. The government will examine the risk DAPL poses to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has been fighting the pipeline since 2016.Incredibly, in defiance of the ruling, Energy Transfer’s spokesperson Vicki Granado said in an email to Bloomberg:We believe [Judge James E. Boasberg] exceeded his authority and does not have the jurisdiction to shut down the pipeline or stop the flow of crude oil.So what’s next? Bloomberg explains:Energy Transfer has multiple routine options for fighting the order in court. It’s asking the US District Court for the District of Columbia to suspend the decision, and it’s pursuing an appeal. If those efforts fail, it can ask the US Supreme Court to step in.If Energy Transfer opts to bypass those traditional routes and instead simply refuses to shut down the pipeline, the district court could hold the company in contempt. An outright violation of a court order could result in fines or jail time.Edmonton International Airport in Alberta, Canada, is working on an agreement with Germany’s Alpin Sun to develop Airport City Solar, a 627-acre, 120-megawatt solar farm in a field next to the airport.

He introduced a number of pandemic recovery plans, and said the government wants a “green recovery with concern for our environment at its heart.”The British government will provide £3 billion for decarbonizing housing and public buildings for a year. This will create thousands of jobs.The Guardian gives details:Vouchers worth £5,000 and up to £10,000 for poorer families will be made available out of a £2 billion pot to retrofit homes with insulation, helping to cut carbon emissions. £1 billion will be allocated to make public buildings greener.Now the government has to execute that plan — efficiently.In response to today’s update, Chris Venables, head of politics at independent think tank Green Alliance, emailed Electrek.Today’s speech could mark a really positive first step on the green recovery — but only if this ambition is continued throughout the rest of the year, and particularly in the autumn budget. The chancellor’s commitment to putting the environment at the heart of the recovery is obviously excellent — now we need funding and detail to turn this into reality.We urgently need to see a clear funding strategy for supporting public transport in its time of crisis, a long-term strategy to ensure all buildings are warm and cheap to run, reversing the catastrophic declines in nature, and investing the technology of the future. The jury is still very much out on how green the UK government’s recovery will be — and we’ll be watching over the coming weeks and months.

But the e-bike ad, titled “Time to Ride the Future,” was banned in France by ad regulatory group Autorité de Régulation Professionnelle de la Publicité (ARPP). The reason? ARPP felt it created a “climate of anxiety.” The French advertising code bans the exploitation of fear and suffering in commercials.ARPP president Stéphane Martin wrote in a letter to VanMoof:We cannot afford to denigrate sectors of activity.Some images present in the reflections of the car appear, in our opinion, disproportionate and bring discredit on the whole sector of the automobile sector.Images of factories, chimneys, and crashes create an anxiety-inducing climate. They will, therefore, have to be modified.VanMoof’s founder, Taco Carlier, responded to France banning his company’s ad:It is amazing that car companies are allowed to cover up their environmental problems while censoring those who question this issue.The television commercial was broadcast two weeks earlier in the Netherlands and Germany. There the spot was well received by the public.

It compared usage rates and energy bill totals before and after nationwide pandemic lockdowns began, factoring in average yearly weather fluctuations by city.The company says a drastic increase in energy costs is expected in all 13 cities this summer.Philadelphia, New York, and Boston may see some of the highest at-home energy bill increases in the nation, with conservative estimates of $37, $34, and $27 in energy bill spikes, respectively.West Coast cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Riverside, and Seattle will likely see bill increases between $2 and $20.Electrek asked why there is a disparity between US East Coast and West Coast cities. Arcadia’s CEO and founder Kiran Bhatraju replied:In denser cities, there’s simply less room for individuals to go outside without running the risk of bumping into other people. These are also areas in which the coronavirus pandemic hit the hardest, so stay at home orders are either still in effect or lifting more slowly.It is our hope that heightened interest and concern over energy consumption at home and energy bills will draw attention to the importance of fossil fuels still being pervasive in the US electricity mix and the need to support more clean energy getting added to the power grid.Arcadia blogged about 10 easy ways to save energy at home here.",solar

It’s sourced from one wind farm and two solar farms in New South Wales via electricity retailer Flow Power, as of last week. The City is home to around 250,000 people.EuroNews writes:All the City’s operations, including street lights, swimming pools, council buildings, and even the historic Sydney Town Hall, will run off entirely renewable sources. This is the biggest green energy deal in Australia’s history, with a value of over AUD$60 million [USD$40 million] overall.Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore (pictured above), said:Cities are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, so it is critical that we take effective and evidence-based climate actions.We are in the middle of a climate emergency. If we are to reduce emissions and grow the green power sector, all levels of government must urgently transition to renewable energy.The City of Sydney has been carbon neutral since 2007, and now that it’s running on 100% renewables, will likely reduce emissions by 70% by 2024  — six years earlier than its goal of 2030.Dominion Energy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. are canceling the $8 billion, 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The natural gas pipeline was to run 600 miles from West Virginia, through Virginia, to eastern North Carolina.Duke Energy Corp has a net zero by 2050 goal in accordance with the Paris Accords. However, the reason for killing the pipeline is not environmental; it’s because of legal uncertainty driving up costs. Recent public guidance of project cost has increased to $8 billion from the original estimate of $4.5 to $5 billion.According to the Charlotte Business Journal:Duke and Dominion specifically cite the April decision by a federal judge in Montana that vacated a key water permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers.Thomas F. Farrell, II, Dominion Energy chairman, president, and chief executive officer, and Lynn J. Good, Duke Energy chair, president, and chief executive officer, stated in a joint press release:We regret that we will be unable to complete the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. For almost six years we have worked diligently and invested billions of dollars to complete the project and deliver the much-needed infrastructure to our customers and communities.This announcement reflects the increasing legal uncertainty that overhangs large-scale energy and industrial infrastructure development in the United States. Until these issues are resolved, the ability to satisfy the country’s energy needs will be significantly challenged.Duke Energy states on its website that it will “continue advancing its ambitious clean energy goals without the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) by investing in renewables, battery storage, energy efficiency programs, and grid projects.”Offshore wind turbines need protection against strong tides. But many of the concrete defenses used to protect them often need to be removed, recycled, or thrown away. They contain plastics and are considered to be marine litter.So UK startup ARC Marine‘s reef cubes have been developed as a more sustainable alternative. The cubes are made from recycled aggregate and sand that is a byproduct of the quarrying industry.The World Economic Forum explains:The cubes interlock, leaving larger living spaces for fish, crabs, and lobsters, and their porous surface is designed to allow marine plants to establish easily and grow. The aim is for these alternative reefs to protect vital offshore installations from storms and erosion while also encouraging marine biodiversity.Reef cubes are designed to be left in place even after a farm has been decommissioned.Since 70% of coral reefs are under threat, this is a pretty great solution.Photo: Clover Moore/Twitter",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

It’s the first fully remodeled bullet train in 13 years. The electric train can run up to 360 kilometers per hour, which makes it one of the fastest trains in the world, but its operating speed will be capped at 285 kilometers per hour.The train features a new active suspension system that helps absorb train movements.It also has a lithium-ion battery self-propulsion system — a world-first — that will kick in during power outages and operate the train at a slower speed to get it to the nearest station. According to Japan Rail Pass, four of the N700S train’s 16 carts will carry batteries on the underside of its carriages. This is a particularly useful feature if it’s stranded in a high-risk area during a natural disaster such as an earthquake.The number of N700S trains in operation will increase from four to 40 by 2022.The CDC Group, which is the British government’s development finance institution, will end fossil-fuel financing abroad. It says it will invest only in companies that align with the Paris Agreement.It will designate almost one-third of its spending to climate finance. The Guardian explains:The publicly owned investor, which supports job-creating sectors in Africa and south Asia, will end financing for coal mining, and oil and gas production, as well as new or existing power plants and refineries that use coal or heavy oil.CDC came under pressure once it came to light that more than £3 billion in public money was spent on polluting projects abroad since the UK signed the Paris Agreement.This is a huge positive step since of course, it doesn’t make sense for the UK to simultaneously reduce its own emissions and fund polluting projects outside its own borders. However, it’s still going to allow rare natural gas investments, despite the fact that environmental groups want CDC Group to only invest in renewables. The Guardian continues:A recent report on energy in Africa by the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that some new investment in gas-fired power generation would be needed alongside a surge in renewable energy — but the impact on global climate emissions would be negligible.ChargeUp Europe, based in Brussels, is an alliance that represents the EV charging infrastructure sector.

That will bump its BYD e-bus total up to 455. According to Sustainable Bus, “Chile aims to have the second largest electric bus fleet in the world after China.”China was responsible for around 99% of global e-bus sales in 2018 and 2019.According to Wikipedia, RED currently operates 6,581 buses, and BYD claims the e-bus fleet in Santiago will reach almost 800 units by the end of this year.Considering the city only got its first 100 e-buses in 2018, this is incredible growth in just two years. RED Movilidad’s goal is the total electrification of public transport by 2040, and if they keep going at their current rate, they’ll probably beat it.(Compare that with New York City, which has 25 e-buses and aims to buy 500 more by 2024.)BYD is a global leader in electric bus sales, and it’s the front-runner in South America. Its e-buses, e-taxis, and other EVs are in more than 300 cities, in more than 50 countries and regions.France’s oldest nuclear power plant, at Fessenheim, closed on Tuesday, June 30, after four decades of operation.The process of removing fuel from the reactors is expected to be completed by 2023. The plant is expected to be fully decommissioned in 2040.France will still have 56 pressurized water reactors in 18 nuclear power plants after this closure.France also aims to reduce emissions from its electricity supply by shutting down its last four coal-fired power plants by 2024 and further investing in green energy.French president Emmanuel Macron pledged €15 billion to fight climate change over the next two years. According to France 24, “Macron also supported a referendum to make “ecocide” a crime — referring to any activity that causes serious damage to the environment.”France’s goal is to achieve net zero by 2050 in accordance with the Paris Agreement.Nevada launched new incentives yesterday from Nevada Energy’s (NVE) annual Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Demonstration (EVID) program that will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and EV charging stations across the state.EVID is funded by NVE customers, via a fraction of a percent ratepayers are charged per kilowatt-hour, and is administered by NVE. The program has $15 million.The program will help make residential EV charging more accessible, especially for low-income residents and those who live in apartments and condos, because of new incentives offered by NVE. Developers of the new low-income multi-unit-dwellings and governmental programs will receive $10,000 — 100% of the total project — to install a charging port in addition to existing incentives.NVE also allocated funds for the Nevada Electric Highway on US 95 between Las Vegas and Reno. A maximum of $500,000 per charging construction site will be provided for up to four remaining Nevada Electric Highway construction sites.Additionally, the program also will boost an effort to electrify school buses. During a July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, grant application period, NVE will offer $3 million for each school district to apply and receive up to 75% of total project costs to purchase two electric school buses and associated charging.",solar
2020/07/01,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Environment Florida has released its seventh annual survey of solar energy in America’s biggest cities. It found that the amount of solar power installed in just seven US cities exceeds the amount installed in the entire country at the end of 2010.The US now has 77.7 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity installed — more than enough to power 1 in every 10 homes in America.Of the 57 cities surveyed in all seven editions of this report, almost 90% more than doubled their total installed solar PV capacity between 2013 and 2019.In 2013, only eight of the cities surveyed for this report had cities with 50 or more watts of solar PV capacity installed per capita, but now 26 cities have earned the title. So who’s leading? You can check out the report here to see the full list, but here is the list of the top 10 cities with 50 or more watts of solar per capita (watts DC per person):Los Angeles is No. 1 for total solar PV.Electrek’s Take: Seeing how it was Environment Florida who put out this report, we should note that the state of Florida is expected to become No. 1 in the Southeast in 2021 for solar capacity, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. It’s about time, Sunshine State.Out of Spain’s 15 coal-fired plants, seven ceased operations on June 30. Four more will soon follow, putting Spain on track to ultimately become coal-free. The country closed all its coal mines two and a half years ago as a result of the European Union banning state aid for them.El Pais asserts that Spain’s decision to move away from coal was not policy-driven, but rather market-driven:These closures appear to have little to do with the Spanish government’s policies. As a matter of fact, the Ministry for Ecological Transition has refused to join an alliance of countries pledging to set a fixed date for phasing out this type of facility. Instead it was the market itself, together with the measures coming out of Brussels, that sounded the death knell for coal.In short, coal is just no longer profitable, or sustainable.In 2018, nearly 15% of all electricity in Spain came from coal-fired thermal stations. In May 2020, it was 1.4%.Dominion Energy has announced that it has completed construction of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project, the US’ second offshore wind farm. It’s a two-turbine, 12-megawatt (MW) facility with plans to expand.The wind farm is 27 miles off Virginia Beach and will go live late summer this year. It’s capable of providing 3,000 homes with power.The pilot project precedes the proposed much bigger 2,640MW Dominion Energy Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind commercial project, which will be able to power up to 650,000 homes.The 30MW Block Island Wind Farm is the US’ first offshore wind farm, and it was launched in 2016.

2020/06/30,"US House Democrats proposed a plan today to bring the US economy to net zero by 2050. This would include transitioning to EVs and green energy with tax incentives, new infrastructure, and government mandates.The Washington Post reports:The proposals would mandate electric utilities be net-zero emitters of greenhouse gases by 2040 and automakers produce only electric cars by 2035. The 538-page plan also backs placing a price on carbon emissions, imposing tougher methane limits, and boosting energy efficiency in buildings. Solar and wind tax credits would be extended through 2025, and the tax credit for electric vehicles would be expanded.As Electrek reported last week, 65% of Americans overall believe that the federal government is doing too little to reduce the impacts of climate change, according to a Pew Research Center study.Representative Kathy Castor (D-FL), the chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said:It will provide a plan that can be taken off the shelf and adopted into law as soon as we are able to reconvene.People would say, ‘Well, why are you releasing this in the middle of COVID and… protests?’ We can’t wait. We can’t wait any longer.A Harvard University study at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which was updated on April 5, has confirmed that there is a direct correlation between long-term exposure to air pollution and a higher coronavirus death rate.Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:The House has an opportunity to put a down payment on those pledges this week as it considers an ambitious infrastructure bill. This measure would make much-needed investments in mass transit, pedestrian-friendly development, and electric vehicle charging stations, while at the same time spurring clean energy deployment and addressing our aging water infrastructure.This is the kind of leadership our country needs right now — putting the well-being of people, communities, and our economy ahead of powerful polluters.The bad news: This has little chance of becoming law because the Senate and Donald Trump are unlikely to pass it.The good news: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Castor have submitted this plan in the hopes that Democratic victories in the elections this year will change the balance in Congress in 2021. So at least it’s now officially on the table.This is a start — at least a climate-change plan is finally on the table on Capitol Hill. Will it go anywhere in 2020? No. But as Castor says, they’re planning ahead so the US can hit the ground running if Congress and the executive branch get on board next year.

Green Tech Media explains:At the same time, the industry has managed to slash the costs to operate projects by half, with levelized lifetime operational expenditures falling from an average of $35 per kilowatt-year for projects built in 2007 to $17/kW-year for projects built in 2019 (all kW values shown are direct current, or DC).Berkeley Lab finds that the levelized cost of energy of US utility-scale PV projects declined from an average of $305 per megawatt-hour for projects built in 2007-2009 to $51/MWh for projects built in 2019. The researchers attributed much of that cost reduction to lower upfront capital expenditures, including less expensive PV modules.The researchers also said they’ve seen costs fall and life spans increase for wind as well, with wind farms expected to also run for around 30 years.",solar
2020/06/29,"A new study from Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, published in Science Advances, provides strong evidence of the causal link between long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure — air pollution — and premature death rates. The study provides the most comprehensive evidence to date.Researchers looked at 16 years’ worth of data from 68.5 million Medicare enrollees — 97% of Americans over the age of 65 — adjusting for factors such as body mass index, smoking, ethnicity, income, and education. They matched participants’ zip codes with air pollution data gathered from locations across the US. In estimating daily levels of PM2.5 air pollution for each zip code, the researchers also took into account satellite data, land-use information, weather variables, and other factors.Based on that finding, the researchers estimated that if the US lowered its annual PM2.5 standard to 10 μg/m3 — the World Health Organization’s annual guideline — the US would save 143,257 lives in one decade — a 6-7% decrease.So what should the Environmental Protection Agency do (EPA), in light of that new information? Further tighten its standards. But that’s not what the EPA is doing. On April 14, the EPA announced that it would not work to lower levels of particulate matter, thus not further reducing air pollution, despite the recommendations of its own scientists to continue to strengthen the standards set previous to 2016 — and put the country on the path to saving lives.Doctoral student Xiao Wu, co-author of the study, said:Our new study included the largest-ever dataset of older Americans and used multiple analytical methods, including statistical methods for causal inference, to show that current US standards for PM2.5 concentrations are not protective enough and should be lowered to ensure that vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, are safe.Electrek spoke to John Bachmann, former associate director for science/policy and new programs, EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, about these new findings. Bachmann said:This nationwide study is easily the most sophisticated and comprehensive air pollution epidemiology study to date.It provides strong and causal evidence that addresses all the major potential ‘confounders’ that the administrator [Andrew Wheeler] and his Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) advisers raised in the rationale for not strengthening the standards.It’s an example of the rare ‘silver bullet’ study, the implications of which simply cannot be ignored. And yet it fits well with conclusions reached by many traditional epidemiology studies over the last two decades.Based on studies, EPA staff and CASAC considered both the EPA policy assessment, and a 20-member Independent PM Research Panel (IPMRP) — which was disbanded by the EPA — recommended the standards be revised. The IPMRP believed the level of the current standards should be reduced from 12 ug/m3 to a range of 10 to 8 ug/m3. Yet this study, supported by a number of other newer studies, compel a standard no higher than 8 ug/m3, and possibly even lower.The EPA banned independent panels, but a judge reversed that decision in April, saying that the EPA failed to provide a “reasoned explanation” for doing so. The EPA won’t fight the reversal.",solar

The oil and gas giant helped lead the shale boom that boosted the US fossil-fuel industry.The bankruptcy occurred because of the pandemic, low energy prices, Chesapeake’s huge amounts of debt, and its ill-calculated move into oil.Low oil and gas prices made it difficult for the company to repay its debt.According to CNN:In May, Chesapeake warned it may not be able to stay in business because it had ‘no access to capital’ and ‘uncertain economic conditions’ were impacting its business partners.The company stated in its press release that it will emerge from the Chapter 11 process as “a stronger and more competitive enterprise.”According to S&P Global Ratings, 20 fossil-fuel companies defaulted on their debt for the whole of 2019. In 2020, 18 oil-and-gas companies have already defaulted on their debt to date.Electrek’s Take: This is how these big fossil-fuel companies often roll. They profit on spoils and then declare bankruptcy and don’t have to clean up after themselves.

It’s the US’ largest stretch of public land.As Axios reports:The roughly 23-million-acre reserve is estimated to hold 8.7 billion barrels of untapped oil and 25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Half of the reservation is already open for drilling.The Republican congressional delegation from Alaska thinks it will be good for Alaska’s economy. Meanwhile, the reality couldn’t be more different: Oil giants are restructuring to move toward green energy, and banks are pulling away from financing fossil fuels.Earthjustice’s attorney Rebecca Noblin put out a statement in response to this proposal:The Trump administration plan to expand drilling in the Western Arctic ignores the reality of climate change, and tramples the health and wellbeing of Alaska Native communities whose traditional foods and cultural practices are inextricably woven into the intact Arctic landscape. At a time when oil prices are cratering, prioritizing expanding oil and gas drilling anywhere — let alone the Arctic — is ridiculous. Earthjustice has gone to court on multiple occasions to defend the Western Arctic, and we will continue to do everything in our power to defend and increase protections for this unique and irreplaceable landscape.The Department of the Interior under the Trump administration approved around half as many wind and solar projects on federal land as the Obama administration had at the same point in its first term, according to a report published yesterday by the Center for American Progress (CAP).According to Reuters:CAP analysis, based on federal data, found the Trump administration has approved seven solar projects and one wind project since taking office compared with 15 total wind and solar projects approved under the previous administration in its first 3.5 years.The study also found the administration has failed to hold competitive lease sales for wind and solar energy development despite holding dozens for oil and gas leases during the period. It has also dismantled the Bureau of Land Management’s National Renewable Energy Coordination Office, CAP said, adding that Interior officials have had 10 times as many meetings with oil and gas industry representatives as with solar and wind companies.Even though the Department of Energy under chief Dan Brouillette says it favors an “all of the above” strategy, Brouillette has repeatedly stated that he thinks there is a bright future for coal.

In contrast, 65% oppose expanding coal mining, 60% oppose hydraulic fracturing, and 58% oppose offshore oil and gas drilling.More than half of Republicans and an overwhelming percentage of Democrats favor a range of initiatives to reduce the impacts of climate change, including large-scale tree planting (90%), tax credits for businesses that capture carbon emissions (84%), and tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles (71%.)And bottom line, 65% of Americans overall believe that the federal government is doing too little to reduce the impacts of climate change.Electrek’s Take: News flash to the other 35%: The federal government is doing almost nothing. Just planting trees isn’t going to cut it. The administration, Congress, and the EPA is not listening to the majority of the people they represent.Online retail giant Amazon has announced a $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund, a venture capital fund, in order to support green energy developments to fight climate change.The goal of Amazon and other companies who have signed The Climate Pledge is to be net zero by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement target. The Climate Pledge was founded on September 19 by Amazon and Global Optimism. Verizon, health and hygiene product company Reckitt Benckiser, and Infosys recently joined the pledge.The Climate Pledge Fund will invest in companies in multiple industries, including transportation and logistics, energy generation, storage and utilization, manufacturing and materials, circular economy, and food and agriculture.Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, said:Companies from around the world of all sizes and stages will be considered, from pre-product startups to well-established enterprises. Each prospective investment will be judged on its potential to accelerate the path to zero carbon and help protect the planet for future generations.Here’s an innovative way to use a landfill cap site (contaminated land with a cover over it): Turn it into a solar farm. Amesbury, Massachusetts, worked with CS Energy to complete a 4.5 MWdc solar project with 3.8 MWh lithium-ion storage on the Amesbury landfill site.It’s the result of a partnership between the City of Amesbury and Kearsarge Energy, a New England based green energy developer and financier.The Amesbury project is live and expected to produce 5,600MWh of electricity annually.Andrew Bernstein, managing partner of Kearsarge Energy, said:As the owner and operator of the Amesbury landfill project, it was critical that Kearsarge Energy partner with a sophisticated and experienced EPC firm capable of navigating the complexities of landfill solar projects. CS Energy’s reputation and extensive experience in this specific field, along with its commitments to quality and safety, made the project an unequivocal success.Photo: Bravo Prince/Unsplash",solar

It has faced protests from environmental activists and pressure from its employees to take action on climate change. But Amazon is on a path to run on 100% green energy by 2025, five years ahead of schedule.Further, it’s announced 91 renewable energy projects globally. These projects will total over 2,900MW of capacity and will deliver more than 7.6 million MWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power 680,000 US homes.In September 2019, Amazon announced that it had ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian. Electrek’s Fred Lambert took a closer look at the e-van in February.Also, in February, Bezos committed about $10 billion to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits, and other groups to fight climate change.Amazon released its 2019 sustainability report yesterday, which you can read here.Amazon’s sales are surging due to the pandemic (but their costs have also gone up), and their long-term prospects are positive. It’s providing an essential service for millions of people who can’t go to brick and mortar stores.So it’s only right that it aggressively tackles the pressing crisis of climate change, and every initiative the retail giant implements is welcome.",solar
2020/06/23,"As Electrek previously reported, the $5 million Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) Impact Fund launched on January 15. LACI is working to eradicate monoculturalism in cleantech startups by bringing on its most diverse cohort yet in spring 2020. More than 50% of participating founders are of color, and nearly 40% are women. We hear from three of those founders in the LACI spring cohort below.Few startups helmed by entrepreneurs of color, especially black Americans and women of color, get the resources and support they need to bring their products to market.As Entrepreneur explains:Black-owned firms represent only 7% of all US businesses. Hispanic-owned firms represent 10.6%, and Asian-owned firms, 4.3%.Josh Aviv, founder and CEO of SparkCharge, Doris Sung, cofounder of TBM Designs, and Sabrina Williams, cofounder and CEO of SEED — all members of LACI’s spring 2020 cohort — had a chat with LACI just for Electrek about what inspires them and what challenges they face, how they innovate, and the support they need to succeed.LACI: What inspired you to pursue a career in cleantech innovation?Josh Aviv: I started SparkCharge when I was a student at Syracuse University working with Linda Hartsoc and Blackstone Launchpad. At the time, I was an economics major who took an environmental economics class and was inspired by my professor to start an electric vehicle charging company. I wanted my company to focus on removing the limitations and anxiety around charging electric vehicles; removing the where, when, and how from EV charging, allowing the electric vehicle market to grow exponentially. Sabrina Williams: I’d always been afraid of the word “tech,” thinking it was only a certain type of person.  But after attending a few workshops with my child at a local makerspace, I learned how to make a simple, automatic watering solution to serve the gardening community where I ran a nonprofit.  After taking the system to Cuba with my future cofounder Ruby Rios, I started looking at ways to democratize IoT [Internet of Things] and take advantage of the innovation and creativity in low-income communities. At that point a light bulb went on: These communities can be huge beneficiaries in the agtech space, especially when it comes to food production, which so profoundly impacts their food security. It also helps them directly fight the deleterious effects of climate change that disproportionately impact low-income communities of color.Doris Sung: As the vehicular industry was making huge changes in moving to electric vehicles (less fuel, less emissions), architecture did not seem to be making the same leaps in technology. I wanted to invent a product that would be low-tech and require no electricity to operate while reduce the amount of energy we use in a building, so I left the field of architecture and dove into research and building technology. By targeting the building envelope or skin, heat could be prevented from entering a building and reduce heavy loads on expensive heating/cooling systems, which are the biggest culprits for energy use and building emissions. Most solutions are super expensive and reliant on electricity to operate. And, the cheap solutions (which are everywhere!) are now deemed to be poor for human wellness. Our product uses no energy, saves energy, requires no maintenance, works endlessly, contributes to human wellness, is priced reasonably, and is elegant. It is something that is smart and embodies a deep understanding of what cleantech truly means to architecture (and not the usual lip service).What are some of the unique challenges you have faced as a startup founder from a traditionally underrepresented community?Josh Aviv: Being a minority founder, I often find that I am the only person of color in the room/part of the conversation, especially when it comes to conversations around cleantech. Over the years, it has gotten better, but I can only remember one or two moments when there was another minority or African-American presenting a company or doing business with me in the cleantech sector. I am excited every time I meet a new minority entrepreneur who is paving the way in cleantech and coming up with innovative ideas on how to change the world. This is something I truly believe we need more of. I really want to shine a light on the cleantech movement and the underserved communities within it.Sabrina Williams: With no prior experience in cleantech, or tech at all for that matter, I had no access to networks. Outside of makerspaces, there was also no institution for learning at the community level — most interventions were from corporations, and were focused on the product level (“what have you built”) versus the education level (“what are you thinking about building?”).  There was also the issue of being taken seriously. What I wanted to do was not big or flashy or complex. It didn’t meet the threshold of words like “disruptive.” I kept getting told, either directly or through messaging, that the value of our product’s impactful change, versus its technical prowess, wasn’t compelling or enough.Doris Sung: The worst experience was when an unnamed manufacturer asked to speak to my boss. When I told him I was a cofounder of the company, he asked to speak to my business partner. He was clearly annoyed to find that the other partner was a female. These experiences are unfortunately commonplace enough in my life that I don’t get upset anymore. I just get annoyed that he wasted my time. I also think that many people are surprised to find that I am the inventor of the product. Because it is highly engineered to perform in a very calculated way, they don’t expect a woman to have designed something that can be scaled so large.How are you continuing to innovate and grow your business during the economic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? Or if you’re struggling, what is your plan to get through this?Josh Aviv: We almost immediately saw a spike in interest in our product. I truly think consumers saw what the world could be like with less pollution in the air (with less ICE vehicles on the road). Mountains that haven’t been seen in years were visible, the world was quieter. EVs have the potential to continue this environmental revolution. When COVID hit, we were faced with a lot of tough situations. We saw the massive layoffs that other companies were doing. That’s far from our core belief that our team is our family. Throughout the worst of the pandemic we did not lay off one single employee. Instead, we kept our team and our family together and worked through the pandemic to make sure that our company would not only survive but thrive in spite of the challenges before us. This is something that we are extremely proud of and is something that we will look back on when the next challenge arrives. Was it difficult ? Absolutely, but we always believed as a team to bet on ourselves to pull through, which we did.Sabrina Williams: We were just completing a full consumer test of our initial product when COVID-19 hit. Those test kits are still in the field, and we haven’t been able to collect necessary data and iterate. But, people are growing more food… and that is our wheelhouse. So we didn’t so much as “pivot” but return to our action-oriented, community-level roots. We are producing the original, starter version of our kit so folks can take part in our Home(in)Stead gardening campaign. It has fewer bells and whistles, but the interest and goodwill we’ve created with the campaign has boosted our profile and has proven invaluable in pushing the brand forward faster than we thought.Doris Sung: Like any company, we have had to put many things on hold for our company. Because we are very lean in size and entering the piloting stage, the reduction in business capacity has not been crippling. As things are opening up, we are starting to ramp up. Our pilot projects have been delayed a few months, but they are all still happening, and we are hopeful and optimistic. As long as our suppliers and manufacturers are able to operate, we should be okay. We pride ourselves in being resilient.How could elected leaders, communities, and the private sector better support entrepreneurs of color?Josh Aviv: One of the biggest areas where they could help is awareness and access to opportunity. Oftentimes one of the biggest struggles for minority entrepreneurs is just getting recognized for the work that we do. In most circumstances minority companies are often overlooked and were not considered for opportunities where their companies can lend a hand. It’s interesting when you think about how much harder we as people of color have to work to be recognized, that drive that is in us to change the world, it’s a beautiful thing.Sabrina Williams: If they are asking the question, then they must acknowledge (or must start believing) that there are many, many entrepreneurs of color they can support.  In other words, you know people of color are out there doing the work you usually support, so find them and make direct appeals if you’re really serious about changing structural inequality. Next, when you start the listening work that you are now vowing to do, give credence to the stories entrepreneurs of color are telling. To what extent will you value other experiences and innovative viewpoints? If I say it’s hot, I don’t want to be offered a sweater because you happen to be a little chilly! Then, look internally. How are you willing to move toward a diverse business landscape? Elected leaders can refuse to commit funds/subsidies until corporations meet environmental and social impact goals. And conversely, the private sector can refuse to bring big contracts to jurisdictions where those impact goals are not supported. Finally, support the small businesses that already exist.Doris Sung: This is a great question. Just like all equity or diversity issues, it is important to find ways to level the playing field. Trained as an architect, my career has always been dominated by white males. Only 19% of licensed architects are women (only 15% Asian) and 11% of engineers are women. Those numbers get even smaller in building-product manufacturing and construction industries, especially at management or executive levels. As an entrepreneur in this industry, it seems to be just as bad, if not worse. Elected leaders, communities, and the private sector need to make a bigger effort to make these changes and support female-owned or minority-owned businesses in funding, investment, marketing, networking, purchasing, promoting and contracting. Otherwise, things will never change.Photo: Megan Thomas/Unsplash",solar
2020/06/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Workers are finishing up the first two out of five solar sites for the Florida Municipal Solar Project, which consists of 16 electric utilities working to create one of the largest municipal-backed solar projects in the US.The Harmony Solar Energy Center in St. Cloud and the Taylor Creek Solar Energy Center in Orange County are nearly complete, with enough energy to power around 30,000 homes. They will come online by the end of June. The other three sites are expected to be online by 2023, and power output will then increase to 75,000 homes.The solar farms will feed energy directly into the grid.Harmony and Taylor Creek will provide solar-powered energy to Fort Pierce, Jacksonville Beach, Key West, Kissimmee, Ocala, and Orlando. Customers will be able to choose what percentage of power they want to be solar — but they’ll have to pay a small additional charge.Electrek’s Take: Of course the energy needs to be paid for, but we wish these utilities would stop charging more for renewable energy. We want to incentivize it, not discourage people — it saves everyone money in the long run.Applications for solar in Hawaii are up 40% in 2020, according to Hawaiian Electric. Hawaii was already on track to reach the 2020 year-end goal of 30% renewable energy, so this is only going to help.Hawaii had the highest electric cost in the US at about $0.29 per kilowatt-hour in 2019.Households in Hawaii who install solar get a 35% tax credit up to $5,000 from the state, and a 26% federal government tax credit that drops to 22% next year.So this may be happening because state residents want to take advantage of the higher federal tax credit, and working from home and staying in due to the pandemic is also boosting home energy consumption.Como Park Zoo and Conservatory in St. Paul, Minnesota, is getting a new solar energy project from  C2 Energy Capital, LLC, a growing investor and developer in renewable energy and storage assets, and the City of St Paul. C2 owns the solar farm, and St. Paul is subscribing to it for the zoo, which is one of only three zoos in the US that has free admission. The clean energy will reduce electricity costs for the zoo’s operations.Michelle Furrer, director of Como Park Zoo & Conservatory, said:Conservation goes to the core of what Como is all about. We are a nationwide leader in animal and plant conservation, and by reducing the City’s overall greenhouse gas emissions we are taking another step in environmental stewardship.This latest solar project is contributing to the Minnesota Renewable Energy Standard, which requires Minnesota utility Xcel Energy to obtain 25% of its retail sales from renewable sources by 2025.",solar

The report details PepsiCo’s progress in agriculture, water, climate, packaging, products, and people.Its focus is on reducing emissions on its three biggest drivers, which is agriculture, packaging, andthird-party transportation and distribution.It’s committed to 100% green electricity for US operations that accounts for over 50% of its global electrical load.Bakery and Snacks reports:PepsiCo is well on its way to achieving its target of sourcing 100% of ingredients that are sustainably farmed by the end of 2020.Further, it’s sustainably sourcing palm oil and cane sugar, incorporating more recycled content into packaging, and reduced emissions from company-owned vending and cooling equipment by 39% from its base year of 2015.The company reduced its emissions by 6% in 2019. Its goal is to goal to achieve a 20% reduction in emissions by 2030, but declares that it must be more ambitious.PepsiCo signed the UN’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge in 2020, which has been signed by 249 companies and aims to achieve net zero by 2050.The company is 88% of the way to using 100% recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable packaging by 2025.https://youtu.be/TGPH3jInT5gBanks are increasingly selling off 30-year mortgages to government-backed buyers like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are government-sponsored and backed by taxpayers, reports the New York Times:Home buyers are increasingly using mortgages that make it easier for them to stop making their monthly payments and walk away from the loan if the home floods or becomes unsellable or unlivable. More banks are getting buyers in coastal areas to make bigger down payments — often as much as 40% of the purchase price, up from the traditional 20% — a sign that lenders have awakened to climate dangers and want to put less of their own money at risk.The small regional banks are leading the way on this trend, selling off coastal mortgages the fastest. (A similar trend applies to those who live in areas prone to wildfires.)According to a paper called “Underwaterwriting” in the journal Climactic Change:In 2009, local banks sold off 43% of their mortgages in vulnerable zones… about the same share as other areas. But by 2017, the share had jumped by one-third, to 57%, despite staying flat in less vulnerable neighborhoods.As Electrek reported, the $5 million Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) Impact Fund launched on January 15.It has just announced that it is putting out a request for information (RFI) for technological solutions to help LACI pilot a zero emissions delivery zone, the first in the US. Santa Monica will be the pilot city for this program.LACI and Santa Monica are interested in the following types of technologies:E-cargo bikes and other micromobility devices for last mile delivery of parcels, groceries and food: Vehicles, maintenance, infrastructure, and charging (fixed and mobile), customer interface for check in/check out, fleet management services, etc.Curb management, including digital curb management, prioritization, signage, driver booking of curb spots, enforcement, etc.Light-duty and medium-duty electric vehicles (EV) used for last mile delivery of parcels and furniture: Vehicles, EV maintenance, charging (fixed and mobile), fleet management services, mini delivery depots, charge management, etc.Measurement and tracking solutions for noise and air pollution (including hyper localized), traffic congestion, delivery volumes, telematics, enforcement, etc.Other innovative solutions that can help make a voluntary last-mile delivery zone succeed (business model solutions, policy solutions, technology solutions, information, and best practice sharing platforms or clearinghouses, etc.)Applications can be submitted here.Photo: Crystal Jo/Unsplash",solar

She’s owned an EV since June 2017.Many consumers have avoided purchasing an electric car because of range anxiety. So it’s great that Grace is comfortable taking long road trips with her small children in an EV and doesn’t worry about range — she drove from South Florida to Montreal and back.Further, historically, more men than women have driven EVs, and that ratio is quickly changing.Experienced EV owners are already aware of the issues that Grace addresses, but it’s always great to hear firsthand experiences. It’s also useful for those who are interested in driving an EV but still have questions and want to learn more.The Vatican yesterday released a 225-page manual for church leaders and workers on the need to protect “nature, life, and defenseless people.”The manual contains practical steps to achieve Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si (Praised Be), according to Reuters.

The report “outlines energy-focused policies and investments to move the world toward a cleaner and more resilient future.”The plan lays out a series of actions that governments can take over the next three years to help economies recover and boost employment in a sustainable manner.The report says policy actions and targeted investments can boost global economic growth by an average of 1.1 percentage points a year; save or create around 9 million jobs a year; and reduce annual global energy-related emissions by a total of 4.5 billion tonnes by the end of the plan.It also includes a plan for driving a 5% reduction in air pollution emissions, bringing access to clean cooking solutions to around 420 million people in low-income countries, and enabling nearly 270 million people to gain access to electricity.It would require $1 trillion annually over the next three years, which represents about 0.7% of today’s global GDP and includes both public spending and private finance that would be mobilized by government policies.According to Goldman Sachs, green energy spending will surpass oil and gas in 2021 for the first time. Further, spending on renewables will account for 25% of all energy investments next year. For perspective, renewables made up 14% of energy investing in 2014.Looking ahead, the banking giant sees total investment in green energy rising to $16 trillion over the next 10 years.Goldman Sachs sees the coronavirus pandemic ultimately accelerating the nationwide pivot to renewables, despite current job losses in the sector.The Goldman Sachs team wrote:We believe this time will be different, especially for technologies that are now mature enough to be deployed at scale and can benefit from a falling cost of capital and an attractive regulatory framework, unlocking one of the largest infrastructure investment opportunities in history on our estimate.",solar

Here’s the instruction book on what to do. You’re welcome, governments. Oh, and by the way, the private sector wants this, too.Governments are under pressure to think on their feet and perform extraordinarily, and this new plan, in Birol’s words, “is not intended to tell governments what they must do.

Both Houston and Boston are members of C40, a network of the world’s megacities committed to addressing climate change, with a goal of achieving net zero by 2050, as per the Paris Agreement.Photo: NODE",solar
2020/06/16,"Danish green energy giant Ørsted CEO Henrik Poulsen has resigned after an eight-year tenure. Ørsted is now the world’s biggest offshore wind developer. It recently installed its 1,500th offshore wind turbine, in announced on June 11.Poulsen will leave Ørsted by January, the company announced yesterday. The company is now searching for a replacement. He was previously an executive at McKinsey and Lego.Poulsen said [via the Financial Times]:It’s been an incredible ride over the past eight years, and I have a tremendous amount of affection for Orsted, its vision, and not least its people.We’ve transformed a Danish utility predominantly based on fossil fuels into a global leader in green energy, which was ranked as the world’s most sustainable company earlier this year.Ørsted plans to double its wind capacity in the next five years to 20GW. It employs almost 7,000 people worldwide, and had revenues of around $10.3 billion in 2019.The Financial Times reports:The company’s stock has risen more than 70% since the beginning of last year, brushing off a dip in valuation inflicted by the pandemic and giving it a market capitalization of roughly $48 billion.The Danish green energy company is growing its onshore wind business, too.As Electrek previously reported on April 8, in 2013, Ørsted announced it would stop developing onshore wind to concentrate on offshore wind, but in 2018, it returned to onshore wind development with the acquisition of Lincoln Clean Energy. It completed its largest onshore wind farm, in Texas, in April.Ørsted’s onshore operational installed capacity has increased to 1.3GW. The company intends to reach 5GW installed onshore capacity by 2025.It aims to reach 99% green energy production overall by 2025.Poulsen transformed what was a fossil-fuel company known as Danish Oil & Natural Gas into Orsted, which is now known as the most sustainable company in the world.He also proved that green energy can be profitable. Let’s hope he keeps his hand in the game, as he has achieved remarkable things for the green energy sector and the environment at large.",solar
2020/06/16,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed today that green (literally) license plates for electric vehicles are set to be rolled out from autumn under plans to drive a green economic recovery from the pandemic in Britain.The government announced:The plates will make it easier for cars to be identified as zero emission vehicles, helping local authorities design and put in place new policies to incentivize people to own and drive them.For example, drivers could benefit from local initiatives such as cheaper parking and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones where those with a green number plate will be recognized as eligible.As pictured above, EVs’ plates will be identifiable by a green stripe on the left-hand side on both front and back plates. The front plate will be white and the rear plate will be yellow, as is the current norm for UK license plates.Further, £12 million funding for research into the zero-emissions market has also been announced to develop greener vehicles and improve vehicle charging technology.Energy storage technology company Fluence, a Siemens and AES company, has launched a sixth-generation integrated grid storage product. It has already signed orders for 800 megawatts/2,300 megawatt-hours from Enel, LS Power, sPower, and Siemens.Over the last 12 years, Fluence has reduced the total cost of energy storage systems by 90%; the new technology stack helps drive down the non-battery costs of energy storage systems by up to 25%.The new technology will help customers deploy larger projects faster and more efficiently for less cost.The latest version is a 10-foot cube, which Fluence will use as a building block for storage plants. It replaces the previous rectangular containers. The first installations will be completed by the end of 2020.Fluence COO John Zahurancik said:Instead of these large containers that are difficult to transport, we can build this replicable form factor over and over again.New, cleaner-energy ships won’t be enough to achieve the necessary emissions reductions in order to meet Paris Agreement targets, according to a new study published in BMC Energy.The new research shows that emissions from existing ships could swallow up shipping’s entire “safe carbon budget.” The shipping sector can’t wait for new, low-carbon ships to enter its fleet if it is to cut emissions on time. The authors suggest a solution:The sector does, however, have significant potential to reduce this committed emissions figure without premature scrappage through a combination of slow speeds, operational and technical efficiency measures, and the timely retrofitting of ships to use zero-carbon fuels.Simon Bullock, co-author of the report of the University of Manchester, told Electrek:This research shows shipping cannot play its part in meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goals without strong and fast policy action to reduce emissions from the existing fleet of ships. Of course, getting zero-carbon fuels is new ships is essential, but measures targeting the existing fleet are also critical — for example on slower speeds, shore power, and wind-assisted technology retrofits. Cutting emissions from the existing fleet should be an urgent priority for the [International Maritime Organization] IMO.",solar
2020/06/15,"A research team at DeSmog has debunked the messaging of an organization that calls itself the “Transportation Fairness Alliance.” It proclaims itself to be in favor of “competitive and equitable transportation,” but it’s actually a powerful, anti-EV, pro-fossil-fuel lobbying group.The anti-EV group describes itself as follows:The Transportation Fairness Alliance is a diverse partnership of groups that support a competitive and equitable transportation sector. Collectively, we represent our nation’s manufacturers, small business owners, farmers, and folks who drive on our roads and pay utility bills.The reality, which is explained on DeSmog‘s microsite Transportation Fairness Alliance Revealed, is that it includes such fossil-fuel powerhouses as the American Petroleum Institute, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, and the National Tank Truck Carriers — the US’ largest association of gasoline and diesel truckers.The coalition is being managed by FTI Consulting, a DC-based international consultancy firm that has a long history of running front groups and PR campaigns for the oil and gas industry.DeSmog‘s microsite breaks down facts versus myths about electric vehicles. Some examples of facts that the researchers cite are:Electric vehicle drivers contribute to road construction and maintenance costs, and in many states pay more than drivers of gas-powered vehicles.Over the full life cycle of the vehicle, electric cars are cleaner, no matter how they are charged.DeSmog also pointedly states the Transportation Fairness Alliance’s real goal:Oil companies don’t care about fairness. Oil companies want to make sure American drivers have no choice but to refuel at the gas pump.Ben Jervey, a research fellow at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School and a senior fellow for DeSmog, told Electrek:The [Transportation Fairness Alliance is] trying to co-opt the “fairness” argument and portray EVs as inequitable, which requires them to peddle a bunch of myths.All you need to do is look in this lobby group’s “news” section on its website to see that it’s an EV-bashing, pro-gasoline lobbying group. It has nothing to do with small business owners or “folks,” a clever PR word implying your average person. If it really cared about “folks,” it would be promoting a cleaner environment and emissions reduction, like the rest of the world’s private and public sectors; not their own interests.The use of the word “fairness” is manipulative — and the only groups that would “fairly” benefit from this propaganda are Big Oil and Gas.",solar
2020/06/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.A week ago, Electrek reported that oil giant BP announced it will cut 15% of its workforce as a result of the pandemic’s impact on the economy and its plan to shift the fossil-fuel company to green energy.The UK-headquartered company said it will cut 10,000 jobs from the current 70,100 positions.Today, the fossil-fuel giant announced it will slash up to $17.5 billion off the value of its assets. That’s because it’s lowered its longer-term energy price assumptions for the same reasons cited above.The Financial Times reports:The UK energy major said coronavirus would have a lasting impact on the global economy as well as oil and gas demand, and that it expected the crisis to accelerate the transition toward cleaner forms of energy.Its move on Monday marks the biggest recognition yet in the oil and gas industry that tens of billions of dollars worth of investments could be rendered uneconomic as the world pursues the Paris climate goals.BP CEO Bernard Looney is aiming to transform the company into a leaner organization and a net zero company.It will go into more specific detail in September about how it will invest less in oil and gas and more in renewables.Despite this year’s economic hardships, US solar installations are projected to grow by 33% in 2020, according to a new report from Solar Energy Industries Association and energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.Nearly 18 gigawatts are expected to be installed. The report reduced the original forecast by 9% (1.7GW) from nearly 20GW of installations for 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Delays in construction, less consumer demand, and tighter financing conditions have contributed to the drop.Community solar continues to expand geographic diversification, but distributed solar expects to see 31% fewer installations in 2020 from the previous year. Utility-scale solar expects to install 14.4GW of new capacity in 2020, which is a new record high. This is due to low cost and states’ green energy targets.The research team at DeSmog has uncovered and debunked the messaging of a group that calls itself the Transportation Fairness Alliance.

2020/06/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Fitch Group, a data firm, is projecting that oil and gas will lose $1.8 trillion in revenue in 2020 due to the pandemic. Why? Because governments globally are building green energy into their stimulus plans.Plus, there are other things like oil oversupply and the plummeting costs of renewables, and not even the OPEC-Russia deal is going to make a difference in the long run.The US currently does not have a green stimulus plan. But if Joe Biden wins the presidential election in November, this inertia on green energy will rapidly disappear, as the Democrats are keen to implement some form of Green New Deal. As Electrek reported earlier this week, the US could deliver 90% clean, net-zero electricity nationwide by 2035, at no extra cost to consumers and without the need for new fossil fuel plants, according to a new study from UC Berkeley.The Houston Chronicle reports the stats that reflect the decline:BP is shedding 10,000 workers, mostly in administrative roles. Chevron is eliminating 6,700 jobs. Nationally, 90,000 oil and gas workers have lost their jobs, while in Texas alone, the industry shed 26,300 jobs in April. Those cuts were on top of layoffs in 2015 and 2016.Fourteen oil and gas companies declared bankruptcy in April and May, compared with five over the same period last year, the law firm Haynes and Boone reported. The corporate bond default rate is up to 12.5%, mostly because of oil companies unable to pay their debts, S&P Global Platts reports.As the Chronicle‘s Chris Tomlinson writes about Texas, which is No 1 in the US for wind energy (pictured above):The world’s energy markets have fundamentally changed, and Texas must keep up with the times by developing industries beyond oil and gas.Adani Green Energy is going to develop 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power over the next few years, helping the Indian government attain the ambitious green energy targets it has set.AGEL and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) will set up 2GW of “solar cell and module manufacturing capacity” by 2022, according to CNBC. The other 6GW will follow. The project will cost $6 billion and will create 400,000 direct and indirect jobs.The Indian government has set a near term goal of 175GW of renewable capacity — the maximum amount that installations can produce — by 2022. CNBC paints the big picture:The country’s installed capacity at the end of May — for all energy sources — was slightly over 370GW, according to government statistics.Renewables — listed as small hydro, wind, solar and bio-power — accounted for over 87.3GW of this total.By contrast, installed coal capacity stood at just over 205GW, a figure which reinforces how much work still needs to be done.China’s State Grid Corporation commissioned and completed a $3.2 billion, 1,500 km electricity transmission line that will carry only renewable energy. It is the world’s first renewables-only electricity transmission line.The transmission line is intended to help increase the use of wind and solar in the relatively remote provinces of Qinghai and Gansu. The State Grid currently has about 40GW of wind and solar generation in those provinces.The line will be put into full operation in December. It will be able to handle 40 billion kWh a year.",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/06/11,"Michelin’s Movin’On Summit was held virtually last week, and five sustainable mobility companies won its Startup Challenge because they stood out as being able to move from “ambition to action.”The Movin’On Summit was originally meant to be held at McGill University in Montreal in June, with former US Secretary of State John Kerry as its keynote speaker.Movin’On, which was founded by Michelin in 2017, brings together corporations, startups, government bodies, academia, NGOs, and international organizations. Its mission is “sustainable mobility as a driving force for human evolution.”Then of course the pandemic happened, so the summit was held virtually, on YouTube. More than 3,500 delegates attended remotely.Movin’On pressed forward with its Startup Challenge, which is part of the Summit that supports sustainable mobility startups that contribute to the emergence of concrete solutions. 326 startups from 61 countries took part in the Challenge.A jury of 22 experts and the public chose five winners. They were:Tackling climate change and air pollution: GBatteries | Advanced Charging based in Ottawa, Canada, which is developing a technology that focuses on ultra-fast recharging of lithium-ion batteries.Improving multimodal mobility: ONO, a Berlin-based startup offering clean and sustainable transport solutions for urban areas.Promoting safe and accessible mobility: N-Vibe, a French startup that has devised vibrating GPS bracelets for people who are blind or have a visual impairment.Designing more efficient global transport: Everty, based in Sydney, which has developed innovative recharging software for electric vehicles.Conserving resources: Addionics, a UK- and Israel-based startup that provides rechargeable batteries that have redesigned architecture and a new 3D metal fabrication method.The winners will attend the 2021 Movin’On Summit in Montreal, and the 42 startups in total that were supposed to attend the 2020 Summit will benefit from coaching and support through sponsorship, incubation programs, and mentoring.Karima Delli, member of European Parliament and president of the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism, said:I am convinced that sustainable mobility is key to a better future and that startups can be the source of new and really concrete solutions. We must bring together all actors in the mobility sector to find collective solutions that will make mobility greener, more inclusive, and safer. Which is why initiatives such as the Movin’On Startup Challenge are essential.I was honored to be co-chair of the jury, alongside Bertrand Piccard, president of the Solar Impulse Foundation, for this edition of the Movin’On Startup Challenge 2020.",solar
2020/06/11,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has signed the Essential State Infrastructure Bill into law, which will expand electric vehicle charging stations to support growth in the use of electric vehicles in Florida.The bill requires the Department of Transportation to “coordinate, develop, and recommend a master plan for the development of electric vehicle charging station infrastructure along the State Highway System.”Specific state agencies will need to identify barriers and opportunities to advance electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The bill requires an interim report at the end of 2020 with a final report by July 1, 2021.The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy’s Dory Larsen writes:This is a big win for Florida’s consumers as it will grow the electric transportation market faster and create opportunities so more Floridians have access to increased cleaner transportation options. The law is also one of the first pieces of state legislation that acknowledges the risks of climate change and identifies electric transportation as a means to combat it.Offshore wind farms need trenches in which to lay cables to get the power to shore, and if you think about it, that’s no easy feat to either dig the trenches or lay the cable. Trenching and cable installer Global Offshore has an efficient new tool, the PLP240, and the company has successfully tested it out in their first phase of work at Vattenfall’s Danish Kriegers Flak site in the Baltic Sea.The PLP240, which was carried by the Havila Jupiter ship, began boulder clearance on the site in April following rigorous testing on a directly comparable set of seabed conditions close by. Overall, 72 routes have now been completed, totaling approximately 158 km (98 miles). It was able to dig trenches up to 1.7 m (5.5 feet) deep.Mike Daniel, managing director of Global Offshore said:We invested heavily in the very best upfront engineering for our PLP240 and had every confidence that the trials would evidence what we already knew to be true about the new asset. But it’s not until the tool hit the seabed, began route clearance, and was tested in each mode that its capabilities were really proven.The seabed conditions that we’ve seen here in the Baltic Sea are likely to be some of the most extreme that we’d ever work in, so it has put the PLP240 to the ultimate stress test and we’re proud to say that it’s passed with flying colors.Check out the PLP240 here, it’s pretty neat: The Movin’On Summit was originally meant to be held at McGill University in Montreal in June, with former US Secretary of State John Kerry as its keynote speaker.Movin’On, which was founded by Michelin in 2017, brings together corporations, startups, government bodies, academia, NGOs, and international organizations. Its mission is “sustainable mobility as a driving force for human evolution.”Then of course the pandemic struck, so the summit was held virtually, on YouTube. More than 3,500 delegates participated remotely.Movin’On pressed forward with its Startup Challenge, which is part of the Summit and supports startups in order to contribute to the emergence of concrete solutions for sustainable mobility. 326 startups from 61 countries took part in the Challenge.A jury of 22 experts and the public chose five winners on the criteria of being able to move “from ambition to action.” They were:Tackling climate change and air pollution: GBatteries | Advanced Charging in Ottawa, Canada, which is developing a technology that focuses on ultra-fast recharging of lithium-ion batteries.Improving multimodal mobility: ONO, a Berlin-based startup offering clean and sustainable transport solutions for urban areas.Promoting safe and accessible mobility: N-Vibe, a French startup that has devised vibrating GPS bracelets for people who are blind or have a visual impairment.Designing more efficient global transport: Everty, based in Sydney, which has developed innovative recharging software for electric vehicles.Conserving resources: Addionics, a UK and Israel-based startup that provides rechargeable batteries that have redesigned architecture and a new 3D metal fabrication method.Photo: Fox 4",solar
2020/06/10,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Natural gas is on course for the biggest annual fall on record, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported today.Gas consumption is expected to fall by 4%, or 150 billion cubic metres (bcm), to 3,850 bcm in 2020 due to excessively warm weather and the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The IEA reports:Faced with this unprecedented shock, natural gas markets are going through a strong supply and trade adjustments, resulting in historically low spot prices and high volatility. Natural gas demand is expected to progressively recover in 2021, however the Covid 19 crisis will have longer-lasting impacts on natural gas markets, as the main medium-term drivers are subject to high uncertainty.Europe, North America, and Asia are forecast to see the biggest drops in demand, or 75% of the total fall this year. Most of the demand increase after 2021 will be led by China and India.As Electrek wrote in April, we’re still suffering from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a decade later.

Background here:https://t.co/I73lNVYr2k https://t.co/Pi6W1Sn4wp— Rick Kriseman (@Kriseman) May 28, 2020As an avid green energy and EV supporter, I wasn’t all that interested in the free Wi-Fi (although that’s a nice feature), and since that’s not unusual, I don’t know on what grounds Trump and other local officials asserted that this project is the first of its kind.I asked PSTA if they’d be sourcing e-buses for this new route that got the DOT funding, since Trump calls them “state-of-the-art.” I got conflicting responses from PSTA. On one hand, PSTA says it has a goal of having an all-electric vehicle fleet.On the other hand, I was told that it is “purchasing nine 40-foot hybrid-electric buses manufactured by Gillig.” When I asked why they didn’t purchase e-buses rather than hybrids, PSTA initially replied:We decided against all-electric buses since there would be a need to construct charging infrastructure along the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) route given the long route (10+ miles each way).It then followed up with this statement:Once the BRT is completed and we get the hybrid electric buses running we will be collecting data to see how we can integrate all electric buses BRT buses on the route.I don’t really get it, since St. Petersburg now has this fantastic inductive wireless charging bus station, and PSTA’s current electric buses average 180 miles or 15 hours before having to recharge. Why would the PSTA spend a lot of money on hybrid buses when it could have gone straight to electric with this great new charging station?This Florida city is a good case study for the need for clean public transport, and why, even in a city that publicly declares support for green energy and sustainability — it is very vulnerable to sea rise (Disclaimer: I live here and worry about that constantly) — the transition to clean energy isn’t happening as quickly or efficiently as it needs to be.I’ve asked for further elaboration from PSTA, and will report back with an update.Photos: WAVE",solar
2020/06/09,"The United States could deliver 90% clean electricity nationwide by 2035, without the need for new fossil fuel plants, according to a study released today from the University of California, Berkeley — with the right policies.If those policies aren’t put into place, the potential for clean energy, jobs, and cutting health costs will be squandered.The report suggests:The rapid buildout of additional renewable energy would inject $1.7 trillion of investment into the economy and increase energy sector jobs by up to 530,000 per year through 2035, across all regions of the US, without raising consumer bills. Delivering 90% clean electricity by 2035 also avoids $1.2 trillion in environmental and health costs through 2050 by reducing damages from air pollution and carbon emissions.Wind, solar, and battery storage can provide the bulk of the electricity.The report also comes with a set of recommendations on how to achieve this goal from nonpartisan policy firm Energy Innovation that can be read here.Dr. Amol Phadke, senior scientist and affiliate at UC Berkeley’s Center for Environmental Public Policy, said:Cost reductions in clean technology have occurred much faster than anticipated just a few years ago. This is the first report to integrate the latest low prices for renewable energy and storage and shows it is technically and economically feasible to deliver 90% carbon-free electricity on the US power grid by 2035.Recent research published in Environmental Science and Policy found that not only would two US presidential terms of inaction create a situation where any chance of hitting emissions targets would be pushed to near zero, it would also have a knock-on effect internationally.The US has incredible potential to lead the world in the shift to green energy, and this new Berkeley study confirms that. Indeed, it’s vital for our planet’s future that both the US and China get on board and take similar steps to what the EU is taking now in their green stimulus packages. There is good movement at the state and city level in America, but it needs federal support and leadership to truly be effective. EPA rollbacks aren’t helping.To put it bluntly, the world simply cannot afford the inertia and backward movement that the US federal government has allowed and even promoted since the beginning of 2017.",solar

Thirty-two new “units” of wind (totaling 3,104 MW) were added to the United States’ total energy generating capacity accompanied by 110 units of solar (1,973 MW), six units of hydropower (25 MW), and two units of biomass (11 MW).Green energy now makes up 22.87% of the nation’s total available installed generating capacity. (For perspective, five years ago, it was 17.05%.) It surpasses coal, which sits at 20.32% and is shrinking (27.5% five years ago, to be precise).FERC reports no new coal capacity in the pipeline over the next three years and just 4MW of new oil-based capacity.It’s possible that green energy generating capacity could make up more than 25% of the US’s total available installed generating capacity within three years. However, natural gas, a fossil fuel, still makes up most of the total capacity.The United States could deliver 90% clean, net zero electricity nationwide by 2035, at no extra cost to consumers and without the need for new fossil fuel plants, according to a study released today from the University of California, Berkeley.That is, with the right policies.

This is a result of the coronavirus impact on the economy, and also CEO Bernard Looney’s plan to shift the fossil-fuel company to green energy, it said today.The UK-headquartered company will cut 10,000 jobs from the current 70,100 positions. Staff were told of the cuts by Looney, who became CEO in February, in a global online call.About one-fifth of the redundancies will be in the UK, and cuts will mostly consist of senior office-based positions. BP will give no pay raises to senior employees until March 2021.BP has flagged a 25% cut to $12 billion this year, and Looney said the company would need to cut costs even further.BP isn’t alone in job cuts in the fossil-fuel industry: US-headquartered Chevron is cutting between 10% and 15% of its global workforce, and Royal Dutch Shell has implemented a voluntary redundancy scheme.Looney addressed the shift to green energy in the call by saying:It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving, and lower-carbon company.BP said the pandemic accelerated those plans.On February 12, as Electrek reported, BP announced that it will become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner. It did not say it would move away entirely from fossil fuels. The company listed five points that they say will help them achieve zero emissions:Net zero across BP’s operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.Net zero on carbon in BP’s oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.50% cut in the carbon intensity of products BP sells by 2050 or sooner.Install methane measurement at all BP’s major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and reduce methane intensity of operations by 50%.Increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time.This isn’t surprising news: Oil giants are taking a pounding due to lack of demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and BP is going to undergo a major restructure anyway in order to transition away from fossil fuels.But it would be good to retrain those laid-off employees to employ them in green energy roles.

2020/06/06,"In a truly unprecedented week, the US is seeing nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by police, and the bigger issue of the country’s long history of systemic racism. Further, Floyd’s autopsy revealed that he tested positive for coronavirus. So what does that have to do with climate change? And where does coronavirus come in? They’re all intertwined. So Electrek rounded up commentary from three African-American climate experts quoted by other media sources who explain the connections between climate change, racism, and coronavirus.Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist and conservation strategist, is the founder of Ocean Collectiv and an adjunct professor at New York University, wrote in the Washington Post:As a marine biologist and policy nerd, building community around climate solutions is my life’s work. But I’m also a black person in the United States of America. I work on one existential crisis, but these days I can’t concentrate because of another… Look, I would love to ignore racism and focus all my attention on climate. But I can’t. Because I am human. And I’m black. And ignoring racism won’t make it go away.Oh, y’all thought we could solve climate change without having to deal with structural racism? 🤣🤣🤣 hahaha. Nope! Allow me to explain. #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/A0BqrK4TGJ— Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (@ayanaeliza) June 4, 2020Kerene Tayloe, director of federal legislative affairs at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, wrote in Grist:It’s pretty clear that the legacy pollutants that have existed in black and brown and indigenous communities for decades have made people who look like me especially vulnerable to COVID-19. And some of the proposed solutions aren’t taking into account the full scope of those inequities.Because COVID-19 is something that everyone in the country is paying attention to, we can use it to draw attention to all of these longstanding problems and drive toward the solutions we’ve identified. This is an opportunity to share solutions in areas like climate change that, under other circumstances, leaders probably wouldn’t have given the time of day.And Robert D. Bullard, distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University who is an expert on environmental racism, told the New York Times:‘I’d like to see these groups start to embrace this whole concept of justice, fairness and equity. Those statements need to be followed up with a concerted effort to address the underlying conditions that make for despair.’The rich, he went on, have a bigger carbon footprint than the poor, but it is the poor who are more likely to be people of color in this country and who are often most vulnerable to the impact of climate change.‘If it’s going to be too hot to work outside, we know who’s going to be affected.

2020/06/05,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.President Donald Trump, citing the need for economic stimulus, signed an executive order on Thursday that would allow key energy and infrastructure projects to move forward without required environmental reviews. This includes such projects as highways, mines, and pipelines.In other words, it uses the cover of the US’ current emergencies to ram through polluting projects. That means agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency would be able to waive provisions put in place by laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).Joel Mintz, former EPA enforcement and supervisory attorney, professor of law emeritus, and C. William Trout Senior Fellow in Public Interest Law at Nova Southeastern University College of Law, said:It is far from clear that the president has the legal authority to do this. NEPA is a clear directive from Congress to federal agencies that the president cannot ignore or change unilaterally. This is also very bad public policy. Pipelines and other infrastructure can do great environmental harm. Their impact should be carefully examined, as NEPA requires, before they are allowed to go forward.Gina McCarthy, President and CEO at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:Instead of trying to ease the pain of a nation in crisis, President Trump is focused on easing the pain of polluters.Abusing emergency powers to deep-six necessary environmental reviews is utterly senseless. These reviews are required by law to protect people from industries that can harm our health and our communities. Getting rid of them will hit those who live closest to polluting facilities and highways the hardest — in many of the same communities already suffering the most from the national emergencies at hand.Americans are crying out for leadership to confront racist violence and stop the spread of a deadly pandemic. This administration is not only ignoring those cries — but piling on the burden. We will not let this stand.So what are the chances of groups like the NRDC legally overturning this executive order? Samir Abdelnour, a lawyer with the environmental practice at California law firm Hanson Bridgett, said:We should expect immediate challenges to this executive order, first seeking an injunction to keep it from going into effect, followed by challenges to specific projects impacted by the order. What we’ve seen with previous executive orders from this president is that district courts are willing to grant nationwide injunctions to block them, but the Supreme Court has been relatively hostile to such nationwide injunctions.On the other hand, the Supreme Court has recently decided two significant environmental cases arguably in favor of environmentalists — in the County of Maui and Atlantic Richfield cases — with Chief Justice Roberts joining the Court’s liberal wing to expand the potential scope of environmental relief available to plaintiffs.Electrek’s Take: The rest of the world, including China, are putting together economic stimulus packages that build in sustainability and renewables. But the Trump administration is taking every opportunity to roll them back. To put it bluntly, this is insanity, and Trump needs to be stopped. This is Naomi Klein’s “shock doctrine” embodied: “Using the public’s disorientation following a collective shock to push through radical pro-corporate measures.” Shame on this administration for putting Americans’ health — particularly people of color — at risk by greenlighting polluting projects without regulation.The nonprofit financial think tank Carbon Tracker has released a new study, “Decline and Fall: The Size & Vulnerability of the Fossil Fuel System,” that states that the energy transition is disrupting the entire fossil fuel system, with profound consequences for financial markets and geopolitics.Carbon Tracker asserts that “falling demand, lower prices, and rising investment risk is likely to slash the value of oil, gas, and coal reserves by nearly two-thirds, increasing the risk and likelihood of stranded assets.”It states that the four main consequences are lower rents, lower profits, totally stranded assets, and lower capital expenditure.According to the Guardian:The report predicts a 2% decline [in line with the Paris Agreement] in demand for fossil fuels every year could cause the future profits of oil, gas, and coal companies to collapse from an estimated $39 trillion [by the World Bank] to just $14 trillion.A study has found that the value of the world’s fossil fuel reserves could fall by two-thirds, sooner than the industry expects, because the COVID-19 crisis has hastened the peak for oil, gas and coal demand.Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at Carbon Tracker and report author, said:Now is the time to plan an orderly wind-down of fossil fuel assets and manage the impact on the global economy rather than try to sustain the unsustainable.Germany’s coronavirus stimulus package has devoted $10 billion to the expansion of hydrogen capacity in order to meet Paris Agreement emissions targets.The country is aiming for hydrogen capacity of up to 5 gigawatts by 2030, with a further 5 gigawatts to be installed by 2040 at the latest, according to Reuters.The stimulus paper said:The measures are aimed at making Germany the world’s supplier of state-of-the-art hydrogen technology.The German government also intends to explore the possibility of creating a European-wide hydrogen initiative.

Customers can’t join the program if they’re behind on their bills, or on a deferred payment plan that sets monthly bills at an amount that is adjusted up or down at the end of the year according to usage.In North Carolina, where community solar became a requirement in 2017, public interest advocates say customers who join the program are subject to excessive fees and inflated costs.The North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association calculated that the cost of the solar power purchase agreements was high and “exceeds the proposed bill credit,” so participants will not see a savings on their bills.Rory McIlmoil, senior energy analyst for Appalachian Voices, in Duke’s home state of North Carolina, says:This report clearly shows that a substantial number of Duke’s customers struggle to pay their electric bills, and when this happens, families end up sacrificing other needs, such as food and healthcare.Rather than spending billions on new gas plants and unnecessary grid upgrades, Duke should instead invest that money in low-income solar and energy efficiency programs that alleviate household energy burdens.20% of Duke’s customers live in poverty, compared to the national rate of 12%. That does not take into account the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.You can read the entire report here.Come on, Duke Energy. You can — and must — do better than this. You lead for energy efficiency in the US South. Why are you fleecing your customers?That’s not OK ever, but particularly now. But as we at Electrek cover green energy, our focus is on making renewables accessible to everyone.Duke Energy offers community solar in Florida, where I live. But like the Carolinas, it costs extra — a monthly charge of $7.75/Block. The Florida bill example Duke gives shows a shared solar subscription fee of 5 blocks x $7.75 = $38.75, minus a $5.20 shared solar credit.How on earth is paying a hypothetical extra $33.55 an incentive for anyone, much less lower-income households during times of relative normalcy, much less during a pandemic and economic upheaval? And Florida is the Sunshine State, for heaven’s sake — it just launched the largest solar community program in the US in March. This is unethical, as it forces people to use fossil fuels that are bad for their health — “choice” is rigged.",solar

The $454 million project by Invenergy LLC will sit on 30,000 acres southeast of Buffalo.The Alle-Catt wind farm, which will feature 116 wind turbines, will be capable of generating 340 megawatts, enough to power around 134,000 homes, the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment announced yesterday.Alle-Catt will generate up to $78 million in local property tax revenues over 20 years, and local governments will receive $3.2 million annually in payments from the wind farm. It will create around 182 construction jobs with a payroll of $15 million, and will provide up to 13 permanent facility operation jobs.Steuben County’s Canisteo plant was previously New York’s largest approved wind project, with a capacity of 290 megawatts.New York’s goal is to achieve net zero in the electricity sector by 2040.Oil giant Total has has bought a 51% stake from utility SSE Plc in the development of a massive wind farm off the Scottish coast.This is the French-headquartered oil company’s first significant push into offshore wind as it shifts into green energy.Total, which currently has stakes in 5 gigawatts of green energy, aims to increase its portfolio to 25 gigawatts by 2025.SSE will lead the development and construction of the Seagreen wind farm, which is expected to cost £3 billion to construct. The 1,140 megawatt project will be Scotland’s largest offshore wind farm once it’s completed in 2023, with the ability to supply energy to around 1 million homes.The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has released a report, “Tone Deaf: The Facts Behind Duke Energy’s Low-Income Programs,” which claims that the power company consistently harms low-income customers.Duke Energy is the US’ largest investor-owned electric utility that serves 6.1 million residential customers in its monopoly territories in the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio and Indiana.EWG asserts that Duke:[R]epeatedly tries to raise fixed charges, which hits low-income customers the most; attacks energy efficiency programs in general; underfunds its own low-income efficiency programs; underfunds programs meant to help low-income customers pay their bills; and makes it harder for them to go solar.Rory McIlmoil, senior energy analyst for Appalachian Voices, in Duke’s home state of North Carolina, says:This report clearly shows that a substantial number of Duke’s customers struggle to pay their electric bills, and when this happens, families end up sacrificing other needs, such as food and healthcare.Rather than spending billions on new gas plants and unnecessary grid upgrades, Duke should instead invest that money in low-income solar and energy efficiency programs that alleviate household energy burdens.20% of Duke’s customers live in poverty, compared to the national rate of 12%.

That was the longest uninterrupted period of not using coal-fired power generation since 1882, during the Industrial Revolution.That record has been broken in a big way, as the National Grid reports that the country’s electricity system continued without coal-fired electricity for the entire month of May. It’s now run without coal-fired power for about 55 consecutive days. Wind and solar power supplied around 28% of the UK’s electricity last month.Since April, the carbon intensity of the electricity grid has fallen to the lowest average carbon intensity on record, at 143 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour.This all happened because of the coronavirus lockdown, an extremely sunny spell, and two bank holiday weekends.The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a report yesterday that asserted that falling costs of renewables make them a cost-effective investment.IRENA states:Renewable power generation technologies are not just competing head-to-head with fossil fuel options without financial support, but increasingly undercutting them, in many cases by a substantial margin. The mature renewable power generation technologies such as hydropower, bioenergy, and geothermal are ongoingly competitive.According to Reuters, more than half of the renewable capacity added in 2019 achieved lower power costs than the cheapest new coal plants, the report found.Further, IRENA said that building new solar farms and onshore wind power now costs less than running many existing coal plants.In March, Virginia passed landmark legislation that requires 30% or more of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 and sets a target of 100% net zero by 2050.And the state is working to keep its renewable transition momentum going despite the pandemic: It’s pressing ahead with its Green New Deal Virginia Coalition Summit virtually.

2020/06/02,"The Trump administration has eliminated states’ and tribes’ rights to halt projects that risk hurting their water quality by rolling back a section of the Clean Water Act (CWA).Section 401 of the federal CWA provides states with the authority to ensure that federal agencies will not issue permits or licenses that violate water quality standards. Or at least it did until yesterday.In the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) own words:The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters.Under the CWA, EPA has implemented pollution control programs such as setting wastewater standards for industry. EPA has also developed national water quality criteria recommendations for pollutants in surface waters.The CWA made it unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained.But EPA chief Andrew Wheeler said after the rollback:Today, we are following through on President Trump’s Executive Order to curb abuses of the Clean Water Act that have held our nation’s energy infrastructure projects hostage, and to put in place clear guidelines that finally give these projects a path forward.Jon Devine, director of federal water policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:Enforcing state and federal laws is essential to protecting critical lakes, streams, and wetlands from harmful pollutants and other threats. But the Trump administration’s rule guts states’ and tribes’ authority to safeguard their waters, allowing it to ram through pipelines and other projects that can decimate vital water resources.This is a dangerous mistake. It makes a mockery of this EPA’s claimed respect for ‘cooperative federalism.’This action undermines how our foundational environmental laws work. The federal government should be setting baseline standards, while states apply and enhance them to the benefit of their unique natural resources and residents.And Mark Ryan, former EPA regional counsel, Seattle/Region 10 (1990-2014), where he specialized in the CWA, both enforcement and permitting; and former special assistant US attorney, where he litigated CWA cases on behalf of DOJ, said:This is a significant retreat from what EPA has said for the last 40 years. The new rule will be very vulnerable to a legal challenge; the EPA will have a very hard time convincing the Supreme Court that its current interpretation of the Clean Water Act is correct.First, note Wheeler’s use of the term “energy infrastructure projects.” A former coal lobbyist, his role as EPA chief is a joke. He was not put in the position to protect the environment; he was put there by Trump to promote fossil fuels, which is a futile waste of time and money. And he is carrying out what Trump wants, not what’s best for the environment. In his own words, it was an Executive Order that spurred this latest move.Second, Ryan’s final sentence is encouraging. So many of these rollbacks have been struck down in courts. So, once the EPA is done wasting the legal system’s time yet again, it will be good to see this latest ridiculous decision thrown out.",solar

It said last year it would set a more ambitious target, without giving figures.Provided the Chinese government follows through with its announcement, this is very good news, as China is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, and there are fears that the country will double down on heavy industry that emits a lot of carbon as it attempts to play catchup after the coronavirus shutdown.In the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) own words:The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters.Under the CWA, EPA has implemented pollution control programs such as setting wastewater standards for industry.

And those manufacturers have had to cut costs due to the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic crisis. Further, smaller companies may have to consolidate to survive.Of course this is bad news for solar manufacturers, but the silver lining is that it may create a higher demand for solar once the economy starts to recover, due to cheaper prices.Both Chinese manufacturing and technological advances have already contributed to solar beating fossil fuels on price.CMB International Securities analyst Robin Xiao said of the Chinese solar industry:The coronavirus added uncertainties to demand, especially overseas. Prices are still under certain pressure. But if the world is gradually recovering from the epidemic from the fourth quarter, cheaper prices may significantly raise competitiveness of photovoltaics.More than 200 multinational and national companies and investors in the UK have signed a letter that calls on the British government to deliver a sustainable coronavirus recovery program.

The initiative was coordinated by The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group (CLG).You can read the letter in full here, but here’s an excerpt:With the UK facing major economic and social concerns including the risk of high unemployment and rising regional inequality, we believe that an ambitious low carbon growth and environmental improvement agenda can do a lot to address these concerns, as well as make the UK economy better prepared to deal with future shocks such as those related to climate change.The current crisis, in moving us all away from business-as-usual, has already created shifts in how we operate, and we believe we must use the recovery to accelerate the transition to net zero. Efforts to rescue and repair the economy in response to the current crisis can and should be aligned with the UK’s legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.The British government is expected to prioritize a green energy package, and the letter urges it to publish a detailed plan — a “clear vision.”In early May, more than 90 multinationals made a similar call in France.

That’s because coal has been declining as a source of electricity over the last 10 years, while wind and solar are growing.How is that timeline relevant, you ask, since historically, there weren’t any solar panels or wind turbines as we know them today? (I wondered, too.) The EIA summarizes the US’ energy usage history (and spoiler: It defines wood as renewable):Historically, wood was the main source of US energy until the mid-1800s and was the only commercial-scale renewable source of energy in the United States until the first hydropower plants began producing electricity in the 1880s. Coal was used in the early 1800s as fuel for steam-powered boats and trains and making steel, and it was later used to generate electricity in the 1880s. EIA’s earliest energy estimates began in 1635.In 2019, US coal consumption decreased by nearly 15% to 11.3 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu), and total green energy consumption grew by 1% to 11.5 quadrillion Btu. Wind surpassed hydro for the first time and is now the largest source of green energy in the US on an annual basis.About 56% of commercially delivered US renewable energy is used in the electric power sector, mostly from wind and hydroelectricity, but different types are also consumed in the industrial (22%), transportation (12%), residential (7%), and commercial (2%) sectors.Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said:It’s basic economics. Renewable energy is cheaper, cleaner, and abundant. There is simply no way for coal to compete. And there is no Wall Street analyst who would risk their clients’ portfolio by investing in an industry in freefall.John Moran, vice president at Goldman Sachs Renewable Energy Group, posted a chart sourced from the EIA data browser that shows how much Oklahoma is moving toward wind and away from coal.Moran wrote:I’m a Notre Dame fan, but, …..Go Sooners! WowIn the first quarter of 2020, wind reached 7,722 GWH of electricity generation in the midwestern state, while coal dropped to 292 GWH.Oklahoma ranks second in total electricity net generation from wind after Texas, and third in wind’s share of state generation after Iowa and Kansas.However, Oklahoma was the fourth-largest crude oil producer in 2019, and had the fourth-largest gross withdrawals of natural gas. Let’s keep that wind generation growing in the Sooner State, and move away from fossil fuels.Southwestern Electric Power Co (SWEPCO), based in Shreveport, Louisiana, was given the go-ahead by the Louisiana Public Service Commission to invest more than $1 billion to acquire three wind farms in north-central Oklahoma. It will own 810 megawatts, or 54.5% of the 1,485-megawatt project, with its sister company, Public Service Company of Oklahoma. Both companies will acquire the wind farms when they are completed in 2020 and 2021.The projects will provide 810 megawatts of green energy to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the project earlier in May, and Texas has yet to approve.Further, reports Arkansas-based Talk Business & Politics:In Louisiana, the project was approved along with SWEPCO’s proposal to add up to 200 megawatts of solar energy. The solar resources would be located within SWEPCO’s existing service territory and construction would start in the next three years.Foster Campbell, commissioner for the Louisiana Public Service Commission, said:This is the largest renewable-energy project ever put forward by a Louisiana utility.

Becerra’s press release, made public yesterday, states:The Trump Administration’s misguided Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles (SAFE) rule stops this progress in its tracks, hurting the economy and public health at a time when the country can least afford it. In the lawsuit, the coalition will argue that the final rule unlawfully violates the Clean Air Act, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.The states (and the District of Columbia) suing the Trump administration include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. The California Air Resources Board, the Cities of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Denver, and the Counties of San Francisco and Denver also joined the coalition in filing the lawsuit.GM and Toyota defend the rollback, but Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen say they will adhere to higher standards. This battle is expected to end up in the Supreme Court.Becerra said:Vehicles are the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in America, and pollution-related respiratory illnesses make people more susceptible to COVID-19.Did you know that Houston buys more green energy than any other city in the US? According to Bloomberg, the Texas city currently powers 92% of its city properties with mostly wind and some solar. “Houston will begin a new five-year contact in July with NRG Energy Inc. to power all of its city-owned properties, from fire stations to airports, with renewable energy.”And that will bring city buildings to 100% renewable power.

In short, a lot.Building renovations: €91 billion per year in EU grants and loan guarantees for renovations such as rooftop solar panels, insulation, and renewable heating systems. €5 billion of guarantees for “green mortgages,” tying low-carbon renovations into property sales. Schools, hospitals, and social housing get priority.Clean hydrogen: €1.3 billion for the EU clean hydrogen support scheme.Green energy: €25 billion of expected investments for a tender of 15 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the next two years. Renewable projects will also receive support from a European Investment Bank pot of €10 billion loans.Electric and hydrogen vehicles: A two-year, €20 billion EU scheme of grants and guarantees for clean vehicles, with 2 million electric and hydrogen vehicle charging stations to be installed by 2025.There may also be €20 billion for cities’ cycling infrastructure and clean public transport, and a €40-60 billion fund for investments in zero-emission trains.Photo: Grace Dadson/Unsplash",solar

Morris then set aside hundreds of those leases in eastern Montana.Strike 2 for the BLM and fossil fuels landed yesterday from Judge Morris when he invalidated 440 oil and gas leases sold across the West. Morris ruled that the BLM did not properly follow a plan to protect sage-grouse (pictured) habitat on more than a million acres of public lands.The lawsuit was filed by Earthjustice on behalf of the Montana Wildlife Federation, the Wilderness Society, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, and Montana Audubon. The US government will now have to return millions of dollars for oil and gas contracts.The sage-grouse is an iconic bird species of the American West whose numbers have plummeted in recent decades.Brian Rutledge, director of the National Audubon Society’s Sagebrush Ecosystem Initiative, said:This court ruling reaffirms that the administration has continued to act in bad faith. A deal’s a deal, and you can’t simply bulldoze the hard fought agreements built across the West to protect the sage-grouse. We’re hopeful that this will lead to the reversal of similarly illegal oil and gas giveaways in more states.The Sierra Club, based on new analysis from the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has released a plan for US economic renewal. The environmental group sent a letter to Congress in April detailing stimulus priorities.The Sierra Club asserts in the report that 9 million jobs could be created every year for the next 10 years “while building an economy that fosters cleaner air and water, higher wages, healthier communities, greater equity, and a more stable climate.” Further, this plan also would enable a 45% reduction in pollution by 2030.The proposed stimulus plan would cost less than $2.9 trillion to employ over 9 million people every year for five years. That’s less than half the amount that the US government spent on stimulus packages in March and April.Here’s the breakdown of 9 million jobs per year:As the Sierra Club explains, “stimulus investments could help many of the 600,000 unemployed clean energy workers get their jobs back, while over 190,000 unemployed oil and gas workers could be hired each year to close orphaned oil and gas wells.”The British government requested a full-year delay for the COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow yesterday. It has written to the UN’s climate change secretariat to move it to November 1-12, 2021, due to the pandemic. There was a possibility that the Glasgow summit could be held next spring, but co-hosts Britain and Italy have pushed the date back. The UN is expected to approve the request.Due to the disruption of the pandemic, countries see the extra time as beneficial to increase momentum and further finalize climate-crisis plans.The letter to the UN states:Given the uneven spread of COVID-19, this date would present the lowest risk of further postponement, and the best chance of delivering an inclusive and ambitious COP.Postponement of COP26 does not mean postponement of climate action. We must scale up action to respond to the climate emergency. It is vital that all Parties increase ambition by submitting enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies that chart a path to net zero; that support is enhanced and the $100 billion climate finance goal is met; and through scaling up action and support for adaptation.COP26 now officially postponed for 12 months to November 2021 pic.twitter.com/KiN1xyMRJZ— Arthur Wyns (@ArthurWyns) May 26, 2020Photo: National Audubon Society",solar
2020/05/27,"The Sierra Club has released a green recovery report that asserts that 9 million US jobs could be created every year for the next 10 years “while building an economy that fosters cleaner air and water, higher wages, healthier communities, greater equity, and a more stable climate.”The Sierra Club’s report, based on new analysis from the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, lays out a plan for US economic renewal. The environmental group sent a letter to Congress in April detailing stimulus priorities.The proposed stimulus plan says it would cost less than $2.9 trillion to employ over 9 million people every year for five years. That’s less than half the amount that the US government spent on stimulus packages in March and April. Further, this plan also would enable a 45% reduction in pollution by 2030.Here’s the Sierra Club’s breakdown of 9 million jobs per year:4.6 million jobs per year to upgrade our infrastructure for clean water, clean transportation, and clean energy3.2 million jobs per year to expand renewable energyOver 700,000 jobs per year to increase energy efficiencyOver 500,000 jobs per year to restore our lands and invest in regenerative agriculture.As the Sierra Club explains, “stimulus investments could help many of the 600,000 unemployed clean energy workers get their jobs back, while over 190,000 unemployed oil and gas workers could be hired each year to close orphaned oil and gas wells.”This isn’t the only plan being proposed or demanded. As Electrek wrote last week, companies worth $2 trillion have called for global green recovery packages, and McKinsey & Company released a report today detailing how post-pandemic stimulus plans globally can both create jobs and fight climate change. (You can read the report here.)Everybody, from environmental groups to multinational corporate firms, wants this. (Well, apart from the Trump administration.) Let’s take a leaf out of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s book and put the country to work, Works Progress Administration-style, not only nationally, but globally. Pakistan is doing it with its tree-planting initiative. But this time, let’s focus on a green approach. This is our chance. We may not get another one.",solar
2020/05/26,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The AA took a poll of 20,000 UK drivers, reports the BBC, and 40% said they would drive less in order to maintain the clean air that has resulted from the pandemic lockdown. Further, 50% said they would walk more, and 80% said they intend to take some action to reduce their own adverse impact on air quality.Further, 25% of drivers said they planned to work from home more, 25% said they would be flying less, and 20% plan to cycle more.Bicycle sales in the UK have been soaring as people are looking to avoid public transport in order to socially distance. This month, London’s mayor announced that large swathes of the city would become car-free in the London Streetspace program.As Electrek has noted a number of times, while air quality globally is currently much better due to coronavirus lockdowns, it may not only revert to previous poorer standards, but also even worsen as economies attempt to make up for lost ground. That’s why building green incentives into recovery packages is so important — and it’s being demanded by a significant number of multinational companies and organizations.And, being that we are Electrek, can we just point out a really obvious solution? Electric vehicles, anyone? Europe is fully embracing electric vehicles — keep going, Europe.Portugal has just made hydrogen produced from green energy a key element of its decarbonization goals by investing €7 billion up to 2030. 85% of that cost will come from the private sector. It’s part of the country’s greater strategy to reduce emissions.The point of the shift to hydrogen is to reduce natural gas imports. Hydrogen will be distributed from the port of Sines, south of Lisbon, where fossil-fuel plants are being decommissioned. Further, gas pipeline networks are already in place there. Environment minister João Pedro Matos Fernandes says existing pipelines are 70% ready to distribute hydrogen, which should eventually produce a gigawatt of energy by 2030.Matos Fernandes said that green hydrogen “has the potential to boost a new economic system, combined with the enormous potential for decarbonization.” He also said it will be used in transport, as the government will create filling stations, too.Leah Stokes is an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In this compelling short video that she made with Grist, she explains how the US can meet ambitious green-energy goals in the fastest way possible. Adapted from Stokes’ April 2020 book, Short Circuiting Policy: Interest Groups and the Battle Over Clean Energy and Climate Policy in the American States, she uses a narwhal to help illustrate her point.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

Icebreaker has been a decade in the making.The plan controversially stipulates that the farm must cease operations between March and October to protect birds and bats due to it being located in an “Important Bird and Biodiversity Area.” LEEDCo is concerned that the lengthy downtime could defeat the project.The American Bird Conservancy and the Black Swamp Bird Observatory wanted the project stopped, citing location, but the Sierra Club felt that limitations on when the wind farm can operate are too restrictive. Public comments were evenly split between those for and against the project.Further, now bankrupt fossil-fuel company Murray Energy Corp. brazenly stated in January 2019 that they openly fought the Icebreaker project:Murray Energy is pleased that its outside counsel… can assist the Bratenahl residents to prevent Icebreaker from steam-rolling this project through the Ohio Power Siting Board certification process without the public scrutiny and opposition that it deserves.Icebreaker was competition for coal, but Murray is finished.David P. Karpinski, president of LEEDCo, which is planning and developing Icebreaker Wind, is concerned the cease of operations could put the whole project in jeopardy, and put out a statement on May 21:We made it abundantly clear that a requirement to shut down the turbines from dusk to dawn for the majority of the year renders the project economically not viable.LEEDCo has invested incredible amounts of time and money into studying and assessing potential impact to birds and bats. We have not taken it lightly.Consider just the following:In light of today’s decision, LEEDCo will need to reconvene in the coming days and examine our options on how and whether we can move forward.E&E News explains the project’s planned specs:The 20.7-megawatt Icebreaker project is planned for 8 to 10 miles off the Lake Erie shore and will be connected by an underwater cable to a Cleveland Public Power substation.It is partially funded through Department of Energy grants and involves six turbines rising almost 500 feet above the lake that would generate about 75,000 megawatt-hours of energy per year to be sold into the grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC.The wind farm will hopefully be online by 2022, provided it can proceed.

Electric models will then make up 31% of all of the cars on the road.In the short term, research firm Wood Mackenzie predicted a 43% drop in global EV sales by the end of 2020. BloombergNEF, in turn, predicted a more modest 18% drop. Unsurprising either way, since driving and car purchases aren’t on the top of everyone’s priorities due to the pandemic.When it comes to other electric vehicles besides passenger cars, Grist reports:The outlook is even brighter for electric buses, expected to make up 67% of all buses on the road by 2040, according to the analysis, as well as two-wheeled vehicles like mopeds and motorcycles, which are expected to be 47% electric by that year.The University of California has divested from all fossil fuels, it announced on Tuesday. They are the largest educational system in the US to do so. The system has a $126 billion investment portfolio and 285,000 students.Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents’ investments committee, said in a statement:As long-term investors, we believe the university and its stakeholders are much better served by investing in promising opportunities in the alternative energy field rather than gambling on oil and gas.The UC system’s decision is significant because of its size: It has sold more than $1 billion in fossil fuel assets and exceeded its five-year goal of investing $1 billion in clean energy projects. Environmental goals were set in UC’s investment framework in 2015.As Electrek reported yesterday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head Andrew Wheeler was questioned by members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today about rolling back environmental regulations during the coronavirus pandemic.As Electrek reported in March, the EPA announced a suspension of the enforcement of environmental rules, saying it “will generally not seek stipulated or other penalties for noncompliance with such obligations” during the coronavirus outbreak. Democratic senators accused Wheeler of allowing companies to increase their pollution.Wheeler rejected that accusation, saying, “No one, anywhere in this country, is allowed to increase their emissions under our enforcement discretion.”As Bloomberg Law reports, “The EPA has proposed or finalized eight rules and guidance documents that would increase air pollution since the pandemic struck.”Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), who, along with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), sent a letter on April 3 to Wheeler, demanding that the agency explain its decision to suspend environmental rules, said to Wheeler:You should be ashamed of yourself. Your agency should be ashamed of itself. Your job is to protect the public health, and you are taking actions that will make this crisis worse.Markey referred to a report that committee ranking member Thomas R. Carper (D-DE) had released earlier in the day that asserts that there is early that reports a correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality.The reports recommends that the EPA reverse its rollbacks and take a number of steps to protect the country from air pollution and address the climate crisis.

Bachmann said during his testimony:Working in EPA’s Air Office on science/policy for 33 years, I had a lead role in all reviews of the particulate matter (PM) standards through 2006.Based on EPA’s assessment of the evidence, the rationale presented in this proposal is wholly inconsistent with the mandate of the Clean Air Act to set standards requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) (pictured in October above), who, along with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), sent a letter on April 3 to Wheeler demanding that the agency explain its decision to suspend environmental rules, said to Wheeler:You should be ashamed of yourself.

But emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power. So if you live in the US, do you know how your EV is being powered?The Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy released a map that shows what powers each state. They explain:When an electric vehicle is charged from the electrical grid, there are upstream emissions involved with creating the electricity. The amount of emissions is dependent on the sources used to create that electricity. Below is a map showing the approximate grid mix for each state, as well as the national average. To see estimates of well-to-wheel emissions for vehicles in a specific state, see the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center.Electrek’s Take: Some readers will occasionally comment or email in, asking why we cover climate-change issues and green energy on an electric vehicle website. This map perfectly illustrates why. The need to switch to clean energy sources has never been greater. There’s some nice wind action going on in the Midwest, but the country has a lot of work to do to get off the natural gas and coal. If you want your EV to be truly emissions-free, then we need to move to renewables.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head Andrew Wheeler will be questioned by members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today about rolling back environmental regulations during the coronavirus pandemic.As Electrek reported in March, the EPA announced a suspension of the enforcement of environmental rules, saying it “will generally not seek stipulated or other penalties for noncompliance with such obligations” during the coronavirus outbreak.On April 3, Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ed Markey (D-MA) sent a letter to Wheeler, demanding that the agency explain their decision to suspend environmental rules; who authorized it; how records will be maintained; whether meetings held with fossil-fuel lobbyists, and if so, when and with who; and finally, whether any analyses were conducted.As Electrek also reported, a Harvard University study at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, updated on April 5, confirmed a direct correlation between long-term exposure to air pollution and a higher coronavirus death rate.Further, on April 14, the EPA announced that it will not work to lower levels of particulate matter, thus not further reducing air pollution, despite the recommendations of its own scientists to do so.As Roll Call reports today:Last week, nine state attorneys general sued the EPA for issuing what they called a ‘broad, open-ended policy,’ referring to the agency’s March 26 decision to allow companies to determine for themselves if they can meet reporting requirements for air and water pollution during the crisis.On April 1, ranking member Thomas R. Carper, (D-DE), and 10 other Democratic senators raised concerns about agency activities during and in response to the pandemic, including its lack of a public continuity of operations plan and easing enforcement of air and water pollution rules.The Spanish government is ready to go net zero. It’s proposing a law, which still needs to be approved by Parliament, that would make Spain run on 100% renewable energy, ban new coal, oil, and gas extraction immediately, end direct fossil fuel subsidies, and make all new vehicles emissions-free by 2040.According to Climate Change News:The government forecast the plan would generate more than €200,000 million ($219,000 million) of investments in the next decade and create up to 350,000 new jobs every year.In a briefing paper, it claimed these carbon-cutting measures would boost the country’s economic growth by 1.8% by 2030 compared with business as usual.The law is expected to shape the recovery from Covid-19.

Lawmakers must hold Wheeler accountable for these indefensible actions that are making us sick.It’s about time that Wheeler answers for his actions. Do we expect straight answers from him? No. The most we can hope for is that the Senate hold the EPA accountable, and somehow, there is a reversal of these polluting deregulations that endanger people’s lives even further in the midst of a pandemic that attacks people’s lungs and other vital organs.As the Environmental Protection Network pointed out, “African Americans are 75% more likely to reside in communities that are near polluting facilities — and face a 54% higher health burden as a result of air pollution, compared with the general population. Similarly, Latino communities are disproportionately affected, with almost 2 million Latinos living within a half-mile of polluting facilities.”",solar

The timing is, frankly, terrible: This is is a punch in the gut to an industry that is suffering at the hand of the pandemic, like most other sectors.There are around 96 utility-scale solar, wind, and geothermal projects that operate on lands run by the US Bureau of Land Management.Reuters continues:US power plant owner Avangrid Inc, majority owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, received a bill for more than $3 million for two years of rent on its 131-megawatt Tule wind project on federal land near San Diego, according to spokesman Paul Copleman.Officials at two other renewable projects also confirmed they had received retroactive rent bills from the federal government but asked not to be named discussing the issue as the industry continues to lobby the government for support to weather the downturn.A budget document on the Interior Department’s website shows it expects to collect $50 million in rent fees for wind and solar projects in 2020, up from $1.1 million in 2019 and $21.6 million in 2018.EY has published its annual “Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index,” which “ranks the top 40 countries in the world on the attractiveness of their renewable energy investment and deployment opportunities.” EY explains:The rankings reflect our assessments of market attractiveness and global market trends. In this latest edition we see COVID-19 having a short to mid-term impact, but the long-term drivers for investment in renewables remain strong, making the sector a safer haven for investment.There have been some interesting shifts in the Top 10. The US has unseated China from the No. 1 spot (presumably this was awarded before the above surprise rent hike happened), because “of a short-term extension to the [Congress’ Production Tax Credit] and long-term growth in offshore wind, with plans to invest $57 billion to install up to 30GW by 2030.” China dropped to No. 2 because of a drop in renewable growth due to a decrease in government subsidies. However, EY is still optimistic about renewables growth in China.EY predicts that the sector will bounce back because of falling costs, supportive policies, the prospect of green stimulus plans, and the fast progress of the storage sector.Benoit Laclau, EY global energy leader, said:Stakeholders are looking to collaborate and invest in companies where climate change and sustainable development is embedded in their strategy. Energy leaders should take action to invest in renewables and related sustainable long-term projects, including energy efficiency, smart power networks and low-carbon transport infrastructure.Joe Biden’s campaign said yesterday that if Biden won the presidency, he’d kill the Keystone XL pipeline project, an $8 billion oil sands pipeline that would cross the US-Canada border.The Obama administration, in which Joe Biden was vice president, rejected the project, declaring it adversely affecting climate change. Donald Trump reversed the Obama administration’s decision in 2017.In April, as Electrek reported, a US federal judge canceled a key permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, saying it failed to adequately consider effects on endangered species.Photo: Energy.gov",solar

Wind projects that began construction in 2019 are eligible for a 40% credit, and those that start construction in 2020 will be eligible for a 60% credit. However, the PTC didn’t include an extension for solar or storage.Keep in mind that EY makes these evaluations on an annual basis. If the US wants to keep its coveted No 1 slot, which it hasn’t held since 2016, then it needs to build a significant extension of those PTCs, include solar and storage this time, and provide even more support for the green energy sector into its stimulus plans — which so far, hasn’t happened.

2020/05/15,"The green energy sector has lost nearly 600,000 jobs in March and April, according to a report by BW Research Partnership. That’s 17% of the sector’s workforce. This is of course a result of stay-at-home orders due to the pandemic, which halts both production and residential and commercial installation.BW Research expects 850,000 job losses by the end of June. That’s about 25% of all clean energy jobs. The clean energy industry employed more than 3.4 million Americans last year — triple the number of people employed in the fossil fuel industry.The nearly 600,000 jobs lost to date is more than double the number the sector has created since 2017, the report said, so it’s a big blow.However, it’s not hopeless. (For example, just look at Poland above, and the fact that the US’ largest solar farm has just been approved.)Ravi Manghani, global head of solar at Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting company based in the UK, said of the sector’s outlook:It might lose the edge a teeny bit, but for the most part it’s still going to be an economically viable proposition.According to the US Department of Labor, total US unemployment claims have reached 33.5 million since mid-March. And that’s claims — undoubtedly, there are people who are unemployed who have yet to file. So the green energy sector’s 594,347 lost jobs make up just a small slice of the unemployed pie.However, the fossil-fuel industry makes up an even smaller slice. So why is the Trump administration trying to bail out fossil fuels yet giving no support to clean energy, who employs even more workers? Green energy needs to be included in federal aid, or more jobs will be lost.Grist suggests how the government could do that:Even in good times, renewable developers often don’t owe enough in tax to the federal government to make green energy tax credits worthwhile, so they partner with big investors that can offset their own own taxes. When the economy slumps, however, investors don’t owe as much tax — and so are unwilling to participate. The 2009 [Obama-era Recovery Act] bypassed this problem by turning those tax credits into grants. Doing that now… could get many people back to work sooner.",solar

2020/05/13,"India, the world’s fifth-largest economy, has had its first year-on-year reduction in CO2 emissions in 40 years, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief. This is due to an economic slowdown as a result of coronavirus and the growth of green energy.Emissions in India fell by around 15% in March, and about 30% in April. Coal sales fell 10% and imports fell 27.5% in March due to reduced demand for electricity.Cities are reporting much lower levels of particulate matter (PM 2.5) and nitrogen dioxide, which is released by vehicles and power plants.According to CNN:Studying daily data from India’s national grid, analysts found that coal-fired power generation fell 15% in March and 31% in the first three weeks of April, while renewable energy generation increased by 6.4% in March and decreased by 1.4% in April.Oil consumption has also been slowing since early 2019, researchers found, but noted that COVID-19 lockdown measures have had a “dramatic impact” on transport oil consumption, which fell 18% in March 2020 compared to the previous year.Meanwhile, natural gas consumption, which increased 5.5% in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, is expected to fall by up to 20% during the lockdown, analysts said.In the short term, this is wonderful for India’s environment. And Indian residents have been posting photos of clear skies allowing views of the Himalayas that they have not previously seen. But this is short-term good news. How the Indian government acts next in response to the pandemic is what really matters.Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government seize the opportunity to clean up India’s pollution, or will the country knee-jerk and double down on pollutants in order to achieve economic recovery?Carbon Brief identifies three possible outcomes:Money will likely drive decision making, and solar is now cheaper than coal. But hopefully, those blue skies and the influence of the people who are enjoying clean air for the first time in decades will help inspire the government to move permanently toward a renewable energy future.

As Electrek reported on January 2, the farm will be 7,100 acres in size and provide 690 megawatts. It will also feature energy storage of at least 380 megawatts of four-hour lithium-ion batteries.It will be the largest solar farm in the US and the eighth largest solar farm in the world. Gemini will be completed as soon as 2022 and provide enough energy to power all 225,000 of the homes in Las Vegas, and then some.Nevada utility NV Energy, a subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, is providing financial backing for the project. It’s expected that it will create 1,600 to 1,800 temporary construction positions, and provide 19 permanent jobs.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said:The solar industry is resilient and a project like this one will bring jobs and private investment to the state when we need it most.In 2019, Governor Steve Sisolak (D-NV) signed a bill that requires Nevada utilities to get half of their electricity from green energy sources by 2030, and set a goal of 100% net zero by 2050.India has had its first year-on-year reduction in CO2 emissions in 40 years, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief. This is due to an economic slowdown due to coronavirus and the growth of green energy.Emissions in India fell by around 15% in March and about 30% in April.

Ultimately, the government will be rolling out a £2 billion cycling and walking funding package.According to Business Green:A coalition of nine NGOs published an open letter to the transport secretary, environment secretary, chancellor, leaders of local and regional authorities, and city mayors calling for a ‘street revolution to stop air pollution bounce-back’ as lockdown measures lifted.The group — which includes Greenpeace UK, Living Streets, Cycling UK, Transport & Environment, and CPRE — is calling for at least £6 billion in funding over the next five years and for a transformation of the UK’s streets to deliver cycle lanes on all main roads and the creation of pedestrianized ‘Mini-Hollands’ in all towns and cities.",solar
2020/05/12,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The US Energy Information Administration released a report yesterday that says the “decline in last year’s coal generation levels was the largest percentage decline in history (16%) and second-largest in absolute terms (240,000 GWh).” Coal-fired electricity power fell to a 42-year low.The cause? Increased output from natural gas-fired plants and wind turbines. Wind turbine-generated electricity set a new record, surpassing 300,000 GWh, up 10% from 2018. Natural gas-fired generation also reached a new record of nearly 1.6 million GWh in 2019, up 8% from 2018.Electrek’s Take: We want to move away from the latter asap. It’s better than coal, but still a polluting fossil fuel. US coal-fired capacity has been declining since 2011 due to cheap natural gas. Renewable prices are now cheaper than natural gas, so expect to see the same pattern repeat itself, happily, with gas and green energy.On February 20, Hartshorne’s Poplar Grove, a thermal coal mine in western Kentucky that was lauded as the first to open under Donald Trump’s pro-coal administration, filed for bankruptcy. The group cited technical challenges and market conditions because gas became cheaper than coal.In 2017, Grant Quasha, then the CEO and managing director of Paringa, which owns Hartshorne, told S&P Global Market Intelligence:The build-out of this newly emerging producer may not have been possible without the support of the Trump and [Kentucky Governor Matt] Bevin administrations.Quasha is no longer CEO, and the company has been working to restructure its business since it declared bankruptcy, and applied for $2.3 million from the federal coronavirus relief program.Hartshorne isn’t feeling as warmly toward the government now. It was denied the application for aid because it’s in the middle of a bankruptcy restructuring — and the Small Business Administration excludes companies in bankruptcy. So the company has filed a lawsuit against the government on May 8, saying the “Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, is contrary to the statute, arbitrary and unlawfully discriminates against businesses that are in bankruptcy,” according to S&P Global.Multiple coal companies have received funding through the PPP program.Li-ion storage system manufacturer SimpliPhi Power has partnered with microgrid systems nonprofit Footprint Project to provide a green energy microgrid 20-bed field hospital (pictured) for the Matamoros migrant camp in Mexico on the US border, with the support of the Mexican government. It’s a pop-up, climate-controlled medical ICU to treat coronavirus patients. A solar and energy storage trailer serves as a primary power source for the ICU.The camp shelters around 3,000 asylum seekers living in overcrowded tents with little infrastructure and no access to basic medical care or hygiene, which heightens the threat of the spread of COVID-19.SimpliPhi and Footprint Project have partnered on many microgrid projects, including disaster relief in Puerto Rico. SimpliPhi also recently powered a trailer in Nashville after the devastating tornadoes hit.SimpliPhi Power CEO Catherine Von Burg said:Renewable energy microgrids for humanitarian needs like the Matamoros migrant camp can play a critical role during this global pandemic, ensuring reliable, uninterrupted access to clean power, allowing medical teams to focus on treatment and medicine, not purchasing fuel over medical supplies.",solar
2020/05/11,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Jeff Currie, Goldman’s global head of commodities research, told media on Thursday last week that he thought a drop in business travel will permanently hit the oil industry. Currie said [via MarketWatch]:I think you’re going to lose a good chunk of the jet demand that would have been associated with business travel. Our base case is you lose somewhere around 2 to 3 million barrels per day.Before we used to have these internal meetings and things of that nature, and I think this is going to be way more Zoom-oriented, other types of substitutes.He expects a recovery in demand, but oversupply will have to be addressed. He says US oil bounce-back could come as late as the third quarter of 2022.Electrek’s Take: As mentioned throughout today’s EGEB, we need support for renewables — not an oil recovery, or Big Oil bailouts.The March US coronavirus stimulus package, the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, featured the Small Business Association’s Paycheck Protection Program. To reiterate, it was created for small businesses.Vice reports:At least 16 drillers, fuel transporters, oil technology firms, and service providers tapped the Small Business Association’s Paycheck Protection Program… the records show. Most of those borrowers are valued at over $10 million on the stock market.That’s at least $72 million in total for fossil-fuel companies. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the end of April:Before we forgive these loans, we’ll check every single one over $2 million. So anybody that took the money that shouldn’t have taken the money, one it won’t be forgiven, and two, they may be subject to criminal liability, which is a big deal.Electrek’s Take: The government ought to be more than a little busy auditing Big Oil and Gas if Mnuchin meant what he said. We’ll see.Support from the current administration for the renewables industry, which makes up around one-fifth of all US power, has been almost nonexistent until just a couple days ago, when, as the Washington Post reports:In a letter sent to senators Thursday, the Treasury Department said it is considering ways to let solar, wind, and other alternative energy developers continue to qualify for tax incentives critical for paying for the building of wind turbines and solar panel arrays — even if construction is put on hold.‘Projects that have been waylaid by the economic disruptions of this pandemic can now proceed with more certainty,’ said Charles E. Grassley (R-IA), who led a bipartisan group of six senators in asking the department for the relief for renewables.Solar and wind developers need to complete construction on projects within four years to receive government incentives. Grassley’s group has asked for an extension to five years. It was positively received.It’s unsurprising that Grassley, a Republican, led the charge for renewable relief; wind power is now the largest source of electricity in Iowa.But don’t get too excited. The chances of green energy incentives in the next stimulus bill are minuscule, as the focus will be on front-line workers and state and local governments.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) doesn’t want any “wish list items” in stimulus packages, and he hasn’t quite figured out, unlike the rest of the world, that addressing coronavirus and reducing pollution and addressing climate change go hand in hand.",solar
2020/05/08,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan announced Thursday that nearly 20 miles of Seattle streets will permanently close to most vehicle traffic by the end of May, reports the Seattle Times.Cities such as Seattle and Oakland closed streets to car traffic to give people a chance to socially distance while exercising during the pandemic. Seattle is going to make this a permanent step after the statewide stay-at-home order is lifted in order to reduce emissions. Walking and cycling may just be the greenest form of transport there is.Residents, delivery drivers, garbage and recycling workers, and emergency response vehicles can continue to use the streets, but no through traffic is allowed.It will cost between $100,000 and $200,000 to close the streets permanently. Durkan said:As we assess how to make the changes that have kept us safe and healthy sustainable for the long term, we must ensure Seattle is rebuilding better than before. Safe and Healthy Streets are an important tool for families in our neighborhoods to get outside, get some exercise and enjoy the nice weather. Over the long term, these streets will become treasured assets in our neighborhoods.Here’s Grist, explaining how open streets to increase walking and cycling space is unfolding:Coal mines that have been dormant for more than 80 years in northeast England will be transformed into a green energy heating system as part of a new £7 million renewable energy plan.The heating scheme will tap geothermal energy from the flooded underground mines of the former Hebburn Colliery east of Newcastle to heat South Tyneside Council buildings.Joan Atkinson, South Tyneside councillor, said:It is expected to deliver a reduction of 319 tonnes of carbon emissions a year, which will make it a key component in our drive to make the council carbon neutral by 2030. It will also help us meet our obligations to upgrade the energy performance of fuel-poor homes as it will be used to heat one of the town’s residential high-rise blocks.The minewater heating system will be powered by solar panels.Minnesota’s Great River Energy will close the Coal Creek Power Station in North Dakota several years early because it says it is losing too much money, despite being adjacent to a coal mine. It will close one of the largest power plants in the US upper Midwest in the second half of 2022.It will be replaced with new wind farms, including four in Minnesota. Great River said its carbon dioxide emissions will fall by 95% from the Minnesota benchmark year of 2005.David Saggau, CEO of Great River, a nonprofit wholesale cooperative owned by 28 retail electricity co-ops, said [via the StarTribune]:The real driver for this decision is economics.[The drop in emissions] is not a driver of [closing Coal Creek], but it is a significant side benefit.The StarTribune writes:When the transformation is complete, Great River expects that two-thirds of its electricity will come from wind turbines. Much of the rest will come through purchases in the regional wholesale electricity market.Electrek’s Take: So Saggau doesn’t see dropping emissions as a driver for shutting down coal. It’s about money for Great River. But ultimately, who cares? Economics, saving the environment: same result. Goodbye, Coal Creek Power Station, and hello wind farms. We all win in the end, regardless of motive.",solar
2020/05/08,"A coal mine in South Tyneside that has been abandoned since 1932 will be transformed into a green energy heating system as part of a new £7 million renewable energy plan.The heating scheme will tap geothermal energy from the flooded underground mines of the former Hebburn Colliery east of Newcastle to heat South Tyneside Council buildings. The project is being developed with the Coal Authority and Durham University. It has preliminary approval for £3.5 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund.Water will be extracted from the coal mines through drilled vertical boreholes that are 300-400 meters deep. A water-source heat pump installed at the project’s energy center will extract the heat from the mine water and compress it to a much higher temperature and then distribute it across the district heat network. Cooled water will then be returned to the mines.The minewater heating system will be powered by solar panels.Joan Atkinson, South Tyneside councillor, said:It is expected to deliver a reduction of 319 tonnes of carbon emissions a year, which will make it a key component in our drive to make the council carbon neutral by 2030. It will also help us meet our obligations to upgrade the energy performance of fuel-poor homes as it will be used to heat one of the town’s residential high-rise blocks.Oh, how I love adaptive reuse. Especially when you take something like a dirty, old coal mine and turn it into a green source of energy. England’s northeast was dependent on coal for a long time, and the region was hit hard by the loss of jobs as mines closed. So to take old mines and turn them into sources of clean energy will only benefit the region both economically and environmentally.Perhaps the US regions that have historically been dependent on coal could follow Tyneside’s lead and adapt, rather than clinging to a dead fossil fuel.

It also called for more clean technology research and development.The letter concluded:Let us use the present challenge we are facing together as an opportunity for us all to put the environment at the core of a collective rebound.Swedish engineering and industrial design company Modvion has erected the first wooden wind turbine outside Gothenburg, Sweden. It was a pilot project for the Swedish Wind Technology Centre and will be used for research purposes.Otto Lundman, CEO of Modvion AB, said:This is a major breakthrough that paves the way for the next generation of wind turbines. Laminated wood is stronger than steel at the same weight and by building in modules, the wind turbines can be taller. By building in wood, we also reduce carbon dioxide emissions in manufacturing and instead store carbon dioxide in the design.Modvion develops modular wind turbine designs in renewable engineered wood.

According to Reuters:[A] group of 11 shareholders, led by French fund manager Meeschaert, will present a resolution at Total’s annual general meeting on May 29 to strengthen its commitment to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Climate Agreement.The investors said they wanted Total to expand its net zero emissions target on its energy products to customers globally, not just for Europe, and called for a detailed plan of action.The investors said in a statement:The climate challenge has no borders.This first step will therefore need to be reinforced by an action plan that meets concrete and exhaustive objectives, including the group’s global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly outside Europe.Total was one of the 90 businesses that called on the French government to prioritize ecological transition.Electrek’s Take: Nice to see Total’s shareholders holding it accountable, as while it’s good news that it’s aiming for net zero, to do so only in Europe is fence-sitting. The climate has no borders, indeed.",solar
2020/05/06,"Top US and British economists, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment chairman Lord Nicholas Stern, published a working paper on Tuesday that asserts that the most effective coronavirus stimulus packages will also focus on reducing carbon emissions.The paper’s introduction states that the COVID-19 crisis could mark a turning point in progress to slow climate change, but emissions could also increase once economies start to recover unless governments intervene.As Bloomberg Green elaborates:That conclusion comes from a survey of more than 200 central bankers, G-20 finance ministers, and top academics from across 53 countries, conducted by a group of star economists that includes Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, among others. The results were released [on May 4] in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.Their task was to rank 25 different economic policies — many of which were used to boost recovery after the financial crisis of 2008-09 — on four characteristics: how quickly the policy could be deployed, what economic return would it bring for each $1 of public money spent, for how long would it provide returns, and how much it would contribute to lowering emissions.The authors “looked at more than 700 economic stimulus policies launched during or since the 2008 financial crisis, and surveyed 231 experts from 53 countries, including senior officials from finance ministries and central banks,” according to Reuters.Survey respondents called for green energy research and infrastructure, zero-carbon transport, and disaster preparedness. They concluded that boosting green energy would create more jobs, deliver more short-term returns, and save more in the long term.Many survey respondents are able to directly influence where stimulus money is spent, such as people like Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Co-operation, and Sandra Eickmeier, senior economist at Germany’s central bank.Since respondents support green stimulus plans, will they actually implement them?This is such a no-brainer, and if anything good comes out of the pandemic, this could be its greatest silver lining — saving the planet and preventing millions more deaths. And for those who still don’t see the point of curbing climate change (looking at you, current US administration and China), what on earth is it going to take?Maybe the almighty “dollar” will sway them where catastrophe and evidence of clean air and water won’t. (Spain has been one of the hardest-hit countries in the world, and Barcelona has seen a pollution reduction of 62% and 58% across the whole country — its lowest levels in a decade. That’s called evidence.)Hey, Donald Trump and Republican legislators — and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, you listening? (probably not) — trying to boost the fossil-fuel industry is throwing money in the garbage.However, more than 40 US lawmakers are backing legislation to prevent fossil fuel companies from receiving aid in stimulus packages in a bill called the ReWIND Act.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

That money bought 1 million solar panels on 370 of its stores and warehouses, 535 wind turbines, and two solar parks. The Swedish furniture giant will only use renewable and recyclable materials by 2030. It’s also going to stop using single-use plastics. Further, it’s aiming for zero-emission home deliveries by 2025.It’s a fantastic initiative, and more retailers need to follow IKEA’s example. If a company of this size can do it, and Costco, Target, and Walmart are too, then why can’t all big chains? Think about all that roof space. They’re doing it because it’s cheaper.🌍 Thank you @IKEA for leadership in the circular economy.

The results were released [on May 4] in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.The paper’s introduction points out that the COVID-19 crisis could mark a turning point in climate-change progress, but that emissions could increase once economies recover, unless governments intervene.The authors “looked at more than 700 economic stimulus policies launched during or since the 2008 financial crisis, and surveyed 231 experts from 53 countries, including senior officials from finance ministries and central banks,” according to Reuters.They concluded that boosting green energy would create more jobs, deliver more short-term returns, and save more in the long term.Swedish-headquartered steelmaker Ovako has successfully used hydrogen to heat steel.Ovako and Linde Gas jointly ran a trial that used hydrogen instead of liquefied petroleum gas to re-heat steel before rolling at the group’s mill in Hofors, Sweden, according to Kallanish Energy.Göran Nyström, EVP group marketing & technology at Ovako, said:This is a major development for the steel industry. It is the first time that hydrogen has been used to heat steel in an existing production environment. Thanks to the trial, we know that hydrogen can be used simply and flexibly, with no impact on steel quality, which would mean a very large reduction in the carbon footprint.Ovako is now evaluating investment options to roll out the scheme in all its rolling mills.Photo: seia.org",solar

The purpose of the program was “to help credit flow to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the pandemic.”Businesses with up to $5 billion in annual revenue are now eligible for support through the Fed’s program, as are companies with up to 15,000 employees. Previously, companies with up to 10,000 workers but under $2.5 billion in revenue were eligible for help.The changes were urged by oil state legislators like Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).Here’s Cruz’s April 24 letter asking for help, in which he cc’ed in Dan Brouillette, the energy secretary. Cruz writes:Under the authority of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, should immediately create a new lending facility that will provide emergency liquidity for small-and-medium sized businesses that work directly or indirectly with the oil and gas industry.The changes will allow oil and gas to qualify for aid after industry lobbyists pushed the Trump administration for changes, reports Bloomberg.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement:It’s outrageous that small businesses are fighting for limited funds, while the Trump administration is bending over backwards to shower these oil companies with billions of taxpayer dollars. For Republicans, there’s always enough money to bail out their corporate donors but not enough for helping working Americans and state and local governments.Friends of the Earth’s Lukas Ross said:These changes directly reflect demands from polluters and their favorite members of Congress. Long before the coronavirus, the drillers were in deep trouble. Now frackers want to pay back their debts with our money. Trump’s big oil bailout must be stopped.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is sitting on about $43 billion in low-interest loans for clean energy projects, reports the New York Times.Tina Bru, Norway’s minister of petroleum and energy, announced that Norwegian oil production will be reduced by 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) in June and 134,000 bpd in the second half of 2020 due to reduced demand as a result of the pandemic.Bru said:The cut will include oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and be fairly distributed between the fields and thereby between companies.It will imply a limitation of production for those oil companies with ownership shares in the relevant oil fields. Gas fields are exempt. Thus, the cut will not affect Norwegian gas production or Norwegian gas exports.Norway has previously said that it will cut production if several big oil-producing countries implement large cuts. Electrek reported on April 13 that oil-producing nations agreed to the largest cut in history in an attempt to stabilize oil prices. It didn’t work, as we also reported on April 20 that US oil futures crashed below $0 for first time in history.Denmark-headquartered Ørsted, the world’s top offshore wind developer, has five US offshore wind projects that are expected to be delayed due to COVID-19 and slowed permitting.Ørsted confirmed that Maryland’s 120-MW Skipjack and New York’s 130-MW South Fork are expected to miss their 2022 completion dates. Skipjack will likely be pushed back to 2023, for example.Ørsted’s three largest US offshore projects — the 704MW Revolution Wind for Rhode Island and Connecticut; New York’s 880MW Sunrise Wind; and New Jersey’s 1.1GW Ocean Wind — face “increased risk of delays,” Greentech Media reports.

2020/04/30,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its Global Energy Review 2020, in which it explores “the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on global energy demand and CO2 emissions.”The IEA predicts that there will be a record annual decline in carbon emissions globally of almost 8%. Further, energy demand will fall 6% in 2020. Or, as the IEA puts it, “the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India, the world’s third largest energy consumer.”The study is based on an analysis of more than 100 days of real data so far this year.Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, said:This is a historic shock to the entire energy world. Amid today’s unparalleled health and economic crises, the plunge in demand for nearly all major fuels is staggering, especially for coal, oil, and gas. Only renewables are holding up during the previously unheard-of slump in electricity use.It is still too early to determine the longer-term impacts, but the energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before.New research from UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health for the Sierra Club on gas-fueled home appliances and their effect on air quality finds replacing gas with electric appliances in California homes would prevent around 350 premature deaths each year and produce $3.5 billion in annual health benefits from cleaner air.According to experts at the Natural Resources Defense Council:Among appliances, gas cooktops and ovens affect indoor air quality the most, the study found, while outdoor air quality is most impacted by gas-fueled furnaces and water heaters that vent combustion gases to the outside.The study states that when it comes to indoor air quality:Gas appliances emit a wide range of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and formaldehyde, which have been linked to various acute and chronic health effects, including respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and premature death.As Electrek reported on April 8, a Harvard study confirmed that there is a direct correlation between long-term exposure to air pollution and a higher coronavirus death rate, so this study is particularly important.Royal Dutch Shell has cut its shareholder dividend for the first time since 1945 following the collapse of global oil prices.Shell’s board said it had decided to reduce its first-quarter dividend to $0.16 per share, down from $0.47 at the end of 2019 — a 66% cut.Shell is — was – the biggest dividend payer in the UK’s FTSE 100. It is no longer the FTSE’s most valuable company. That’s now pharma company AstraZeneca.CNBC reports:Shell also reported that net income attributable to shareholders on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis and excluding identified items, which is used as a proxy for net profit, came in at $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2020.

Let us know what you think in the comments below.I know a lot of people who prefer cooking on gas — for years, I preferred it to electric, as it gave me better control over the temperature. I also didn’t know any better. (Most restaurant kitchens use gas, do they not?) Then I got an induction cooker, which was fantastic, and now cook on electric. It’s great, as temperature control has improved. We can adapt.In the current pandemic, we need our homes to be healthy and safe.

2020/04/29,"At the 11th Petersberg Climate Dialogue that was held virtually this year, UN Secretary General António Guterres yesterday said that the US and China must stop supporting emitters in economic pandemic rescue packages.Guterres said:Let us not forget that the G20 countries collectively account for more than 80% of global emissions and over 85% of the global economy.All of them must also commit to carbon neutrality by 2050.The Paris Agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the United States and China.Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts risk to be doomed.The Guardian details the US’ and China’s counterproductive measures:In the US the bailout of the airline industry is set to go ahead without conditions attached on their emissions, while the White House has moved to weaken a raft of environmental regulations. In China, subsidies for fossil fuel vehicles and the easing of permits for coal mining are also likely to raise emissions.Guterres also urged around 30 governments who participated in the dialogue to “devote economic rescue packages for the coronavirus crisis to businesses that cut greenhouse gas emissions and create green jobs,” according to the Guardian.Guterres said:Where taxpayers’ money is needed to rescue businesses, it must be creating green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth. It must not be bailing out outdated, polluting, carbon-intensive industries.He also called for fiscal firepower to shift economies from gray to green, public funds to be invested in sustainable sectors, the end of fossil fuel subsidies, always taking climate change into account in all global financial decisions, and working together as an international community.German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed that message yesterday:It will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programs, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection.COP26 president Alok Sharma of the UK said in his closing remarks:We have defined a number of key themes for COP26, which include transition to clean energy, clean transport, nature based solutions, adaptation and resilience, and of course bringing it all together, finance.I think what is very heartening, was to see the contributions today have very much echoed these particular themes. We’ve heard colleagues talk about the need for a green deal, a green transition, the need to invest in innovation, to shift the investment to green technologies, and all of that is going to be absolutely vital.As environmental activist George Monbiot more starkly put it in an op-ed today:Bail out the living world, not its destroyers.

It will also ask its fund managers to demonstrate evidence of net zero emissions business plans.The university said it would follow the practices in its own Oxford Martin Principles for Climate-Conscious Investment. (Makes sense, right? Have to put your £3 billion where your mouth is.) That document includes a framework that determines whether investments are compatible with the Paris Agreement.Students have put pressure on the university in recent years with protests, including campaigners occupying St John’s College over its £8 million investments in BP and Shell.Oxford had more investments in fossil fuels than any other university in the UK, apart from Cambridge, which has yet to divest.According to the BBC, the Oxford Climate Justice Campaign (OCJC) said the resolution was of “historic importance.”At the 11th Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which was held virtually this year, UN secretary general António Guterres yesterday urged around 35 governments to “devote economic rescue packages for the coronavirus crisis to businesses that cut greenhouse gas emissions and create green jobs,” according to the Guardian.Guterres said:Where taxpayers’ money is needed to rescue businesses, it must be creating green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth.

That’s the longest uninterrupted period of not using coal-fired power generation since 1882, during the Industrial Revolution.This is due to lower demand for power as a result of the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.Coal makes up only 2.1% of the UK’s power source now. There are only four coal plants left, and coal generation will be banned from 2025.Last week, as Electrek reported, the UK broke its solar power record at 9.68 GW. The previous record was 9.55 GW in May 2019. More electricity is being generated than being used, so the National Grid may need to turn off some power plants and wind farms to avoid overload.As the Guardian reports:The collapse of coal and rise of renewable energy sources have led to a drastic reduction in carbon emissions from the UK power sector. Since 2012, the average carbon intensity of the grid – the amount of emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy – has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO2 to 161g.GAF Energy, a San Francisco-based company that provides roof-integrated solar — an all-in-one solar solution for roofers — has launched an upgraded version of its solar roof product, DecoTech 2.0.

It also features wiring improvements for durability and safety.Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy, said:Not only does our redesigned system simplify the installation process, but it can reduce costs and save our local roofing contractors time. The goal is to provide a product to roofers that is as simple and easy to install as a non-solar roof, while delivering superior value.So, you don’t just sit the solar panels on the roof; the roofers themselves integrate the solar panels as part of the roof.

Saving the climate isn’t the incentive in these places — profitability is.We at Electrek take a slightly different stance from Texas’ reasoning: We are interested first in protecting the environment, ahead of profitability. And job creation is great — we fully support clean, well-paid jobs. But whatever the motive, whether it’s profitability or environmentalism, we hope that other states follow Texas’ lead, and think this article is a great backgrounder on why it’s happened, and how the country can go forward with green energy, with Texas as a model to follow.Oil may have bottomed out, but green energy is getting cheaper, too.

It recognizes climate change, and said it will not provide project-related financial services for the following:New thermal coal mines or significant expansion of existing mines;New coal-fired power plants or expansion of existing plants;Oil and gas exploration, development and production in the Arctic Circle;Projects that negatively impact the Outstanding Universal Value of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.They join Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo in shifting away from fossil-fuel projects.According to the Hill, Trump expressed his disgruntlement with the banks’ shift. After Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) complained in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump stated:I don’t like that.They’re afraid of the radical left. You shouldn’t be afraid of the radical left. You cannot be discriminating against these great energy companies.Electrek’s Take: The concept of Big Banks being “afraid” of the “radical left” is laughable.

The goal is a green recovery. This means not only creating new jobs but also advancing climate action in ways that make the entire world more resilient. It also includes the question of how to design stimulus programmes that will facilitate a more committed climate policy in future.Wenonah Hauter is the executive director of the national advocacy groups Food & Water Action and Food & Water Watch and author of the book Frackopoly: The Battle for the Future of Energy and the Environment. Hauter wrote an op-ed for Newsweek in which she suggests that the US government should buy fossil-fuel companies, not bail them out. Here’s how she says it could work. (You can read the whole op-ed here.)Simply put, here’s how the buyout can work: The federal government purchases enough stock to take a majority stake in the largest American fossil fuel companies, and over the next decade winds down drilling and fracking operations while managing a rapid, just transition to clean, renewable energy. This would drastically reduce climate-warming emissions while creating hundreds of thousands of stable new jobs at a time when American workers need them most. As documented in our 2019 report “Building Climate Justice,” the vast majority of these jobs are based in readily available technologies, including solar panel production and energy efficiency retrofitting.The fossil fuel crisis presents an opportunity for real climate action—and at a bargain price. A 2017 analysis of full industry nationalization pinned the cost at a little more than $1 trillion. It would cost less than half as much to buy control of the same companies now.Do you agree?

It also includes the question of how to design stimulus programmes that will facilitate a more committed climate policy in future.60 German companies said in a letter ahead of the PCD:We appeal to the federal government to closely link economic policy measures to overcome both the climate crisis and the coronavirus crisis.Companies included ThyssenKrupp, Salzgitter, Bayer, Covestro, E.ON, HeidelbergCement, Puma, Allianz and Deutsche Telekom, according to Reuters.But not all companies are keen:Car makers are already lobbying to prevent the announced tightening of emissions limits on cars, airlines for a waiver on jet fuel taxes, and the plastics industry for an appeal of the ban on some plastics products.EU green chief Frans Timmermans said every euro spent on economic recovery measures after the coronavirus crisis would be linked to the green and digital transitions, according to the BBC.Meanwhile, China is plowing ahead with its carbon-intensive path, and Donald Trump is still desperately clinging to the idea of rescuing fossil fuels in the US. But the UK climate economist Lord Stern told BBC News: The immediate priority is the current COVID crisis — but then we have to build for the future.Timmermans is right and Trump is wrong. We should only be bailing out firms that are going to contribute to tackling climate change.They don’t have be be ostensibly clean tech firms at the moment — but they do have to be committed to cutting their emissions in line with international targets.Photo: CGTN",solar
2020/04/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Oil and gas operations in the US’s Permian Basin in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, which contains the Mid-Continent Oil Field province, is releasing methane at twice the average rate found in previous studies of 11 other major US oil and gas regions.The Permian Basin accounts for more than 30% of total US oil production and 10% of total US gas production — 3.5 million barrels of crude and 11 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.These findings were published on April 22 in the journal Science Advances by scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund, Harvard University, Georgia Tech, and the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research.The abstract reports:This magnitude of emissions is 3.7% of the gross gas extracted in the Permian, i.e., ~60% higher than the national average leakage rate. The high methane leakage rate is likely contributed by extensive venting and flaring, resulting from insufficient infrastructure to process and transport natural gas.According to Phys.org, the report was “based on 11 months of satellite data encompassing 200,000 individual readings taken across the 160,000-square-kilometer basin by the European Space Agency’s TROPOMI instrument from May 2018 to March 2019.”The Permian Basin could, in the short term, greatly reduce methane emissions with better infrastructure design and development, more effective operations, and better regulation at both the state and federal levels. (Yes, EPA, we do need regulations. This study is proof.)Reducing methane from oil and gas is the fastest, most cost-effective way to slow the rate of global warming. Or, the US could just fully embrace green energy, since oil is tanking anyway.The Supreme Court yesterday, in a 6-3 ruling on the Maui/Clean Water Act Case, held that discharges to “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) via groundwater are covered under the Clean Water Act “when there is a functional equivalent of a direct discharge.” The federal government must regulate groundwater pollutants that make their way into navigable waters such as oceans.The court concluded that “an addition [of pollutants] falls within the statutory requirement that it be ‘from any point source’ when a point source directly deposits pollutants into navigable waters, or when the discharge reaches the same result through roughly similar means.”  The Supreme Court remanded the case to the 9th Circuit for further consideration in light of today’s opinion.A new study, published in Nature Communications yesterday, examined China’s large-scale initiative, launched in 2013, to systematically deploy solar photovoltaic (PV) projects to alleviate poverty in rural areas.The researchers used a panel dataset of 211 pilot counties that received targeted PV investments from 2013 to 2016. They found that the PV poverty alleviation pilot policy increases per-capita disposable income in a county by approximately 7%-8%.The study states:The effect of PV investment is positive and significant in the year of policy implementation and the effect is more than twice as high in the subsequent two to three years. The PV poverty alleviation effect is stronger in poorer regions, particularly in Eastern China.You can read the full study by clicking on the link above.Photo: Christopher Collins/Texas Observer",solar

It fell to 64,061 GWh during the week ended April 18, down 4.2% from the same week in 2019, according to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) trade group.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said it expected commercial-sector power to fall by 4.7% and industrial demand to fall by 4.2% in 2020.Residential electricity will only decline by about 0.8% in 2020, predicts the EIA, due to stay-at-home orders.The EIA said it expects total US power consumption to fall by 3% in 2020 before rising almost 1% next year.The EIA also reported today that “US consumption of petroleum products has fallen to its lowest level in decades because of measures that limit travel and because of the general economic slowdown” due to the pandemic. From January 1 to March 13, there has been a 40% decline of motor gasoline, a 20% decline of distillate fuel oil, and a 62% decline of jet fuel.Germany’s photovoltaic plants produced 32.227 GW on Monday (40% of the country’s power), which beat the country’s previous record on March 23. The UK broke its solar record on Monday at 9.68 GW. The previous record was 9.55 GW in May 2019.Records are common in the spring due to sunny conditions and cool temperatures, but this year, it’s more significant due to lack of pollution, which can block sunshine and coat PV panels with dirt.The German government forecasts that green energy will make up about 80% of the electricity mix by 2038, compared with just over 40% in 2019. (However, Germany still lags behind its European neighbors on ditching coal; Austria and Sweden just shut its last coal plants in the last week, for example. Germany intends to exit coal by 2038, but may do so sooner due to falling renewables prices.)Chris Hewett, chief executive of the UK’s Solar Trade Association (STA), said:Ideal weather conditions and lower levels of pollution than normal mean solar is providing record levels of cheap, clean power to the grid. At a time when most of us are working remotely, we can say that solar is truly keeping the Wi-Fi on.The UK has now gone nearly two weeks without using any coal on its grid, said the STA.8minute Solar Energy, the largest privately-held developer of solar PV and storage projects in the US, added 3 GW of large-scale solar projects to its development pipeline in April, for a total of over 18 GW. That’s enough to provide power for 20 million people in California and the US Southwest.8minute was the first company to beat the cost of fossil fuels with solar photovoltaics. In late 2019, it received approval for the Eland Solar & Storage Center north of Los Angeles, the lowest-cost solar and energy storage project in the US. 8minute intends to replicate this model across its pipeline to provide a reliable alternative for baseload power plants.8minute recently raised new development capital from its joint venture partners to support its 18 GW development pipeline. Partners include JP Morgan Asset Management, Upper Bay Infrastructure Partners, and the University of California (UC) Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents.Mario Maselli and Marietta Moshiashvili, cofounders and managing partners of Upper Bay, which manages around $700 million of assets, said:We are excited to partner with long-term, aligned capital to grow our platform investment in 8minute and accelerate the execution of several of 8minute’s next-generation solar power plants.",solar

2020/04/22,"Just days after Austria shut its last coal power plant, Sweden has followed suit with the closure of Stockholm Exergi AB’s Värtaverket plant, two years ahead of schedule. Belgium shut down its last coal power station in 2016.Stockholm Exergi said:The coal-fired cogeneration plant KVV6 at Värtaverket has been in operation and supplied heat and electricity to Stockholmers since 1989. Now it is closed.The mild winter has meant that that reserve has not had to be used, and now it is closed down for good. Our goal is for all our production to come from renewable or recycled energy.The closure of KVV6 means that all planned use of coal will cease and thus Stockholm Exergi’s CO2 emissions will be reduced by about half.Anders Egelrud, CEO of Stockholm Exergi, said:Our goal is for all our production to come from renewable or recycled energy. This plant has provided the Stockholmers with heat and electricity for a long time. Today we know that we must stop using all fossil fuels, therefore the coal needs to be phased out and we do so several years before the original plan.Europe Beyond Coal‘s campaign director Kathrin Gutmann said:With Sweden going coal free in the same week as Austria, the downward trajectory of coal in Europe is clear.Against the backdrop of the serious health challenges we are currently facing, leaving coal behind in exchange for renewables is the right decision, and will repay us in kind with improved health, climate protection, and more resilient economies.According to Europe Beyond Coal, six more countries are expected to follow suit by 2025 or earlier, including France (2022), Slovakia and Portugal (2023), the UK (2024), Ireland (2025), and Italy (2025).Five more will drop coal by 2030 or earlier, which is the necessary end date for coal generation in Europe for the continent to be in line with the Paris Agreement. This includes Greece (2028), the Netherlands and Finland (2029), and Hungary and Denmark (2030).Discussions are currently under way in the Czech Republic, Spain, and North Macedonia over when to exit coal.Germany intends to exit coal by 2038, which would mean it would not meet the Paris Agreement.Photo: Raphael Andres/Unsplash",solar

It brought out 20 million Americans in participation and helped spark the modern environmental movement. Today, it’s 50 years old.In the 1970s, the Environmental Protection Agency was created (although we probably need to go back to the drawing board on that one now) and the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act were passed. The Clean Air Act was updated, too.The Earth Day Network published a Q&A with solar and environmental advocate Hayes just ahead of its 50th anniversary, which can be read in full here. (Of course, Earth Day is being celebrated remotely this year — here’s what’s on.)Here’s an excerpt of Haye’s thoughts on where we were, where we are, and where we could go:Earth Day Network: The decade that followed the first Earth Day saw a cascade of environmental protection legislation, some of which are facing recent threats and rollbacks. What do we need to do to spark the next wave of protections for our environment?Denis Hayes: The really big question is not so much how we’re going to protect the victories of the past, since they are hugely popular and very cost effective; it’s how we move into global issues, which we’ve been notoriously unsuccessful in figuring out ways to address. If it’s a national issue, you just pass a law and turn it over to an agency to regulate it — we can enforce it and take people to court. On a global issue, none of that is true.EDN: What does a successful Earth Day 2070 look like? And what legacy do you hope to build as Earth Day heads in the next 50 years?DH: …I do hope that what we have in 2070 is a world that is living within its limits. That is in ecological terms, not going well beyond its current capacity and suffering from overshoots from collapse is something that I fear is likely, but it shouldn’t be if we’re doing everything well. When we have things going well for the environment, Earth Days tend to be somewhat celebratory, and when you have things going wrong for the environment, then they tend to be protests against all of the things that are going wrong and that are harming people. I hope in 2070 we will be in a position to celebrate.Nigel Green is CEO of the deVere Group, one of the world’s leading independent financial advisory organizations. deVere has more than $10 billion under advice from more than 80,000 clients in 100 countries.Green explains how negative oil prices crashed below zero this week in the video.

2020/04/20,"The US lost more than 100,000 green energy jobs in March due to the coronavirus shutdown, but the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) first Global Renewables Outlook, released today, reports that if the world thinks long term, investment in green energy would be a huge boost to the global economy.In the short term, like all sectors, the US renewable sector is taking a big hit due to the coronavirus pandemic. A study by BW Research Partnership for environmental entrepreneurial advocacy group E2, which drew from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that March unemployment data reflect the following job losses:These numbers do not reflect underemployment or temporary unemployment, and April will probably look worse.However, if we think long-term, IRENA reports, it doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom:Transforming the energy system could boost cumulative global GDP gains above business-as-usual by USD $98 trillion between now and 2050. It would nearly quadruple renewable energy jobs to 42 million, expand employment in energy efficiency to 21 million and add 15 million in system flexibility.Here’s IRENA’s director-general Francesco La Camera on the report:These job losses are painful, especially when we need to be developing the clean energy sector faster and more efficiently than ever. But La Camera is right: We have to stay the course and keep our eyes on the prize.La Camera says:By accelerating renewables and making the energy transition an integral part of the wider recovery, governments can achieve multiple economic and social objectives in the pursuit of a resilient future that leaves nobody behind.Supporting the green energy sector now is not only better for the environment, it’s also going to pay off for healthier economies.

Both states now get more than 40% of their electricity from wind. In both states, wind has surpassed coal.Texas and Iowa led the US in wind power additions, and South Dakota had the largest percentage growth in 2019, “increasing its installed wind capacity by over 50 percent after installing 506 MW.”The Des Moines Register points out that “projects in Iowa added the second-most wind power capacity of any state in 2019, behind only Texas.”Further:The report also says Iowa is second in the nation in total wind industry jobs, with more than 9,000. The state’s total economic investment in wind energy grew by $3 billion to reach $19 billion — also second in the nation. Texas leads both categories.A USA Today report from earlier this year noted the reliable income from wind energy can help steady farmers dealing with a turbulent economy. The AWEA report said land lease payments for Iowa wind projects reached $69 million in 2019.On Friday, Austria shut down its last coal power plant. The country’s largest power provider, Verbund, switched off its coal-fired district heating plant in the southeastern state of Styria, which had provided power to the nearby city of Graz for 34 years.Austria still has gas and oil plants, but plans to cease fossil-fuel use for energy by 2030. Gas-fired plants will be shut down by the end of this decade, and Austria intends to be on 100% green energy at that point.Austria is the eighth EU country to stop burning coal.

This is the second time in 10 years that Longview, considered a model project, has filed for bankruptcy.The nine-year-old, 700-megawatt Longview Power Plant was one of the newest, most efficient coal-burning plants in the country. It was commissioned in December 2011 at a cost of $2.1 billion. It is near the coal mine that supplies it, keeping transport and fuel costs low. Longview is a “co‐fired” plant, meaning it can burn both coal and natural gas, although coal is its primary fuel.During the first quarter of 2020, most utilities have slashed the use of coal to the lowest levels in decades, as measured by market share of electricity generation: 19.9% in January, 18.5% in February, and 17.1% in March. Compare that to more than 50% in first-quarter 2008.Bottom line? When it comes to fossil fuels, gas is cheaper than coal now. And if we look at it purely from a financial standpoint, coal simply no longer makes economic sense. And if one of the newest, most efficient coal plants in the US can’t survive, well, then… isn’t the writing on the wall for dirty coal?And it looks like even Longview is beginning to figure it out: It’s building a 70MW utility-scale solar farm on the nearby Pennsylvania/West Virginia state line. At $76 million, that’s a fraction of the cost of the coal or gas plants.The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced yesterday that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.In 2012, the EPA enacted the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which, as the EPA states on its own website, protects “our children and communities by limiting emissions of mercury and other air toxics from power plants.”In December 2018, EPA head Andrew Wheeler issued a proposed revised Supplemental Cost Finding for the MATS and required risk and technology review under the Clean Air Act.Despite opposition from unions, business groups, and even utilities, and despite proven scientific links between pollution and coronavirus death rates, the EPA announced an overhaul of how the government calculates the health benefits of cleaner air by rolling back the legal basis for MATS, arguing in part that the benefits don’t justify the costs. But the Trump administration only considers direct benefits, not the millions of dollars spent on healthcare or lives lost. Even the EPA’s own Science Advisory Board found in January that this analysis is deeply flawed.Mercury exposure has been linked to severe damage to the lungs, brain, and other organs, and those who are exposed often later experience developmental disorders. The reduction of other pollutants that are decreased when mercury emissions are controlled saves hundreds of lives annually and prevents illnesses such as asthma and heart attacks.A US federal judge canceled a key permit on Wednesday for the Keystone XL oil pipeline that’s expected to stretch from Canada to Nebraska.Associated Press reports:Judge Brian Morris said the US Army Corps of Engineers failed to adequately consider effects on endangered species such as pallid sturgeon, a massive, dinosaur-like fish that lives in rivers the pipeline would cross.It’s another setback for the controversial project, as the ruling could block construction through hundreds of water crossings along the Keystone XL pipeline route. The ruling was the result of a lawsuit that challenged the Corps’ failure to adequately analyze the effects of pipelines authorized under Nationwide Permit 12, including Keystone XL, on local waterways, lands, wildlife, and communities, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.There is another hearing that began yesterday with Judge Morris on two other lawsuits against the $8 billion pipeline.

That directive led to the EPA removing many of the US’ top scientists from its roughly 23 advisory committees. Judge Denise Cote found that the EPA “failed to articulate any reason” or provide any evidentiary basis for its decision.The lawsuit was filed by the international environmental organization the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The directive disqualified scientists who receive research grants from the EPA, mainly scientists from universities and other nonprofit institutions, on the groundless pretext that these scientists may be biased.The EPA hypocritically allowed scientists, consultants, and others who work for or receive funding from the chemical and fossil-fuel industries to serve on the advisory committees.NRDC attorney Vivian Wang said: “EPA should return to relying on science to protect people from dirty air, unsafe water, and toxic chemicals, and do it now.”This was the 107th lawsuit that the NRDC has filed against Trump administration environmental rollbacks. The NRDC has won 60 of the 65 resolved cases to date.Chris Zarba, former chair of the EPA Science Advisory Board, said:This decision was clearly a victory for science. It will help ensure that some of the nation’s leading scientists will no longer be prohibited from advising EPA on how best to fulfill its mission to protect public health and safeguard the environment. However, there are a number of additional steps that need to be taken to ensure that EPA actions and decisions are based on the best available science.The Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has announced that it intends to reach net zero by 2050 or sooner by selling more green energy to reduce its carbon emissions.Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told investors today:Society’s expectations have shifted quickly in the debate around climate change. Shell now needs to go further with our own ambitions, which is why we aim to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner. Society, and our customers, expect nothing less.Shell said it plans to offset CO2 emissions from its own oil and gas production by 2050. Those emissions do not include the much larger category of greenhouse gases emitted from products it sells such as jet fuel and gasoline. The plan includes an interim target to cut those emissions by more than 33% by 2030, up from 20% previously.The Guardian compares Shell’s plan to BP’s plan:Whereas BP’s ambitious targets include an absolute reduction in emissions, Shell has chosen to focus on the overall carbon intensity of the energy it sells, which could be lowered by selling more clean energy alternatives without reducing the amount of fossil fuels produced.Hedge fund manager, philanthropist, environmentalist, and former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer wrote an op-ed for Green Tech Media titled, “A Pandemic Is No Time to Pander to the Fossil Fuel Industry.” You can read the full op-ed by clicking here, but here’s an excerpt. (And we at Electrek agree with Steyer’s point of view.)From transportation to energy generation, the fossil fuel industry is largely protected by its deep, complex and pervasive roots reaching throughout our global economy. But that’s precisely what also makes the investment risk all the clearer. All the corporate boardrooms, investment advisers, and brokers who have fought not to divest have been working strenuously to protect their God-given right to lose a lot of money. Jim Cramer and Larry Fink agree on that.Investing in clean energy isn’t just a social investment in curbing climate change — it also makes basic market sense. Wind energy is already on track to supply 20% of electricity in the US by 2030, and the solar industry has experienced a growth rate of more than 48% a year since 2010. In addition to avoiding the volatility of high-tension foreign commodities markets and the mounting social cost of carbon-polluting energy sources, an investment in clean energy doubles as an investment in long-term, good-paying American jobs. For example, the solar industry employs a quarter-million people, a number that’s doubled since 2012 due to the industry’s rapid growth.",solar

Richard George, head of Greenpeace UK’s climate campaign, said:A credible net-zero plan from Shell would start with a commitment to stop drilling for new oil and gas.Instead, investors are being fobbed off with vague aspirations that don’t tackle Shell’s monstrous carbon footprint and pass the buck to Shell’s customers to offset their emissions.Adam Matthews, a director on the Church of England Pensions Board, took a slightly softer tone:Ultimately, it will be by developing and supporting net-zero pathways in these sectors that we will achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.And Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said:Considering that Shell had just last year questioned the feasibility of achieving the 1.5 degree goal envisioned by the Paris Agreement, the company’s new aim to align its business with a 1.5 degree trajectory by 2050 or sooner is a sign of just how quickly the bar is being raised by Climate Action 100+ investor signatories in this high-emitting sector.This increased ambition, coupled with recent commitments from other oil companies including BP, Equinor, Repsol, and Eni, will place intense pressure on Shell’s US competitors including ExxonMobil and Chevron to follow suit. With stock prices in the sector near record lows, investors are quickly running out of patience with any company that continues to pursue business as usual.",solar
2020/04/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The Plant Washington coal project, which would have cost more than $2 billion, has been denied a request for additional time to begin construction by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD).The 12-year-long project was the last proposed new coal power plant project in the United States. It would have produced the annual carbon pollution equivalent of about 1 million cars.The Sierra Club, the Fall-line Alliance for a Clean Environment, Ogeechee Riverkeeper, Altamaha Riverkeeper, and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy challenged the plant’s original water and air permits and repeatedly fought requests for permit extensions.Katherine Cummings of the Washington County-based Fall-line Alliance for a Clean Environment said:I am thankful for the EPD’s decision so we can move on from this outdated and unnecessary project. Plant Washington posed a threat to family budgets, community health, and natural resources in and beyond Middle Georgia. It’s certainly a moment of closure and relief that this polluting giant will never be built.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced yesterday that it will not work to lower levels of particulate matter, thus not further reducing air pollution, despite the recommendations of its own scientists to do so.As Electrek reported last week, a Harvard University study at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, updated on April 5, confirmed a direct correlation between long-term exposure to air pollution and a higher coronavirus death rate.Under the Clean Air Act, particulate matter is among dangerous air pollutants covered by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which the EPA is required to review once every five years. But the last review was completed in 2012 — they’re three years late.Under the current standard, there are an estimated 52,100 premature deaths a year. The EPA’s own analysis by staff scientists showed that strengthening the standard by 25% could save 12,500 lives a year.US research group Brookings is running the Bass Center for Transformative Placemaking’s “Placemaking Postcards” blog series, which “aims to inspire public, private, and civic sector leaders to make transformative place investments that generate widespread social and economic benefits.” There is a particular focus on inclusive economic growth and development.Ben Fink, lead organizer for Performing Our Future, Appalshop/Roadside Theater, wrote an article titled, “How a conservative coal county built the biggest community solar energy project in East Kentucky.”You can read the entire article here, but here’s an excerpt:Bringing solar to coal country was risky. Coal had been king for generations, and there was plenty of propaganda accusing solar supporters of siding with ‘elite, anti-coal activists.’ It would have been easy to assume ‘the community’ would oppose the project — except for the fact that the community was the one running it. One Culture Hub leader surveyed the coal miners in her neighborhood and reported, ‘Every one of them said something like — “Honey, the train’s pulled out and it looks like this solar thing could benefit all of us.”‘This work is not about changing residents’ political views. It’s about neighbors coming together across differences to create a new story about the place we all live in and love. To some, it’s a story about saving the planet. To others, it’s about saving money or fighting an energy company. But to everyone, it’s about supporting our communities and the centers that keep them strong.",solar
2020/04/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Governor Ralph Northam (D-VA) signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act on Sunday. He also amended the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act that requires Virginia to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.The Virginia Clean Economy Act requires new measures to promote energy efficiency, sets a schedule for closing old fossil-fuel power plants, and requires electricity to come from 100% green energy.Dominion Energy Virginia must be 100% carbon-free by 2045 and Appalachian Power must be 100% carbon-free by 2050. It requires nearly all coal-fired plants to close by the end of 2024. Energy companies must pay penalties if they miss their targets, and part of that revenue would fund job training and green energy programs in historically disadvantaged communities.The Act says that 5.2GW of offshore wind generation and 16.1GW of solar and onshore wind are in the public interest. Virginia’s largest energy companies will also have to construct or acquire more than 3.1GW of energy storage capacity.Further, Dominion is required to prioritize hiring local workers from historically disadvantaged communities, work to advance apprenticeship and job training, and to include an environmental and fisheries mitigation plan.Northam said:These new clean energy laws propel Virginia to leadership among the states in fighting climate change. They advance environmental justice and help create clean energy jobs. In Virginia, we are proving that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig spilled around 4.9 million barrels of oil after a methane explosion on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico — the largest marine oil spill in history. And a decade later, scientists are finding oil from that spill in the livers of fish, and on the deep ocean floor.Scientists at the Center for Integrated Modeling and Analysis of the Gulf Ecosystem (C-IMAGE) at the University of South Florida have been studying the consequences of this marine fossil-fuel disaster since 2011. Marine scientists Steven Murawski and Sherryl Gilbert published their two main findings on the Conversation yesterday. The goal of the extensive study is to quantify the impacts of oil spills and prevent them in the future.Researchers have spent nearly 250 days at sea, sampling over 15,000 fishes and taking over 2,500 sediment cores off the US, Mexican, and Cuban coasts. The sediment cores prove that the oil has settled into the seabed floor.No fish in the Gulf have been free of hydrocarbons, the chief components of petroleum. This includes species such as grouper, hake, and red snapper.Deepwater fish that live from depths of about 650 to 3,300 feet were also affected. They are a food source for other fish, mammals, and birds. So this is a red flag for the occurrence of ongoing oil pollution in the Gulf of Mexico.The Deepwater Horizon oil spill also deposited large quantities of crude at the bottom of the deep sea:It was carried there by marine snow — clumps of plankton, fecal pellets, biominerals, and soil particles washed into the Gulf from land… In the Gulf, they attached to oil droplets as they descended.Post-spill studies found that levels of oil compounds on the seafloor in the area affected by the spill were two to three times higher than background levels elsewhere in the Gulf.Researchers project that it will take perhaps 50 to 100 years for the deep ocean ecosystem to recover.Boston-based electric services company Eversource, which serves New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, isn’t letting the coronavirus lockdown get in the way of energy efficiency. Eversource energy specialists are now providing virtual energy assessments by phone or video service.Eversource Energy senior vice president and chief customer officer Penni Conner said:One of the highlights we’re offering customers is that we will pay 100% of the cost of insulation, which will help customers save money during these financially difficult times.Customers who participate in the virtual Home Energy Assessment will also receive a custom report outlining energy-saving recommendations. This virtual service allows us to continue to serve them and provide them with ways to save.Customers will also receive a delivery of recommended energy-saving products such as LED light bulbs, advanced power strips, and thermostats.This is a great initiative to reduce emissions and save people money, demonstrating that the two go hand in hand.",solar
2020/04/13,"American coal generation declined 36% in March compared to the year before. With oil prices at new low levels, coal is now the most expensive fossil fuel on the planet. Reuters reports that nearly half of global coal plants will run at a loss this year. That’s all sad news for coal country, but it means that electric cars continue to get cleaner.The assertion that EVs produce more pollution than average gas and diesel cars has been debunked many times. The greater efficiency of an electric powertrain makes an EV greener even in parts of the US where a relatively higher percentage of coal is used to generate electricity.The arguments were made in 2008 when coal was used to generate 49% of the electricity in the US. By 2018, it had dropped to 28%.The new data was compiled and published today by Michael Sivak, managing director of Sivak Applied Research and the former director of Sustainable Worldwide Transportation at the University of Michigan.Writing for Green Car Congress, Sivak provides these stats:Sivak admits, of course, that battery-electric vehicles are “only as clean as the energy source used to generate the electricity that powers them.”But he points to work from the Union of Concerned Scientists, which indicates that the average EV produces global warming pollution equal to a gasoline vehicle that gets 88 miles per gallon fuel economy.UCS earlier this year crunched similar data. It concluded:Based on where EVs have been sold, driving the average EV produces global warming pollution equal to a gasoline vehicle that gets 88 miles per gallon (mpg) fuel economy.That’s significantly better than the most efficient gasoline car (58 mpg) and far cleaner than the average new gasoline car (31 mpg) or truck (21 mpg) sold in the US.And our estimate for EV emissions is almost 10 percent lower than our previous estimate two years ago. Now 94 percent of people in the US live where driving an EV produces less emissions than using a 50 mpg gasoline car.Using data from 2018, UCS produced this map to show the MPG equivalent of electric cars in different parts of the country:The Atlantic reported in January that coal consumption “entered a free fall in 2019.” About 15% of America’s coal capacity was retired between 2017 and 2019.The changing economics for energy during the pandemic is only getting worse for coal. In March, coal generation declined by more than a third compared to last year.So one more time: Electric vehicles are cleaner and greener than any other type of car on the road – and they will only get cleaner over time.",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/04/13,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.In the first quarter of 2020, green energy became the UK’s main power source for the first time ever, according to new analysis by European energy insight company EnAppSys.According to Current News:During this period 44.6% of total generation was produced by renewables, with the rest generated by gas-fired plants (29.1%), nuclear plants (15.3%), power imports (7.3%), and coal plants (3.7%).Green energy generated 35.4TWh between January and March. In first-quarter 2019, they produced 27.2TWh.Consistently high winds played a major part in renewable power generation:Storm Ciara, for example, set two wind generation records, with wind turbines generating 56% of the country’s electricity at 2 a.m. on Saturday February 8, the most at any one time, and accounting for 44.26% of power produced across the whole day.G-20 energy ministers met on Friday and agreed to “commit to doing whatever it takes, both individually and collectively” to try to save the energy sector. And on Sunday, oil-producing nations agreed to the largest production cut ever in order to stabilize oil prices.Electrek reported Friday morning:Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut oil production by 5 million barrels per day each, for a total of 10 million barrels, following a meeting of OPEC Plus yesterday. The cuts will be gradually phased out to April 2022.On Sunday, the New York Times reports, those figures ended up being slightly smaller than originally agreed:The plan by OPEC, Russia, and other allied producers… will slash 9.7 million barrels a day in May and June, or close to 10% of the world’s output.Analysts expect oil prices, which soared above $100 a barrel only six years ago, to remain below $40 for the foreseeable future. The American oil benchmark price was just over $23 a barrel on Sunday night.Non-OPEC countries like Brazil and Norway have already been cutting production. It’s unclear whether the US made a formal commitment to reduce oil production, but it has agreed to help Mexico with oil reductions. But according to the Financial Times:Dan Brouillette, US energy secretary, told the conference he estimated US oil production would be reduced by nearly 2 million b/d this year, or at least 10% of the country’s output.The cuts are huge, but the drop in demand is bigger, so whether the reduction will keep the industry from collapsing remains to be seen. US oil companies have been laying off thousands of workers and ceasing production.The vehicles are being used in a large number of districts in India, where they procure produce directly from the growers and deliver straight to consumers.The solar panels on the vehicle’s roof helps to control the temperatures within, in order to keep the fruits and vegetables fresh, and the solar energy can also be used for other purposes.G Senthil Kumaran, principal scientist at the IIHR’s Post Harvest Technology and Agricultural Engineering (PHTAE) division, said:The evaporating cooling technology in the vehicle keeps produces fresh, hygienic, and dust-free.(Writer’s note: If I had a fresh produce e-van come to my house so I could buy fruits and vegetables that were sourced from the growers themselves, I’d be ecstatic.)Photo: Paul Ellis/AFP",solar

That will make it easier for fossil-fuel projects to proceed.As we wrote:Up until now, NEPA has required, with the backing of federal courts, that the federal government considers a project’s carbon footprint when it comes to leasing public lands for fossil-fuel projects.Now Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) has flagged up a transparency violation around NEPA in a letter on Thursday to Mary Neumayr, the chairwoman of the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), according to the Hill. Carper wrote:It has come to my attention that, in addition to receiving public comments on this rule through www.regulations.gov, the White House accommodated industry requests for the use of an email address, NEPA-Update@ceq.eop.gov, to receive comments on the proposed regulations.This practice appears to violate Section 206(d) of the E-Government Act of 2002, which requires agencies to make dockets and comments submitted on proposed rules available online.In doing so, the White House created a two track system to receive and process comments — one track for those working closely with the White House and another for the rest of the publicCEQ spokesman Dan Schneider said to the Hill:CEQ did not create any additional email address on its own or at the request of any entity or for any group to submit comments on the proposed rule.But Electrek tested the above email address today, and it most certainly is real and active; we received the below automatic response (try it yourself):Hello, thank you for your email.  Please note that the comment period for CEQ’s proposed rule titled ‘Update to the Regulations Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act’ has closed. CEQ will consider comments received through this email address during the comment period, which ended on March 10, 2020, and include them in the docket on Regulations.gov.Why would the government need a separate email address if the ability to comment is on the regulation’s website? And why would Schneider lie about it?In the words of the Union of Concerned Scientists:Hydrokinetic technologies produce renewable electricity by harnessing the kinetic energy of a body of water, the energy that results from its motion. Since water is 832 times denser than air, our tides, waves, ocean currents, and free-flowing rivers represent an untapped, powerful, highly concentrated and clean energy resource.Now, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has announced $38 million for hydrokinetic turbine technology development.The program, called Submarine Hydrokinetic And Riverine Kilo-megawatt Systems (SHARKS), seeks to design economically attractive hydrokinetic turbines for tidal and riverine currents.Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes said:America’s tidal and riverine currents remain a valuable resource for the generation of clean and reliable electricity. Developing efficient, economically attractive hydrokinetic turbine technologies will enable the United States to utilize those resources and continue to diversify our energy generation infrastructure and increase grid resiliency.Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut oil production by 5 million barrels per day each, for a total of 10 million barrels, following a meeting of OPEC Plus yesterday. The cuts will be gradually phased out to April 2022.The US and Canada will be asked to also cut production by a further 5 million barrels per day each at the G-20 energy ministers meeting today.But it probably won’t make much of a difference. Reuters ran an exclusive story yesterday that stated:Major US lenders are preparing to become operators of oil and gas fields across the country for the first time in a generation to avoid losses on loans to energy companies that may go bankrupt.The industry is estimated to owe more than $200 billion to lenders through loans backed by oil and gas reserves.

Compare to 2018 below and you can see:If you look at the right sides of the graphs above and below, 100% of the overall usage decline was in “Rejected energy” (more on that below), which means we are getting more efficient with our energy. But we still have a long way to go.2018The biggest shock to most people is that over two-thirds of energy produced in the US is “rejected.” What does that mean? A good primer:Rejected energy is part of the energy of a fuel — such as gas or petrol — that could be used for a purposeful activity, like making electricity or transport. However, because of the technologies that we currently use to consume fuels, a lot of it gets tossed out by turning it into heat in the environment, which is totally useless [or worse]. For a coal-fired power station, for instance, about two-thirds of the energy released when the coal is burnt is discarded as heat in the environment. This reject energy sometimes appears as clouds of vapor coming off a power station’s cooling towers, such as the well-known ones at Didcot in England.Coal, for instance, produces a lot more unused heat byproduct compared to natural gas. By moving a significant amount of energy production off of coal and onto other energy sources, the US saved a quadrillion BTUs of energy but got the same energy services out of it.Incidentally, 2018’s 101.2 quads was the highest-ever energy consumption for the US. The prior record, set all the way back in 2007, was 101 quads.Small internal combustion engines are one of the most wasteful forms of energy production, and they make up almost all of the transportation in the US. That is reflected in the overwhelming amount of rejected energy coming out of transportation. Almost all energy going into transportation currently is in the form of petroleum, and yet those internal combustion cars and jet planes are mostly producing heat and very little relative energy, to the tune of 1 unit of energy per 4-5 units put in. That’s 20-25% efficiency. Compare that to an EV, which is over 90% efficient.Which brings me to my next observation.The whole US transportation industry uses only 5.93 quads of energy to propel vehicles around. While it takes 28.3 quads of mostly petroleum to do so today, replacing internal combustion or jet engines with their much more efficient electric alternatives means you’d only need about 6 quads of electricity to produce the same movement. That can currently be made by wind, solar, or hydro (if they weren’t doing other things).To put it another way: to get rid of all of the petroleum energy used to run transportation in the US, you wouldn’t even have to double the amount of wind, solar and hydro.The biggest piece of rejected energy (24.2 quads) comes from electricity generation. A lot of that is excess heat from coal and to a lesser extent gas-powered turbines. As utility-scale batteries from Tesla and others start to come online, fewer less efficient coal and gas peaker plants will be necessary. We already saw a 1.1 quad drop from 25.3 quads a year ago, while the service energy only dropped from 12.9 to 12.7 quads.Other efficiencies like creating energy closer to its use point (solar/wind) and higher voltage or DC transmission lines will reduce resistance in wires. Better turbines and inverters and smarter grid usage will shave off heat losses as well.As far as renewables are concerned, wind is about 2.5x solar currently and growing slightly faster. What’s great about renewables is that they are close to 100% efficient. So for every BTU gained, more than 1 BTU of fossil fuel is offset.“Solar and wind continue to show year-on-year growth, which is an impressive change for the energy system,” said AJ Simon, associate program leader for Water Security and Technologies at LLNL. “Other energy resources, such as hydropower, nuclear energy and geothermal have trended flat over the past decade, despite visible annual fluctuations.” If there is one decisive loser in this graphic, it is coal, with a decrease of 14% in just one year. It is the least efficient at the power generating point and also the worst for carbon production per watt. Coal was down 5% last year and it looks to be down again next year as more and more coal plants are replaced by gas — or even better, solar and wind.Biomass, or basically burning wood and other plant material, has fallen out of favor recently economically because it produces more emissions and is more expensive than a comparable natural gas plant. However, proponents will say that a fallen tree will release its CO2 regardless if whether is on the ground decomposing or in a furnace. So why not make some energy?In small amounts (for instance using fallen trees to heat homes), biomass makes a lot of sense. However, the scale at which it is being used in Europe from trees in the southeastern US is unsustainable. Here’s a short flick on the subject:https://vimeo.com/286550378The US is moving in the right direction, but way too slowly, and with a hostile political administration slowing us down. Coal should be outlawed/kept in the ground and replaced by biomass in the short term.Solar and wind power should be doubling year over year as we race against time to become carbon neutral. We should be looking at more tidal and hydro plants around the US and putting a moratorium on petroleum-fueled cars and industry.This flowchart shows us what we need to do. Climate scientists show us when we need to do it (yesterday). The time to act is now.",solar

It’s a world first. (Writer’s note: Yes, I’m trying to get my head around the concept of renewables to power fossil fuels, too, in case you think it’s just you.)Hywind Tampen will feature 11 8MW wind turbines and will be situated around 140km (87 miles) from shore, between the two fossil-fuel platforms. The wind farm will generate 88MW of energy that will meet about 35% of the annual power demand of the oil and gas platforms.Equinor Norway development and production executive vice-president Arne Sigve Nylund said [via Power Technology]:Hywind Tampen is a pioneering project and a central contribution to reducing emissions from Gullfaks and Snorre, and I am pleased that both ESA and Norwegian authorities have approved the project.A Harvard University study at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which was updated on April 5, has confirmed that there is a direct correlation between long-term exposure to air pollution and a higher coronavirus death rate.This study is the first to confirm a statistical link between coronavirus deaths and air pollution — something public health officials and environmentalists already surmised.The study’s background states that the majority of pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death for coronavirus are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. They investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter, which is caused by fossil fuels and vehicle emissions, increases the risk of COVID-19 deaths in the US.The researchers collected data for about 3,000 US counties (98% of the population) for 17 years, up to April 4, 2020.An increase of one microgram of fine particulates per cubic meter is associated with a 15% increase in the coronavirus death rate. Breathing in fine particulates damages the lungs over time, making it harder for the body to fight respiratory infections.The study concluded:A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 [fine particulate matter] leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rate, with the magnitude of increase 20 times that observed for PM2.5 [fine particulate matter] and all-cause mortality. The study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.Harvard study researcher Xiao Wu said [via the Guardian]:We should consider additional measures to protect ourselves from pollution exposure to reduce the COVID-19 death toll.The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) reports that more than 80% of US voters favor offshore wind energy, with widespread support coming from both Republicans and Democrats and every demographic group across the country, according to a national survey conducted by Public Opinion Strategies from March 16 to 19, 2020.85% of all voters think wind energy is a clean, renewable, and affordable power source of the future, including 80% of Republicans. GOP voters support offshore wind energy for slightly different reasons than Democrats: They cite well-paying, stable jobs and improved economic revitalization for port communities/coastal states.Further, voters from Gen Z to Millennials to Gen X and Boomers all express 83% to 88% favorability in their support for offshore wind.AWEA CEO Tom Kiernan said:Republicans and Democrats alike see offshore wind as playing a key role in the nation’s future energy portfolio, providing tremendous economic and environmental benefits and helping stabilize the cost of electricity.Photo: Equinor illustration of Hywind",solar

They are afraid of being particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus due to living in a high-pollution area — and this was before the Harvard study was released.Penny Aucoin, her husband Carl Dee George, and their son and daughter have suffered from nosebleeds, asthma, facial blisters, and headaches.On January 21, their house was showered with oil field wastewater when a pipe burst. Aucoin describes that experience, and their living situation in general, on March 7 at a community meeting of around 100 people in the video below:Sharon Wilson of Earthworks emailed DeSmog about the family’s dilemma over socially isolating next to a major polluter during the pandemic:For some people living next to oil and gas, staying at home means trading one health crisis for another. Protecting against COVID shouldn’t mean breathing more carcinogens like benzene, but it does.We at Electrek feel like we’re saying this on a near daily basis now. And we can’t hammer it home enough, since Big Oil is lobbying the government hard for help, and the EPA is deregulating at a blinding pace.The coronavirus attacks lungs, often causing pneumonia, and it severely impedes the ability of those with more severe cases to breathe. It also kills. Air pollution also harms lungs.So therefore, coronavirus + air pollution = bad for your lungs and health. Thank you, Harvard, for officially confirming what we had already surmised with actual hard data.We’re going to repeat the Harvard researchers’ words one more time, in bold:The study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.Environmental Protection Agency: Reinstate preventative rules NOW.

The country’s PV generation jumped 29.1% in March 2020 over the same month in 2019, according to Spanish grid operator REE.Further, on March 29 at 2:29 p.m., Spain’s solar covered 25.6% of all GWh produced across the country — a new milestone.Spain added more than 4GW of solar over the last year. That’s more megawatts of solar than anywhere else in Europe, and it now has a total of 9GW, so it’s not surprising that the country saw a big jump year-on-year.In spite of supply chain bottlenecks and factory and construction shutdowns, REE said [via PV-Tech]:Despite the fact that sunlight hours are fewer in this month than during the summer months, solar is already flexing muscles and anticipating something — that this will be a good summer.On February 29, Electrek reported that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had eliminated leak prevention and repair requirements for hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the heat-trapping pollutants used in commercial and industrial refrigeration.The rule, set under the Obama administration, extended leak prevention requirements to HFCs that were already in place for ozone-depleting refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).HFCs’ impact on global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide per unit of mass.Yesterday, a federal court struck down the EPA’s rollback of the greenhouse-gas-leak prevention rule. The court said that the Trump administration did not follow proper procedure.The Hill reports that Judge Sri Srinivasan wrote:EPA had several options by which it could have attempted to address the perceived difficulties associated with implementing our decision.But the one option EPA could not permissibly pursue was the one it chose: promulgating a legislative rule without abiding by notice-and-comment requirements and without invoking any exception to those obligations.Natural Resources Defense Council staff attorney Pete DeMarco said:This is an important victory for our climate.

The 120-wind turbine project spreads across Garza and Lynn counties and is capable of powering 120,000 US households.Ørsted executive vice-president and onshore business CEO Declan Flanagan said:The safe completion of Sage Draw amid the escalating COVID-19 crisis is a testament to the resilience and adaptiveness of the Orsted team and key project partners at Blattner Energy and GE Renewable Energy, as well as financial partners GE Energy Financial Services and BHE Renewables. This underscores the significant role renewable energy can play in continuing to build our economy as we manage through and beyond the current crisis.Ørsted’s onshore operational installed capacity has increased to 1.3GW. The company intends to reach 5GW installed onshore capacity by 2025. In 2013, it announced it would stop developing onshore wind to concentrate on offshore wind, but in 2018, it returned to onshore wind development with the acquisition of Lincoln Clean Energy.Photo: Biel Morro/Unsplash; bottom photo: Ørsted",solar

2020/04/07,"As Electrek reported on March 27, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a suspension of the enforcement of environmental rules, saying it “will generally not seek stipulated or other penalties for noncompliance with such obligations” during the coronavirus outbreak. There is no end date for this policy.The coronavirus attacks lungs, often causing pneumonia, and severely impedes the ability of those with more severe cases to breathe. Air pollution also harms lungs. So now, the senators from Massachusetts want explanations for the EPA’s decision.On Friday, April 3, Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ed Markey (D-MA) sent a letter to EPA head Andrew Wheeler, demanding that the agency answer six questions by April 17. In a nutshell, the six questions consist of wanting to know what the rationale is behind the EPA’s decision; who authorized it; how records will be maintained; whether meetings held with fossil-fuel lobbyists, and if so, when and with who; and finally, whether any analyses were conducted.The oil and gas industry, which is in turmoil due to oversupply, plunging prices, and a battle between Russia and Saudi Arabia over production, had been lobbying the EPA for weeks for a relaxation of the rules.Warren told BuzzFeed News:This pandemic isn’t an excuse for polluters to ignore the law and for EPA to let them get away with it.It’s absurd that Donald Trump and former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler are using this public health and economic crisis as a cover to roll back environmental laws. The government should be focused on protecting public health now, not making it worse.E&E News reported that the EPA has refused to disclose how many companies sought waivers of noncompliance due to the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, as the Huffington Post reported in late March, there are many lawmakers who are perfectly happy to throw a lifeline to fossil fuels:Sixty-one House lawmakers — 60 Republicans and one Democrat — have signed on to at least one of three letters to date calling for the Trump administration to cut royalties on fossil fuel extraction.Incidentally, more than 70 members of Congress have pocketed a total of $35.7 million in contributions from the fossil fuel industry over their careers. (The Huffington Post features a list of who has taken how much. Representative Kevin McCarthy [R-CA] is the big House winner, with $1,955,325.)And 12 senators (all Republicans) also sent a letter on March 30 to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt pleading the same royalties-cut case for the fossil fuel industry. These dozen lawmakers have reaped more than $14 million over the course of their careers from Big Oil. (Senator John Cornyn [R-TX] is the big winner in this dozen, with a whopping $4,067,906 in contributions from the oil and gas industry.)We were wondering when someone on Capitol Hill was finally going to challenge the EPA, seeing how this directly correlates to the pandemic. The environmental groups were disgusted. And frankly, so are we at Electrek. Who isn’t trying to protect their lungs across the globe? Isn’t the US government agency, originally designed to protect the environment, supposed to help Americans do that?Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, told us via email that the EPA’s decision was an open license to pollute. “The administration should be giving its all toward making our country healthier right now. Instead, it is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health.”We can’t wait to hear the answers the EPA provides, although we can’t think of a single answer that would justify this insane decision that allows unregulated air pollution while the whole country struggles to find enough ventilators to help people breathe.(And by the way, there really needs to be a cap on contributions to legislators. They’re basically being bought by special-interest groups.)You know things have truly gotten weird when the EPA allows pollution, and the CEO of BP calls for the need to continue to tackle climate change in a blog on LinkedIn.Photo: Boston Globe",solar

Geographically, more than half — 54% — of that new capacity occurred in Asia. That continent increased its renewable capacity by 95.5GW to reach 1.12TW, of 44% of the global total.IRENA continues the global breakdown:Capacity in Europe and North America expanded by 35GW (+6.6%) and 22GW (+6.0%), respectively. Oceania and the Middle East were the fastest growing regions (+18.4% and +12.6%, respectively), although their share of global capacity is small. Africa has a similar amount of renewable capacity, but this only increased by 2GW (+4.3%). Compared to 2018, capacity growth in Asia and Africa was somewhat lower than in 2019, but higher in Europe and North America.Wind expanded by nearly 60GW, which was higher than 2018. China and the US continued to dominate, with increases of 26GW and 9GW, respectively.Asia continued to dominate global solar capacity expansion with a 56GW increase. China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam had the most new capacity in 2019.Overall, hydropower made up the largest share of the global total of 2,537GW, with a capacity of 1,190GW, or 47%, thus bringing it to 44% of the global total. However, growth in hydro was unusually low in 2019 due to some large projects missing projected completion dates.Francesco La Camera, director general of IRENA said [via the Guardian]:In responding to today’s crisis, governments may be tempted to focus on short-term solutions.

This is in response to plunging prices, overproduction, bankruptcies, and layoffs.Greg Garland, CEO of refining company Phillips 66 and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, Occidental Petroleum Corp. CEO Vicki Hollub, Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren, Chevron Corp. CEO Mike Wirth, and Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Darren Woods are expected to attend.The apparent goal of the oil executives is to brief Trump of the dire situation in the oil industry and encourage him to push Saudi Arabia to back off increased oil production.As Electrek reported on March 9, the plunging oil prices occurred because:Saudi Arabia wanted OPEC and Russia to make oil production cuts to support oil prices in light of the coronavirus outbreak, which has hurt the global economy. But Russia objected, saying everyone can produce whatever they want, so Saudi Arabia jacked up oil production to 2 million barrels per day and discounted its oil prices. Analysts say Saudi Arabia is punishing Russia for abandoning the two countries’ three-year supply pact. The oil market is already saturated.Saudi Arabia plans to boost its crude output above 10 million barrels per day in April when the pact expires.Further, the US oil and gas industry has nearly $90 billion of rated debt due in the next four years, according to Moody’s.Trump said he knows how to solve the Saudi Arabia/Russia problem, but didn’t elaborate on how he’d do that.E&E News reports:Several industry sources said the Department of Energy is expected to finalize a plan that would lease portions of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the private sector, taking crude off the market. DOE was seeking final approval for the move, which could account for 75 million barrels of oil.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC yesterday that the administration would continue to ask Congress for approval to buy oil from US producers to fill up the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve].The latter request was denied in the third stimulus package.Whiting Petroleum Corp., a Denver-based independent oil producer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday. They won’t be the last.Oil giant Shell, energy network operator Gasunie, and Groningen Seaports are building NortH2, the world’s largest offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea to produce green hydrogen. And that project should be fine, despite the coronavirus pandemic, due to its early development stage.Oil and gas firms could delay other energy transition projects during the oil crisis, but this one is going ahead.Shell’s spokesman in the Netherlands, Marc Potma, told Recharge [via Upstream]:Since NortH2 is still in a feasibility study-phase for the remainder of this year, impact [from Covid-19] is limited to none.Europe’s biggest green hydrogen project will be powered by a 3-4GW offshore wind farm in the North Sea by 2030. It will be expanded by up to 10GW by 2040.As Electrek reported yesterday, green energy made up 52% of Germany’s power consumption during the first quarter of 2020.And that’s a good thing, but there’s a challenge. Germany is generating record amounts of clean energy in the north, but its grid is too weak to transport all the power to load centers in the south, reports Green Tech Media.The German government is working to strengthen the grid, but there is often local community resistance, so it takes longer to bury the lines underground. The export of German renewable energy is also causing hiccups for the grids of neighbors such as Denmark and the Netherlands.It’s a good example of why ensuring grids can handle the movement toward green energy is just as important as switching to green energy itself.",solar
2020/04/02,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.A consortium headed by Spanish company Iberdrola announced this week that it is developing a large floating offshore wind turbine in the North Sea. The consortium is made up of companies from Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, and Spain.The turbine will be more than 10MW, and the project will be tested at the Marine Energy Test Centre in Norway. According to CNBC, “The average size of offshore turbines installed in 2019 was 7.8MW, according to trade body WindEurope.”Construction of the project’s floating platform is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2021, with installation starting in the first quarter of 2022.Hywind Scotland (pictured) was the world’s first floating wind farm, and the 30MW farm went live in 2017. As Electrek reported in October 2017:Floating wind is being developed because 80% of the Europe’s wind resources are located in water too deep for traditional fixed bottom wind turbines to reach. Additionally, just west of Europe, in the North Atlantic, there is enough wind to power the entire world.Here’s a cool video that shows us how Hywind came together, giving us a glimpse of the newest project to come:The Global Wind Energy Council says it is too soon to predict the extent of how the coronavirus will impact the forecast of continued growth in the wind industry.It’s increasingly evident, during the coronavirus pandemic, that not only is COVID-19 and the economy tightly wound together, but green energy and the environment are also in the mix.According to a new report from banking giant HSBC, “Shares of companies focused on climate change or ESG issues — environmental, social, and governance — outperformed as the virus spread.”HSBC says that companies with good governance and exposure to long-term growth markets such as green technology will better be able to endure short-term hardships such as the coronavirus.Ashim Paun, co-head of ESG research at HSBC, wrote:The climate-focused stocks outperformed others by 7.6% from December and by 3% since February. The ESG shares beat others by about 7% for both periods.HSBC’s Climate Solutions Database has four divisions: Environment & Land Use Management, Low Carbon & Energy Production, Energy Efficiency & Energy Management, and Climate Finance. All beat the markets over both periods — Low Carbon by more than 11% since 20 December.Business Green points out that HSBC’s latest analysis is one of many other analyses that “consistently shown how firms with strong ESG ratings tend to outperform their peers.”Green energy made up 52% of Germany’s power consumption during the first quarter of 2020, compared to 44.4% in the same quarter in 2019. The preliminary data was supplied by solar and hydrogen research centre Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) and the German federation of energy and water industries (BDEW).According to Recharge, this was due to a mixture of very strong winds due to February storms, above-average sunshine in March, and a lower power demand — a fall of 1% compared to the same time last year — due to the coronavirus. Industrial production declined in the last week of March due to the pandemic.Renewables have priority over fossil fuels in the German grid, and some fossil-fuel power plants were closed in late 2019.",solar

Each winner will receive between $75,000-$150,000. According to the Innovation Incubator:The award program strengthens sustainable technology initiatives and fosters a creative and collaborative network of cross-industry stakeholders in order to address barriers that startups face on the path to commercialization.The annual submissions were evaluated on their potential for STEM job creation, impact on cleantech and agtech sectors, ability to leverage the innovation incubator network, and funding sustainability.Here are the eight winners:The government of Alberta, Canada, announced yesterday that it would support TC Energy’s Keystone XL oil pipeline with a direct investment of more than USD $1 billion and a further USD $4.2 billion loan guarantee during the coronavirus crisis.Yet, in contrast (which, frankly, doesn’t reflect well on Alberta’s priorities), according to the CBC:Thousands of educational assistants and support staff are expected to be laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic after the Alberta government announced it will cut some K-12 education funding as students transition to at-home learning.Hannah McKinnon, energy transitions & futures director at Oil Change International, said:Never has there been a more critical moment to support health, workers, and communities. Instead, the Alberta government is diverting limited and desperately needed public money to Big Oil in the latest misplaced attempt to revive the Keystone XL pipeline and prop up a sector that has no role in a more resilient, safer climate future.Collin Rees, senior US campaigner for Oil Change International, said:This huge giveaway of public money to fossil fuel executives coming just days after [Alberta premier] Jason Kenney’s government laid off more than 20,000 educational workers across Alberta says more about where his priorities lie than we ever could. The Indigenous communities, farmers, and ranchers along the Keystone XL route will continue to fiercely resist, and this pipeline will never be built.Equinor is quitting the oil lobbying group Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).The Norwegian oil and gas giant officially recognizes that climate change is real, and publicly states that it intends to align with the Paris Agreement.

Despite the coronavirus, industry experts believe the target remains within reach, the Scotsman reports.So not only is Scotland benefitting from clean energy, but clean energy is set to help benefit Scotland during the COVID-19 crisis. Wind farm developers pay £20 million annually into a community development fund. And a growing number of developers are redirecting that money to help support communities during the coronavirus crisis. The Scottish Borders and Western Isles schemes are already participating, and others are expected to follow. This includes emergency grants to struggling families.Jamie Adam, development manager for Community Energy Scotland, said:We have now been contacted by a new volunteer action group who want to divert some of the money to provide emergency grants to local families who might be experiencing hardship or redundancy.This is a great opportunity for renewable energy projects to provide direct action on a pressing local issue, and we’d love to see more wind farm owners following suit.While the country is focused on the coronavirus crisis, US states are quietly redefining fossil-fuel infrastructure as critical in order to prevent protests such as the ones that took place around the Dakota Access pipeline. The idea is to make civil disobedience more difficult.On March 16, Governor Andy Beshear (D-KY) signed House Bill 44, which designated “natural gas or petroleum pipelines” as “key infrastructure assets” in Kentucky. The bill states that any “tampering with, impeding, or inhibiting operations of a key infrastructure asset in the offense of criminal mischief in the first degree.”On March 18, Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) signed Senate Bill 151 in South Dakota that expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to oil, gas, or utility equipment, and declared causing “substantial interruption or impairment” of that equipment as a felony. On March 23, Noem signed a second bill that defines a felony “riot” as “intentional use of force or violence by three or more persons” that causes “any damage to property,” according to the Huffington Post.On March 25, Governor Jim Justice (R-WV) signed West Virginia House Bill 4615 that also declares fossil fuel infrastructure as critical. That bill focuses heavily on “trespassing” as a misdemeanor with fines, and also makes provisions for damage as a felony.Similar legislation is active in Illinois, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and was passed in Alabama on March 12.Why is this legislation all going through right now?

2020/03/30,"Atmospheric pollution may be “giving a helping hand” to the coronavirus, according to a new paper by Italian researchers from the University of Bologna.The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, according to the Economist, but that’s not unusual right now when it comes to coronavirus research, due to the sheer speed at which the virus is spreading and the urgent search for solutions.The research team looked at why the virus spread a lot faster in northern Italy’s Po Valley than in other parts of the country. Their hypothesis is that it’s due to pollution, or particulate matter, which is far more prevalent in that geographical area.The Economist continues:In the paper, the researchers cite previous work from other places which suggests that influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and measles viruses can all spread by hitching lifts on such particles. And they make a good case that, allowing for a 14-day delay caused by SARS-COV-2’s incubation period, the daily rates of new infections in the Po valley correlate closely with the level of particulate pollution.Air pollution already aggravates respiratory problems like asthma. And respiratory problems make people more susceptible to coronavirus, since it attacks the lungs. (That’s why the EPA environmental law enforcement rollback is so harmful.)According to the New York Times, Meredith McCormack, spokesperson for the American Lung Association and associate professor of pulmonary and critical care at Johns Hopkins University, said:Increased pollution increases susceptibility to infection. All things being equal, a person exposed to air pollution would likely have a worse outcome if they were exposed to coronavirus.So the best way to protect your lungs is to stay away from outdoor polluted areas as much as possible, and also do the following to keep your indoor air clean:",solar

NASA and the European Space Agency documents drops in pollution of between 40% to 70%.But once the lockdown lifts, we might not just return to our usual pollution levels; it might actually get worse. Francois Gemenne, director of The Hugo Observatory, said [via Forbes]:I think that in the long run this crisis will be a disaster for the climate. Of course there are short-term effects on the environment: a substantial drop in air pollution, a fall in greenhouse gas emissions, etc. But in the long term, these temporary effects will probably be insignificant.So what would cause the backlash? Here are a couple of reasons:First, in the US, the EPA’s terrible decision to suspend environmental law enforcement indefinitely. Second, there’s a rebound effect as countries try to make up for lost time economically by doubling down on manufacturing. Forbes gives an example from China:Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre [for Research on Energy and Clean Air] said, ‘The obvious point to make here is that China’s ‘airpocalypse’ — the horrendous smog of the winter 2012-13 — was a direct outcome of the smokestack stimulus started in 2008.’Further, all of the European car industry‘s lobby groups wrote to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen asking for a relaxation of cars’ emission targets last week.However, there is hope: There may be some changes in the way that the general population approaches travel and polluting.

It has successfully developed more than 3,500MW of projects that are currently in financing, construction, or operation. It currently develops wind and solar projects in Texas, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, and Virginia. And Sunfinity Renewable Energy is a provider of residential, commercial, and utility solar energy.John Billingsley is the chairman and CEO of both of those companies, and he is strongly urging lawmakers to ensure green energy is included in the next phase of stimulus spending. (Green energy was not in this week’s Senate’s stimulus bill, and the entire House of Representatives is currently flying to Washington, DC, because one representative, Thomas Massie (R-KY), said he won’t vote for the bill on the phone. I’m guessing he’s not going to win Capitol Hill’s popularity contest today.)Here’s what Billingsley had to say in an email about what the renewable sector needs going forward:Together, wind and solar energy represent hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs, billions of dollars in spending and tax revenues, and just as importantly, clean, renewable power for a better world.President Trump tweeted about ‘the ridiculous Green New Deal’ and Republicans accused Democrat lawmakers of holding up the overall package with green initiatives, but this isn’t a political issue, it’s economics that are just as valid as airlines, hospitality, and many other important American industries.Congress can support the clean energy industry simply by extending the safe harbor provisions, essentially freezing tax credits in place, and eliminate uncertainty and enable projects to move forward. Also, allowing developers to receive direct pay equal to the value of the credits helps ensure the availability of tax equity.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a suspension of the enforcement of environmental rules on Thursday, saying it “will generally not seek stipulated or other penalties for noncompliance with such obligations” during the coronavirus outbreak.The EPA has not set an end date for this new policy, which can be read here.The oil and gas industry has been lobbying the EPA for weeks for a relaxation of the rules, citing staffing issues, according to the Associated Press.Andrew Wheeler, head of the EPA, said:EPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements.This temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment.Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an emailed statement:This is an open license to pollute. Plain and simple. The administration should be giving its all toward making our country healthier right now. Instead it is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health.We can all appreciate the need for additional caution and flexibility in a time of crisis, but this brazen directive is an abdication of the EPA’s responsibility to protect our health.Outrageous.

Mark Pocan (@repmarkpocan) March 26, 2020A federal judge has ordered the US Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a full environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline, three years after it opened.US District Judge James Boasberg requested that both the US Army Corps of Engineers and environmental groups and Native American tribes submit briefings in April for and against the pipeline.The pipeline, which runs from North Dakota to Illinois, is 1,000 miles long. The controversial area is a small portion under the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe’s reservation lies downstream from that area, and they are concerned that a leak could contaminate their drinking water and lands.According to NPR, Judge Boasberg stated:The many commenters in this case pointed to serious gaps in crucial parts of the Corps’ analysis — to name a few, that the pipeline’s leak-detection system was unlikely to work, that it was not designed to catch slow spills, that the operator’s serious history of incidents had not been taken into account, that that the worst-case scenario used by the Corps was potentially only a fraction of what a realistic figure would be — and the Corps was not able to fill any of [the gaps in the analysis].",solar

But Congress must ensure that federal assistance to companies does not make the climate crisis worse for our children by increasing pollution.Despite rising public awareness and the warning of scientists, our government has failed to take strong action on climate change. It is a repeat of the mistakes that led to the worsening coronavirus pandemic. It’s time our leaders followed facts, listened to scientists, and took action on the dangers that confront our economy and society. In the coming weeks, as Congress continues to respond to the current health crisis, it must do so in a way that also protects the next generation from the unfolding climate crisis.Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said:We must continue to support one another during this crisis and work to ensure that when we come out on the other side, we have a more sustainable and equitable economy, a stronger democracy, and a cleaner energy future.

The world’s wind power grew by 19% in 2019 compared with the previous year, resulting in the second-best year in wind power history. It grew 60.4 gigawatts, compared with 2018.Total capacity for wind energy globally is now over 651GW, an increase of 10% compared to 2018.Offshore wind led the way by installing a record 6.1GW, making up 10% of new wind farm installations. China leads in new offshore wind capacity with 2.3GW installed in 2019. The UK remains in the top spot for cumulative offshore wind capacity with 9.7GW, which is nearly one-third of the 29.1GW of total global offshore capacity.China and the US remain the world’s largest onshore wind markets, together accounting for more than 60% of new capacity in 2019. Europe saw a 30% year-on-year growth for its onshore wind market.GWEC’s 2020 forecast predicted that wind power would grow, but this will undoubtedly be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, so GWEC will revise its 2020-2024 forecast and publish an updated market outlook in second-quarter 2020.Ben Backwell, CEO at GWEC said:If we are to have any chance at reaching our Paris Agreement objectives and remaining on a 1.5°C pathway, we need to be installing at least 100GW of wind energy annually over the next decade, and this needs to rise to 200 GW annually post-2030 and beyond.The US Senate has finalized the $2 trillion stimulus package.

The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy published a list of ways to increase energy efficiency as huge numbers of us are on lockdown. It’s good for the environment, and for your wallet. I’ve paraphrased a couple and added tips of my own.Adjust your thermostat: If it’s cold, lower your heat and put on a sweater. If it’s hot, lower your air conditioning and dress in cooler clothes. And open the windows to let the fresh air in when possible.Cooking: Use the right-sized cookware for burners and energy-efficient appliances, such as your toaster or microwave oven instead of your conventional oven. And keeping your appliances clean also helps them work more efficiently. Use the energy-efficient setting on your dishwasher, and only run it when it’s full. And don’t stand staring into an open fridge — or freezer — when you’re trying to figure out what you want to eat.Laundry: Reduce your water temperature, use eco-settings, and run full loads only. If your weather is good, hang your laundry to dry, rather than use your dryer. (Yes, seriously, Americans. The rest of the world does it; I didn’t have a dryer when I lived in the UK for many years and hung my laundry on racks in the house, or on my clothesline outdoors. No big deal.) If you do use your dryer, keep the filter clean.Television: Don’t leave your TVs running as background noise, and don’t leave them on idle, either. That wastes energy. You’re either watching it, or you’re not.Lighting: If you’ve got LED lights in the house that haven’t yet been installed, put them in now. Turn off lights if you don’t need them; rely more heavily on natural light. You probably don’t need as many lights on as you think, and encourage your kids to shut off lights. (Going to turn off kitchen light right now, ahem.)",solar
2020/03/25,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Grid operators in the US say electricity demand is both shifting and falling due to coronavirus stay-in-place directives and businesses shutting down, according to Utility Dive. So other countries that have implemented stricter lockdowns may give us a glimpse of what might be coming.After Italy went into lockdown and shut businesses, there was a huge decline in electricity demand, according to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Five to seven days after the country locked down, peak demand dropped by 18-21%.S&P Global said in a March 19 report:In the near term, utilities will likely see some reduced sales volumes as major sporting events, concerts, and businesses scale back drastically, compounded even further by social distancing requirements being mandated or recommended by federal and local governments across North America.So what will the utility companies do? Possible rate increases for customers. James Newcomb, managing director of emerging solutions at Rocky Mountain Institute, said:As a consequence of lower energy use and lower capacity demands from the system, utilities will collect less revenue in the form of rates during this downturn of industrial productivity and economic activity.Utilities may ask regulators for increased cost recovery through rate increases in the future as a result.Russell Hardy, the CEO of Dutch energy and commodities company Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader, spoke with Bloomberg Markets: European Open this morning about the impact of the coronavirus on the oil markets. He said:The change is pretty tumultuous. We’ve had a market that was expecting supply cuts and instead we’ve got supply increases and a dramatic change in demand. The market is reacting to that abrupt change, and… demand today we think is down significantly, 15 to 20 million barrels per day at its peak over the next few weeks, which is going to contribute to an approximate 5 million barrel a day decline for the year when we annualize that out. So it’s pretty huge in terms of anything we’ve had to deal with before.When asked where he sees prices going from here, Hardy replied:I think the numbers have adjusted slightly because obviously the news keeps flowing and India is a massive economy and they contributed this week to a lockdown which in turn means a substantial loss of demand in India as well. Where do we think things go from here, well, there’s a lot of oil in the market, and there’s a lot of stocks that we’re going to have to build because it’s not going to get consumed. Right now, product inventories are building in the US, Europe, and India, and refineries are going to have to cut runs. So we think refineries have cut by about 7 billion barrels a day, but they’re going to have to go a little bit farther.We don’t know when this situation is going to improve from a demand perspective. Everyone is taking a slightly pessimistic or conservative view of that; that demand is going to be down for a decent period of time.Please don’t read this as us telling you something you already knew, Electrek readers. A new scientific study is merely confirming what we all already knew.A new study published in Nature Sustainability from the universities of Exeter and Cambridge in the UK, and Nijmegen in the Netherlands, looked at emission reductions of electric cars and heat pumps in 59 world regions. The study concluded that EVs result in lower emissions — and that’s even if the electricity that charges those EVs is powered by a substantial amount of fossil fuels.Driving an electric car is better for the environment than ICE vehicles in 95% of the world, the study finds, except for in countries like Poland that still rely heavily on coal.The University of Exeter reports:In a few years, even inefficient electric cars will be less emission-intensive than most new petrol cars in most countries, as electricity generation is expected to be less carbon-intensive than today.The study projects that in 2050, every second car on the streets could be electric. This would reduce global CO2 emissions by up to 1.5 gigatons per year, which is equivalent to the total current CO2 emissions of Russia.Photo: Matthew Henry/Unsplash",solar
2020/03/24,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The US state of Idaho is due to break ground on a huge wind farm, the Lava Ridge Wind Project, in 2022. The wind farm, which will be located in Magic Valley in south-central Idaho, will span three counties on Bureau of Land Management land.It is expected to cost around $1 billion and produce 1,000MW of power. It will not only be Idaho’s largest; it may also be one of the largest wind farms in the world.Magicvalley.com reports:Magic Valley Energy will own Lava Ridge. The company is an affiliate of LS Power, an energy generation and transmission company with projects throughout the US. This will be LS Power’s first Idaho wind farm.After the wind farm is constructed, it will be run by 20 full-time employees.Magic Valley Energy project manager Luke Papez said:There’s certainly a growing need all throughout the West for greater amounts of clean energy and carbon-free energy. This could really put Idaho at the forefront of helping meet those needs across the West.In January and February of this year, every form of electric power production in China floundered except solar. On the renewables front, the latter was up 12%, whereas wind dropped by 0.2% and hydropower fell by 11.9%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China.Xizhou Zhou, vice president and managing director, global power and renewables, at London-based global information provider IHS Markit, wrote on February 19:Renewable generation volume will unlikely be affected significantly due to their non-dispatchability and preferential status in the Chinese power system; the only sub-sector with more impact will be distributed solar PV generation for industrial and commercial customers impacted.Forbes reports:Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, believes renewables were protected ‘above all’ by their zero marginal cost. Every additional unit of thermal energy requires the producer to buy additional fuel. The sun demands no such payment.The Senate has been in deep talks — and some seriously heated arguments — for days in order to attempt to reach agreement over the stimulus bill as a result of COVID-19. Democrats say the delay is a result of the bill not containing enough support for healthcare systems. Republicans argue that Democrats are trying to ram through the Green New Deal.It’s true that environmental groups are fighting funding for the fossil fuel industry and pushing for tax incentives for green energy, and stricter emissions rules on airlines. (And they’re right to do so: There is a direct correlation between pollution and health.)But none of that, barring emissions reductions measures for the airline industry, is included in the bill. Transitioning to 100% green energy or support for EVs is not included in the bill. There is nothing about the Green New Deal.As Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said, according to the Hill:I keep hearing about the House wanting a Green New Deal as part of this emergency package. That’s a total red herring.There’s no Green New Deal in this thing, so let’s get real.Photo: Magicvalley.com",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

Although they may be severe, the effects are likely to be temporary. Meanwhile, the threat posed by climate change, which requires us to reduce global emissions significantly this decade, will remain. We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise our efforts to tackle the world’s inescapable challenge.Large-scale investment to boost the development, deployment and integration of clean energy technologies — such as solar, wind, hydrogen, batteries and carbon capture (CCUS) — should be a central part of governments’ plans because it will bring the twin benefits of stimulating economies and accelerating clean energy transitions.And yet transitioning to 100% green energy, or EVs, is not included in the bill.Environmental groups are indeed fighting funding for the fossil fuel industry and pushing for tax incentives for green energy and stricter emissions rules on airlines. (And they’re right to do so: There is a direct correlation between pollution and health.)But none of that, barring emissions reductions measures for the airline industry, is included in the bill.

That amounts to a total of 1,278 megawatts of new green energy capacity. The awards total $1 billion in state investment.According to Real Estate Weekly, the projects are expected to stimulate more than $2.5 billion in direct, private investments toward their development, construction, and operation and create more than 2,000 short- and long-term jobs.The projects include 17 large-scale solar projects and four utility-scale wind projects comprised of three redevelopment upgrades to existing wind projects and one new large-scale wind project.Governor Andrew Cuomo said:New York continues to be a leader in developing large-scale renewable energy projects in a way that brings significant economic benefits and jobs to the state.With these projects we will build on our aggressive strategy to combat climate change and lay a foundation for a more sustainable future for all New Yorkers.Electrek’s Take: Bravo, Governor Cuomo. May this initiative help New York State recover from the awful pandemic hit the state is suffering in the short term, and it will certainly help New York move to cleaner energy and reduce emissions in the longer term.

2020/03/20,"This may sound controversial, but please stay with us. The coronavirus lockdown may actually save even more lives by reducing pollution due to factory shutdowns, reduced travel, and more.Forbes and France24 report that François Gemenne, director of The Hugo Observatory, which studies the interactions between environmental changes, human migration, and politics, pointedly says:Strangely enough, I think the death toll of the coronavirus at the end of the day might be positive, if you consider the deaths from atmospheric pollution.More than likely the number of lives that would be spared because of these confinement measures would be higher than the number of lives that would be lost because of the pandemic.Gemenne went on to cite that 48,000 people die in France and 1 million people in China die annually because of pollution. The US death toll annually is estimated at around 100,000.Here’s Gemenne in his own words:However, a big manufacturing push is expected in China, for example — and other countries will undoubtedly try to follow — to try to make up for economic losses due to the coronavirus, and this could increase emissions even more than before the big drop. So recovery packages need to include green energy and serious consideration for reducing climate change.For example, US Democrats want airlines to reduce emissions, and they also want an extension of clean-tech tax credits. That includes electric vehicles, battery storage, offshore wind, and solar energy.As a result of social distancing and lockdowns, the air quality has improved. According to CNN, the average number of “good quality air days” increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period in 2019, according to China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment.And in Venice, for example, the lack of boat traffic and tourist overcrowding has resulted in clear water in the canals, so now fish can be seen. Swans are now making an appearance, and people are posting videos of dolphins on social media.One thing is pretty clear (besides the water and air): greatly reduced numbers of people, and nature makes a fast comeback. No fossil fuels and transport emissions, and pollution clears up quickly. So these lockdowns are evidence that governments can do something quickly about a global threat. Rapid change is possible.Gail Whiteman, director of the Pentland Centre for Sustainability in Business at Lancaster University, told CNBC:This is the first time I have seen governments choosing humanity over economics in such a significant way — ever.This is a ‘yes we can’ moment for the climate crisis.Photo: The Hill",solar
2020/03/20,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.A lot of people are now working from home due to the coronavirus. Here’s how to be more energy efficient. Both the environment and your energy bill will thank you.Take advantage of natural daylight. If you’re in a cooler climate, the sun will help warm your house. Or just put on a sweater or use blankets. Likewise, if you’re in a warmer climate, pull your blinds — it’s how it’s always been done in places like Spain or the Caribbean. Heating and cooling costs make up nearly half of an average home’s utility bills. And natural light is great for ambience, so turn off your lighting if it’s not necessary. (I turn off all lights during the day until I absolutely need to switch them on, late afternoon, and sit by a window.) Once you do have to turn on your lights, switch any non-LED lights to LED. You can order them online, and you’ll save money in the long run.Turn down your water heater temperature. Even a couple of degrees can make a difference to your energy consumption without compromising the simple pleasure of a nice shower. (Oh, and baths are lovely, but if you want to keep your water bill down too, stick to showers.)Use a smart power strip. Smart power strips ensure your tech devices that you need for work don’t use power when they’re not in use. And you can also get them with surge protection, too.Use power management settings. Electronics have Active, Active standby, and Passive standby settings. If you set your computer to passive standby, you’ll save power when you take a break. (I keep my laptop on a setting where it “sleeps” after just a couple minutes.)Unplug things, or turn them off if you’re not using them. Don’t let the TV run all day, wait for the dishwasher to be full if you run it, and only put in full loads of laundry.The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is a biannual collegiate competition that’s been running since 2002. In the Decathlon’s own words, it comprises 10 contests……that challenge student teams to design and build highly efficient and innovative buildings powered by renewable energy. The winners will be those teams that best blend architectural design and engineering excellence with innovation, market potential, building efficiency, and smart energy production.It consists of the Design Challenge and the Build Challenge. And yesterday, the DOE Solar Decathlon announced that the Design Challenge weekend, on April 17-19, will be completely virtual due to COVID-19. (It was originally to be held at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado.)Here’s the virtual agenda. And here’s the competition guide, if you’re interested in how it’ll work. Here’s how the Design Challenge evaluates the projects:Designs are evaluated on how well they meet the nation’s rapidly evolving demand for buildings that are innovative, cost-effective, quick to build, high quality, resilient, grid interactive, efficient, and locally responsive.The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) sent out an email that stated the following:Millions of people are facing unprecedented hardship as the COVID-19 coronavirus takes its toll on public health and livelihoods. Smart energy policies that conserve resources and protect customers continue to be critically important in these uncertain times, especially as some may struggle even more than normal to pay our bills. It is critically important for power companies to make sure that no one is left behind and no one’s utilities are shut off, especially as people are encouraged to stay home.Utilities are a necessity, not a luxury. Even at the best of times, too many people have to choose between paying their utility bills or groceries, prescriptions, or rent.In these extraordinary circumstances, it is critical that utilities immediately suspend disconnections, waive late payment fees, reconnect customers that have been recently been disconnected due to nonpayment, and commit to investing in bill-lowering measures like energy efficiency and solar energy.SACE recommends contacting your elected officials to urge them to suspend utility disconnections and commit to green energy and energy efficiency, which lowers bills and reduces pollution. Because pollution is one of the greatest threats to human health in the world.You can check here to see what your utility company’s policy is on disconnections during this pandemic.Photo: Glenn Carstens-Peters/Unsplash",solar
2020/03/19,"Senator Angus King (I-ME) introduced the Battery and Critical Mineral Recycling Act of 2020 this month. The groundbreaking bill aims, as it simply states, “to support the reuse and recycling of batteries and critical minerals, and for other purposes.”According to King’s website, the legislation aims to incentivize, through grant programs, the recycling of rechargeable and electrochemical batteries in the US to meet green energy needs and decrease mineral imports.The bill calls for $150 million over the next five years to support innovative research into recycling and to establish a US-wide collection system that can harvest old batteries from anything that — well, uses batteries.King, who is a founding member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, said:Critical minerals like lithium and cobalt are vital to developing clean energy technology — and the good news here is that we have these materials on hand already, from old phone and computer batteries in the desk drawers of American homes and offices.Why pay the economic and environmental cost of importing these minerals from countries like China, when we could meet a large portion of our need by simply encouraging the American people to turn in their old batteries to be recycled back into the industry?This act is a key step toward reducing waste, developing clean energy technology, and revolutionizing the way we produce and utilize critical minerals.This is a great incentive: Americans must recycle what they already have. In fact, it’s crucial. Lithium-ion batteries are a vital part of moving into emissions-free energy, but we can’t then start to pollute by discarding all those batteries — and the metals within them — when they stop working.We have to have a plan for the full cycle of green-energy life — not a growing mountain of discarded batteries. And as a recent study, published in February in the journal Science Advances pointed out, our metals supply is finite, and nor do we want to spur a dirty mining boom.",solar

But she still prioritized EVs and charging stations in Santa Fe, which received $750,000. According to the Santa Fe Reporter, city EVs and charging stations were a top 10 priority. The expansion of the city’s airport was originally No. 1, but did not receive funding.The money could buy as many as 23 state electric vehicles, and every time a city fleet vehicle must be replaced, it will be with an electric car. Santa Fe plans to convert the city’s entire fleet to electric by 2025.Santa Fe director of public works Regina Wheeler said:Electric vehicles hit two birds with one stone. It makes the city more sustainable, and it supports an industry built on the green economy that is counter-cyclical to the oil boom and bust cycle.Electrek’s Take: It’s great to see New Mexico and Santa Fe prioritize green transport and cleaner air, even in the midst of a difficult time. We hope to see other cities and states stay the course as well.US lawmakers are scrambling to put together a stimulus package for the coronavirus crisis, and Democratic House members have included green energy tax incentives.There are seven potential clean energy tax incentives that were requested in a letter dated February 27 by environmental groups and green energy trade associations and sent to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. You can read the letter with the full seven provisions here. These incentives requested in February are now being rolled into the greater stimulus coronavirus package.Examples include tax incentives for batteries and electricity storage systems, solar and wind, and electric vehicles to support the clean energy industry in an economic downturn.According to market research company Morning Consult, representatives Gerry Connolly (D-VA), Paul Tonko (D-NY), and Doris Matsui (D-CA) stated:Our members pushed for these credits in the [2019] end-of-year funding package and will continue to fight for them in this round of economic stimulus.DesignBoom runs a DIY submissions feature where readers submit their own work for publication, and the website received an extremely intriguing conceptual project from French architecture firm XTU architects.XTU’s submission is called “x_lands,” and DesignBoom describes the concept as “fantastical.” They’ve got that right.The concept looks at life after oil, and in particular, what to do with all the offshore platforms that have been built in the last century to drill for the earth’s natural resources.This project imagines the industrial monoliths transformed into poetic, habitable, and exotic projects, or in other words, ‘x_lands.’Each concept features a lot of natural greenery, along with some wind turbines for clean energy.

2020/03/17,"Last week, the US Senate confirmed James Danly as a commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC regulates the interstate transmission of natural gas, electricity, and oil. Danly previously represented two natural gas companies that FERC is supposed to regulate.Further, FERC is supposed to be nonpartisan, but it now has a 3-1 Republican majority, with one vacancy, on the five-member board. Trump controversially did not nominate a Democrat as well. Bipartisan nominations have historically been the norm. Danly is a Republican.Danly previously served as FERC’s general counsel before being approved as a commissioner. His first nomination for commissioner was rejected earlier this year.According to the Hill, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who voted for Danly, said:Past presidents have sent nominations to fill both [seats] at the same time. I am deeply disappointed this has not happened this time. The politics involved in this town is outrageous.Further, watchdog group Accountable.US is concerned about Danly’s conflicts of interest. Also from the Hill:According to ethics forms obtained by [Accountable.US] and reviewed by the Hill, when Danly worked at a law firm from 2014 to 2017, his clients included Exelon Corp. and NextEra Energy. Both are energy companies with ongoing natural gas projects, which the agency has jurisdiction over from the Natural Gas Act.The two natural gas companies Danly worked with have been legally challenged by environmentalists.Chris Saeger, Accountable.US’s director of strategic initiatives, said:We will see more dangerous pipeline projects approved… and ultimately the American people will pay the price. It will mean more carbon in the atmosphere, it will mean more pipelines in communities that don’t want them.This latest partisan move by the Trump administration is a disappointment, but it’s unsurprising, as this administration has been systematically boosting the fossil-fuel industry and deregulating environmental protection (137 EPA deregulations, to be precise, as of February 8) since 2016.Further, there is an ongoing theme with Trump’s administration of appointees having ties with the very industries they are supposed to be regulating.On February 20, the American Council on Renewable Energy issued a press release complaining that FERC was continuing “executive overreach” by delivering “a new subsidy to the fossil fuel industry today at the unfortunate expense of New York ratepayers.”So this latest appointment is going to ruin FERC’s reputation as a nonpartisan commission.",solar

Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm, previously predicted that global solar energy capacity would grow by 121 to 152 gigawatts this year, but on Friday, the group issued a new report dialing back its prediction to just 108 to 143 Gigawatts.In the US… utility-scale wind developers have received ‘force majeure’ notices from wind turbine suppliers in Asia who cannot fulfill their contract obligations in time.Further, governments are having to turn away from focusing on green energy projects and turn their attention to coronavirus action plans. But Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, told the Guardian:We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition.We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages.

Bottom line, they both support it.The Green New Deal includes a goal of switching to 100% green energy by 2030, among many other details. (The Sierra Club provides a comprehensive summary of what the Green New Deal is here.)Biden said:We both agree that we have a new green deal [sic] to deal with the threat that faces humanity.We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don’t disagree on the principle.The New York Times fact-checked Biden’s statement and concluded that it’s mostly true. Sanders is an original co-sponsor of the Senate version. He has incorporated a lot of the Green New Deal into his own climate-crisis plan, which he has also named the Green New Deal.However, Biden wants to spend $1.7 trillion on addressing climate change, and his deadline for net zero is 2050. Sanders, on the other hand, proposes spending $16 trillion, and his deadline is 2030, as stated above.Sanders wants a wholesale ban on fracking, while Biden wants to stop new fracking on public land. Further, when it comes to fossil fuels, Reuters reports:Sanders wants to end fossil fuel use completely in power and transport in less than 10 years. Biden, meanwhile, sees traditional power sources like natural gas still having a role to play, with the help of technology to deal with emissions.But bottom line, this is a great progress for the support of green energy from Democratic presidential candidates, as four years ago, it was barely on the agenda.The coronavirus pandemic is affecting nearly every aspect of life in the world, and solar and wind power is no exception.

2020/03/13,"Coal developers risk wasting nearly $640 billion because it’s already cheaper to generate electricity from green energy than from new coal plants in all major markets, Carbon Tracker Initiative reported yesterday.The independent financial think tank got right to the point:Policymakers need to stop new investments in coal power immediately and redesign power market regulation to minimize stranded asset risk [and] accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy.Banks are increasingly withdrawing from fossil-fuel company investments due to tougher emissions-cuts targets and cheaper green energy.It takes 15 to 20 years for capital recovery for new coal investments, so that makes it risky.By 2030 at the latest, it will be cheaper to build new wind or solar than continue to operate coal across the globe, according to the report.Reuters reports:The report examined the economics of 95% of coal plants which are operating, under construction, or planned worldwide.Globally, 499 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power capacity is planned or under construction with an investment cost of $638 billion.More than 60% of global coal plants are currently generating electricity at a higher cost than could be produced by building new renewables.The US has 254GW of coal capacity, with 47% costing more than green energy.We, of course, have written at length about how coal is not only bad for our planet, but it’s also economically unwise for investors — it’s just a bad bet. This latest report just reinforces what we’ve been saying all along.You personally want to invest wisely and also do good? Buy some solar stocks, for instance.

So what’s going on with solar? It’s not great — but don’t worry just yet.Motley Fool reports that solar stocks took a hit yesterday — like everything else. Solar companies are concerned that financing will dry up: “The freezing of credit markets or a drop in earnings may mean a loss of demand for solar development financing.”But Motley Fool‘s outlook is optimistic. Travis Hoium writes:Long term, the fundamentals of solar energy will win out, especially if interest rates stay low.Solar energy is ultimately less expensive than fossil fuels as a producer of electricity because the upfront costs have fallen dramatically over the last decade and financing the long-term cash flows is cheap. For the time being, it doesn’t appear that either of those factors are going to change anytime soon.If you’re a long-term investor willing to buy and hold stocks for a decade or more, now may be the time to start buying solar stocks. They’re taking market share from fossil fuels and growing in large- and small-scale installations.

2020/03/12,"The UK’s chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak presented Britain’s 2020 budget yesterday in Parliament. Here’s what the majority Conservative Party announced about EVs, green energy, and the environment.The budget included the following:There was no taxation change for the fossil-fuel industry, and fuel duty remains frozen. Further, there was no mention of improving domestic energy efficiency. Also, many aren’t happy about £27 billion for new roads, because they feel it will encourage people to choose cars over public transport faster than EVs can be adopted, thus increasing emissions.A new national infrastructure strategy, encompassing hundreds of billions of pounds in public- and private-sector spending on green energy, transport and communications, has been postponed to later this spring. So hopefully, the British government will address the issues they missed in yesterday’s budget, including a plan for new roads without increasing emissions.Fossil-fuel companies do need to be taxed, and the UK has a lot of old, drafty houses (I’ve lived in many) that need to be made more energy-efficient and heated with another source besides natural gas. Heating with electric is very expensive in the UK, so lowering electricity’s tax was a good move.While we understand and agree with the reasons why groups such as Greenpeace aren’t happy about the new roads scheme, the UK needs to continue to improve its public transport, as it’s expensive and overcrowded. There needs to be a lot of incentives to switch to EVs and take public transport (which should all be converted to electric asap).And seeing how the UK has banned the sales of ICE cars from 2035, that EV charging network is a must, so it was a good move.",solar

Dan West of the National Resources Defense Council, who is speaking today, says in his testimony:We ask that Congress provide renewed funding to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which is a smart investment that creates new opportunities for American companies and workers to tap into the $60 trillion global clean energy market and create good-paying American jobs. Many American companies export their technologies and innovations around the world, including to projects that are enabled by the GCF.Bilateral programs like sustainable landscapes, renewable energy, adaptation, and biodiversity programs are all smart investments to strengthen US alliances and prevent instability overseas by helping developing countries become more resilient.West also will urge Congress to fully fund the Global Environment Facility — protecting species and forests — and provide additional funding for international climate research and the Montreal Protocol’s fund supporting the phase-out of ozone-destroying chemicals.The UK’s chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak presented the country’s 2020 budget yesterday in Parliament. Here’s what Sunak, who is a Conservative Party member, announced about green energy and the environment:The not-so-good? No taxation change for the fossil-fuel industry, and fuel duty remains frozen. Further, there was no mention of improving domestic energy efficiency. Also, environmentalists are not happy about £27 billion for new roads.A new national infrastructure strategy, encompassing hundreds of billions of pounds in public- and private-sector spending on green energy, transport, and communications, has been postponed to later this spring.Luxembourg has become the first country to make all public transport free nationwide, as of March 1. Unsurprisingly, more people use public transport if it’s free.However, according to Enrica Papa, senior lecturer in transport planning at the University of Westminster in the UK, this doesn’t necessarily reduce drivers, but rather just increases pedestrians and cyclists on public transport.So how can ICE car drivers be encouraged to take free public transport instead (that is, if they’re not switching to EVs)? Papa writes:Rather than relying on free public transport to engineer the shift, a more effective way to reduce the number of people choosing to drive could be regulating car use.Increasing the cost of parking, congestion charging, or increasing fuel taxes could all be combined with free fares to lower car demand.Cleaner and more reliable public transport must be a prerequisite for these schemes if buses and trams are to compete with the car, and making it part of a wider investment plan could have a big impact on the sustainability of transport.",solar
2020/03/11,"The US is about to get a comprehensive database of electricity prices that will be available to the public. The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and WattBuy, an energy intelligence service for consumers, is working together to bring the current national database up to speed.The initiative is funded through a grant from Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative co-founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy.NREL already maintains the Utility Rate Database (URDB), which focuses on the largest 150 electric utilities, constituting approximately 70% of the US electricity load. However, this accounts for less than 10% of all electricity providers. The new project will expand the URDB data set and make it more current and accurate.Kumar Garg, senior director and head of partnerships at Schmidt Futures, said:This data will be a boon to green energy players and researchers.The rise of consumer choice, distributed generation, building automation, and the increasing adoption of electric vehicles makes it critical to provide individuals and businesses with timely, accurate information on electricity costs across geographies.This project follows a successful initiative last year that cataloged electricity rates in the 13 states that deregulated their energy markets, enabling consumer choice. That led to the current database project for all 50 states.WattBuy will create automated processes to collect and maintain all transmission and distribution utility rates nationally by creating new APIs, working with Public Utility Commissions, applying AI to data extraction, and crowdsourcing rates. This will replace the URDB’s current inefficient method of collecting information manually from PDF files submitted to Public Utility Commissions.Debbie Brodt-Giles, group manager for data, analytics, tools, and applications at NREL, said:We’re thrilled WattBuy is expanding the URDB by publishing electricity prices and plans in deregulated markets.This is a logical next step because we know that there is a strong demand for this data from solar financiers and energy efficiency companies, and we are excited about using this platform to share data with the public.",solar

The city is seeking monetary damages to pay for flooding and sea-level rise as a result of climate change. Maui is also expected to file its own lawsuit soon.The companies named in Honolulu’s lawsuit include Aloha Petroleum, BHP Group, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Royal Dutch Shell, and Sunoco.The lawsuit states:The City brings this action against Defendants for Public Nuisance, Private Nuisance, Strict Liability for Failure to Warn, Negligent Failure to Warn, and Trespass.The City seeks to ensure that the parties who have profited from externalizing the consequences and costs of dealing with global warming and its physical, environmental, social, and economic consequences, bear the costs of those impacts, rather than the City, taxpayers, residents, or broader segments of the public.Honolulu’s chief resilience officer Josh Stanbro said at a press briefing on Monday, as per DeSmog Blog:For decades and decades the fossil fuel companies knew that the products they were selling would have tremendous damaging economic impacts for local governments, cities, and counties that our taxpayers are going to be forced to bear.Someone has to hold accountable corporations that color outside the lines and don’t play by the rules.

2020/03/10,"Nestlé, who makes billions of dollars every year selling bottled water, wants to draw out the maximum amount of 1.152 million gallons of water a day from a Florida spring. Today, a bill was filed by a Florida representative that is part of a larger effort by House Democrats to scrutinize bottled water companies.Ginnie Springs Outdoors is a vast recreational park and campground facility in Florida, northwest of Gainesville, and is on the south side of the Santa Fe River. It consists of seven springs fed by the Santa Fe.The Wray family, who own the land around Ginnie Springs, has allowed a number of corporations to draw water from the springs and bottle it to sell. An original permit was issued to the local company Seven Springs Bottling Company in 1995 and modified in 1999. The permit allowed for a total of 1.152 million gallons a day, but Seven Springs only drew around one-third of that amount.Now Seven Springs has a contract with the multinational food giant Nestlé, who wants to draw out the maximum amount. Incredibly, the only money Florida makes for the water — the same water for which Nestlé will make millions — is a single $115 application fee paid by Seven Springs.The New York Times reports:If Nestlé draws the more than 1 million gallons, it would be enough to fill about 8.7 million 16.9-ounce bottles of water each day. Nestlé said that figure did not take into account water used for cleaning or in the manufacturing process and for employees to drink.On March 2, the Suwannee River Water Management District said that they considered Seven Springs’ permit application incomplete and recommended that it be denied. The renewal application does not provide specific information about engineering plans to accommodate all the water it wants to pump. Seven Springs also declined to provide a copy of its contract with Nestlé. Finally, there is not evidence of the physical ability to process the greatly inflated amount of water by Nestlé.On March 3, Nestlé issued a statement in response, saying:Nestlé Waters North America (NWNA) is disappointed with the SRWMD staff’s recommendation that the board deny Seven Springs’ permit renewal. The denial recommendation is narrowly focused on issues specifically related to the water purchase agreement and how much water is needed by the facility, NOT on any adverse environmental impacts as a result of the permitted withdrawals.And then Nestlé and Seven Springs filed an appeal, so now the case will go to a hearing, followed by court proceedings. The judge will submit a recommended order to the District Governing Board for a final agency action.Nestle and Seven Springs filed an administrative appeal before Suwannee River Water Mgmt District had a chance to vote on the water use permit at Ginnie Springs. The board was expected to deny the permit tomorrow because the water managers considered the application incomplete. https://t.co/0OmApbPbzR— James Marshall (@jamesmarshall_a) March 9, 2020More than 149,000 people who have signed a change.org petition vehemently disagree with Nestlé’s claim that it would provide no adverse environmental impacts. Consequences include:Deterioration of water quality, lowering the water table reducing residential well water supplies, reduction of water to other streams and lakes in the state, destruction of ecosystems and wetlands, loss of support below soils creating sink holes.A Florida Springs Institute study shows the Santa Fe River’s flow, which feeds the springs, is down 28% from historical levels due to overpumping.Further, Ryan Smart of the Florida Springs Council told NPR:It makes no sense to be giving away water, a million gallons a day, to an out-of-state bottling company when our own river right here is suffering.According to Michael Roth, president of Our Santa Fe River, a Fort White-based nonprofit dedicated to springs and aquifer protection, yes, it would hurt the springs. Roth told Electrek:I do fault the [Suwannee River Water Management District] staff with coming up with three curable objections to the permit while leaving on the table the actual danger to the resource they are supposed to protect and any serious consideration of the public interest.Environmental Action says Nestlé’s plan threatens “the area’s natural beauty and ecological diversity. Years of overpumping have already scarred this spring and the Sante Fe River, which has seen a precipitous drop in water level and stalled river flow.”Today, Broward Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced that she’s filing a bill that would levy a five cents per gallon tax on water that is extracted from springs or groundwater sources. It would result in a significant cost increase for Nestlé. Her bill is part of a larger effort by House Democrats to scrutinize bottled water companies.Wasserman Schultz said:For too long, bottling companies have drained Florida’s most precious resource for next to nothing. Florida’s aquifers are the lifeblood of our economy and a recreational staple of our communities. They can’t be treated like a corporate giveaway that has infinite supply any longer.And Our Santa Fe River’s Roth continued to Electrek:The laws are designed to protect corporate interest, and this is a clear example. We have a valuable resource that’s being both withdrawn from us and polluted, and trying to stop it is almost impossible because the corporation has every legal avenue available to them.After months of our appealing to the apparent decision maker this now goes to a sterile courtroom where we will probably have to prove standing just to present the public view. What was the point of all of our appeals these last six months? And that is the way the system is designed.That having been said, we are not at all surprised at this turn of events, and hopeful that the administrative judge will see that this permit is not reasonable in that it is not necessary, and that it does in fact harm existing users, and it is not at all in the public interest.So, you may be asking, what does this water issue have to do with climate change and green energy? A lot. Just as we at Electrek cover electric vehicles not only because they’re cool (which they are), we also cover them because they’re good for the environment. And like air, water is also vital for humans to live. A tax may be a deterrent, but it’s still not good enough. This water should not be sold as a consumer good.The fact that states are literally giving away one of its most precious resources — water — to corporations for their own profit is just beyond insane. States are allowing companies like Nestlé to take our water, not just in Florida, but in other states like Michigan and California, put it in plastic bottles, and sell it back to us.",solar
2020/03/10,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Virginia’s General Assembly passed milestone clean energy legislation yesterday that requires 30% or more of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 and sets a target of 100% net zero by 2050.The law doubles the state’s offshore wind goal to 5.2GW, which will put Virginia third in the country for offshore wind, and creates incentives for 16.1GW of solar PV and 2.7GW of energy storage. Virginia does not have any onshore wind farms.Virginia’s governor Ralph Northam is expected to sign the bill into law by this week.Recharge reports:For offshore wind, this means allowing Dominion, the state’s dominant utility, to recover the estimated $7.8 billion cost plus make a reasonable profit on its planned 2.64GW array — the nation’s largest — that it wants to build in federal waters in three stages by 2026.Solar Energy Industries Association CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said the legislation “will completely transform energy in Virginia and is a bold step into the Solar+ Decade.”Due to reduced coal usage in Europe and the US, emissions in the power sector fell by 2% in 2019, the biggest fall since at least 1990, according to a study from by independent climate think tank Ember, which focuses on global energy transition. Reuters reports:The report examined data covering 85% of the world’s electricity generation and used informed estimates for the remaining 15%.The drop in Europe was 24%, driven by a switch to renewables, while US coal-fired generation was down 16% because of more competitive gas.However, China bucked the trend with a rise as it became responsible for half of global coal-fired power generation.But 2% is falling far short of the necessary 11% drop in coal generation per year to keep within a warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius.On the green energy side, wind and solar power generation rose by 270 terawatt-hours, or 15%, last year. That annual growth rate would put the world on track to achieve Paris Agreement goals.My Electrek colleague Bradley Berman reported yesterday that consulting firm McKinsey predicts that Germany will be the market leader for electric vehicles by 2021. And it looks like the UK is on the same track, as British companies are expected to spend more than £12 billion ($15.7 billion) on EVs in the next two years.The British government is expected to end fuel subsidies and duty freezes in this week’s budget, and that will accelerate the movement to adopt EVs. And let’s not forget the UK government’s ban on sales of new ICE vehicles by 2035, as we reported on February 5.The Guardian reports:More than a third of companies say the government’s looming ban on petrol and diesel cars has made them bring forward plans to shift to clean driving, according to a survey by the owner of British Gas. The same proportion of companies told Centrica that access to ultra-low emissions driving zones was also a factor in their decision.(For those who live in the UK, you know that petrol is very expensive.

So in retaliation, Saudi Arabia will produce 2 million barrels per day at $6 to $7 a barrel into an already oversupplied global market. As a result, oil prices have dropped by a third today — the biggest loss since the 1991 Gulf War.Saudi Arabia wanted OPEC and Russia to make oil production cuts to support oil prices in light of the coronavirus outbreak. But Russia objected, so Saudi Arabia jacked up oil production and discounted its oil prices. Analysts say Saudi Arabia is punishing Russia for abandoning the two countries’ three-year supply pact. The oil market is already saturated.Officially, Russia said it wants to wait and see what the coronavirus’ impact is on the oil market. Unofficially, Russia is angry about US sanctions of Russian energy companies and the US’ attempts to stop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany.Russia felt that cutting output would boost the US shale industry, which has stolen customers away from Russia. So Russia sees this as an opportunity to put a dent in the US shale industry. Russia says it can cope with low oil prices for six to 10 years.As CNBC explains:The industry is facing a three-sided attack: falling prices, a move of institutional investors to divest from fossil fuel companies, and crushing debt loads.Making a difference to adopt green energy and help lower emissions tends to feel overwhelming for most people. Where does one even start? Well, it’s easier than you think.The Guardian published a roundup of 50 simple steps everyone could take to make their lives greener. You can see all 50 suggestions by clicking on the link here, but here three suggestions to get you started:Fix your electrical appliances: Yes, everyone is fully aware that “they don’t make ’em like they used to,” and it’s because appliance makers want to sell more stuff. You can prolong the life of your appliances by regular cleaning, and look for repair shops. If your appliance is beyond help, then “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling.”Create clean air: No, we’re not suggesting you buy an expensive air filtration system. We’re suggesting you buy house plants. For example, mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, so it’s great for a bedroom. And Boston ferns love humidity and can reduce the mold spores, making them ideal for bathrooms.Be an eco-driver if you can’t yet switch to an EV: Maintain your vehicle regularly and check your tire pressure, as low air causes a rise in fuel consumption. Don’t overload your car. Open your window instead of run the AC below 40 mph, and for heaven’s sake, don’t idle.",solar

2020/03/06,"ExxonMobil held its investor day at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) yesterday, and its CEO, Darren Woods, dismissed carbon targets as a “beauty match” with other companies.Woods (pictured behind the podium a couple years ago, above) said ExxonMobil will not be entering into a competition with European companies like BP (UK), which said it would reach net zero from oil and gas it produces by 2050. Shell (British-Dutch) and Equinor (Norway) are also setting targets around Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions that occur in the company’s value chain. Eni (Italy) has pledged to cut its emissions by 80% by 2050 and said its fossil-fuel production will peak in 2025.In comparison, American Exxon has pledged a 15% reduction in methane emissions between 2016 and 2020, and a 25% cut in flaring waste natural gas, which is the burning at the wellhead of unwanted natural gas, principally methane, an oil extraction byproduct.Neither Exxon nor Chevron (also American) have set Scope 3 targets. Instead, Exxon is approaching this as an opportunity, not an environmental crisis. The Financial Times reports that Woods said at the NYSE:We want to ensure that we’re well-positioned for the inevitable upswing as growth in demand outstrips current supply.Exxon has plans for $30-$35 billion in capital spending per year for the next five years. Most of its money will go to big oil and gas projects. Exxon seems to be singing off a different hymn sheet, not only from its competitors (except for Chevron), but also investors and, increasingly, banks.#Exxon CEO has his head buried in the Tar Sands…. https://t.co/EKMSWT7L1m— Tony Calandro (@TonySustain) March 6, 2020(Edward Mason is head of responsible investment for the Church of England Commissioners.)Woods said:Individual companies hitting targets and then selling assets to another company so that their portfolio has a different carbon intensity has not solved the problem for the world. It hasn’t made a dent in it. And in some cases, if you’re moving to a less effective operator, you’ve actually made the problem worse.The FT continues:Once the largest company by market value, Exxon has lost allure to investors spooked by declining returns and questions over future demand. Some have pledged to divest from oil and other fossil fuel stocks as worries build over climate change.Further, the Guardian reported today that ExxonMobil met with European Commission officials to try to get them to compromise on the European Green Deal. The company wants to extend its carbon-pricing scheme to include ICE vehicles.The Guardian says:Green groups believe this would be the least effective way to disincentive fossil fuel vehicles, and would rather allow countries to set their own emissions standards and targets for road emissions.The move appears to be an attempt to stall the rollout of electric vehicles by keeping a lid on the cost of driving a traditional combustion engine vehicle running on fossil fuels.Exxon has spent €37.2 million lobbying the EU since 2010, more than any other fossil-fuel company.Let’s just park, for the moment, the discussion of all the air pollution and damage to the environment fossil fuels do — that’s a given. And regular readers of Electrek know that’s our stance, and it drives our passion for and promotion of electric vehicles. So of course we’re not happy at all with Exxon’s dodging, diving, and covert attempt to thwart the adoption of EVs, which isn’t going to happen anyway, no matter how hard they try.Let’s put it in Exxon’s context, which is money. It’s always about money. So, if they stay on their current path of justification for refusing to emulate their European counterparts by investing in green energy and steering away from fossil fuels, it’s just financially not smart. Just ask Jim Cramer, who declared fossil fuels “done” on January 31.As Noah Brenner, Energy Intelligence‘s Houston bureau chief, wrote on Twitter, “If Exxon thinks the only reason peers are pledging cuts is activist pressure then [ExxonMobil] execs really don’t understand the modern financial world.”Well, quite, Mr. Brenner.Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

As Electrek reported, Arizona passed this legislation in February — with help, of course, from natural gas businesses — and the other five states have plenty of backing from the same groups.Natural gas is a fossil fuel that causes emissions. While it produces less carbon dioxide than coal, it is not “clean,” like the natural gas industry claims in its PR campaigns. As Reuters states:Research is mounting that natural gas contributes significantly to global warming by leaking from drilling, piping, compressing, and distribution infrastructure. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is many times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.Connecticut is a major insurance hub. There are 1,478 domestic and non-domestic insurance companies licensed to do business in the state.And now, Connecticut state senator Matt Lesser (D), who is a co-chair of the state senate’s insurance committee, is pushing a bill that would require the state’s insurance commissioner to study and report on climate change issues.According to Lesser, via S&P Global:The bill aims to create transparency about both the support insurers provide to the fossil fuel industry and the risks the insurance industry is taking on when it comes to climate change.The bill would require the commissioner to determine if Connecticut-based or licensed insurers disclosed investments in fossil fuels and whether or not they were involved in underwriting for fossil fuels, including coal and tar sands projects. It would also require a study of whether insurers engaged a third party to assess their investment portfolios for exposure to climate risk.Ross Hammond, senior strategist at Insure Our Future and The Sunrise Project, said:It’s clear that pressure is rapidly growing on US insurers to end their support for fossil fuels. There’s simply no justification anymore for insuring and investing in the very things that are causing the climate crisis.The construction of a new wind farm in northwestern Arizona will create around 300 jobs. BP Wind Energy North America will begin work this year on a 38-square-mile wind farm in White Hills, about 40 miles north of Kingman, Arizona, and south of Lake Mead National Recreation Area.The Mohave County Wind Farm will generate enough energy to power 175,000 homes.NextEra Energy Renewables Holdings LLC and Mohave County Wind Farm LLC own the wind farm.

There’s simply no justification anymore for insuring and investing in the very things that are causing the climate crisis.Samantha Dynowski, Connecticut state director for the Sierra Club, said:Backing fossil fuel projects at this time is going to make it difficult if not impossible to do what we need to do to protect the planet and save lives. I think transparency is really the first step to hold insurers accountable for backing fossil fuels.Several major environmental groups, such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth, launched a campaign called Stop the Money Pipeline in Washington, DC, in January. They’re targeting institutions such as banks and insurance companies to stop funding and underwriting fossil-fuel companies.US insurance firms are beginning follow their European counterparts, which are withdrawing from the coal industry.There is a major conflict of interest between underwriting fossil-fuel projects that are ruining the environment and people’s health, and then paying out losses from climate-change-caused disasters and disease and death as a result of air pollution. And guess what? Then premiums go up, so the insurance companies’ customers get to foot the bill.Insurers: Don’t underwrite fossil fuels, save money in payouts.

The new program will provide 1,490MW of solar in 20 new solar plants by mid-2021.It will be the largest community solar program in the US, more than doubling the amount of community solar in the country. FPL estimates, based on sign-ups for program updates, that more than 150,000 families and small businesses want to join SolarTogether. Community solar also provides an opportunity for low-income households to benefit from green energy.Dr. Stephen Smith, executive director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said:We applaud the Florida Public Service Commission for embracing a new, innovative solar program that will greatly expand access to solar power for customers, including low-income customers, and generate millions of dollars in projected economic benefits.Open enrollment in SolarTogether begins on March 17 at noon.Donald Trump has nominated Nancy B.

She then joined the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Environmental groups are very concerned about the coziness that now exists between the EPA and the ACC, in which Beck has played a big part.Environmental groups such as the EWG and the Environmental Defense Fund think Beck’s CPSC nomination is a really bad idea. Ken Cook, president of the EWG, a nonprofit public health advocacy organization, said:Nancy Beck is the last person who should be in charge of safeguarding the American people from dangerous products.The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will consider Beck’s nomination before it goes to the Senate floor for a vote.You can read the full story here.Red diesel in the UK is the same as ordinary diesel, but it’s dyed red to indicate its tax exemption, which has existed since 1928. Red diesel is used for non-motoring functions such as farming, crane operation, and construction. It makes up around 15% of total diesel use.The UK’s chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak is expected to scrap the red diesel rebate in his budget statement next week. That means red diesel consumers will have to pay an extra 47 pence on every liter of diesel consumed.In other words, the UK is going to stop subsidizing this fossil fuel to encourage industry to switch to cleaner technologies. And this approach works: When the UK started heavily taxing tobacco, the number of smokers dropped dramatically. Cigarettes in the UK now cost around $14 a pack.The end of the red diesel rebate will undoubtedly put a squeeze on the farming and construction industries, so the British government will, in turn, need to provide financial incentives for sustainable alternatives.Photo: U.S. Senate Committee Channel",solar
2020/03/05,"Donald Trump has nominated Nancy B. Beck to head up the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), an independent federal agency responsible for — as the title says — consumer product safety.For more than five years, Beck was a senior director at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the chemical industry’s main lobbying group. She then joined the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2017 as deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and was promoted to principal deputy assistant administrator in December 2018.The current CPSC head is Elliot F. Kaye, who was sworn in in July 2014 during the Obama administration. Kaye’s tenure expires in October 2020.Beck has been accused of using her governmental power to dismantle regulations and advance the chemical industry’s interests. On February 25, 2019, ThinkProgress published email exchanges from August 4, 2017, obtained by the Sierra Club through the Freedom of Information Act. The emails were between Beck and Komal K. Jain, an ACC senior director, who asked Beck about a job for her husband. Beck replied that “there is a hiring freeze (unless he wants to be a fellow :)), so I think political is the most workable.”In other words, environmental groups and the press are very concerned about the coziness that now exists between the EPA and the ACC, and they feel that Beck played a big part in establishing that relationship. On May 2, 2017, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) published, “The Scariest Trump Appointee You’ve Never Heard Of” about Beck. The EWG is a nonprofit public health advocacy organization.The New York Times wrote a feature on October 21, 2017, about Beck headlined, “Why Has the EPA Shifted on Toxic Chemicals?

C16 Biosciences uses microbes to ferment food waste into synthetic palm oil.In C16 Biosciences’ own words:Palm oil is everywhere. It’s in our food, clothes, shampoo, and even the fuel that powers our cars. But this $61 billion industry has drastic environmental and societal costs: Rainforests from Costa Rica to Indonesia are destroyed to make way for oil palm tree plantations, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and destroying habitats for people and endangered wildlife along the way.But palm oil doesn’t have to be a problem. There remains an urgent need for consumers and companies alike to switch to environmentally conscious, sustainable palm oil products. We’re building that solution.Palm Oil Investigations reports that palm oil is in more than 50% of consumer products, and that the slashing and burning to make way for palm oil plantations (pictured) is causing terrible pollution. “It’s estimated that deforestation contributes up to 20% of global warming,” they report. More than 90% of palm oil is used to produce food, cosmetics, detergents, and candles, says Rainforest Rescue. It’s also used as fuel.As Bloomberg Green reports, “Breakthrough Energy Ventures wants to invest in companies that have the potential to cut emissions by as much as 500 million metric tons each year.”The Adygea wind farm, Russia’s largest, has begun to supply electric power to the wholesale electricity and capacity market.

The next-largest wind farm with an installed capacity of 210MW will appear in the Kochubeyevsky district of the Stavropol Kray.Overall, by 2023, Rosatom will install 1GW of wind farms.According to a 2017 report (the most recent report available) from the US Energy Information Administration, only 13% of Russia’s primary energy consumption consists of “nuclear, renewables and other.”On February 28, Electrek reported on West Virginia’s solar bill SB583, which was unanimously passed.

2020/03/04,"The SB583 solar bill debate was lively on the West Virginia House floor yesterday, and some of the delegates’ viewpoints were… interesting. However, the House of Delegates ultimately passed the bill on a 75-23 vote that will make it easier for companies to get a small portion of their power supply from solar energy.On February 28, Electrek reported on SB583, which was then unanimously passed. The bill passed the Senate, but the House amended it, so it goes back to the Senate to concur or reject the changes.SB583 aims to create “a program to further the development of renewable energy resources and renewable energy facilities for solar energy by modifying the powers and duties of the Public Service Commission.”West Virginia ranks 48th in the US in solar, with 8.372MW installed. In 2018, 90% of the state’s energy came from coal, and 8% is natural gas. Only 2% came from green energy.In other words, green energy is currently minuscule in this struggling coal-dependent state.The West Virginia Metro News reported on some of the debate’s highlights:House Energy Committee chair Bill Anderson (R-Wood) expressed a bit of actual logic. He said:I acknowledge the history of coal in this state, and I feel for what the citizens of southern West Virginia have been going through for the past decade.I don’t want to focus more on the past because it’s kind of depressing to tell you the truth. We need to move forward.There are economic forces at work, not only in West Virginia but throughout this country that are transforming this country in many ways. We are focusing on the energy component and its effect on this state today. There has got to be a mosaic of energy production in this state.Delegate Moore Capito (R-Kanawha), on the other hand, saw solar as a means to boost fossil fuels (yes, really):I would suggest to you the way to burn more coal and to burn more gas is to get more bodies into West Virginia.If West Virginia’s future is bright I would suggest a little solar energy might come in handy.So, basically, Capito sees solar as a way to lure more business in — like bait on a hook — so the state can then burn more coal.Daryl Cowles (R-Morgan) echoed Capito’s sentiment:I think this bill is good for coal.Evan Hansen (D-Monongalia) expressed a bit of common sense when he said the state’s economy had been running in slow motion for decades, and it was time to “pivot”:Now we’re finally taking a step to support all types of energy, not just fossil energy but renewal energy as well.The West Virginia debate focused on whether the bill would undercut coal and natural gas — not how the state could provide clean energy jobs, reduce emissions, lower electric bills for its residents, and attract more businesses to the state. So while the solar bill is welcome, the thinking of many delegates misses the point entirely. Many delegates seem trapped in the past. One legislator even said that “catering to corporate America” is a “fad.”Anderson is right: The country — the world — is transforming, when it comes to reducing emissions. In fact, it’s speeding up. As Anderson says, the state needs to move forward. Are West Virginia’s legislators going to raise their heads, look around, and see that they’re being left behind? The state was hit hard by the loss of coal. State legislators are failing their residents, who need new jobs — green energy jobs, corporate or corporate-related jobs — to replace their redundant coal jobs.The solar bill is a positive step, but if I was the CEO of a company that puts sustainability at the forefront of its values, once I heard about Capito’s and Cowles’ logic, I’d take my business to another state. I’d feel like the state’s legislature was trying to hoodwink me. Corporate sustainability is most definitely not a fad.Photo: Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church, Shepherdstown, West Virginia.

2020/03/03,"You know what’s shortening people’s lives globally, far more than viruses, wars, disease, and smoking? It’s air pollution, according to a new study released today and published in Cardiovascular Research.According to the European Society of Cardiology:Professors Jos Lelieveld and Thomas Münzel, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Department of Cardiology of the University Medical Centre Mainz in Mainz, Germany, who led the research, say the findings suggest the world is facing an air pollution ‘pandemic.’Using a new method of modeling the effects of various sources of air pollution on death rates, the researchers estimated that globally, air pollution caused an extra 8.8 million premature deaths a year in 2015. This represents an average shortening of life expectancy of nearly three years for all persons worldwide.This is the first study to show the effects of air pollution on deaths according to age, type of disease, and also its effect on life expectancy at the level of individual countries and regions.Here’s how that compares to other things that shorten life expectancy:The researchers looked at the effects of air pollution on the following six categories:They concluded that heart disease and cerebrovascular disease caused by air pollution causes the greatest proportion of shortened lives, at 43% worldwide.Lelieveld, a co-author of the study, said:We show that about two-thirds of premature deaths are attributable to human-made air pollution, mainly from fossil-fuel use; this goes up to 80% in high-income countries. Five and a half million deaths worldwide a year are potentially avoidable.Everyone is worrying about the coronavirus pandemic, yet the real global threat has been staring us in the face for decades: fossil fuels. This is the first study that’s looked at age, type of disease, and effect on life expectancy, but we already knew that exposure to air pollution is a bigger killer worldwide than smoking.Outdoor particulate pollution kills around 4.2 million people worldwide annually, according to the Lancet and the World Health Organization (WHO).What’s it going to take to get governments to acknowledge the true problem that’s causing premature human deaths — and stop using fossil fuels?We’ve got to move to electric vehicles and green energy as quickly as possible. Wash your hands — but immediately — stop idling your car, switch to solar or join a renewable co-op, drive an EV, walk, take public transport, ditch natural gas and coal.

Now, onshore wind farms will be able to compete for subsidies with other green energy sources. Johnson’s decision is part of the UK’s efforts to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050.Former prime minister David Cameron halted onshore wind-farm subsidies four years ago. Cameron had called the onshore wind turbines “unsightly,” and they were unpopular with his Conservative Party.The party has now reversed its ban, as, according to the Financial Times, “Alok Sharma, business secretary, said cutting carbon emissions rapidly would mean ‘making the most of every technology available‘ including onshore wind and solar.” New onshore wind farms could be operating by the mid-2020s. Onshore wind is typically cheaper to build than offshore wind.The COP26 global climate change talks will be held in Glasgow in November.Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland have discovered a new family of chemical compounds that could revolutionize fuel-cell technology: hexagonal perovskites. The scientists call their discovery a “needle in a haystack.”So what are hexagonal perovskites, and what do they have to do with green energy and reducing emissions?To put it in layman’s terms, it’s a new chemical compound that exhibits high conductivity at lower temperatures.It’s an alternative to ceramic fuel cells, which are highly efficient devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy and produce very low emissions if powered by hydrogen. They can power homes and cars. But the hitch of ceramic fuel cells is that the high temperature of operation results in a short life span.Professor Abbie McLaughlin, director of research in the chemistry department who led the study, says:Ceramic fuel cells are highly efficient, but the problem is they operate at really high temperatures, above 800C.What we have discovered here is a dual proton and oxide ion conductor that will operate successfully at a lower temperature — around 500C — which solves these problems.With hexagonal perovskites, lowering the working temperature prolongs long-term operation and improves stability, safety, and cost.Germany broke a new monthly record for green energy production in February. Renewables provided 61.2% of the country’s net public electricity generation last month, with wind energy providing nearly half of the country’s electricity.According to Renew Economy:Germany’s fleet of wind turbines generated a record 20.80TWh, or 45.8%, of the country’s electricity.Second in terms of contribution to Germany’s renewables power sector was biomass, which provided 3.74TWh, or 8.3% of total electricity generation, followed by solar with 1.86TWh, or 4.2%.There were over a dozen days that achieved around or above 70% as well.

I hope that when California sees our final regulation when it comes out they will agree that it’s the best approach for the entire country.The EPA wants to roll back fuel economy standards, while California has pushed for automakers to reach an average fuel economy of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2026.As Electrek reported on February 10, Donald Trump proposed a 26% slash to the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. It would eliminate 50 EPA programs and cut the research and development budget from $500 million to $281 million.When Scott Pruitt resigned as head of the EPA in July 2018, Wheeler replaced him. Wheeler was previously a former coal lobbyist who worked with Murray Energy and was an aide for Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), an avid climate-science denier. As Electrek‘s Jameson Dow reported in July 2018:Wheeler’s connection to the coal industry is strong.  As a former lobbyist for Murray Energy, Wheeler had knowledge of the three-page directive that Bob Murray gave to the EPA after donating $300,000 to Trump’s inauguration fund, with a list of demands from the coal industry for the new administrator to enact.  Wheeler was also personally involved in the DOE’s attempt at a $70 billion bailout for the coal industry with a proposed rule that was later stopped by the FERC.Congress is expected to ignore Trump’s budget request when it comes to environmental issues.Most heads of departments in any private or public organization or company get upset when they lose funding, but Wheeler is cool with it.And with all the rollbacks the EPA has been pushing through — for example, the latest being the greenhouse-gas-leak prevention rule, and in November, regulations that require chemical plants to provide the public with information about potential risks — no wonder he doesn’t care. Just look at his fossil-fuel-supporting record.Why would you need a healthy budget when your department is washing its hands of its job to protect the environment by killing regulations left, right, and center?Photo: Union of Concerned Scientists",solar
2020/02/28,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The UK’s National Express, a UK-headquartered public transport company, has announced that it intends to become the first zero-emission transport group in the UK. It says it will drive a net zero bus fleet by 2030 and a net zero coach fleet by 2035.It will bring electric coaches into service in 2021. The company said it will never buy another diesel bus again.Earlier in February, the British government announced £5 billion of funding to support the development of green transport, including at least 4,000 zero-emission buses.Electrek’s Take: Yesterday, we wrote about Ireland’s plan to purchase hybrid buses. BAE, which is supplying Ireland with the hybrid buses, cited lack of charging infrastructure. If National Express can go straight to electric in the UK, and BAE produces fully electric buses in addition to hybrids, then why can’t Ireland build the electric charging infrastructure now and go straight to electric?The environmental nonprofit The Nature Conservancy is working with West Virginia’s Coalfield Development Corporation to put large-scale solar energy on a decommissioned coal mine site. This would be a first in West Virginia, and only one other coalfield has been converted to solar, in Virginia.According to PV Magazine:The technical potential for solar on coalfields and other brownfields in central Appalachia has been estimated by the conservancy and West Virginia consultancy Downstream Strategies at 400,000 acres, which could host 50GW of solar.On February 14, West Virginia lawmakers unanimously passed a bill to increase solar in the state overall.SB583 aims to create “a program to further the development of renewable energy resources and renewable energy facilities for solar energy by modifying the powers and duties of the Public Service Commission.”The state’s two utilities, American Electric Power and FirstEnergy, could each install up to 200MW of solar, in 50MW increments, potentially creating a 5,000% increase in the state’s solar capacity.The Reclaiming Appalachia Coalition says that solar installation would create tens of thousands of jobs.The Department of Energy (DOE) was sued this week by environmental and consumer protection groups over its move to block requirements for more efficient light bulbs.The US Public Interest Research Group, Environment America, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Consumer Federation of America, and Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants filed the lawsuit.The DOE argued that LEDs would be too expensive for consumers.According to the Hill, Secretary of Energy Daniel Brouillette argued:Innovation and technology are already driving progress, increasing the efficiency and affordability of light bulbs, without federal government intervention. The American people will continue to have a choice on how they light their homes.Noah Horowitz, director of NRDC’s Center for Energy Efficiency Standards, said:The United States could soon become the world’s dumping ground for these incredibly inefficient bulbs, which increase Americans’ energy bills and lead to millions of tons of additional carbon pollution every year.Electrek’s Take: Light bulb moment, DOE: LEDs save big on electric bills. Brouillette is missing the point. Nearly every other country has phased out the old, inefficient light bulbs. Carbon pollution affects everyone. It shouldn’t be about selfish, personal choices. That’s why we have environmental protection regulations — or did.Photo: National Express",solar

The utility would spend $50 million by 2025 to install charging stations for electric cars every 50 miles on Utah’s highways and between places like national parks. The bill’s purpose is to encourage Utahns to embrace electric vehicles.95% of Utahns think that air pollution and smog are serious problems in their state, according to a Colorado College poll. Further, 53% think that action should be taken to address climate change. That’s up 16 percentage points since 2011.Thom Carter, executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said to Electrek:The EV infrastructure bills make a significant statement about our state’s investment in air quality. There are no perfect answers, but there are practical solutions, and these bills to expand the charging infrastructure is a practical solution to range anxiety.The state legislature has already passed SB77 this week, which will give tax credits to companies that purchase electric commercial vehicles.The Republic of Ireland’s National Transport Authority (NTA) is buying up to 600 hybrid double-decker buses from BAE and bus-building company Alexander Dennis Ltd. The NTA is initially ordering 100 systems that will be deployed in Dublin and regional cities by the end of 2020. The other 500 buses will be deployed over the next 4.5 years. The cost will be €273 million.The buses have a BAE Series-ER system, which allows drivers to drive with the diesel engine off up to 35% of the time. The buses will switch to full electric in designated low- and zero-emission zones.Electrek asked BAE why NTA didn’t just opt for all-electric buses, as BAE makes fully electric buses: the Series-EV, with more than 200 currently in service.Ian Wilson, director of business development for power and propulsion solutions at BAE Systems, replied:Like many places in Europe, Ireland has ambitious targets to achieve a zero emission bus fleet. We firmly believe that hybrid systems present a bridge technology that offers many of the advantages of battery electric without many of the drawbacks.Over the life of the vehicles it will be possible to increase the battery capacity on the vehicles and grow the distances that can be driven with the engine turned off.Electrek’s Take: It’s a bit odd that Wilson describes “battery electric” as a drawback when BAE successfully manufactures functional electric buses already. Ireland, get going on building charging infrastructure, as you’re going to need it to meet the Paris Agreement targets. BAE, sell Ireland on 100% electric, as clearly you already have the technology and the product. Let’s get that 35% to 100%.Seattle’s expansion National Hockey League franchise, a professional ice hockey expansion team that will begin play in the 2021–22 season, “will fully subsidize public transit costs for fans with season tickets or single-game tickets,” according to ESPN via AP. It’s the third US franchise to fully subsidize public travel costs to games.Further, the team will invest $7 million to upgrade the Seattle Center Monorail’s system that connects downtown Seattle with the team’s arena, which is under construction.The franchise expects 25% of game attendees to use the monorail in the first season.Electrek’s Take: This is a win for everyone. Hockey fans get free travel (and I think most people know the exorbitant prices stadiums charge to park). The city of Seattle gets an upgrade to part of its public monorail and traffic relief. And most importantly, it reduces emissions by removing extra cars on the road and reducing idling.

When charging infrastructure becomes available, we can also plug them in, which takes advantage of grid power — further reducing their carbon footprint and localized emissions.The Irish Times explains:The Enviro400ER is a diesel-electric hybrid, capable of at least 2.5 km continuous electric range with no exhaust emissions.The set-up meets meets the requirements of the EU’s Clean Vehicles Directive.There are very few double-decker buses available in electric vehicle mode as they are larger buses and batteries are not good enough yet for the types of routes used in Ireland. But they are expected to be available in three or four years’ time.While we agree that hybrid systems can be used as a bridge technology and that battery technology can be further improved, the only “drawback” we see is the use of polluting diesel. It’s a bit odd that Wilson describes “battery electric” as a drawback when BAE successfully manufactures functional electric buses already.And as for the unavailability of electric double-decker buses, Electrek wrote about… electric double decker buses in March 2016 (electric double decker bus in London) and May 2019 (Hyundai’s electric double decker bus).

2020/02/26,"The 2018 Super Bowl winners the Philadelphia Eagles have been leaders in sustainability among professional sports teams for years.And the team’s latest move is to partner with technology company PDC Machines, who will provide Lincoln Financial Field with a SimpleFuel hydrogen refueling unit to power vehicles and material handling equipment.The NFL team has the Go Green program that incorporates green energy production, recycling, composting, energy efficiency, and reforestation.The Eagles were also the world’s first professional sports team to be awarded the ISO 20121 Event Sustainability Management System certification, in June 2018. ISO 20121 is an international standard designed to help organizations involved in the events and hospitality industries integrate sustainability into management practices and processes.And in December 2018, Lincoln Financial Field was awarded LEED Gold certification by the US Green Building Council.Further, Lincoln Financial Field’s microgrid of around 11,000 solar panels — the largest solar power system in the NFL and the Philadelphia area — provide more than 3MW of generating capacity. It powers around one-third of the stadium’s energy consumption annually, and the rest is offset with green energy purchases.The stadium had wind turbines for nearly a decade, but the Eagles removed them last year and are deciding whether to repair or replace them.The Eagles offset 100% of all team travel through the “Go Zero” program. Further, the installation of water filtration fountains at the team’s facilities has saved more than 174,000 water bottles since 2015.Also, the team diverts more than 99% of their waste from landfills, and two onsite bio-digesters help decompose pre-consumer food waste to eliminate the need for landfill disposal.Electrek recently reported on Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium using recyclable aluminum cups at Super Bowl LIV. The NFL is big business, and a lot of people attend those games. That’s a lot of consumption and a lot of emissions. So, in addition to green energy, we’d also really like to see EV chargers put in at Lincoln Financial Field — and all stadiums — for fans asap.The Philadelphia Eagles were ahead of their time with green energy initiatives, and continue to push for ways to reduce their consumption and carbon footprint.

2020/02/26,"JP Morgan, the world’s largest financier of the fossil-fuel industry, announced yesterday that it will end fossil-fuel loans for Arctic oil drilling and phase out loans for coal mining.Further, JP Morgan will offer $200 billion in environmental and economic development deals to help support green energy projects.JP Morgan made the announcement at an investor meeting yesterday. The announcement follows a study commissioned by JP Morgan and sent to clients — which the bank said was wholly independent from the company — that stated [via the BBC]:‘We cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened.’Carbon emissions in the coming decades ‘will continue to affect the climate for centuries to come in a way that is likely to be irreversible,’ they said, adding that climate change action should be motivated ‘by the likelihood of extreme events.’‘It is a global problem but no global solution is in sight,’ the report added.Mother Jones reported in March 2019, “By far, JPMorgan Chase is the biggest funder among the 33 banks assessed, putting $196 billion into fossil fuels from 2016 through 2018. Its money represents 10%.”Lee Raymond, JP Morgan Chase’s lead independent director, is the former CEO and Chair of ExxonMobil.According to the Guardian:JP Morgan’s coal finance restrictions will apply to companies whose primary business is coal mining, but could allow a loophole to continue financing conglomerates that earn less than half of their revenue from coal.ShareAction, which promotes responsible investing, said JP Morgan’s new policy “is at best an anticlimax and at worst dangerously omissive of a huge part of the coal market.”JP Morgan has committed to being 100% renewable by this year and has made a big push on installing onsite solar on their own buildings. It joins Goldman Sachs, whose CEO called for a price on the cost of carbon and announced the curbing of funding fossil fuels in December.But it falls short of BlackRock’s initiatives, who, as Electrek reported on January 16, “announced that it will no longer invest in thermal coal. It also said it will drop company directors who fail to act on financial risks from climate change.” BlackRock is the world’s largest investment manager.As we often say: It’s good, but it’s not good enough. JP Morgan ought to listen to the economists it commissioned whose findings couldn’t have been clearer about the gravity of our climate crisis.Photo: Bryan Parras/Sierra Club",solar

And now, Norwegian company Equinor has become the third major fossil fuel producer to abandon plans to drill for oil in the Bight.But Equinor didn’t say they pulled out for conservation reasons; the company said it was “not commercially competitive.” Unsurprisingly, they didn’t acknowledge the huge surf community protest movement to prevent the drilling from going forward.

It will be the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mining truck (pictured above). The company is modifying its fleet of existing trucks.Anglo American is partnering with Williams Advanced Engineering to supply the battery system and French multinational electric utility ENGIE, who is developing the hydrogen technology.Anglo American says this is the first time a truck of this size and load capacity has been converted to run on hydrogen.The South African reports:The FCEV haul truck will be powered by a hydrogen Fuel Cell Module paired with a scalable high-power modular lithium-ion battery system.This… is controlled by a high-voltage power distribution unit delivering in excess of 1,000kWh of energy storage.‘First motion’ of the hydrogen-powered truck is expected later in 2020, followed by a testing and validation program at Anglo American’s Mogalakwena platinum group metals mine in South Africa.Once this phase is completed, the trucks will be deployed to other Anglo American operations.Anglo American aims to reduce its emissions by 30% by 2030. This isn’t particularly ambitious, so hopefully, we’ll see Anglo American raise their bar across the board as their trucks project ramps up.Bernie Sanders’ Green New Deal initially looks expensive — $16.3 trillion — but that pales in comparison to the cost of not addressing the climate crisis.Sanders says that by working to avert climate catastrophe with the Green New Deal, the US will save $2.9 trillion over 10 years, and ultimately $70.4 trillion over the next 80 years. He says the US will lose $34.5 trillion by 2100 in economic productivity if the government does not act.Sanders’ website now includes more details on how the Green New Deal would be funded. It also states that 20 million well-paid jobs would be also be created.Here are the six sources where the money comes from, according to Sanders’ site:Raising $3.085 trillion by making the fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution, through litigation, fees, and taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies.Generating $6.4 trillion in revenue from the wholesale of energy produced by the regional Power Marketing Administrations. This revenue will be collected from 2023-2035, and after 2035 electricity will be virtually free, aside from operations and maintenance costs.Reducing defense spending by $1.215 trillion by scaling back military operations on protecting the global oil supply.Collecting $2.3 trillion in new income tax revenue from the 20 million new jobs created by the plan.Saving $1.31 trillion by reduced the need for federal and state safety net spending due to the creation of millions of good-paying, unionized jobs.Raising $2 trillion in revenue by making large corporations pay their fair share of taxes.Arizona governor Doug Ducey (R) signed House Bill 2686 into law on Friday. The new law declares that a “utility provider’s authority to operate and serve customers is a matter of statewide concern.” In other words, the new law removes the power of every town, city, and county in Arizona to choose their own energy infrastructure.Representative Jeff Weninger (R-District 17) and Southwest Gas, which provides natural gas (which is a polluting fossil fuel) to large parts of Arizona, introduced the bill.It’s a problem for towns, cities, and counties, because it prevents local areas from making decisions that are best for their own unique communities. And secondly, the best momentum for adopting green energy and reducing emissions has come from the grassroots level in the US over the last couple of years, due to complete stagnation at the federal level, and uneven activity at states’ level.As the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote on January 27 of the bill:[It] would permanently infringe on the ability of Arizonans to power their lives with electricity generated from emissions-free renewable energy and lock them into dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come. While the rest of the nation and world moves to super-efficient electric heating technologies powered by clean energy, Arizonans could be left behind if these bills become law.Sadly, it’s now a law.",solar

The new law declares that a “utility provider’s authority to operate and serve customers is a matter of statewide concern.”In other words, the new law removes the power of every town, city, and county in Arizona to choose their own energy infrastructure.Representative Jeff Weninger (R-District 17) and Southwest Gas, the Nevada gas utility that provides natural gas (which is a polluting fossil fuel) to more than 2 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in parts of Arizona, Nevada, and California.Todd Dickey, president of Arizona-headquartered VMI Holdings, wrote an op-ed in the Arizona Capitol Times about how 2686 undermines local authority:[Southwest Gas is] trying to prevent cities from changing city building codes to allow for more efficient energy standards. The gas utility obviously doesn’t like this, of course, because it may come at the expense of natural gas.These proposals are actually just a giveaway that ensures future expansion of Southwest Gas facilities and revenues, to which cities and counties cannot say no.Finally, it has come to light that Southwest Gas has been a major contributor to the same Arizona legislators sponsoring this bill. My suggestion would be that legislators listen to those of us who contribute with our votes rather than monopoly utilities that cut checks for large political donations.First, it’s a problem for town, cities, and counties, because it prevents local areas from making decisions that are best for their own unique communities. And secondly, the best momentum for adopting green energy and reducing emissions has come from the grassroots level in the US over the last couple years, due to complete stagnation at the federal level, and uneven activity — from good initiatives to some initiatives to none — at states’ level. Dickey continues:This power move would severely hinder cities’ ability to adopt building codes that save energy and water, which benefits the future of all Arizona residents.It would take away cities’ and counties’ ability to select utility services that are best for constituents and communities.A foundational principle of Arizona governments is home rule. Communities must have a right to determine how they want to proceed with the services utilities provide.In Arizona, it’s a huge setback. As I just wrote, local governments across the US are leading in the fight against climate change. This new law robs Arizonans of the right to self-determination. As the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote on January 27:The bills would prohibit local governments from adopting any ordinance, code, or land use plan that supports buildings that use only one fuel and would limit local governments’ abilities to incentivize the construction of healthier, more economic buildings via permitting processes.These dangerous bills would permanently infringe on the ability of Arizonans to power their lives with electricity generated from emissions-free renewable energy and lock them into dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come. While the rest of the nation and world moves to super-efficient electric heating technologies powered by clean energy, Arizonans could be left behind if these bills become law.Welp, it did become law, and that is a crying shame. We suspect this will be an outcome that will agitate both Republican and Democratic Arizonans. Energy efficiency is something both party members are interested in. The removal of self-determination will irritate a lot of Republicans, and the green energy setback will upset Democrats.It is absolutely wrong that a big utility’s lobbying and payoffs to legislators determined a decision that will adversely affect all Arizonans just so Southwest Gas can keep the money pouring in. Gas companies like to wrongly market their energy as “clean” — it’s a lie. Shame on the Arizona state legislature for voting this terrible bill into law.",solar
2020/02/24,"Sheffield, England, is becoming a smart city to reduce energy consumption. Infrastructure support service provider Amey is installing thousands of sensors in garbage cans, trees, and drains that will be hooked up to a network and fed into tech company Connexin’s CityOS platform.Amey operates Streets Ahead, a huge citywide highway maintenance contract. The project is upgrading and maintaining the city’s roads, sidewalks, streetlights, bridges, etc.Using the Internet of Things (IoT), Amey will use Connexin’s CityOS platform to manage and respond to information in order to improve maintenance services.Connexin’s CityOS platform, which it describes as the “operating system of a smart city,” will digitally connect highway maintenance services and report back on the condition of street assets in real time.As BIM+ explains:Sensors will be placed in public bins to determine when they need to be emptied, grit bins to signal when they need to be refilled, at the base of trees to tell when they need to be watered, and in drains to detect floods and blockages.The new smart system will also reduce air pollution because it will cut down on the number of trips city vehicles make. They can also avoid areas where air quality is poorer.Sheffield City Council councillor Mark Jones said:By investing in this new initiative, our contractors will be undertaking fewer journeys, which in turn will result in a reduction in energy consumption, pollution, and congestion, while ensuring our streets are kept clean and our bins are emptied using a more efficient and effective approach.Using technology in this pioneering way will help the council in its efforts to tackle the climate crisis while improving standards. Following installation, those who live and work in our city should see a positive impact on their neighborhoods fairly quickly.This is a super-neat initiative. It’s not only going to help the city run more efficiently with better IoT communication — particularly in light of the major flooding occurring recently in the UK (ahem, climate change) — but it’s also going to help Sheffield work toward its required net zero goals. The trees will surely benefit from the consistent care. And potholes, begone.Photo: Benjamin Elliott/Unsplash",solar

The Lone Star State leads the US with the most energy generated by wind power, and now it’s ramping up solar, which is projected to be the fastest-growing contributor to the state’s power grid in the next three years.Solar currently provides just 2.2% of energy to the Texas power grid. But according to the state grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), solar developers are expected to add 3.5GW of capacity from new utility-scale solar projects this year and 5.5GW in 2021 (via the Houston Chronicle). One gigawatt can power around 700,000 homes.That includes projects that have signed interconnection agreements with ERCOT, which means they have a high likelihood of completion. ERCOT represents 90% of the state’s electric load.Most of the planned solar projects are expected to come online before summer 2021.According to the US Energy Information Administration about Texas’ renewable energy:The state provided almost one-fifth of the total US utility-scale electricity generation from all non-hydroelectric renewable sources in 2018, more than any other state.Texas leads the nation in wind-powered electricity generation, producing more than one-fourth of the US total in 2018.The EIA also says that the sun power in western Texas gives the state some of the largest solar power potential in the nation, so it makes sense that it’s starting to utilize that potential. For example, a large solar farm was installed in late January in Andrews County in western Texas.Everything Lubbock reports:According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, in 2019, more than 3,000 megawatts of solar energy were installed, enough energy to power than 400,000 homes. Of the 750 solar companies in the state, that breaks down into 120 manufacturers and 307 installers/developers. In turn, this creates 9,600 jobs.As Electrek reported on January 10, Texas used more green energy than coal in 2019:The state sourced 21.5% of its energy from green sources (wind, solar, hydro, and biomass) and 20.3% came from coal, which is dropping rapidly across the US. However, as the Dallas Observer rightly points out, 47.3% of its energy still came from the fossil-fuel natural gas.Texas is a red state, and as Electrek previously reported, “Democrats and Republicans invest in residential solar for different reasons, yet they still invest.” Switching to green energy is a win, no matter what or why. In fact, it’s vital for the sake of our planet’s future.We look forward to Texas hopefully setting an example for all states, both red and blue, to follow. It’s pretty amazing for a state previously better known for its oil. Hopefully we’ll see fossil fuels go the way of the Houston Oilers soon.",solar

JP Morgan said that the report’s research was wholly independent from the bank.Twenty-one US agricultural groups announced the formation of Farmers for a Sustainable Future at a Capitol Hill press conference, writes Capital Press, which reports on farming, ranching, and agriculture.The coalition will serve as a resource for policymakers, the media, and the public. However, as agricultural news source the Fence Post points out:The coalition’s documents do not use the term ‘climate change,’ and a primary goal of the coalition appears to be to point out what farmers are already doing to address sustainability issues.Zippy Duvall, American Farm Bureau Federation president, said:Agriculture has a great story to tell about using technology and innovation, and the coalition is a tremendous tool to advance sustainability and climate-smart farming.It supports science-based research, resilient infrastructure, and focusing on outcomes.Farmers and ranchers have demonstrated a commitment to sustainability.The groups represent the majority of US agriculture.In 2017, the Union of Concerned Scientists defined sustainable agriculture as building and maintaining healthy soil; managing water wisely; minimizing air, water, and climate pollution; and promoting biodiversity.EV software solutions provider Electriphi has signed with the Twin Rivers Unified School District in Sacramento, California, which is the largest fleet of electric school buses in North America.San Francisco-headquartered Electriphi develops software solutions and services for EV fleet and energy management that are compatible with any charging infrastructure or vehicle type. It offers an open-standards-based charging and operations management platform that saves energy costs and simplifies the transition to EV fleets. The company yesterday announced $3.5 million in seed funding to fuel customer growth, scale its services, and enter into new markets.In 2017, Twin Rivers was the first school district in the US to deploy electric school buses. The district currently has 30 EV buses in its fleet.Tim Shannon, transportation services director of the Twin Rivers Unified School District, said:This is a significant undertaking, and we needed a trusted partner that could provide us state-of-the-art charging management and help us with data collection and monitoring. Electriphi has absolutely been that partner to us, by helping reduce operational costs and simplifying our data collection and reporting.",solar

Flooding and storms then added to the damage. Hundreds of properties are running diesel generators and face lengthy delays before normal services resume. Now, we are pulling together to rebuild.They are using large pre-assembled solar power systems and Tesla Powerwalls and deploying them in less than a day to power back local grids in bushfire communities:Here’s a little something I’ve been working on with brilliant mates at @5B_Au & @Tesla to bring power to bushfire communities v fast.

2020/02/19,"Mandy Gunasekara, the self-proclaimed “chief architect of the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord,” is tipped to replace Ryan Jackson, the EPA’s chief of staff, who will step down on February 21. (Michael Molina will be acting chief of staff.) Jackson is to become the top lobbyist for the National Mining Association (yes, really).Gunasekara served as counsel for climate-change denier Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and was then the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) top air-policy adviser. Gunasekara is also a climate-change denier. She left the EPA to start the Jackson, Mississippi-based “nonprofit educational organization” Energy45. As her simple website states, Energy45’s agenda is also simple: “Energy45 is here to defend the Trump Energy Agenda in Mississippi.”She describes herself on her site as the “chief architect of the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord and she orchestrated the repeal/replace of the Clean Power Plan.” The Clean Power Plan was the first-ever plan to curb carbon pollution from US power plants.In a subsection of her website, she writes that Trump has a  “commitment to creating an energy-dominate [sic] America.”She also states:Remarkably we have drilled our way to lower gas prices, lower unemployment, and lower emissions.One section of her website is titled “Defending the Trump Energy Agenda.” It falsely states:Under the leadership of President Trump, those shackles to our economy have been removed. Now, America is the world’s largest producer of oil and natural gas and close to being a net energy exporter for the first time in generations, while also outpacing the world in carbon reductions and leading on increasing access to clean air and water. This is America at its best.Another section of her website is called “Exposing liberal energy fantasies.” It also falsely says:Today’s Democratic party is not the party of our parents and grandparents. Led by self-avowed socialists, the Democrats have made a leftward lurch so dramatic that it would make Stalin blush. Their policies to combat climate change are nothing but a proxy for draconian government control that prohibits car ownership, kills domestic energy production, and harms low-income communities the most.According to the Washington Post, Sierra Club spokesman Adam Beitman said of this possible new role for Gunasekara:Now that Gunasekara’s efforts to try and greenhouse gaslight the country into believing that Trump is an environmentalist have failed, we’re not surprised she opted to rejoin Andrew Wheeler in attempting to roll back as many clean air, clean water, and climate protections as possible.Gunasekara’s take on the environment is bizarre, ill-informed, and divisive. And nowhere does she even mention green energy on her site (apart from bashing the Green New Deal). She only promotes fossil fuels. And this is the next chief of staff for the Environmental Protection Agency?For example, coal is dying — which Trump failed to save. The demise of coal helps to reduce emissions, not embracing oil and natural gas. And that statement about prohibiting car ownership is just bizarre. The growth of electric vehicles makes sense — that’s why so many automakers and municipal vehicles are moving in that direction — and clean public transportation is a win for everyone. Who wants bus exhaust spewed in their face, or to sit in traffic with idling, polluting cars? I didn’t realize riding bicycles and walking and EVs were “Stalinist” activities.We agree with the Sierra Club that Gunasekara will achieve further harm to the environment in a position where she is obligated to protect it. She regularly appears on Fox News spouting fossil-fuel propaganda — no wonder she’s catching Trump’s eye. The whole world knows fossil fuels need to be eliminated — even the banks. Heck, even the oil companies are beginning to (reluctantly) shift position.Gunasekara is a mouthpiece for Trump’s lonely fossil-fuel agenda. You know it’s bad when Bill Nye the Science Guy publicly questions her credentials and points out that her children will “inherit the Earth.” Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t care.Bless both their hearts. I’m happy to give @BillNye the “Science” Guy and @HardballChris  a lesson in climate 101, but something tells me they both are more interested in the TV ratings of their bogus tv shows. pic.twitter.com/FsELaWaHS9— Mandy Gunasekara (@MississippiMG) February 18, 2020Photo: Fox News",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/02/19,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Community choice aggregation (CCA) is when governments have the right to buy electricity in bulk on behalf of their residents, enabling them to focus on buying more green energy and lowering costs. The utility companies continue to manage transmission.Community choice programs often provide the same or lower rates, so few people opt-out. John Farrell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance says usually fewer than 10% of customers do, according to Yale Climate Connections.Farrell continues:And a secondary thing that is happening in most of the places where these programs are running is the purchase of more renewable energy.According to the EPA:CCAs are an attractive option for communities that want more local control over their electricity sources, more green power than is offered by the default utility, and/or lower electricity prices.CCAs are currently authorized in California, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. In 2016, community choice aggregations sold about 8.7 billion kilowatt-hours of green power to about 3.3 million customers.Many California (pictured above, with MCE and PG&E) and New York programs offer customers the opportunity to buy 100% green electricity.If you want to learn what your state is doing — or not doing — to make CCA available, have a look here. And if your state is doing nothing, then contact your representative and tell them you want it.On February 17, New England Public Radio wrote about four municipalities in Connecticut who have passed resolutions in support of CCAs, but they need authority from state lawmakers.Michael Harris, energy coordinator for the municipality of Middletown, said:The utilities have a corporate stranglehold on energy policy in the state of Connecticut. We are behind New York and Massachusetts in implementing clean energy and progressive policies, policies that could cause the utilities to lose some of their control.Ever seen the sea of plastic cups strewn all over the road after a marathon? Sustainable packaging startup Notpla has a fantastic solution to eliminating that waste: edible beverage pods.The pods were used at the London Marathon last year, filled with Lucozade, and will be used again this year on March 1. You just bite the corner off to drink the beverage inside, and if you want to eat the pod, it’s tasteless.The beverage pods are made of brown seaweed and plants, and if people decide not to eat them, they’ll biodegrade in about six weeks. They’re great for replacing plastic cups at sporting events, it’s a fun way to consume cocktails (forget those jelly shots!), and could replace plastic condiment packets that are so casually thrown by the handful into takeout bags of fast food. Further, Notpla is developing a water- and grease-proof cardboard takeaway box that is biodegradable and repulpable.Fast Company explains how the pods work:The designers used a technique from molecular gastronomy to create the package — if you dip a sphere of ice in a mixture of calcium chloride and brown algae extract, an edible membrane forms around the ice, holding everything in place as the ice melts back to room temperature. A small version of the package is designed to break open inside your mouth.So it’s not going to solve the single-use plastic problem overall, but it’s a great step to eliminate plastic in certain situations.Mandy Gunasekara, who was previously the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) top air-policy adviser, left the EPA to start the Jackson, Mississippi-based Energy 45. As her website states, the agenda is really quite simple: “Energy45 is here to defend the Trump Energy Agenda in Mississippi.”Now Ryan Jackson, the EPA’s chief of staff, is stepping down on February 21 to work as the top lobbyist for the National Mining Association (yes, really), and Gunasekara is tipped to replace him.According to the Washington Post, Sierra Club spokesman Adam Beitman said of this possible new role for Gunasekara:Now that Gunasekara’s efforts to try and greenhouse gaslight the country into believing that Trump is an environmentalist have failed, we’re not surprised she opted to rejoin Andrew Wheeler in attempting to roll back as many clean air, clean water, and climate protections as possible.Before she left the EPA, Gunasekara also urged Trump to leave the Paris Agreement. (She states that on her website, too.)Electrek’s Take: Gunasekara’s take on the environment is extremely ill-informed and not grounded in scientific fact at all. We agree with the Sierra Club that she will do nothing but further roll back more environmental and climate protections.

2020/02/18,"Electrek compiled how three environmental and political groups — The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, Build a Movement 2020, and Greenpeace — grade the presidential candidates on environmental and climate-change issues.As we previously wrote in Climate Crisis Weekly, The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication reported that among all registered voters, global warming is ranked fifth and environmental protection is ranked eighth as the “most important issue” when it comes to deciding who they’ll vote for.The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund based their final grades on averages for wildlife, public lands, environmental justice, and climate.Build a Movement 2020‘s four criteria are: Will declare a climate emergency; Commits to reach net-zero carbon by 2030 or ASAP; Commits to remove a trillion tons of CO2 by 2050; Commits to climate restoration emergency action by 2030. Their final grades are an average of the four criteria’s grades.Greenpeace based their scores on kickstarting the Green New Deal and saying no to fossil fuels — “the recipe for addressing climate change before it’s too late.”You can click on the above links for detailed explanations of their grades and findings. The candidates are listed in alphabetical order.Build a Movement 2020 isn’t impressed with any candidate, giving only a C+ as the highest grade. Its founder is Paul Zeitz, who is a senior policy adviser at the Foundation for Climate Restoration. Zeitz just feels they’re all moving too slowly. Zeitz told Fast Company that “an ‘A’ president would commit to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2030.”Tulsi Gabbard has oddly been left out by both Build a Movement 2020 and The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, but the League of Conservation Voters gave her a national environmental lifetime score of 96%, which is an A. Gabbard wants to drop fossil fuels and their subsidies, and require 100% of electricity in the US to come from green energy by 2035. She also wants zero-emissions vehicles and tax credits for green energy.Climate change and green energy are at the forefront of Sanders’ campaign; he did trailblaze with the Green New Deal, after all. So it’s unsurprising that his grades are high. Warren also has a detailed plan for a Green New Deal and says she’ll tackle the fossil fuel industry if she wins. Steyer also supports a Green New Deal and says he’ll hold the fossil-fuel industry accountable.Buttigieg and Biden both say they’ll stop fossil-fuel subsidies and have plans to reach net zero by 2050. Klobuchar also says this, but her score is impacted by a lack of a detailed plan. Buttigieg is in favor of carbon capture, so that negatively impacts his score. Greenpeace says Biden has not committed to fully ban new fossil fuel drilling on public lands and waters, nor halt federal permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure. The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund calls Biden’s track record “a mixed bag.”Michael Bloomberg supports net zero by 2050 and wants to stop fossil-fuel subsidies, but he doesn’t fully support a Green New Deal.Donald Trump, the only Republican to be graded — because the chances of former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld beating Trump in the Republican primaries are next to none — gets an F from 2 out of 3 report cards because he is a climate-change denier who subsidizes fossil fuels and shows no support for green energy, and hates wind turbines. His cabinet is full of former coal and oil lobbyists. He also pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement.Want to know where some of the Democratic candidates stand on electric vehicles?

2020/02/18,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Amazon head Jeff Bezos (pictured) — the world’s richest man — announced the $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund on Instagram (below) yesterday.The Bezos Earth Fund is an initiative to “amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change… This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.”Bezos is now worth an estimated $130 billion, and as the fund comes from Bezos’ own personal wealth, it’s unsurprising that Bezos did not mention Amazon. The Verge reports that his fund would not invest in the private sector, and instead focus on charitable giving.Quartz writes about Amazon:In a September 2019 report, the company for the first time disclosed its carbon footprint: 44.4 million metric tons in 2018. That’s larger than the estimated carbon footprint of Angola, a country of 30 million people, but less than 1% of the US’s total footprint (and less than Amazon’s chief competitor, Walmart).Amazon is aiming to reach net zero by 2040.A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)Last Thursday, a US bankruptcy judge in Delaware officially signed off on Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES)’ bankruptcy plan. This includes the sale of the company’s 1,300-acre oil refinery complex to Hilco Redevelopment Partners, a Chicago-based real estate company that turns fossil-fuel infrastructure into logistics centers, for $252 million.Laid-off refinery workers will receive $5 million in severance in the final bankruptcy plan. The plan will also pay PES executives as much as $20 million in bonuses. (Electrek‘s note: Yeah, that’s fair payout distribution — not.)Judge Kevin Gross said, according to Grist:I’m very much satisfied that the sale to Hilco is the highest bid and sale.Clearly [it] is in the best interest of the community as well, given the risks that were attended to the prior operations with the refinery, and a refinery frankly that had numerous and repeated problems over the years.The PES oil refinery exploded in June 2019. On February 6, the Environmental Integrity Project released a report that found that the PES refinery was the worst refinery in the US for releasing the highest levels of cancer-causing benzene.According to a new report published in Nature titled, “Power Generation from Ambient Humidity Using Protein Nanowires,” electrical engineer Jun Yao and microbiologist Derek Lovley at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have created the “Air-gen,” which connects electrodes to electrically conductive protein nanowires so that electrical current is generated from the water vapor present in the atmosphere.Yao says:We are literally making electricity out of thin air. The Air-gen generates clean energy 24/7.Lovley adds:It’s the most amazing and exciting application of protein nanowires yet.UMass reports:The new technology developed in Yao’s lab is non-polluting, renewable, and low-cost. It can generate power even in areas with extremely low humidity such as the Sahara Desert. It has significant advantages over other forms of renewable energy including solar and wind, Lovley says, because unlike these other renewable energy sources, the Air-gen does not require sunlight or wind, and ‘it even works indoors.’To read the scientific detail of how the Air-gen works, click here.",solar

Their primary school, as well as a middle and high school, make up the campus.The system will go live next month, and the campus will have enough energy to cover about 85% of the district’s power needs and save about $90,000 a year.According to the suburban Chicago paper the Daily Herald, there are 952 solar panels on the west side of the campus and 3,774 modules on the east side. They’ll produce nearly 2.1 million kWh of electricity each year.The then fourth-grade students presented their project to the school board.

The storm caused flooding, power outages, downed trees, damage to houses, and travel disruption. It also broke wind power records.The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) reports that the Britain set a new daily record for wind energy, topping 44% of the country’s electricity consumption. This was greater than nuclear and gas combined.And at one point during the stormy weekend, in the early hours of Saturday February 8, wind electricity supply hit 56%.The IEEFA says:The UK has 13.57GW of onshore wind installed, and a world-leading 8.4GW offshore fleet.The two are currently on very different trajectories, with onshore installations plunging as a result of adverse government policies, while offshore is booming after being included as a key part of the national industrial strategy.For perspective, wind energy provided about 19% of Britain’s electricity in 2019, a third consecutive annual record.The UK got punched again by Storm Dennis less than a week after Ciara, so expect more record wind power figures.The Big Hollow District 38 campus in Ingleside, Illinois, which is made up of an elementary, middle, and high school, now has enough energy to cover about 85% of the district’s power needs and save about $90,000 a year, according to the suburban Chicago paper the Daily Herald.

And the Central American country aims to be 100% carbon neutral by 2021 — much sooner than most other countries.Costa Rican president President Carlos Alvarado Quesada details the progress Costa Rica has made in the World Economic Forum video below, and what they intend to do next to keep reducing emissions and cleaning up their environment.https://youtu.be/RoniwU01xPwOne area of room for improvement: plastics consumption and disposal. Costa Rica generates “400 tons of plastic waste per day — much of which goes to rivers and seas,” according to the Tico Times. The country passed a law in November that only banned plastic straws. The law ended the purchase of single-use plastics throughout the public sector and avoids delivering bags to final consumers unless they are biodegradable or have 50% recycled material. It was referred to by environmental groups as “watered down” because it doesn’t ban single-use plastics entirely.Why the weak law? The plastics sector employs 14,000 people in Costa Rica, a country with a population of 4.9 million.Angelina, an American and 12-year resident of Costa Rica who recently returned to the US, told me yesterday that plastic litter — and plastic burning — in Costa Rica is a pervasive problem. So while Costa Rica is to be applauded and emulated for its green energy initiatives — as of this month, the country had 300 days of using only green energy — they’ll have to get more aggressive with reducing plastic litter and production.Photo: Paul Ellis/AFP",solar
2020/02/14,"The Wyoming legislature proposed a bill this week that would have penalized — yes, penalized — utility companies for using green energy to supply electricity to customers. Fortunately, the bill didn’t receive sufficient votes to advance.Senate File 125, “Electricity Production Standard,” stated that energy utilities must provide 95% of their electricity from a list of energy sources that included coal, oil, and natural gas by 2021, and 100% percent by 2022. Wind and solar power were not on the list.Amazingly, the bill also stated that if utilities sourced energy from sustainable sources, they would be penalized with a fine for each megawatt of green energy.The House Appropriations Committee also introduced a bill to impose a $1-per-MW-hour excise tax on electricity produced from solar sources this week.According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of October 2019, Wyoming’s net electricity generation by source was as follows:In 2017, Wyoming generated 86% of its electricity from coal and 9% from wind, according to the New York Times. Because of its small population — 577,737 as of 2018 — Wyoming produces much more power than it consumes and sends about 60% to nearby states.But in October, the state’s largest utility company, PacifiCorp, said it plans to retire two-thirds of its coal fleet by 2030.Wyoming is a fossil-fuel bonanza: According to the EIA, it produced about 40% of all coal mined in the US in 2017, and has about one-third of US coal reserves. It’s one of the top 10 natural gas-producing states, and its natural gas reserves are among the top five states. Wyoming is the sixth largest crude oil producer in the nation, accounting for just over 2% of the U.S. total crude oil output.However, Wyoming’s installed wind-powered electricity generating capacity ranked 16th in the US in 2017 at nearly 1,500MW, so it’s strange that the pro-fossil-fuel bill left wind out of the equation entirely.The Casper Star Tribune spoke with University of Wyoming economist Rob Godby about why a such an anti-renewable energy bill would even be introduced. Godby said:We are now looking at significant disruption of local communities based on coal-fired power plant closures.To be honest, the state of Wyoming was kind of caught flat-footed when those closures were announced. It just hadn’t been something that had ever been imagined here.If you’re going to impose that kind of tax on [renewable] producers in Wyoming, it’s very likely that most of that cost will fall on the people of Wyoming. A lot of people don’t believe that renewables are as cheap as they are, that gas is actually cheaper than coal and coal is, relatively speaking, expensive to run.Wyoming has got all its power-generation eggs in one dirty basket, and there’s trouble ahead. The fossil-fuel bill that seems crazy, which fortunately failed, actually reeks of desperation, once you realize how heavily dependent the state is on coal.It’s pretty baffling if what Godby says is true. Have Wyoming legislators seriously not noticed the general collapse of the coal industry and the global movement away from fossil fuels? (Maybe they ought to read the Atlantic‘s “Coal Country’s Decline Has a Long History” — from 2013.) Like much of the West and Midwest, the state has great potential for both wind and solar energy. Why wouldn’t they work to boost that potential, rather than penalize it?Further, Wyoming is a big state with a very small population, but their coal output is still doing damage beyond its borders.According to a new study by MIT researchers published in Nature, half of pollution deaths in the US occur in states where the pollution didn’t start. Wyoming is the No. 1 offender of most consistently producing pollution that affected the health of those in other states. So what Wyoming is doing is very much everyone else’s business, and other states need to stop sourcing coal from Wyoming.Wyoming legislators need to get their heads out of the sand and move forward, or they’re going to end up with a decimated job market, a depleted energy economy, and just generally in a bit of a mess due to overdependence on dirty coal.Hey, Texas, you’re No. 1 in the nation for wind power, and California, you’re No. 1 for solar. Can you two take a little trip to Wyoming and teach them how to do it? Because coal is a lost cause, and Wyoming is headed toward becoming a dinosaur when it comes to energy production — or one could say, a fossil.Photo: ribarnica/flickr",solar
2020/02/14,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Delta Airlines is the world’s biggest airline by revenue. The airline announced today that it will be spending $1 billion to purchase carbon offsets over the next 10 years. Carbon offsetting is when a company pays to reduce global emissions instead of making reductions of its own.As Axios explains:Virtually all airlines rely on carbon offsets to cut their emissions. That’s because no commercially available technology exists to affordably make large quantities of low-carbon or zero-carbon jet fuel, whether battery-powered or another kind of liquid like biofuels.The quality of offsets also faces scrutiny. Doubt persists about whether offsets purchased actually reduce emissions and don’t just throw money at projects, such as planting trees or building a wind farm, that would have happened regardless.According to a September study from the International Council on Clean Transportation, Delta ranked eighth in energy efficiency out of 11 US domestic airlines. This is due to its older fleet, and the company is apparently in the process of replacing them. (JetBlue came in last in that study, but it announced on January 6 that it’s going to become carbon neutral by July with carbon offsetting.)There is not yet an industry-wide standard for offsetting carbon emissions, but the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working on one.Electrek’s Take: Let’s hope the ICAO works quickly, as carbon offsetting is presently pretty vague. Aviation emissions are worsening and currently represent around 2.5% of global emissions.It may not be spinning straw into gold, but it’s still pretty darned good. Egypt is going to build a $230 million factory in Beheira Province in the Nile delta that will produce 205,000 square meters of medium-density fiberboard (MDF) a year out of rice straw. MDF is normally made out of waste wood fiber.The plan was signed and announced yesterday by German engineering firm Siempelkamp, and Wotech, a new Egyptian government-owned wood technology company.Rice-straw MDF uses a resin that contains no formaldehyde, a carcinogenic. Further, using rice straw to make MDF will reduce air pollution, as burning rice straw is a significant contributor to pollution in the north African country.The factory’s MDF will be used for furniture, construction, and decoration.The factory will be the second of its kind in the world. The first, CalPlant 1, is near Sacramento, California, and is expected to have MDF panels ready in first quarter of this year.Photo: Burning rice straw in EgyptJapan’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm project has reached financial close.

It will commence construction in February 2020 and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2022.According to Global Construction Review, it’s “the first commercial-scale Japanese offshore wind farm to secure non-recourse debt financing from a syndicate of Japanese lenders.”The project’s technical adviser is Mott MacDonald, and Isao Terasawa, the company’s Japan business development manager, said:This project is a great achievement and first for Japan — and with participation of local stakeholders, it paves the way for development of the Japanese offshore wind industry supply chain. We were able to transfer and apply best practice and knowledge from our European and global offshore wind projects into the procurement and due diligence process, which will serve as a benchmark for future in-country projects.Photo: Miguel Ángel Sanz/Unsplash",solar
2020/02/13,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Greenhouses, especially large-scale greenhouses, require energy to keep them at an ideal temperature to prolong the growing season, and that costs money. But greenhouses are effective for agriculture because, among other reasons, the need for pesticides is low as they’re closed, and water use is often lower due to lack of evaporation and runoff.A new study released by engineering, plant biology, and physics researchers at North Carolina State University reports that greenhouses could become net zero in some climates by using semitransparent organic solar cells made of plastics to harvest energy, thus furthering eco-friendly agriculture.Brendan O’Connor, one of the study’s authors, said:Plants only use some wavelengths of light for photosynthesis, and the idea is to create greenhouses that make energy from that unused light while allowing most of the photosynthetic band of light to pass through.A semitransparent solar panel can let particular wavelengths of light into a greenhouse that plants need, and they’re thin and lightweight. They reflect infrared light, so they help keep greenhouses cooler in the summer and warmer in winter. However, they’re not as efficient as silicon solar cells and have a shorter lifespan, so more improvement is needed.The study was conducted in greenhouses in which tomatoes were grown in Arizona, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.In Arizona, the solar greenhouses could be energy neutral while only blocking 10% of the sun that the plants need. In North Carolina, the greenhouse would block 20% of the sun to be energy-neutral. In Wisconsin, greenhouses could not achieve zero-energy use, but could still cut a greenhouse’s energy bills in half.Embedded photo: North Carolina State UniversityThe $2.8 billion, 800MW, 84-turbine Vineyard Wind, the first large-scale US offshore wind farm, is delayed again due to federal infighting. It is expected to be sited around 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard and 35 miles off mainland Massachusetts.The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management was supposed to make a decision in August last year, but it delayed a ruling amid reports of ongoing concerns from NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service. Reuters reported on the two departments’ disagreements in July 2019, and they clearly have not yet resolved their differences.Vineyard Wind intended to start construction in 2019 and have the wind farm online by 2022. The new deadline for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is December 18, 2020, and final permits for the project are now expected to be issued by mid-March 2021.On Tuesday, Lars Pedersen, CEO of Vineyard Wind, said:We have received updated information from the Department of Interior that indicates the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Vineyard Wind I project will be published later than what was previously anticipated.While we need to analyze what a longer permitting timeline will mean for beginning construction, commercial operation in 2022 is no longer expected. We look forward to the clarity that will come with a final EIS so that Vineyard Wind can deliver this project to Massachusetts and kick off the new US offshore energy industry.US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Greg Walden (R-OR) introduced climate-change legislative proposals yesterday in an attempt to shift the Republican party’s message on climate change from nothing to something.The Republican’s four bills encourage planting trees, providing a tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration, and want to fund research and development of carbon capture and utilization technology.They propose no targets — either with dates or quantities — for reducing emissions. Neither do they propose incentives for green energy, or reductions in subsidies for fossil fuels.The Republican Party is discovering that the general public  — to include Republicans — actually cares about climate change, and that’s a serious conundrum for the party of climate-change denial and fossil-fuel supporters, led by a president who hates wind turbines.You can read Electrek‘s take on these bills here.Main photo: Abigail Lynn/Unsplash",solar
2020/02/12,"US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) (pictured, with Donald Trump) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Greg Walden (R-OR) introduced climate-change legislative proposals today in an attempt to shift the Republican party’s message on climate change from nothing to something.The Republicans said they will introduce additional legislation in the near future dealing with clean energy and conservation.The Republican’s bills encourage planting trees, providing a tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration, and want to fund research and development of carbon capture and utilization technology.Bruce Westerman (R-AK)’s tree-planting bill would see the US plant some 3.3 billion trees each year over the next 30 years. Donald Trump backs this bill.David McKinley (R-WV)’s Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Innovation Act wants to advance carbon utilization and direct air capture technology.David Schweikert (R-AZ) and Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) introduced a bill that would cancel the 2024 sunset date for 45Q carbon capture tax credit eligibility and allow more projects to be able to claim the incentive. Carbon capture is a natural or artificial process by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and held in solid or liquid form.Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) is leading a bill on carbon capture research and development.The Republicans propose no targets — either with dates or quantities — for reducing emissions.And yet, despite McCarthy’s endorsement, E&E News reports that a senior Republican aide said:This plan may have the support of the individuals in the room, including the leader, but it’s not something that has earned the support of the broader conference, and a number of members have concerns about some of the pieces of legislation in the package.The conservative Club for Growth PAC called the plan “liberal environmental policies.”The Republican Party is discovering that the general public  — even Republicans themselves — actually cares about climate change, and that’s a serious conundrum for the party of climate-change denial and fossil-fuel supporters, led by a president who hates wind turbines.According to Mother Jones:The American Conservation Coalition, a group representing younger conservatives, has done its own polling of 1,000 voters nationwide under age 35 — 77% of whom said climate change was important to them and that they want to see more solutions from their party.As I asked about Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech just four days ago — which words are missing from today’s announcement?Green energy. Renewables. Solar. Wind. Electric vehicles.And it’s no accident that Trump has budgeted for Everglades conservation in Florida — it’s a purple state, and this is an election year. (44% of Republican Floridians are concerned about climate change.)What the House Republicans are proposing instead are tax credits for the fossil-fuel industry — more tax credits. So that is an active endorsement of continuing to support fossil fuels.Essentially, they’re saying: “OK, we begrudgingly admit you’re polluting the Earth and driving us toward climate change, but keep doing what you’re doing and just figure out a way to stash your mess. Here’s some money.”If you make a mess, you should clean it up. Why would you pay polluters to clean up their own mess? They should pay for it themselves.The way to incentivize carbon capture and sequestration is to disincentivize carbon — by putting a price on emissions. And where are incentives for the green energy, which was never even mentioned?As for the trees, here’s what Center for American Progress senior policy analyst Ryan Richards had to say, according to Mother Jones:The same man who is proposing to cut down the Tongass National Forest [in Alaska] wants to plant a trillion trees. He can’t have it both ways.Photo: Andrew Harnik",solar

Their methods are a bit vague at this stage (i.e., the plan doesn’t state that they will move away from fossil fuels), but here are the five points the company lists that they say will help them achieve zero emissions:Net zero across BP’s operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.Net zero on carbon in BP’s oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.50% cut in the carbon intensity of products BP sells by 2050 or sooner.Install methane measurement at all BP’s major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and reduce methane intensity of operations by 50%.Increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time.The company also said it would restructure, and would also advocate for carbon pricing, as part of the five aims to help the world get to carbon zero. (You can see those here.) BP will host a capital markets day in September to set out its strategy and near-term plans.BP’s brand-new CEO Bernard Looney said:The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it.This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change — this is the right thing for the world and for BP.Looney, according to BP, encouraged the company to lead the industry on methane detection methods as Upstream CEO. He was also responsible for all BP-operated oil and gas production worldwide and for all of BP’s drilling.[Electrek‘s take: “Increasing the proportion” of non-oil and gas businesses over time isn’t good enough. BP has to pledge to commit to drop fossil fuels entirely and immediately.]How do BP get to 'net zero' without:– Stopping drilling for NEW oil and gas– Reducing the oil and gas from their existing oil and gas wellsThese are the questions @BP_plc's Bernard Looney brushed over today.#ClimateEmergency pic.twitter.com/sYaF7J4Vho— Greenpeace UK (@GreenpeaceUK) February 12, 2020Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) introduced the Clean Economy Act of 2020 yesterday.

And according to Senator Patrick Leahy’s (D-VT) website:The bill would also promote American competitiveness and healthier communities, while fostering a fair and growing economy.The bill is co-sponsored by one-third of the Senate — all Democrats — with the exception of independent Angus King of Maine.The bill aims to do this by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (but not limited to):Low- and zero-greenhouse gas electricity, transportation, and building technologies.Methane capture and destruction technologies.Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies and practices, including direct air capture to prevent domestic carbon leakage.Maximize flexibility in reducing greenhouse gas emissions for entities subject to regulation under this section.Minimize costs of greenhouse-gas emission reductions to consumers, particularly consumers from low-income householdsThe Virginia House and Senate passed sweeping green energy legislation yesterday that overhauls how Virginia’s utilities generate electricity moves the state to focus on sustainable energy policy.Like the US Senate’s bill, it’s also called The Clean Economy Act. It lays out a plan to get Virginia to 100% green energy. The House version wants the deadline to be 2045, and the Senate wants 2050. They’ll have to resolve the deadline difference before it heads to Democratic Governor Ralph Northam.AP explains what the plan is:The legislation paves the way for an enormous expansion of solar and offshore wind generation plus battery storage , and sets an energy efficiency standard that utilities must meet. It also includes language that would add Virginia to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program.Both the House and Senate versions would effectively block new fossil fuel generation facilities in the short term while state officials study whether a permanent ban should be enacted.The bill allows for the development of up to 5,200MW of offshore wind.The Senate sponsor of the bill, Jennifer McClellan, said:We have got to do something to break our dependence on energy that is destroying our planet.

2020/02/11,"Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) introduced the Clean Economy Act of 2020 today.

Future generations will surely judge us by how we choose to meet this challenge. The Clean Economy Act recognizes the reality that climate action is both a necessity and an economic opportunity.Senator Angus King (I-ME), a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and and a founding member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, said:Climate change is the most pressing existential threat we face — but it is also an opportunity for America to lead the way into the economy of the future.We don’t have to choose between a thriving economy or a healthy environment — we can have both, if we’re ready to do the work.I phoned the office of Senator Mike Braun (R-IN), who cofounded the first-ever bipartisan caucus dedicated to climate solutions in the Senate, and emailed the office of Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who also belongs to the climate caucus. I asked Braun’s staffer why Braun didn’t sign on to support the Clean Economy Act. His staffer replied, “That’s a good question,” and said he would find out and reply, but I didn’t hear back from Braun’s office. I also got no reply from Murkowski’s office. If I hear from either, I will update this story.The bill aims to reach net zero by 2050 by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (but not limited to):Here’s what some of the environmental groups had to say about the Clean Economy Act.Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:The challenges ahead are daunting — but we can overcome them. This bill will help jumpstart a breakthrough on climate action. It will cut dangerous carbon pollution and steer us toward cleaner, smarter energy sources — sending a message that the Senate backs a strong national response to a global threat. It will help us build the better future our children deserve.Elizabeth Gore, senior vice president of political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, said:By uniting support behind the strong emission reduction target of net-zero climate pollution by 2050, we can increase clean energy development, enhance domestic job creation, advance critical technology innovation, and protect public health.Food & Water Watch‘s action policy director Mitch Jones was a bit more pointed, specifically about fossil fuels:We have to move off fossil fuels now. Any climate proposal that does not explicitly stop the extraction of fossil fuels is not a serious climate proposal. Our first step must be to ban fracking, ban exports and imports of fossil fuels, and stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure. Anything less threatens future generations with an uninhabitable planet.Congress must step up to their responsibility to pass comprehensive climate legislation that is focused on ending the emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. This legislation fails woefully at meeting that responsibility.We’re delighted to see this bill be introduced into the Senate, but will it go anywhere?

2020/02/11,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The 140,000-acre Silvies Valley Ranch, formerly a dude ranch outside of Burns, Oregon, is an eco-friendly ranch and luxury resort. Visitors and homeowners don’t use ICE vehicles. Instead, they’re given electric golf carts to drive. The development also uses a graywater system, sustainable materials, and a native plant landscape.Silvies Valley Ranch is developing 600 homes that will be between 2,000 to 6,000 square feet each. They will be built in three phases of 200 homes (pictured) over the next two to three years.Each home will feature Humless solar off-grid microgrids. That’s because it’s cheaper than paying the utility company $7 million to run lines to the development.The solar off-grid microgrid systems will consist of solar panels on each home coupled with a Humless Universal System, a battery system of anywhere from 30-70kWh, depending on the home’s size.Microgrid Systems explains how the solar off-grid microgrids work:The Humless system is unique, the company says, because it has the ability to be both AC and DC coupling simultaneously. AC and DC coupling is related to how the PV panels are connected to the system. Most DC panels are connected through an AC inverter, the company says. Smaller off-grid solar and storage systems generally are DC coupled because DC systems are simpler to build and are less expensive. Typically home and business solar systems are DC connected. But AC-coupled systems allow energy to be used more efficiently, the company says.Eric Lobdell, VP of business development for Humless, said:You can get more benefit from the homeowners’ solar panels by keeping them turned on, creating a family home microgrid. Panels charge the energy storage system for when they need it most.The US Department of Justice has dropped its investigation into Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW for antitrust practices. The four automakers sided with the state of California to implement stricter emissions standards for cars and light trucks than the Trump administration wants.As Electrek has previously reported:Since the 1970s, California has held (and legally defended) a waiver through the Clean Air Act that allows them to set stronger standards than the federal government.This waiver has been responsible for a tremendous improvement in air quality in California’s population centers, including a 98% reduction in some vehicle-based pollutants in the LA basin. It has been so successful that other states [13] representing a huge chunk of the US auto market have joined in.Those 14 states account for around 40% of the US population.So why did the DOJ drop the investigation? Because the four automakers weren’t actually violating any laws. They were self-regulating — exactly what Republicans claim they wanted all along.California Governor Gavin Newsom said:These trumped-up charges were always a sham — a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to prevent more automakers from joining California and agreeing to stronger emissions standards. [The decision is] a victory for anyone who cares about the rule of law and clean air.Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti signed an executive directive yesterday called “LA’s Green New Deal: Leading By Example.” The theme of the signing was “A Decade of Action,” referring to scientific reports that the use of fossil fuels need to be ceased by 2030.The directive aims to remove non-green energy from the city’s main sources of CO2 emissions, which include transport, buildings, electricity, and trash.According to the City of Los Angeles, the “Decade of Action” includes the following:Photo: Humless",solar
2020/02/10,"Donald Trump proposed a $4.8 trillion budget plan today that proposes cuts to several programs, including a 26% reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Trump’s proposal would eliminate 50 EPA programs and cut the research and development budget from $500 million to $281 million.The Energy Star program, which measures the efficiency of electronics and appliances, would also lose its funding. The program would instead rely on businesses to pay a fee to participate in the program.Further, Trump’s budget request proposes reducing the Department of Energy’s spending by 8% and the Department of the Interior’s budget by 16%.Touting his upcoming budget proposal, Trump says, ""We're doing a lot of things that are good including waste and fraud. Tremendous waste and tremendous fraud."" pic.twitter.com/nQbTNJPbFG— Oliver Willis (@owillis) February 10, 2020As Congress has consistently done in the past, they are expected to ignore Trump’s budget request when it comes to environmental issues.The budget has little chance of passing in the Democratic-majority House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in a statement last night:The budget is a statement of values and once again the president is showing just how little he values the good health, financial security, and well-being of hard-working American families.Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said:Congress should toss this Trump budget into the dustbin of history like they’ve done with the other ones. This president is putting our families and communities at risk by taking direct aim at the environment, public health, and energy innovation. It is unconscionable to take such drastic cuts to EPA, the Energy Department, and other agencies that keep us safe, protect our kids, and grow our clean energy economy. At a time when we’re only seeing greater risks from climate change, these agencies deserve to be fully funded by Congress.The Hill pointed out some interesting election-year antics on the Trump administration’s part:The proposal would cut funding for a number of waterway protection projects in blue states like Maryland, New York, and Washington. Projects in swing states like the Great Lakes region and Florida’s Everglades would be fully funded.So, swing states get environmental protection and clean-up, blue states don’t. Trump knows concern about the Everglades is bipartisan in Florida, for example. Talk about putting politics before economy, social needs, or the environment. He’s definitely learned his lesson. Right, Susan Collins?As we at Electrek just agreed in a group discussion, the EPA has actually become the EDA — the Environmental Destruction Agency, of late, first under ethics-scandal-plagued Scott Pruitt, and then under former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler. And the Energy and Interior departments aren’t any better lately, with their aggressive fossil-fuel agendas. Gina McCarthy is right: These agencies are supposed to keep us safe. But they’re not doing that.So, acknowledging that what I’m about to say is rather bizarre, is it really so bad to defund them when they’re doing more harm than good these days?",solar

In January 2019, there were 2,680 passenger EV registrations, or 12.7% of the market. In January 2020, there were 5,382 registrations, or 30.3% of the market.Meanwhile, ICE cars have dropped:There’s a new incentive system in Sweden, as CleanTechnica explains:Vehicles with CO2 emissions from zero to 70 g/km can receive a sliding scale of up to ~€5,700 in incentives in Sweden, and vehicles with emissions above 95 g/km pay additional yearly taxes.

2020/02/10,"The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released its “Annual Energy Outlook 2020” report.Policy analysts Rachel Fakhry and Robert Harding of the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote an expert blog on Friday that summarized the report’s findings.Fakhry and Harding helpfully remind us:The Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) is a projection of the future energy economy based on what’s true today. It relies on existing policies and current technology cost and performance projections to predict emissions and consumption trends in the energy sector. The AEO projections are significant as they are heavily relied upon as a key reference point for numerous energy and policy analyses.The report is packed with a lot of information, but here are the EIA’s main projections for the US energy sector:Transportation and buildings need to get on the bandwagon, and, for example, follow New York City’s lead. The NRDC offers up these solutions, which Electrek backs completely:Enact policies that promote construction of net-zero emissions buildings, more electric vehicles, acceleration of clean energy resources, and retirement of dirty fossil plants.Those solutions are mostly at a big-picture policy level. These challenges may seem overwhelming for individuals who ask:This is bigger than me. How is it even possible to do anything to help reduce emissions and slow climate change? It feels hopeless.The good news is, you can make changes, and small changes from individuals add up.Your country needs you.I myself am making continuous changes as I learn more, and I then share information with you. Here are some things you can do, and these suggestions are by no means exhaustive:Energy efficiency: Use LED bulbs (there are even light bulbs that still work if the power goes out), insulate your attics well, install more energy-efficient windows, and keep your heat down in the winter and your air conditioning a bit higher in the summer. Heck, turn the water off when you’re brushing your teeth. If you’re not watching TV, turn it off — same goes with lights.Consumption: Make food shopping lists to cut down on food waste, and eat less meat. Don’t buy clothes you don’t need, and if you do need something, check out the charity shops. And ditch the single-use plastics — take your own bags to the supermarket, and pick up your produce loose or in paper, if necessary. If you forget your bags, ask for paper. No more plastic plates, cups, and forks. If the Super Bowl can do it, so can you. And recycle the right way. Recycling reform is needed in the US, but in the meantime, do your part.Home/apartment energy: Switch from gas to electricity if you own your home. I switched from a gas stove to an electric stove, and a gas tankless water heater to an electric tankless water heater. Guess what? My electric bill stayed about the same, because my appliances are efficient. We also use an electric lawnmower, and heat our pool with solar (yes, a pool is a big privilege, and I keep my house temperature warmer in the summer). Choose energy-efficient appliances — contrary to dishwasher propaganda, they work just fine. I used them for years in the UK, and use them now. We are actively working on having solar panels installed, but in the meantime, we source our electricity from Arcadia Power, which is powered by green energy. It took me five minutes to sign up.Transport: If you read Electrek (which you clearly do, because here you are), you’ll know the leaps and bounds the electric vehicle industry is making. Learn all you can, and if it’s time to buy a new (or used) car, then purchase an electric vehicle. I’ve never met a person who regretted switching to an EV. If you aren’t in a position to buy one, then consider an e-bike, e-scooter, or e-motorcycle, or simply ride a bicycle… or walk. If you have to commute to work in an ICE vehicle, then carpool. Work from home if possible.Bonus: You’ll save money by doing these things. The planet, and your wallet, will thank you.If you have further suggestions for individuals to switch to green energy, adopt more eco-friendly habits, and help the environment, please leave them in the comments section below!",solar
2020/02/07,"New York City mayor Bill de Blasio delivered his seventh State of the City Address on Thursday. A central focus of his plan was tackling climate change with major new green energy initiatives.De Blasio unveiled the following proposal, called “Save Our Future,” as part of his 2020 agenda, according to the City of New York’s website:Climate change is real. And if we don’t act now, our kids will grow up in a world that’s less livable and more dangerous. We are launching a second wave of the Green New Deal that will green our energy, cut vehicle emissions, and ban more wasteful plastics — all so the nation’s largest city can become carbon neutral. We will:Investment in wind: To accelerate the growth of off-shore wind, with our New York State and Empire Wind partners, we will equip the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park as a new hub for staging, installing and operating turbines across the tri-state area. We’ll create 500 green jobs and support clean wind power that would reduce emissions equivalent to taking 200,000 cars off the road.Double solar power: New York City will launch a new program to defray upfront costs of solar power, letting homeowners pay for them over years out of the savings on their energy bills. We will help install solar panels on 50,000 one-to-four family homes, doubling the amount of solar power produced in New York City and creating 5,000 green jobs.Bring hydro to New York City: This year, we will secure an agreement to bring more zero-emission hydropower to New York City by 2025, which will help run City government operations on 100 percent renewable energy.End unnecessary single-use plastic bottles: Through an Executive Order, New York City government will end the purchase of unnecessary single-use plastic bottles and restrict the sale of single-use plastic bottles (21 fluid ounces or less) on City property by 2021.Make ALL city vehicles electric: The mayor will issue an executive order to have all on-road vehicles in the fleet be plug-in electric by 2040. By 2025, 4,000 vehicles will be replaced or converted to electric, and by 2040, we will work to make the entire city fleet — every garbage truck, every ferry, every ambulance and every police cruiser — fully electric. The first electric school buses will hit the streets this year.End the use of fossil fuels, including natural gas: By 2040, we still stop using natural gas and other fossil fuels in large building systems in New York City, starting in government buildings. We will work with lawmakers to ensure that new permits for building systems are aligned with our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.Stop new fossil fuel infrastructure: We’re not just divesting billions from coal and oil companies — we will stop any new infrastructure, such as power plant expansions, pipelines, or terminals that expands the supply of fossil fuels in our city. We will issue an executive order codifying this policy.New York City passed its first Green New Deal in April 2019. Like so many other US cities, New York has bypassed the federal government’s lack of initiative to forge ahead at the local level with their own plans to cut emissions and pollution.Last year’s bill kept New York City in line with the Paris Agreement, and particularly noteworthy was the Dirty Buildings Bill. Grist explained the bill:It requires around 50,000 of the city’s buildings to cut emissions by 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050 by installing new windows, insulation, and other retrofits to become more energy efficient. The legislation targets buildings over 25,000 square feet, which make up just 2% of the city’s real estate but account for about half of all building emissions. If landlords fail to meet targets, they will be forced to pay a fine of up to millions of dollars per year.One of those buildings? Trump Tower.Unsurprisingly, buildings cause 70% of emissions in the Big Apple. Also unsurprisingly, the real estate industry fought the Dirty Buildings Bill, but the city prevailed.New York is geographically vulnerable to climate change. Last year’s initiative, and then the follow-up plan yesterday, was not just the right thing to do — it’s the only thing to do to protect the city and the environment.Main photo: Allie Smith/Unsplash; De Blasio: City of New York",solar

He made the announcement in his annual State of the City address on Thursday.This will include every garbage truck, ferry, ambulance, police cruiser, bus, car, and vehicle owned and operated by municipal agencies.The New York Daily News reports:There are 25,104 on-road vehicles in the fleet now, [and] just 8.5% or 2,134 are electric. The city also has 5,613 off-road vehicles like carts and light towers, and about 10% or 548 of them are electric.The mayor’s office expects to see a 50% reduction in emissions from the fleet by 2025. The effort will cost $36 million next fiscal year and the city is assessing the price tag going forward.De Blasio said:To address our climate crisis, New York City needs to stop burning fossil fuels and electrify everything. That’s why we’re making our entire fleet electric by 2040 — the equivalent of taking 750,000 cars off the street.Andy Levin (D-MI) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) introduced the Electric Vehicle Freedom Act in the US House of Representatives on Thursday. The legislation would create a network of high-speed charging stations in the US national highway system within five years.Levin’s and Ocasio-Cortez’s bill also proposes that those working on the network have jobs that pay well and follow “buy American” requirements, that the chargers are fast, that it would promote compatibility between chargers and cars, and that it’s Americans with Disabilities compliant.Ocasio-Cortez said:We’re trying to actually advance and improve our fleets and our vehicles, which means that we have to go electric and the way that we do that is with a public infrastructure.Further, a separate bill was introduced this week by Yvette Clarke (D-NY) and others that proposes increasing EV charging stations in underserved communities.An Atlantic storm named Ciara is headed for Europe this weekend, and while it may wreak some havoc in the form of power outages and travel disruption, there’s a silver lining: It’s expected to result in record wind power in the UK on Saturday and Germany on Sunday.In the UK, winds could reach up to 80 mph between 6 p.m. on Saturday and midnight on Sunday. Northern parts of mainland Europe will have strong winds, potentially including parts of northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, northern Germany, and Denmark.When it comes to wind power, Bloomberg Green explains:Wind provided about 19% of Britain’s electricity in 2019, a third consecutive annual record.The UK’s previous record was set on January 7 when output peaked at 13,761 megawatts, according to grid data.

This surface not only enhances the energy absorption from sunlight but also reduces heat dissipation at other wavelengths.Professor Chunlei Guo, professor of optics and an author of the paper, says that it makes “a perfect metallic solar absorber for the first time. We also demonstrate solar energy harnessing with a thermal electric generator device. This will be useful for any thermal solar energy absorber or harvesting device.”The work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Army Research Office, and the National Science Foundation.You can learn more about this project in the below video:Northern Powergrid, which distributes electricity in Northeast England, Yorkshire, and northernLincolnshire to 3.9 million homes and businesses, has launched AutoDesign.

Paradise was one of TVA’s biggest coal plants.The TVA was created during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal in 1933 to bring power and economic development to one of the areas of the US hit hardest by the Great Depression.Despite objections to the closure from Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Donald Trump, the TVA board voted in February 2019 to halt the last Paradise unit, along with the Bull Run Steam Plant near Oak Ridge by 2023.TVA spokesman Jim Hopson told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that “TVA has expanded its nuclear generation for its baseload capacity, and gas and renewable sources are better suited and cheaper for meeting power peaks.”TVA has already shut down a majority of the 59 coal-fired units it once operated, cutting the share of its power generated by burning coal from nearly two-thirds of TVA’s generation in the 1980s to 17% of TVA’s generation in fiscal 2019, Hopson said.TVA continues to operate nine coal-fired units.In September 2019, TVA, the US Department of the Navy, Silicon Ranch, and the East Mississippi Electric Power Association brought a new 6MW solar facility at the Naval Air Station in Meridian, Mississippi, online.And two weeks ago, Vanderbilt University committed to a green energy partnership with TVA and Nashville Electric Service for offsite solar. Vanderbilt’s goal is to be carbon neutral by 2050.Vanderbilt’s new solar farm will supply up to 35 megawatts of green energy, enough to offset approximately 70% of Vanderbilt’s annual indirect greenhouse gas emissions from purchased electricity.The TVA could lead in the South when it comes to clean energy — but it doesn’t. (And the South lags behind the rest of the country in clean energy and energy efficiency.) The New York Times reports in an opinion piece:It is true that under a new chief executive, Jeff Lyash, the TVA has recently made noises about building a lot of solar plants. But they seem to be just noises: The actual budget the TVA has adopted calls for a more modest solar program that will most likely leave the Tennessee Valley lagging [behind] much of the South.The TVA’s board members are appointed by the incumbent president. So it’s had no pressure from the current administration to adopt green energy, and Barack Obama didn’t want to tangle with Tennessee’s Republican senators, so he didn’t push them, either.Stephen Smith, the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said:If someone could make a compelling case that you need to put this country on a war footing to solve the climate crisis, then TVA could be a tremendous asset for doing that. But you’d have to clean house.The New York Times continues:Overall, the authority’s power mix is more than half clean, well above the national figure of 38% of all electric-power generation coming from low-carbon sources. To get to 100% would thus require less work at the TVA than for many power suppliers.The backwardness of the TVA on this issue is not just a national embarrassment; it is a betrayal of the agency’s own progressive legacy as one of the signature creations of the New Deal.

MeyGen sits off Scotland’s northern coast, on the ocean floor, near the island of Stroma.This was a major milestone for the project, which harnesses the currents’ energy and is laying the foundations for tidal as a future energy source.Fast currents drive the turbine rotors, which in turn drive generators that produce electricity. They are fixed to the sea bed and connected to the grid via an armored cable.The World Economic Forum explains:The four giant turbines have now exported 24.7 gigawatt hours (GWh) of predictable renewable power to the national grid. And this is just the first phase of a project that could eventually power 175,000 homes with more than 250 submerged turbines.Tidal energy is still small within the growing green energy sector but is seen to have a lot of potential.A 2016 estimate from the European Commission said wave and tidal power could account for 10% of the EU’s energy needs by 2050. And back in 2013, the UK estimated 20% of its power needs could be met by tidal.Company cars made up 53% of all cars sold in 2019 in the UK, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. They’re a heavily taxed perk (I speak from experience, my husband drove company cars), and since 2002, the British government has pegged the duty rate to the car’s official CO2 emission figure.But a company car revolution in the UK is coming: From April, people who choose electric cars as company cars will pay no tax on them.Autocar explains how this is going to work:The driver of a Nissan Leaf EV currently pays between £871 and £1,960 in company car tax, depending on their salary. From next April it falls into a 0% tax band, meaning they’ll pay nothing. That generosity from the government lasts only a year, but the following tax year the Leaf bill rises to just £54-£122, then £109-£245 the year after that.It’s even more striking when you compare the figures for EVs against combustion-engined cars. While a Tesla Model S costing £97,700 will attract a 0% company car tax from April, a slightly cheaper Mercedes-Benz S450L AMG Line will cost the driver a whopping £13,116 a year in tax.Speaking from personal experience, getting an EV as a company car in the UK is now a no-brainer, and it’s going to encourage EV driving to skyrocket among those driving company cars in Britain.In Sierra Leone, 87% of people, or 7.65 million, don’t have access to a reliable electricity grid. 99% of people in rural areas don’t have electricity.Easy Solar provides pay-as-you-go solar lighting and chargers to low-income people. The company has brought power to more than 200,000 people in 40,000 homes that can run lighting, home systems, mobile phones, and entertainment. It has created more than 300 jobs and saves households more than $5 million in power costs annually.Easy Solar founders Enyonam Nthabiseng Mosia and Alexandre Tourre discuss their company and the future of power in Africa in the video below. (They won Social Entrepreneur Awards from the Schwab Foundation.)Mosia said:I realized that you cannot talk about wide-scale development on the African continent unless you fix the energy problem. Six hundred million Africans are without power, whereas in the rest of the world we are talking about robotics and AI.800 million people globally do not have access to electricity.https://youtu.be/lLm9IAB-4D4Video: World Economic ForumPhotos: Ramon Vloon/Unsplash (top); MeyGen tidal/Andritz Hydro Hammerfest",solar
2020/02/04,"Investor Ron Baron is chairman and CEO of Baron Capital, which holds nearly 1.63 million Tesla shares. This morning, he discussed why Tesla’s stocks are doing so well on CNBC’s Squawk Box.Tesla reported revenue last week of $24.6 billion in 2019. As my Electrek colleague Fred Lambert pointed out, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock jumped again in pre-market trading this morning to $900 a share.Host Rebecca Quick asked Baron this morning, “What have you thought, as you’ve watched the stock go up 80%?” Baron replied:Well, you gotta remember that 2014, when we were buying our stock, we bought [1.6 million] shares at a price of $214. And as you know, since I’ve been on this show several times since, the stock went between $350 and $180 and $250, so it’s all over. And that period of time was when this company wasn’t profitable, was expanding rapidly, was being criticized by short sellers, it was very difficult for them to get started because dealers would try to prevent them from selling cars in individual states.But now things have all come together. In the period of time since 2014, the stock price didn’t change very much through that summer. So through last summer, our $219 stock was $230, $240, so we made 10%, 20%, 30%. At the same period of time, the company’s business — we focus on business, not stock prices — the company’s business had grown from $2.8 billion of annual revenues to $25 billion of annual revenues. Eight-fold. So the company’s up eight-fold, stock’s up 20%, 10%. Now it’s happening, let’s just catch it.This year [2020], Tesla is going to do somewhere around $32 billion in revenues, and I guess that they’re gonna do $100 billion in revenues within four years. And I think they have potential for $1 trillion in revenues within 10 years. So basically, you’re looking at the very start of what’s gonna happen with Tesla. This could be one of the largest companies in the whole world.That’s assuming you do 10 million cars. There’s 90 million cars, or 95 million cars they’ve sold. And yes, that’s without the battery business. We’re thinking $750 billion to $1 trillion of revenues, just on the car business. [CEO] Elon [Musk] says that the battery business is going to be as big as the car business. In addition to that, when I’m thinking 10 million cars a year, the last conversation he had, he said it was 20 million cars is what he thinks he can do.And so what we’re talking about is a business that right now, demand is overwhelming for the product that they’re selling and they’re constrained as far as making as many cars as they could sell because they don’t have enough batteries.So now, it’s a nice move, an announcement today that Panasonic is making money in the plant they have in Reno, but they need to have more batteries. So they’re going to have a battery day in a few months. [Tesla will] have all the analysts coming out and they’re going to show how they’re addressing the issue of where are these batteries gonna come from to make all these cars that are possible to make.You can watch the interview with Baron below:Baron’s take follows CNBC’s Jim Cramer’s assessment of Chevon’s and Exxon’s declines on Friday that “I’m done with fossil fuels… this is the other side of Tesla.”Baron also said, “Whether Elon Musk is successful or not, I am really glad that I have invested in this company because I’m helping — this guy is saving the earth. Brilliant guy, great businessman, and saving the planet.”This reinforces that it isn’t just money anymore that’s driving the stock market, as Cramer pointed out that fossil fuel companies’ dividends are great. But it’s simply not enough. He called fossil fuels the new tobacco.Tesla is a great product, and it’s good for the planet. And Baron didn’t even address Musk’s plans to rapidly develop Tesla’s solar industry, so there’s even more potential for growth.",solar
2020/02/03,"Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have published a new paper in the journal ACS Photonics that says “anti-solar panels” can generate night solar electricity.Solar panels absorb the sun’s heat and generate energy. At night, if a panel is pointed toward Earth, then it could capture the Earth’s invisible infrared light. The paper claims an anti-solar panel could generate about 25% of the electricity at night that a solar panel generates during the day.The nighttime device uses a thermoradiative cell to generate electricity, and it has to be made of something that can capture extremely long-wavelength light. The UC Davis team is working on prototypes, and considering mercury alloys.Jeremy Munday, an author of the paper and a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis, told Inverse:You have heat energy coming from the sun toward the Earth, and that normal solar cell picks off that energy as it’s transmitted from the sun to the Earth, so basically you need these two different temperature bodies and some way of converting that power.What this nighttime device does is a similar sort of thing — where it’s just taking a hot body and a cold body — but now the relatively hot body is the Earth and space is the cold body. As this heat is flowing from the Earth to outer space, it’s picking that off and converting that into power.Here’s the study’s abstract:Photovoltaics possess significant potential due to the abundance of solar power incident on Earth; however, they can only generate electricity during daylight hours. In order to produce electrical power after the sun has set, we consider an alternative photovoltaic concept that uses the Earth as a heat source and the night sky as a heat sink, resulting in a ‘nighttime photovoltaic cell’ that employs thermoradiative photovoltaics and concepts from the advancing field of radiative cooling. In this Perspective, we discuss the principles of thermoradiative photovoltaics, the theoretical limits of applying this concept to coupling with deep space, the potential of advanced radiative cooling techniques to enhance their performance, and a discussion of the practical limits, scalability, and integrability of this nighttime photovoltaic concept.The UC Davis scientists aren’t the only ones who are developing solar that will work at night. Researchers at Stanford published a paper in November about it, too.We at Electrek think it’s just a matter of time before someone makes a breakthrough with night solar. Think about all the advances solar, and renewable energy in general has made in such a short period of time. We fully expect more great leaps to come, and we think night solar will be one of those achievements.Photo: Ryan Hutton/Unsplash",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/02/03,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced how the UK will have to change the way it travels and heats homes to meet the British government’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The changes will be powered by wind farms, and Ofgem says it will be considerably cheaper than gas, coal, and oil.The Daily Mail summarizes:Ofgem envisages the number of electric vehicles will surge from 230,000 today to 10 million by 2030 and 39 million by 2050. It argues this will only be possible if the current total of 30,000 public car chargers rises to 210,000, plus 3,500 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers near motorways.Ofgem wants UK EV owners to charge them at the night, during off-peak hours, and then sell it back to the national grid at a higher price at peak periods. The power stored in the cars’ batteries will reduce the need to build gas-fired power stations.Further, natural gas heating will need to be replaced by electric heating, or a gas system run on hydrogen, where the emissions are water.One of the most common questions about solar’s effectiveness is, “But what happens at night when the sun goes down?” The short answer is battery storage, but researchers at the University of California, Davis have released a new paper published in the journal ACS Photonics that says that “anti-solar panels” can generate electricity.Solar panels absorb the sun’s heat and generate energy.

The facades are made of wood, steel, and plaster.Houses facing east or west have white plaster, and houses facing north or south are made of either dark silver steel or steel with wood lattice.All of the homes feature solar panels:As the solar panels are designed to face south, the architects had to come up with a unique roof designed for both appearance and practicality. Houses that were east-west facing have sawtooth roofs with customized ridgelines and a 45-degree angle for the panels, while homes with north-south facades and east-west ridgelines have asymmetrical, mirrored roofs.Photos: Peter Cavanagh/Alamy Stock Photo (top); Street Monkey Architects (bottom)",solar
2020/01/31,"Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money, cofounder of The Street, and former stockbroker and hedge fund manager, declared fossil fuels dead after oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron reported Q4 earnings this morning.When asked about Exxon’s and Chevron’s stocks, which are dragging down the Dow today, on Squawk Box, Cramer gave a damning prognosis to a surprised Rebecca Quick:I’m done with fossil fuels. They’re done. They’re just done. We’re starting to see divestment all over the world. We’re starting to see companies just regard them as, I mean big pension funds saying, listen, we’re not gonna own them anymore. It doesn’t matter how good they are.The world’s changed. There’s new managers, they don’t want to hear whether these are good or bad. Look at BP, it’s a solid yield, very good. Look at Chevron, buying back $5 billion worth of stock, nobody cares, and this has to do with new kinds of money managers who frankly just want to appease younger people who believe that you can’t ever make a fossil fuel company sustainable. That why I said, Mike Wirth [chairman and CEO of Chevron] is trying everything he can, but in the end, they make fossil fuels, and … we’re in the death knell phase. I know that’s very contrary, but we’re in the death knell phase.The issue is sustainability. Look, this is the other side of Tesla. These stocks don’t want to be owned by younger people.

You’re seeing divestiture by a lot of different funds. It’s going to be a parade…. that says look, these are tobacco, and we’re not gonna own ’em… I think they’re tobacco. We’re in a new world. Prognosis negative.You can watch the clip below:I don’t think it will come as a surprise that we at Electrek are in complete agreement with Cramer.

The wind industry is on the rise in the US, with installations for the year at 9,143MW.There is now 105,583MW of wind energy operating in the US, with nearly 60,000 wind turbines spinning across 41 states and two US territories.Here are the takeaways, for those of you who love stats:New York City’s notorious Rikers Island has been the city’s main jail complex since 1932, and it’s closing in 2026. Queens councilman Costa Constantinides has put forward a proposal to turn the complex into a green energy hub, and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson is enthusiastically backing it.Johnson says the plan would help New York City reach its goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050.Crains’ New York Business writes:Constantinides’ bills would obligate the city to conduct feasibility studies on placing renewable energy arrays, battery storage, and a wastewater plant on the 413-acre isle, which the councilman — himself currently running for Queens borough president — hopes would allow the closure of existing power and sewage facilities near residential neighborhoods. Another of his proposals would require the city Department of Corrections to remand the 413-acre isle to the Department of Environmental Protection by 2026.The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, was founded in 1693. The historic college is forward-thinking: The college has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Dominion Energy that will source nearly 50% of the university’s electricity from solar. It will save the college money after around six years.A 20MW solar farm will be installed by Strata Solar on a farm in nearby James City County.The college explains:At that rate, W&M will be sourcing a greater percentage of renewable energy than any other public university in the state. With electricity being the largest part of W&M’s carbon footprint, the agreement gets the university one step closer to becoming carbon neutral by 2030 — a goal it announced last fall in partnership with the University of Virginia.Initial work on the project will begin in the next couple of months, and solar production is expected to begin next year.",solar
2020/01/30,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Assurance, tax, and advisory services firm BDO has released a new CFO outlook survey called, “Energy Goes Green.” The 2020 BDO Energy Outlook Survey polled 100 chief financial officers (CFOs) at US energy organizations with revenues ranging from $250 million to $3 billion in October and November 2019.The overall finding is that energy CFOs agree that green energy is the future. 38% of oil and gas CFOs felt the most dominant alternative energy by 2023 would be solar, followed by 28% choosing hydroelectric, and 16% choosing wind. 38% of power generation CFOs agreed about solar, but 22% chose wind, and 20% chose geothermal.Drastically lower production costs, growing concern around climate change, evolving global energy policies, and increased pressure from investors on companies to adopt environmental social governance (ESG) polices are pushing renewables into the mainstream.But the industry has a long way to go — according to energy CFOs, renewables aren’t projected to make up a significant part of their businesses for a few years.BDO described US movement toward green energy as “slow and steady.” When Electrek asked BDO why the US lags behind so many other countries in the adaptation of green energy, Clark Sackschewsky, BDO’s national natural resources practice leader, replied:The difference between the US and most other countries, particularly those in Europe, is that the US has a readily available source of energy that is cheap and abundant.  Most countries, like those in Europe, do not have that luxury, and therefore the cost/benefit analysis outside of the US is completely different.The cost per MWh has been dropping significantly, but it won’t be until we get to the point where energy storage for when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining has improved dramatically that we will see a large conversion to alternative energy.We are seeing the shift and it is moving in the right direction within the US, [but] a dramatic turn to renewables has a lot of headwinds to overcome.As BDO put it: “One thing is certain: The energy industry in 10 years will look completely different than it does today, and our world will be better off for it.”The world-famous, nearly 11 mile-long, mountain-biking Slickrock trail near Moab, Utah, takes riders over stunning petrified sand dunes and sea bed remnants.And now, reports the Salt Lake Tribune, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has proposed leasing two-thirds of Slickrock for oil and gas drilling, even though it has very low potential to produce.Under a plan to be opened for public comment on February 20, the agency would auction two parcels on Sand Flats, one of which is barely a mile form Arches National Park, and five others in Grand County.The June offerings are puny, covering about 5,000 acres. Yet they will likely court controversy — as was the case a few years ago, when the BLM proposed offering parcels for leasing near Zion National Park. It withdrew those patches after taking heat from Utah Governor Gary Herbert and Washington County leaders.Oil prices are down mainly because there is plenty of oil — Donald Trump likes to announce that at his rallies regularly — so it’s pointless to even consider destroying unique natural beauty that so many people enjoy.A study by economics researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, which was published in the journal Environmental and Resource Economics, explored what happens to attitudes about climate change when people see their neighbors putting solar panels on their roofs.The study analyzed five years of survey data collected between 2010 and 2014 in Australian communities.It found that for every additional 1,000 solar panels in a neighborhood, the share of neighbors that believe climate change is primarily caused by human action increased by seven percentage points.Graham Beattie, assistant professor of economics at Loyola Marymount University, who worked on the study as a post-doctoral researcher at Pitt until 2018, said:They see their neighbors install solar panels, so they get interested and read more on them and climate change to update their beliefs. Maybe they receive government funding to install panels, or maybe they just believe their neighbors more than scientists. There’s all kinds of possibilities as to why.There’s a lot more solar installation in Australia than there is in the U.S., but conjecturally speaking, there’s no reason why this relationship wouldn’t also exist in the US.",solar

It’s part of the international news organization’s efforts to reduce their own carbon footprint.In October 2019, the Guardian pledged to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2030.The Scott Trust Endowment fund, which supports the Guardian, excluded all fossil fuel investments five years ago.The company stated:Of course we know some readers would like us to go further, banning ads for any product with a significant carbon footprint, such as cars or holidays. Stopping those ads would be a severe financial blow, and might force us to make significant cuts to Guardian and Observer journalism around the world.Advertising made up 40% of the Guardian‘s revenue in 2019. The shift from print to online within media has hit the industry hard over recent years, and all media organizations have had to seek out alternate forms of income as advertising has evolved or even dried up. The Guardian continued:The advertising landscape is shifting fast, and many businesses and advertisers are waking up to the climate crisis themselves. We believe many brands will agree with our stance, and might be persuaded to choose to work with us more as a result. The future of advertising lies in building trust with consumers, and demonstrating a real commitment to values and purpose.It’s true that rejecting some adverts might make our lives a tiny bit tougher in the very short term. Nonetheless, we believe building a more purposeful organization and remaining financially sustainable have to go hand in hand.Duke Energy has announced that it will build two new solar farms, in Florida’s Hamilton and Columbia Counties.The Twin Rivers Solar Power Plant will be built on 460 acres in Hamilton County, Florida. Once operational, the 74.9 megawatt (MW) facility will consist of approximately 235,000 tracking solar panels to power approximately 23,000 homes at peak production.The Santa Fe Solar Power Plant will be built on approximately 600 acres in Columbia County, Florida. The 74.9 MW plant will consist of approximately 235,000 tracking solar panels to power more than 23,000 average homes at peak production.Completion is expected in late 2020, and each solar project will create 200 to 300 temporary jobs.The company is investing an estimated $1 billion to construct or acquire a total of 700 MW of solar farms from 2018 through 2022 in Florida, and planning for another 1,500 MW of solar generation through 2028.Every August, the annual Burning Man event takes place in Black Rock City, Nevada. Just in case you haven’t heard of it, it’s a huge, wild, creative, art and community event attended by tens of thousands of people in the desert.In 2016, the Burning Man Project acquired Fly Ranch, a 3,800-acre property north of the event’s site. The Fly Ranch project has provided an opportunity to create a year-round rural incubator for Burning Man culture, and “a catalyst for innovation and creativity in the world.”The Land Art Generator Initiative (LAGI) and Burning Man Project have partnered to launch a multi-disciplinary design challenge — LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch — that will create the foundational infrastructure of Fly Ranch.LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch calls for design solutions for energy, water, food, shelter, and regeneration (zero waste).

Those will provide enough energy to power 45,000 homes.As Electrek has previously reported for context, according to Florida Census Data, there are around 6.3 million homes in the Sunshine State.New solar is always welcome, particularly in the US South. For example, the region’s energy efficiency lags behind the rest of the country — it’s less than half as efficient as in other regions.And it’s not like Florida doesn’t have enough sun — the state should take full advantage of its natural resource, the way Arizona is doing. Arizona ranked second in the US in total solar energy generation in 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration.The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy’s (SACE) “Energy Efficiency in the Southeast” 2019 Annual Report noted that Duke Energy leads on energy efficiency, but that there is disparity among southern states (and they explain why):Duke Energy Carolinas, operating in North and South Carolina, continues to be the only utility in the Southeast to exceed 1% annual savings (1.03%), a symbolic checkpoint on the path toward the higher savings levels achieved by successful utilities in other parts of the country. Duke Energy Progress (0.86%), also operating in North and South Carolina, was also head-and-shoulders above the next major Southeastern utility energy efficiency leader. State policy differences meant far lower savings for Duke Energy Florida (0.21%).So even though efficiency and solar are two separate things, they both fall under the same green energy advancement umbrella, so it’s good to see Duke Energy Florida push these solar initiatives.",solar

When SARS hit the country in 2002, China’s annual growth dropped from 11% to 9%.This recent price drop has occurred because traders are concerned that travel advisories and any other major impact on China’s and other countries’ economies will reduce oil demand, yet there is a strong supply.However, today saw a slight recovery after five days of losses. OPEC gave a statement yesterday calling for calm, and that helped curb the sell-off of futures.Vandana Hari, CEO of Vanda Insights, told CNBC today:It is based on a lot of fear and panic… That fear and panic will probably not die down anytime soon.It’s natural, very human to… hark back to SARS. However, when it comes to the oil market, I don’t think it’s entirely comparable.Perhaps a bigger one is that the China-US trade deal… has not really raised hopes for commodities seeing a major comeback in demand. All of these factors will remain, and I presume they have contributed to this fear and panic being a little bit more amplified.Tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon were the biggest buyers of green energy in 2019. The companies purchased the green energy to power their data centers.Tech firms bought almost 25% of green energy sold to global companies last year, according to a BloombergNEF report.Google led with 2,700MW, followed by Facebook at 1,100MW, Amazon at 900MW, and Microsoft at 800MW.According to the Guardian:BloombergNEF found that 100 companies in 23 countries struck deals to buy 19.5GW of renewable energy last year, up 40% from the record set the year before.Kyle Harrison, the lead author of the [BloombergNEF] report, said: ‘The clean energy portfolios of some of the largest corporate buyers rival those of the world’s biggest utilities. These companies are facing mounting pressure from investors to decarbonize.’On October 15, Google announced that it will spend $150 million on green energy projects in countries where its products are made.And on January 16, Microsoft announced that by 2030 it “will be carbon negative, and by 2050 Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.”China is the world’s No. 1 largest creator of single-use plastic waste.

2020/01/28,"China is the world’s No. 1 largest creator of single-use plastic waste. The United States has the “honor” of being No. 2. Last week, China announced that it will ban single-use plastics across the country. The US has no federal plan to ban single-use plastics.And only eight US states have banned single-use plastic bags.As Waste 360 explains:This year, China will ban and restrict the production, sales, and use of some plastic products in some regions and areas. By 2022, China hopes the consumption of disposable plastic products will be significantly reduced and alternative products will be replaced. By 2025, China will prohibit the production, distribution, consumption, and recycling of single-use plastic products.The US, meanwhile, has no tangible nationwide plan for either banning or recycling single-use plastics. It just vaguely encourages people to do a better job of recycling. But as the New York Times‘ climate newsletter pointed out:For years, we relied heavily on recycling operations in China to take our waste. But that came to an end in 2018, when Beijing barred the import of recycling materials. The result is a waste crisis that has caused at least dozens of municipalities to cancel curbside recycling programs, with many more implementing partial cuts. Huge amounts of recyclables are now going to landfills.Legislators may need to pass laws requiring manufacturers to use more recyclable materials, companies would need to build much-needed recycling infrastructure, and people would need to recycle properly.Maybe someone should let Donald Trump (and his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin) know that climate activist Greta Thunberg doesn’t need to focus more on China when it comes to single-use plastics, because China is on a winning path when it comes to both banning and recycling them.Where is the US’s single-use plastic ban plan?Here’s my first-person take. I live in Florida and sometimes shop at the supermarket chain Publix. I always take my own bags — I got my sturdy canvas bags years ago, at Waitrose supermarket in the UK, a country that reduced their plastic bag consumption by 90% since 2015 as of August 2019.Every time, the Publix cashier politely asks, as I stand there with my canvas bags, “Plastic OK?” And my answer is a polite but firm, “No.”There are always both plastic and brown paper bags sitting next to the till (but the paper bags are tucked away). I’ve asked multiple cashiers why they offer plastic over paper, and they always reply that that’s what they’re told to do. Some have told me that they resent this directive to offer plastic. This policy contradicts Publix’s useless campaign of plastic “reduction.” Ban them, Publix. Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s have banned them; you can, too.The US, both at federal and state levels, also needs a really good recycling plan — not just a clean-up plan. What’s the point of the Save our Seas 2.0 Act if we’re continuing to make more single-use plastic that ends up right back in the sea?If you’re American, and curious about what your state is doing (or not doing) after the Beijing recycling import ban, have a look at this 50-state report from WasteDive.And if this issue is important to you, be mindful. Don’t buy or use single-use plastics at every opportunity.",solar
2020/01/27,"Melrose, Massachusetts, won the 2019 SolSmart Innovation Award. SolSmart is funded by the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office.The city, with a population of around 27,000 and located in the Boston metropolitan area, won the award because it chose to expand beyond the residential market to nonprofits, places of worship, and small businesses by the end of 2019.Melrose has installed solar at Melrose Highlands Congregational Church (MHCC), Green Street Baptist Church, and First Baptist Church (pictured above). SolSmart explained today:Through a unique financing pathway, MHCC was able to purchase 61.5 kW of solar across two roofs with an upfront discount achieved by transferring the Federal Investment Tax Credit to a third party. The 61.5kW of capacity allowed the church to generate their entire electricity usage, claim $9,444 SMART incentive revenue in year one, and sell the excess electricity produced to support the work of the organization. The total savings in year one alone will be $15,687 and over $200,000 by year 25.SolSmart is a program that recognizes cities, counties, and regional organizations for making it faster, easier, and more affordable to go solar. It helps local governments and regional organizations bring new business to their community, promote economic growth, and foster the creation of new jobs. It has more than 350 designees across the US.The Melrose Energy Commission pulled in the key ingredients to a successful campaign: local community support, trusted introductions to decision makers, technical expertise, and highly visible examples of success. The community partnered with Boston-based Resonant Energy, a solar provider specializing in nonprofit solar finance options, the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) Program, and the technical complexities of serving projects 25kW to 300 kW.Melrose is going for efficiency in its approach by targeting mid-sized roofs, which is an untapped market. As SolSmart rightfully points out, nearly all rooftop solar development has focused on residential projects smaller than 25kW and commercial projects larger than 300kW.The Massachusetts city is targeting a market that makes up most of the nearly 80% of the addressable rooftop solar market with capacity under 300kW.The city deserves its innovation award, and for spotting the obvious potential. Hopefully Melrose will serve as an example for other cities’ mid-sized solar roof capacities. It’d be great to see more houses of worship with solar panels on their roofs.Photo: First Baptist Church in Melrose",solar

Further, 87% said their EV is their first choice of transportation in their household, even though 78% also owned a gas-powered vehicle.The survey also confirmed what many EV owners already know: Non-EV drivers (57% of Americans, to be exact) worry about running out of charge while they’re driving, or that they won’t be able to find a place to charge (that’s 58% of Americans).But guess what? 95% of EV owners have never run out of charge while driving, and 75% charge their cars at home only. The average EV driver drives 39 miles per day.So, once AAA shared that info with the worried non-EV drivers, 77% then decided running out of charge wasn’t a threat after all. And the cure for alleviating that fear? Firsthand experience: actually owning an EV.The 2019 electric vehicle models selected for this study were: Chevrolet Bolt (LT), Hyundai Ionic Electric (Base), Kia Soul EV (+), Nissan Leaf (SV), and Volkswagen eGolf (SE). The 2019 internal combustion engine vehicles selected for the comparison were: Chevrolet Cruze (LS), Honda Civic (LX), Hyundai Elantra (SE), Nissan Sentra (SV), and Toyota Corolla (SE).(And no, I have no idea why AAA didn’t use a Tesla in their study, either.)The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) has released its “Energy Efficiency in the Southeast” 2019 Annual Report. Bottom line, the American southern states achieve less than half the national average of energy efficiency savings than other regions of the US.This is because “electric utilities and regulators in the Southeast consistently underinvest in this abundant low-cost energy efficiency resource.” Further, “utilities… continue to rely on expensive, outdated fossil fuel power plants — including 53 GW of coal-powered generators — and are even proposing construction of new ones.”SACE continues:Utilities often point to cost as an argument against spending money on efficiency, while simultaneously building expensive new power plants that increase their own profits. The fact that the Southeast has among the highest energy bills in the country and the lowest energy efficiency performance points to a clear solution: Before spending customer dollars on more expensive power plants, utilities should be required to first invest in all cost-effective energy efficiency and energy optimization. To do otherwise is to pay too much.Energy efficiency helps reduce high energy bills and cuts carbon emissions that worsen the climate crisis, threaten public health, and damage our environment. Efficiency enables the retirement of polluting fossil fuels and also reduces the cost of electricity for customers.You can read the entire report here.Dallas law firm Haynes and Boone reported on Wednesday that the number of oil and gas company bankruptcies in the US and Canada rose 50% in 2019 over 2018.

Voters rejected Proposition 127, so APS’ about-turn is particularly surprising, and the target they set themselves is even more ambitious than what was on the ballot.APS currently sources around 25% of its electricity from coal, 25% from natural gas, and 25% from nuclear power. It will cease to use coal by 2031, citing the coal plants as being uneconomical, and will eventually also phase out natural gas.It will continue to use the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in the state, the US’s largest nuclear power plant. The station, which APS co-owns and operates, is licensed to run into the 2040s.APS will also build an 850-megawatt expansion of large-scale energy storage, mostly paired with the company’s solar farms.So why the change of heart after dropping nearly $38 million to fight green energy? APS said:After our Integrated Resource Plan process in 2018, Arizona’s experience with Proposition 127 and the Arizona Corporation Commission’s efforts to update the state’s energy rules, we took a hard look at our generation mix and future plans. We spent more than a year engaged with a variety of stakeholders including our customers, business organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. This plan reflects those experiences and discussions.Arizona ranked second in the US in total solar energy generation in 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration.The US Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded phase 1 funding to tech company Everledger for two pilot programs to trace the life cycle of lithium-ion batteries using blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.In the first pilot, Everledger and the DOE will work with Ford to connect stakeholders in its EV battery life cycle to ensure optimal management and responsible recovery when batteries stop working.Ford’s batteries will be traced from the moment of manufacture, so elements can be reused, generate less waste, and increase protection from metals leakage into the environment.The second pilot focuses on developing a platform to inform and reward consumers for recycling portable Li-ion batteries and the products they power.Identification, data capture, and blockchain technologies will be used to give batteries a digital identity (or “battery passport”). This will give stakeholders knowledge of a battery’s location, condition, health score, and which metals could be recycled to use in new batteries.Britain’s Prince Charles returned to the World Economic Forum at Davos after a 30-year hiatus, on the 50th anniversary of the annual summit in Switzerland.The Prince of Wales gave a keynote speech yesterday in which he launched a new Sustainable Markets Initiative, and addressed ways to tackle the climate crisis.The Sustainable Markets Initiative “brings together leading international figures to find ways to rapidly decarbonize the global economy and make the transition to sustainable markets.”Click here to read Prince Charles’ opening statements excerpt, and Electrek’s Take on Prince Charles’ speech and what it means for decarbonization efforts.Photo: APS Red Rock solar farm",solar
2020/01/22,"Prince Charles returned to the World Economic Forum at Davos after a 30-year hiatus, on the 50th anniversary of the annual summit in Switzerland.The Prince of Wales gave a keynote speech today in which he launched a new Sustainable Markets Initiative, and addressed ways to tackle the climate crisis.Prince Charles spoke for a half hour about climate change and sustainability, and his new initiative as a way to tackle these issues.The Sustainable Markets Initiative “brings together leading international figures to find ways to rapidly decarbonize the global economy and make the transition to sustainable markets.”Here’s an excerpt of his opening remarks:We are in the midst of a crisis that is now, I hope, well understood. Global warming, climate change, and the devastating loss of biodiversity are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced, and one largely of our own creation.Now, I have dedicated much of my life to the restoration of harmony between humanity, nature, and the environment, and to the encouragement of corporate, social, and environmental responsibility. Quite frankly, it has been a bit of an uphill struggle. But now, it is time to take it to the next level.In order to secure our future and to prosper, we need to evolve our economic model… it’s not a lack of capital that is holding us back but rather the way in which we deploy it. Therefore to move forward, we need nothing short of a paradigm shift… And with this in mind, I am delighted to be launching a Sustainable Markets Initiative, with the generous support of the World Economic Forum.For me, sustainable markets offer a new systems-level framework which grounds markets in a higher-purpose mission. In other words, putting people and planet at the heart of global value creation.Sustainable markets generate long-term value through the balance of natural, social, human, and financial capital. Systems-level change within sustainable markets is driven by consumer and investor demand, access to sustainable alternatives, and an enhanced partnership between the public, private, and philanthropic sectors.He also said:Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink, in trying to restore the balance, when we could have done? I don’t want to.The only limit is our willingness to act, and the time to act is now.Here is his speech in full:After his speech, he met with climate activist Greta Thunberg:The Prince of Wales meets environmental activist @GretaThunberg at #wef20. @wef pic.twitter.com/FruEgY17mi— Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) January 22, 2020As Prince Charles points out in his speech, he has a long history of promoting sustainability. Last year, he told the Evening Standard that big business and the financial sector should help save the planet by investing “trillions of pounds” into a sustainable economy and environmental schemes.The Prince of Wales arrived in Davos with a 10-point plan to make the global economy more sustainable. That included identifying policies or regulations that need to change, and bringing the right people together to push change through. Credit to him for showing up with a structured plan.Charles deserves to be taken seriously, not because he’s a high-profile member of the British royal family (which hasn’t been taken seriously lately) — although that helps raise the awareness of what he’s saying — but because he has promoted sustainability for four decades. He knows what he’s talking about.(And yes, we know he flew to Switzerland  — there’s an aviation initiative at Davos to reduce carbon emissions.)",solar
2020/01/22,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The 2019 Menino Survey of Mayors, the sixth annual report conducted by Boston University’s Initiative on Cities, was released this week. It reflects responses from 119 sitting mayors from 38 US states about their policy priorities, leadership strategies, and their cities’ pressing issues.The report covers, among other things, infrastructure and climate. The survey reveals that mayors feel the biggest source of greenhouse gases in their cities is vehicles (66%), followed by commercial buildings and “something else” (8%). Industrial and residential buildings tied at 7%, and 5% responded “not sure.”The report states:Reflecting the growing urgency with which cities need to address climate change, a large majority of mayors (70%) agree that cities should play a strong role in reducing the effects of climate change, even if it means sacrificing revenues or expending financial resources.When broken down by political party, 92% of Democratic mayors agree with the above statement, and 25% of Republican mayors agree.Further, when it comes to electric vehicles, 67% of mayors support improving their cities’ EV infrastructure, even if it means sacrificing parking for non-electric vehicles.There is still a partisan gap, with Democratic mayors 40 percentage points more likely to agree that improvements to their cities’ electric vehicle infrastructure are important. But Republican mayors are substantially more likely to fall into the neutral category than in the previous tradeoff, suggesting that views are not quite so polarized on this issue.78% of Democratic mayors feel it’s important to improve EV infrastructure, and 40% of Republican mayors feel the same.A common criticism of the annual World Economic Forum at Davos meeting is that everyone talks about sustainability but arrives in thousands of polluting private jets.So the initiatives announced by the Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF Coalition), the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Zurich Airport are welcome.First, the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will lower emissions for flights to and from Davos this year, and secondly, it will further help to support aviation’s effort to expand the use of SAF.Further, as the SAF Coalition explains:Under a payment-transfer initiative known as “book-and-claim,” operators for the first time will be able to purchase SAF even at airports where it’s not available. Under the program, for each gallon of conventional fuel purchased at Teterboro Airport outside New York City, Hanscom Field in the Boston area and Dulles International Airport, Washington, D.C.’s main international terminal, an equivalent amount of conventional fuel will be replaced with SAF on flights departing from Van Nuys airport in the Los Angeles area.Sustainable aviation fuels are carbon-cutting turbine fuels, made from bio-based or other sources, which can reduce a flight’s emissions by as much as 80%. However, it’s currently available in limited quantities, it’s expensive, and it needs further refinement for wider use.The Wall Street Journal asks:Could hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, help reduce the use of fossil fuels, and boost the adoption of renewable energy? … But there’s also skepticism around it. Will people embrace the hydrogen revolution, or is it overhyped?Have a watch of the Journal‘s video above to learn about hydrogen as a potential source of green energy.

2020/01/22,"The Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF Coalition), the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Zurich Airport have announced initiatives to reduce aviation emissions.First, the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will lower emissions for flights to and from Davos this year, and secondly, it will help support the aviation industry’s effort to expand the use of SAF.Jet Aviation and World Fuel Services is making SAF available for aircraft leaving Switzerland as delegates depart Davos, Switzerland.Further, as the SAF Coalition explains:Under a payment-transfer initiative known as ‘book-and-claim,’ operators for the first time will be able to purchase SAF even at airports where it’s not available. Under the program, for each gallon of conventional fuel purchased at Teterboro Airport outside New York City, Hanscom Field in the Boston area and Dulles International Airport, Washington, D.C.’s main international terminal, an equivalent amount of conventional fuel will be replaced with SAF on flights departing from Van Nuys airport in the Los Angeles area.Sustainable aviation fuels are carbon-cutting turbine fuels, made from bio-based or other sources, which can reduce a flight’s emissions by as much as 80%. It’s currently available in limited quantities but is produced from renewable sources. It works exactly the same as conventional fuel.However, SAF manufacturers have some kinks to iron out, as Market Watch writes:Aviation biofuels exist, i.e., fuel made from plants or waste biomass that has a much lower carbon footprint, and is generally blended in with regular jet fuel. The big obstacle is making enough without competing with food production, at a low enough price.At the moment, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), as the industry calls them, are about three times more expensive than commercial fossil-fuel derived jet fuel.The SAF Coalition is made up of the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), International Business Aviation Council (IBAC), National Air Transportation Association (NATA), and the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).The SAF Coalition will host the Business Aviation Global Sustainability Summit in Washington, D.C., in March 2020 to accelerate the availability and use of SAF.A common annual criticism of the annual World Economic Forum at Davos meeting is that everyone talks about sustainability but arrives in polluting private jets, and that contributes to the perception of the event as being elitist and hypocritical. As Electrek asserted yesterday:What’s really important is what real and concrete actions come out of Davos when it comes to the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases.So, while SAF needs some serious fine-tuning, the effort to reduce aircraft emissions is welcome. When it comes to private jets (thousands show up at Davos), their overall emissions are lower than commercial flights, but the carbon footprint for individual passengers on private jets is much higher, as there are fewer passengers.Photo: JetApp",solar
2020/01/21,"The 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos launched its annual meeting today with an agenda focused heavily on climate change. This year’s theme is, “Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World.”One of the six key areas that the summit prioritizes this year is “Ecology: How to mobilize business to respond to the risks of climate change and ensure that measures to protect biodiversity reach forest floors and ocean beds.”Sustainability is not only being discussed but also applied at the event. The WEF reports:Initiatives put in place to achieve this goal include using locally sourced food suppliers, introducing alternative sources of protein to reduce meat consumption, sourcing 100% renewable electricity, and reducing or eliminating the use of materials that cannot easily be recycled or reused, such as carpets and introducing more electric vehicles.Climate activist Greta Thunberg opened a panel discussion at the meeting in the Swiss village in which she demanded that all organizations stop investing in fossil fuels immediately. She said:Let’s be clear. We don’t need a low carbon economy. We don’t need to lower emissions. Our emissions have to stop.You say children shouldn’t worry. You say, ‘Just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won’t let you down. Don’t be so pessimistic.’ And then… nothing. Silence. Or something worse than silence: Empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken.We demand at this year’s World Economic Forum [that] participants from all companies, banks, institutions, and governments immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction. Immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels.From a sustainability perspective, the right, the left, as well as the center have all failed. No political ideology or economic structure has been able to tackle the climate and environmental emergency.In Donald Trump’s speech at Davos, he dismissed climate activists’ pleas to stop using fossil fuels in order to slow global warming and pollution. He said:The United States is now by far the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.We are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy including from traditional fuels, LNG, clean coal, next-generation nuclear power, and gas hydrate technologies.We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers.Trump is a supporter and subsidizer of fossil fuels, dislikes wind farms, and pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement. He did, however, announce today that the US would join the 1 trillion trees initiative, launched at the WEF, which is meant to “serve and empower the reforestation community.”What’s really important is what real and concrete actions come out of Davos when it comes to the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases.The WEF’s sustainably run summit is a good example and a nice gesture, but the powerful delegates need to emulate the WEF’s actions immediately, the way that Microsoft has.It’s a bit baffling that the WEF’s theme is a sustainable world, yet they invited Trump to deliver the keynote speech. It’s telling, yet not at all surprising, that Trump didn’t even mention any green energy sources whatsoever in his list of “unlimited reserves of energy.” And it beggars belief that he still insists coal is clean when the evidence is overwhelming that it’s anything but.Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Davos attendee said in response to Trump’s speech:He managed to say absolutely zero on climate change. Meanwhile, we’re going to roast.Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions, and outdoor particulate pollution kills around 4.2 million people worldwide annually. The International Energy Agency yesterday warned that Big Oil emissions inaction is not an option.So while the 1 trillion trees initiative is important, it’s not enough. The world’s governments, banks, companies, and institutions must continue to circumvent the climate denier in the White House with positive, definitive action.Photo: Manuel Lopez/World Economic Forum",solar

It was the largest one-year increase since [power supplier Hawaiian Electric] began tracking solar capacity in 2005.There are now an estimated 3.5 million solar panels producing electricity on the company’s five grids.Hawaii has embraced solar due to the island’s high electricity costs and capacity for sunshine. The state has one of the highest per-capita rates of solar power in the US. Maui Now says that Hawaii leads the US in rooftop solar adoption.The state previously had a 30% federal tax credit with no caps for homeowners who installed solar PV systems. This year, that credit dropped to 26%. Next year it will drop to 22%, and in 2022, the tax credit will be terminated.In 2019, 19% of residential customers in Hawaiian Electric’s five-island territory were using rooftop solar, up from 18% in 2018.

The country’s energy minister, Saad al-Kaabi, made the announcement on Sunday at a press conference. Qatar’s Siraj Energy will hold a 60% stake. The other 40% will be owned by Marubeni and Total.The Al Kharsaah project will cost $467 million. Half of the plant is expected to be in operation by the first quarter of 2021 and will be running at full capacity by the first quarter of 2022.According to Al Jazeera, Kaabi said:It will generate about eight times the size of the solar energy Qatar had pledged to build, helping the organization of a carbon-neutral [FIFA World Cup] event.The solar farm will meet one-tenth of the country’s peak energy demands, said Kaabi, who also said more solar projects are planned.Dr. Veronica Bermudez, senior research director and energy center director at Qatar Environment and Energy Institute (QEERI) said in October on Business Insider about Qatar’s solar energy storage:Although solar is more environmentally sustainable than electricity produced from gas fired turbines, we have to worry about excess capacity and what to do about that. Solving the puzzle of where and how to fit renewables into the energy mix in Qatar is one of our biggest challenges.A team from the Tokyo University of Science are working on an alternative to lithium-ion batteries — ion batteries driven by potassium and sodium (KIBs). As the university’s website explains:Sodium and potassium are in the same alkali metal group in the periodic table of elements, and their chemical natures are, therefore, quite similar. But, unlike lithium, these elements are widely abundant on earth, and using them to develop high-performance rechargeable batteries would be a breakthrough toward creating a more sustainable society.Rechargeable batteries are necessary to support and grow green energy. Alternatives to lithium-ion batteries are necessary, as lithium supply is limited.Further research is needed about the safety and other aspects of KIBs. Professor Shinichi Komaba, who leads the Tokyo University of Science team, said:Research on KIBs, including electrode materials, non-aqueous/solid electrolytes, and additives will provide new insights into the electrode reactions and solid ionics, opening up new strategies that would allow for the creation of next-generation batteries.See the video explainer about this new development of battery below:Cleantech Group, which supports the development and marketability of clean technologies, has released its annual report, “Global Cleantech 100: Leading Companies and Themes in Sustainable Innovation,” which highlights the top 100 private cleantech companies expected to make the most significant market impact over the next five to 10 years.The following sectors are included in the report: energy and power, agriculture and food, transportation and logistics, natural resources and environment, enabling technologies, and materials and chemicals.

It’s a newly created position to help the automaker meet its net zero goals.Parker is currently vice president of sustainable workplaces, and this expands his current role. He will now lead the company-wide sustainability strategy, including the zero emissions goal.The Detroit News explains:The new position comes as GM prepares to convert the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant for electric vehicle production. The company also is purchasing property for a new battery-cell manufacturing plant in Ohio as it prepares to roll out 20 new all-electric models by 2023.GM has said it will invest $3 billion to prepare the plant for electric-vehicle production. The investment comes with 2,225 jobs.Parker said that GM’s “transition to electric vehicles is key.”GM chairman and CEO Mary Barra said:Climate change is real. That is indisputable, and we take the challenges it presents seriously. The transportation sector must be part of any credible climate change solution, and Dane’s leadership, experience, and passion will help us meet these challenges head-on. Our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion is ambitious, and this appointment aligns our organization to accelerate achieving that vision.Focusing on EVs remains a key measure of our commitment, but it’s also important to recognize the role our facilities play in enabling our vision of zero emissions.On Thursday, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban unveiled a climate-crisis strategy for the Eastern European country.France 24 (via AFP) explains:Published on the [Hungarian] government’s website, the National Energy and Climate Plan sets out targets including 90% carbon-neutral electricity production by 2030, mostly from nuclear and solar energy.Orban initially vetoed the EU’s carbon-neutral 2050 goal. But he then conceded once Brussels gave him a concession to use controversial nuclear energy. (France and Germany are in disagreement about the use of nuclear.)Further, Hungary’s upcoming plan will include pledges to clean up rivers, ban illegal garbage dumping, and equip all cities with electric buses by 2022.Orban’s reasoning for the plan is certainly unique. He and his ruling Fidesz party have often been ambivalent in the past when it comes to climate change.‘Orban doesn’t want climate change to be solely a leftist topic, either in Hungary or in Europe,’ Agoston Mraz, an analyst with the Nezopont Institute in Budapest, told AFP Thursday.‘He is trying to build up a conservative right-wing green politics as a counterbalance,’ said Mraz.At a press conference last week, Orban told reporters that “the protection of the created environment and of nature just on a biblical basis is an especially Christian democratic policy.”“Christian democratic” is a phrase Orban commonly uses to describe his policies, particularly when it comes to his staunch opposition to Muslim immigrants.Richmond, California, has banned coal export from its shores. Richmond is — or was — a critical port for coal exports to Asia, the world’s only region where coal use is still growing.The Levin-Richmond Terminal handles about 25% of exports from the US West Coast. However, US coal exports accounted for just over 3% of Asia-Pacific’s total imports in 2018. India and Japan are the biggest customers.According to Bloomberg:In 2018, the facility shipped almost 1 million metric tons of coal to Japan and South Korea. The legislation gives the port three years to stop coal shipments. The ordinance also includes petroleum coke, a byproduct of oil refining that’s another major product handled by the terminal.Richmond mayor Tom Butt said:I’ve got bigger ambitions than just Richmond. I’d like to get rid of coal worldwide.Richmond joins other West Coast cities who have banned coal shipping. For example, in 2014, Oregon regulators rejected a proposed coal-export terminal on the Columbia River. Oakland banned coal exports in 2016.Photo: General Motors",solar

Further, coal-fired power plants is forecast to decline by 13% in 2020. Both natural gas and coal are fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the EIA says green energy — solar and wind — is expected to grow by 20%. Texas in particular, which leads the US in wind, is expected to see a big jump in wind and solar.As for 2021, the EIA says:EIA expects these trends to continue into 2021. EIA forecasts US generation from non-hydropower renewable energy sources will grow by 17% next year as the electric power sector continues expanding solar and wind capacity. This increase in renewables, along with forecast increases in natural gas fuel costs, contributes to EIA’s forecast of a 2.3% decline in natural gas-fired generation in 2021.

2020/01/16,"BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager, announced that it will no longer invest in thermal coal. It also said it will drop company directors who fail to act on financial risks from climate change.As a result, BlackRock will drop around $500 million in thermal coal investments. It manages around $7 trillion of funds.According to the Guardian, BlackRock has announced several new changes in its investment approach, including:Making sustainability integral to portfolio construction and risk management;Exiting investments that present a high sustainability-related risk, such as thermal coal producers;Launching new investment products that screen fossil fuels;And strengthening our commitment to sustainability and transparency in our investment stewardship activities.BlackRock has joined Climate Action 100+, a pressure group of large asset managers that calls for the biggest polluters to reduce their emissions to respond to the climate crisis.In a letter to clients, BlackRock’s Global Executive Committee said:Thermal coal is significantly carbon intensive, becoming less and less economically viable, and highly exposed to regulation because of its environmental impacts. With the acceleration of the global energy transition, we do not believe that the long-term economic or investment rationale justifies continued investment in this sector.As a result, we are in the process of removing from our discretionary active investment portfolios the public securities (both debt and equity) of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production, which we aim to accomplish by the middle of 2020.As part of our process of evaluating sectors with high ESG risk, we will also closely scrutinize other businesses that are heavily reliant on thermal coal as an input, in order to understand whether they are effectively transitioning away from this reliance.As Electrek reported on January 14, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said in an annual letter to CEOs:In the near future — and sooner than most anticipate — there will be a significant reallocation of capital.Some environmental groups, such as Extinction Rebellion, are skeptical about BlackRock’s announcement, while others, such as the Sunrise Project, which supports climate-crisis campaign groups, welcomes the news.“Putting climate change at the absolute center of its business is the way every company should respond to this planetary emergency,” said Diana Best of the Sunrise Project [via the Guardian].Meanwhile, in the coal industry, coal companies like Murray Energy are declaring bankruptcy. As Electrek reported on December 18, “[CEO] Robert Murray spent tens of millions from the company coffers to pay himself, his successor, and several anti-science and anti-environment lobby groups, according to new court filings.”But this week, Quest Energy’s coal miners in Kentucky blocked coal shipments because they haven’t been paid.According to Kentucky.com,The miners said about 50 employees are owed for three weeks of work, totaling $2,000 to $3,000 [each].The blockade echoes a protest that miners in Harlan County carried out last summer when a coal company called Blackjewel filed bankruptcy.The final checks the company issued to hundreds of miners in Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia bounced, leaving many overdrawn.Fink’s hint in his letter to CEOs wasn’t exactly subtle. BlackRock didn’t mess around, announcing their termination of thermal coal investments just two days later.We at Electrek firmly believe that the only way emissions can be reduced is for fossil-fuel investments to stop, and for green energy investments to be significantly boosted. The science and technology and innovation is there — it needs financial support.Fossil fuels will be less and less viable as they become more expensive, and the government subsidies for these polluters must stop. Money should be put toward growth of green energy. BlackRock’s announcement is a welcome one.",solar
2020/01/15,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) has equipped its new fleet of 33 GILLIG diesel buses with cost-saving solar panel systems.The solar systems are made by eNow, a Warwick, Rhode Island-based company that makes mobile solar battery-charging technology for commercial transport. eNow worked with RIPTA on a pilot program for more than two years to test the effectiveness of their solar panels on buses.RIPTA received a green energy grant from the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation through the Renewable Energy Fund that covered 2/3 of the cost.The solar systems are designed specifically for the transportation industry and will extend the vehicle battery life and optimize battery performance, thus saving RIPTA around $80,000 a year. Further, it reduces the amount of diesel fuel used, thus reducing emissions.Guy Shaffer, chief marketing officer at eNow, who made the solar panel systems, told Electrek:Solar charges the batteries on commercial transportation. Our technology has helped transform the heavy-duty diesel transport business — existing equipment as well as new equipment. Our system eliminates the need to idle. With solar, the batteries will last longer.When I asked Shaffer why RIPTA invested in diesel vehicles rather than electric, he said,The purchase decision takes place years before the buses are delivered. I’m sure electric buses are in [RIPTA’s] queue to be purchased.Upfront, an average diesel transit bus costs around $500,000, compared with $750,000 for an electric bus. But in the long run, electric buses provide greater cost savings, not to mention a huge reduction in emissions. An electric bus could save $400,000 in fuel expenses and $125,000 in averted maintenance costs. Therefore, they are a cost-effective method of transportation.Scott Avedisian, RIPTA’s chief executive officer, said in RIPTA’s press release that RIPTA “will explore the feasibility of having the panels installed on more buses in the future.” What we’d really like to see at Electrek is RIPTA investing in electric buses. eNow is working on solar for e-buses, so let’s see that happen with all public transit authorities.The European Commission announced yesterday that it will be budgeting at least €1 trillion of investment over the next 10 years to make Europe carbon neutral.As Electrek previously wrote on December 13:The European Commission (EC) released a new climate change action plan… known as the European Green Deal, with the subtitle, “striving to be the first climate-neutral continent.” The plan aims to make the European Union “climate neutral” by 2050.Today’s budget announcement says that the plan will use a mix of both private and public funds, including one-quarter of the EU’s budget, according to EuroNews.Part of the budget is a €100 million Just Transition Fund. That money is to help countries like Poland transition to green energy. Poland is still on 80% coal.Members of European Parliament will vote on the resolution tomorrow. The EU wants the Green Deal to be law by March 2020.It says will set out the conditions for transition, provide predictability for investors, and ensure the transition to carbon neutrality is irreversible.The $5 million Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) Impact Fund has formally announced its launch today. This is a welcome addition, as investments in early-stage cleantech have taken a hit in recent years, yet seem to now be making a comeback.The new cleantech impact fund considers a range of criteria beyond the traditional ability to make returns.The criteria consists of:LACI recently made investments in Seatrec, which provides off-grid clean, renewable electricity for research and monitoring, and Freewire, which delivers mobile and off-grid EV charging and power supply technologies.LACI President and CEO Matt Petersen told Electrek:The need to accelerate climate action is greater than ever, and we are thrilled to announce the LACI Impact Fund. Investing in LACI’s portfolio companies will help our startups scale not just their growth, but also their economic, environmental, diversity, and social impact.

2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about. What do you say, should Electrek do a Moke video next?",solar
2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2020/01/14,"The European Commission announced today that it will be budgeting at least €1 trillion of investment over the next 10 years to make Europe carbon neutral.As Electrek previously wrote on December 13:The European Commission (EC) released a new climate change action plan… known as the European Green Deal, with the subtitle, “striving to be the first climate-neutral continent.” The plan aims to make the European Union “climate neutral” by 2050.The Hill explains:The EU is currently third, behind China and the United States, in global greenhouse gas emissions. The new plan contains even more ambitious emissions cuts than the EU’s Paris Climate Agreement commitments. The EU’s goal for 2030 has gone from a 40% reduction to a 50% reduction, with the added goal for 2050 of eliminating 100% of the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions.But the European Green Deal is light on the details of how this massive transition would actually proceed. For example, the plan doesn’t provide a detailed description of the energy sources that would power the EU to zero emissions by 2050, what technologies might help it get there, or any policy mechanisms that could help incentivize climate-friendly business practices. [EC president Ursula] von der Leyen acknowledged this, calling it a ‘broad road map,’ rather than a step-by-step action plan.Today’s budget announcement says that the plan will use a mix of both private and public funds, including one-quarter of the EU’s budget, according to EuroNews.Part of the budget is a €100 million Just Transition Fund. That money is to help countries like Poland transition to green energy. Poland is still on 80% coal.Members of European Parliament will vote on the resolution on Wednesday. The EU wants the Green Deal to be law by March 2020.It says will set out the conditions for transition, provide predictability for investors, and ensure the transition to carbon neutrality is irreversible.Katie Treadwell, energy policy officer at WWF European Policy Office, said:A climate-neutral Europe needs everyone to play their part. The proposed just transition mechanism is an important step toward making that happen.But a ‘just transition’ is not ‘just’ if regions are locked into unviable fossil fuels. It is not a ‘transition’ if there is no deadline for getting climate neutral. MEPs and EU Member States must improve the proposal so that regions show how and by when they will get free from gas, oil, and coal.Photo: European Union External Action",solar

According to IBM:This new research could help eliminate the need for heavy metals in battery production and transform the long-term sustainability of many elements of our energy infrastructure.[Initial tests indicate] it can be optimized to surpass the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries in a number of individual categories including lower costs, faster charging time, higher power and energy density, strong energy efficiency, and low flammability.The scientists who developed lithium-ion batteries won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in October 2019. Heavy metals like cobalt and nickel are used in lithium-ion batteries, and cobalt has to be mined.Dr. Daeha Joung, who specializes in experimental biophysics and nanoscience at Virginia Commonwealth University, told the Hill:Unfortunately, the actual design concept and new materials have not been disclosed, presumably due to intellectual property issues.If the claim is valid, what is impressive about it is that they have overcome most of all the current limitations of lithium-ion battery technologies.The world’s oceans set a new record for high temperatures in 2019, according to a study published in the journal Advances In Atmospheric Sciences. The past decade is also the warmest on record.An independent analysis of the same data by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirms the study’s findings.What are the repercussions? More storms, floods, droughts, wildfires, and a rise in sea levels. The rising temperatures are also harming sea life.The temperature increase is a result of the acceleration of greenhouse gases, especially due to humans burning fossil fuels.Professor John Abraham at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, one of the studies’ authors, told the Guardian:The data we have is irrefutable, but we still have hope because humans can still take action. We just haven’t taken meaningful action yet.Lijing Cheng, the paper’s lead author and an associate professor at the International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said [via CNN]:The amount of heat we have put in the world’s oceans in the past 25 years equals to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions.And today, Larry Fink, the CEO of the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock, said in an annual letter to CEOs:Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects… But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.Climate change is almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise with BlackRock. From Europe to Australia, South America to China, Florida to Oregon, investors are asking how they should modify their portfolios.And because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself.In the near future — and sooner than most anticipate — there will be a significant reallocation of capital.Fink’s comments come ahead of Davos next week.

It is produced from concrete, brick, and plasterboard waste, and it’s compressed without firing.The brick will be commercially produced by Kenoteq, a commercial arm of Heriot Watt.Professor Gabriela Medero, inventor of the K-Briq, said:I have spent many years researching building materials and have been concerned that modern construction techniques exploit raw materials without considering that they are among the largest contributors to carbon emissions.

It is sustainable and not kiln-fired so it is far better for the environment and represents massive savings for the construction industry in terms of related taxes.Building and construction are responsible for 39% of all global carbon emissions, according to the World Green Building Council.So if this brick proves durable, it could potentially revolutionize the construction industry, not only in Scotland but globally. Affordable housing shortages are a chronic problem around the world, and so is the pollution caused by building. So the construction industry is coming up with innovations like tiny housing, net zero housing, and modular housing.These bricks could be yet another great and impactful solution.

There’s an urgent need to set a long-term 2050 goal, but at present the UN only has a goal to keep international aviation emissions at 2020 levels.Environmental groups remain skeptical that carbon offsets alone are enough to mitigate aviation emissions, which rose by nearly a third between 2013 and 2018, and 70% faster than predicted.The International Air Transport Association predicts that 7.8 billion passengers will be flying by 2036, a near doubling of the 4 billion who flew in 2017.Beginning in 2020, British Airways is offsetting all emissions from its UK flights through verified carbon-reduction projects. Last year, EasyJet pledged to offset carbon emissions from the fuel used on all of its flights, making it the first major airline to pledge carbon neutrality across its network. KLM is aiming to reduce its carbon emissions 15% over 2005 levels by 2030, and SAS (Scandinavian Airlines) wants to reduce emissions by 25% over 2005 levels by 2030.These airlines, along with JetBlue, collectively flew roughly 237 million passengers last year.Photo: Airbus",solar
2020/01/09,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Donald Trump is expected to announce an overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) today, at 11 a.m. ET. Climate change consideration is expected to be eliminated. (In fact, the phrase “climate change” is not in the memo at all.)NEPA has been in place for 50 years and is considered a bedrock environmental regulation. Trump and many industry groups including fossil fuels, on the other hand, see NEPA as red tape.As E&E News explains:NEPA, signed into law by [Republican] President [Richard] Nixon, gives communities input and allows them to challenge federal decisions on projects like pipelines, highways, and bridges. And it requires federal regulators to analyze a host of impacts.The overhaul will help the administration advance projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which have caused concern about environmental impact and climate change. In the revised plan, federal agencies would not be required to consider the climate impact of a project. That will make it easier for fossil-fuel projects to proceed.The revised plan would establish two-year time limits for environmental impact statements and one-year limits for weakened environmental assessments.Up until now, NEPA has required, with the backing of federal courts, that the federal government considers a project’s carbon footprint when it comes to leasing public lands for fossil-fuel projects.E&E News continues:The Trump plan largely aligns with the wishes of energy companies, which have lobbied government executives to unwind what they called cumbersome permitting requirements.Environmentalists have countered that the administration’s rewrite merely benefits polluters and, as [the Center for American Progress] noted, could impede the way the country addresses and adapts to climate change.Food & Water Action policy director Mitch Jones said of the planned changes:Trump’s intention to remove climate considerations from all new infrastructure decisions is akin to lighting the fuse on a bomb and standing idly by as it burns down. Even conservative Republicans should be alarmed at the prospect of a future where new highways are built in flood zones, new factories are constructed next to drinking water sources, and new air pollution condemns our planet to climate chaos.Update: In a complete about-turn, according to the New York Times climate change reporter on Twitter at 12:30 p.m. today, Trump said the following:As per WH pool report- Trump when asked whether climate change is a hoax (which he has repeatedly claimed) he said.

2020/01/08,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The US saw a 2.1% fall in greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, according to a report by independent research company Rhodium Group titled “Preliminary US Emissions Estimates for 2019.” This was due to a decrease in coal plants, which resulted in an emissions drop of 190 million metric tons.The fall is good news, seeing how there was a rise of 3.4% in emissions in 2018. But the bad news is, it’s not enough. Even though renewables were up 6% in 2019, there has been little progress in reducing CO2 in other sectors. Industry is now a larger source of emissions than coal-fired power, and growing.The report states:Coal-fired power generation fell by a record 18% year-on-year to its lowest level since 1975. An increase in natural gas generation offset some of the climate gains from this coal decline, but overall power sector emissions still decreased by almost 10%.Unfortunately, far less progress was made in other sectors of the economy. Transportation emissions remained relatively flat [drop by 0.3%]. Emissions rose from buildings [2.2%], industry [0.6%], and other parts of the economy [agriculture, waste, land use, oil and gas methane, etc. — 4.4%], though less than in 2018. All told, net US [greenhouse gas] emissions ended 2019 slightly higher than at the end of 2016. At roughly 12% below 2005 levels, the US is at risk of missing its Copenhagen Accord target of a 17% reduction by the end of 2020, and is still a long way off from the 26-28% reduction by 2025 pledged under the Paris Agreement [which, of course, the US withdrew from under the Trump administration].The renewable energy blog Green Coast has rounded up six innovative green energy projects around the world that demonstrate future potential. Click on the article here to read the full roundup, and we’ve summarized their choices below.

(It also has offices in Montreal and Dublin.)According to ORPC, “it is the only company to have built, operated, and delivered power to a utility grid from a tidal energy project (in Maine), and to a remote community grid from a river energy project (in Alaska).”ORPC has announced that director Stuart Davis is succeeding Chris Sauer as CEO, as of January 20. Davies joined the board of directors in 2019.Davies was chief investment officer of Global Opportunistic Credit and an investment committee member of Sankaty Advisors, where he worked for 17 years. He is also involved with the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative as a member of its renewable energy finance round table.Davies said:We are creating the opportunity to transition remote communities off diesel power by harnessing energy from river and tidal currents using ORPC’s proprietary RivGen® and TidGen® Power Systems. Providing predictable baseload power as the key part of smart microgrids that also combine wind, solar, and energy storage to handle peak load demands will give these communities smart, emission-free, energy independence.

Its rise in popularity is because it’s cheap. (The US Energy Information Administration says there’s enough to last 80 years — even more reason to keep up the momentum with renewables.) Natural gas may be cleaner than coal, but it still causes harmful emissions. Further, the report states:There are low-cost technology solutions to reduce oil and gas methane emissions, but their deployment at scale requires strengthening regulations that the Trump administration instead has been weakening.The US has the resources and technology to continue to reduce emissions. It needs collective momentum, which is happening at local and state levels. It needs the desire at the federal level, and the federal government needs to stop supporting the fossil-fuel industry.

2020/01/07,"Dutch water recycling system Hydraloop has won Best of Innovation in Sustainability, Eco-Design, and Smart Energy at CES 2020 in Las Vegas.Hydraloop claims that its water recycling system is the first of its kind in the world.Hydraloop is headquartered at the water technology center the Water Campus in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands (a United Nations Innovating City). The US office is at the Water Council at the The Global Water Center in Milwaukee.Hydraloop has worked on research and development for a decade to produce water recycling systems to drastically reduce water usage. The result is a system that is affordable and easy to use, low-maintenance, and doesn’t compromise convenience or personal hygiene.In November 2017, the company brought their first product to market in the Netherlands. Hydraloop made their global launch at CES this year, where it won the Best of Innovation award.The product recycles 85% of all domestic water used. It cleans and disinfects shower, bath, and washing machine water it so it can be reused for toilet flushing, washing machines, the garden, or swimming pools.According to the CES website, Hydraloop:The treatment system combines five technologies: sedimentation, flotation, dissolved air flotation, foam fractionation, and an aerobic bioreactor. The sixth technology, which is the final treatment, is disinfection using UV light. You can read more about how Hydraloop’s systems work here.Arthur Valkieser, CEO and cofounder, explained in an email to Electrek:The reason why we started to develop our products is the fact that people use water very inefficiently. We use much more water than our ecosystem can produce. Fresh water is renewable only by rainfall on land, and the amount of rainfall is simply insufficient to the amount we withdraw from our earth.And, in the next 30 years our world population will grow from 7.8 billion to 10 billion, but we are already running out of water today.But, if in the next decades decentralized water recycling units become standard, just like other appliances at home, we can substantially curb the growing demand on fresh water we withdraw from the earth and even reverse the growth.It is absolutely ridiculous, and definitely not at all 21st century, that we still flush our toilets with drinking water or run our washing machine with it. Water is our ‘Blue Gold’ and we should treat it this way.The units come with an app that helps optimize reusing the recycled water.The product is currently available in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. US delivery will start in the second half of 2020. The US cost will start at $4,000 excluding tax, transportation within the US, and installation.

The article was published in Nature Sustainability.Burning coal creates particulate matter that harms people, plants, and regional climates.UCSD writes:The author, Jennifer Burney, associate professor of environmental science at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, combined data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on electric power generation with satellite and surface measurements from the EPA as well as NASA to gauge changes in local pollution before and after coal-fired unit shutdowns. She also studied changes in county-level mortality rates and crop yields using data from the Centers for Disease Control and the US Department of Agriculture.Burney found that between 2005 and 2016, the shutdown of coal-fired units saved an estimated 26,610 lives and 570 million bushels of corn, soybeans, and wheat in their immediate vicinities. The inverse calculation, estimating the damages caused by coal plants left in operation over that same time period, suggests they contributed to 329,417 premature deaths and the loss of 10.2 billion bushels of crops, roughly equivalent to half of a year’s typical production in the US.Burney said:Policymakers often think about greenhouse gas emissions as a separate problem from air pollution, but the same processes that cause climate change also produce these aerosols, ozone, and other compounds that cause important damages.California state lawmakers introduced a bill in Sacramento yesterday that aims to speed up the state’s compliance with existing targets to wean the state off fossil fuels entirely by 2030. All retail electricity is already required to be carbon-free by 2045.Assemblyman Rob Bonta (D-Alameda) announced the bill, which is called the California Green New Deal, along with nine other Democratic lawmakers. The bill includes “a federal jobs guarantee, universal access to clean water, and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,” according to the Sacramento Bee.Bonta said:We can’t afford not to pay for it. There’s no bigger threat to our planet, people, existence, state, all the residents of California than climate change. It is existential. When the federal government decides to go to war, sometimes endless war, we don’t ask how it’s being paid for. There’s many things we do we don’t ask how it’s going to be paid for. The money shows up. It turns up. When we’re trying to save our planet, you would think there would be a political will to make the investment.A 600-megawatt wind project is now under way in southeastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri for Liberty Utilities-Empire District.

Perry will be eligible for cash compensation.Perry served as a director at Energy Transfer Partners before stepping down at the end of 2016.Perry was confirmed as energy secretary on March 2, 2017, and then stepped down on December 1, 2019.Pipeline giant Energy Transfer LP owns the controversial Dakota Access crude oil pipeline, a 1,172-mile-long oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois. The Dakota Access is best known for months of protests against it by native Americans and environmentalists at Standing Rock. The Obama administration denied a permit for the Dakota Access pipeline in December 2016, but in January 2017, the Trump administration reversed that decision and approved construction.According to Bloomberg [via the Dallas Morning News]:Energy Transfer has been criticized not only for specific projects but for corporate governance practices as well.The MLP model the company employs means the general partner — in this case, LE GP — doesn’t have a fiduciary obligation to common investors. And board members aren’t required to be independent.The New York Times has shed light on unlikely bedfellows: local and state chapters of the civil rights group the NAACP and utilities companies. As the Times explains:Most Americans know the NAACP as a storied civil rights organization that has fought for equal access to public facilities, fairness in housing, and equality in education. But on energy policy, many of its chapters have for years advanced the interests of energy companies that are big donors to their programs. Often this advocacy has come at the expense of the black neighborhoods, which are more likely to have polluting power plants and are less able to adapt to climate change.Local chapters are largely autonomous, so the national office published a primer titled the “Top 10 Manipulation Tactics of the Fossil Fuel Industry” in April, and is sending national staff to work with local and state chapters on this issue.Jacqueline Patterson, who leads an environmental justice program for the national NAACP, said:Seeing all of those intersections and more, we really saw this as a civil rights issue. The NAACP is now engaging around pushing for policies and pushing for access to clean energy.The Times continues:Under her leadership, the group began connecting the dots between climate change and the impact of disasters like Katrina on African-American communities. The group also took a closer look at how rising sea levels and more intense storms might affect low-income, minority neighborhoods. And it started examining how air pollution from power plants affected nearby residents, many of them black.The world’s largest floating wind farm is now installed and connected to the grid off the northern Portuguese coast, near Viana do Castelo.It’s now supplying up to 8.4 MW to customers in Portugal, and will eventually produce a total of 25 MW of power.Maritime Executive reports:The three new WindFloat semisubmersible units are designed by California-based Principle Power and classed by ABS.

(Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, but the US is blaming Iran, who denies they were responsible. Saudi Arabia says Iranian weapons were used.)The attack on Aramco also caused a price spike of oil.The Guardian reports:Despite the latest attack, the price of oil remains below a peak of about $75 a barrel recorded in April last year.

Last year was the UK’s cleanest energy year on record.The National Grid includes nuclear energy in the mix, as well as wind, solar, and energy imported by subsea cables. That combination supplied 48.5% of the UK’s electricity in 2019. Fossil fuels — coal, gas, oil, and diesel — provided 43%. Biomass such as wood pellets made up 8.5%.The UK’s target year to become net zero is 2050, so the country is nearly at the halfway point.Coal now only provides 1.9% of electricity for Britain. By March, there will be four coal plants left in the country. Last summer, the country went for 18 days without burning any coal.Wind farms, solar panels, and hydro now generate just over 25% of the UK’s electricity.In Germany, the New Year brought in a price slash of 10% on Deutsche Bahn’s Intercity Express trains for trips of more than 50 km (31 miles).This cut is a result of Deutsche Bahn passing on to customers the government’s cut in value-added tax on rail travel from 19% to 7%. This is to encourage people to take the train rather than drive in order to cut emissions.The train company is also cutting fees for transporting bicycles.Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s main rail-service provider, is a private company, and the state is the single shareholder. The company believes this will increase the number of passengers by 5 million per year.The Israeli government has approved plans to erect hundreds of wind turbines in the north of the country.The Jerusalem Post reports:Israel targeted the conversion of 10% of the country’s electricity supply to renewable energies by 2020, and is aiming for a cumulative reduction of 17% by 2030.In November, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz vowed that Israel will move into a coal-free era of power production by the end of 2025, five years earlier than originally targeted. Electricity production from coal has been halved since 2015, according to the Energy Ministry, as Israel increasingly relies on its domestic supply of natural gas.The wind turbines are currently in the planning phase and will be implemented in the next couple of years.Photo: Iraqi prime minister press office",solar

By March, there will be four coal plants left in the country. Last summer, the country went for 18 days without burning any coal.The Guardian breaks down the sources of power:The National Grid figures show a dramatic shift in the last two decades. Wind farms, solar panels, and hydro power now generate just over a quarter of Britain’s electricity, compared with 2.3% in 1990. Nuclear power accounts for 17%, compared with nearly 20% in 1990. However, the use of gas — a fossil fuel — also shot up to generate more than 38% of the country’s power last year, compared with just 0.1% in 1990.In December, National Grid unveiled plans to invest almost £10 billion in the UK’s gas and electricity networks over the next five years. Of this, almost £1 billion has been earmarked for the transition to a net zero carbon electricity system by 2025, including investments in new equipment and technology.A further £85 million will support changes to the ways people heat their homes, switching away from gas boilers to technologies such as electric heat pumps and hydrogen boilers. National Grid estimates that more than 23 million homes will need to install new low-carbon heating solutions by 2050.Overall, this is a great milestone for the UK, but there are caveats. Bottom line, Britain is going in the right direction. They’re not Denmark, who gets nearly half their power from wind, but hey, coal is nearly gone, and fossil-fuel usage overall is falling. I do appreciate, however, that the Guardian stated what I would have stated anyway — that natural gas is a fossil fuel.The subsea cables are piping in electricity created by gas on the continent. So can that really be included in the “clean” mix? Just because natural gas is not produced on your soil doesn’t make it clean energy.Further, I recognize that nuclear energy is cleaner than fossil fuels (and it’s dropped a bit in usage, too), but it’s hardly without controversy. France and Germany disagree about whether it should be categorized as clean, as Electrek covered at the end of November. There’s also that small sticking point for nuclear of waste treatment — like, how Marie Curie’s lab is still radioactive and will be thousands of years after we’re all dead.And please work to ditch the gas asap, Britain. I knew that — I’m a British citizen and we always had gas heating. I’m hoping that the gas is an interim solution as the country transitions. And probably the nuclear, too — but good luck trying to find a place to bury the waste. Germany is stumped by that problem.But let’s end this on a positive note: Wind, solar, and hydro jumping from 2.3% in 1990 to over 25% is great. So let’s stay the course on that front.Photo: Peter Cavanagh/Alamy Stock Photo",solar

Gas is the least harmful fossil fuel available to support the transition to green energy, and we’ll continue to trade gas for years to come.’According to this year’s Q3 financial results, natural gas sales contributed around a quarter of the Ørsted’s revenue, down from more than a third in the same period last year.The two biggest money makers for the company are offshore wind development and power sales.Ørsted aims to reach 99% green energy production by 2025.A new study out of Stanford University, “Impacts of Green New Deal Energy Plans on Grid Stability, Costs, Jobs, Health, and Climate in 143 Countries,” finds that if the world makes a transition to green energy, nearly 30 million jobs will be created.The researchers define green energy as wind, solar, and water power. The researchers say it’s possible to achieve a transition by 2050. It would cost around $73 trillion. By 2050, the world will spend around $17 trillion per year on energy if we’re still using fossil fuels, but $6.8 trillion if we’re using renewable energy.Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and one of the authors of the study, told Inverse:You reduce your energy costs each year by 60%. Worldwide, you save about $30 trillion per year in health costs. Seven million people die from air pollution every year, and hundreds of millions more are ill. Climate costs are reduced, too.When you have renewables providing power, because there’s more distributed energy, that makes the energy infrastructure less prone to horrible weather events, terrorist attacks and things like that. Plus, you don’t rely on foreign oil or gas or anything else when you have renewables in your country, which reduces international conflicts over energy.",solar

Still water bottles are also banned in school catering services. The French government intends to phase out all single-use plastics by 2040.Here’s what else will be banned in the next couple years:2021: Plastic straws and cutlery, stirrers, plastic cup lids, confetti, Styrofoam containers, plastic packaging for fruits and vegetables that weigh less than 1.5 kg.2022: Disposable dishes in fast food restaurants for meals served onsite. Plastic fast-food toys. Plastic tea bags. Free plastic bottles in companies. And all public places must have mandatory water fountains.Only 25% of plastic packaging was recycled in France in 2018. The European average is 30%.France24 points out:This fall, an investigation by the online magazine Quartz found that at most 9% of plastic produced worldwide is recycled.The last 15 years saw more than plastic produced than in all previous human history, and plastic production is expected to triple again by 2050.Thailand banned plastic bags at major stores today, with the government aiming for a complete ban in 2021.Last year, Thailand reduced the use of plastic bags by 2 billion, or about 5,765 metric tons. It was the first phase of a campaign that encouraged consumers to use reusable bags.Thailand’s minister of natural resources and environment Varawut Silpa-Archa said today:Thailand was ranked sixth among the world’s top countries that dumps waste into the sea. During the past five months, we were down to 10th… thanks to the cooperation of the Thai people.Varawut said the country would have to continue to work diligently to eliminate plastic bag use at markets and in rural areas.In September, the Trump administration scrapped a Department of Energy (DOE) rule that would have phased out energy-inefficient incandescent light bulbs across the US. That initiative was introduced by George W. Bush’s administration in 2007 and was approved in 2017.Yesterday, a federal judge allowed California to proceed with the lightbulb efficiency standards. The Associated Press [via the Press Herald] reports:[US District Judge Kimberly Mueller of Sacramento] said state regulators appear to have acted properly under exemptions that gave special privileges to California and Nevada to adopt tougher regulations more quickly than the U.S. Department of Energy.In granting the exemptions, ‘Congress recognized, among other things, California’s history of leadership in energy efficiency regulations,’ Mueller wrote.Cronkite News out of Arizona reports that both environmental groups and utilities alike disagree with the DOE’s rollback. Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power wrote to the DOE, urging it to withdraw the proposal. The utilities say incandescents jack up consumers’ electric bills.Cronkite News continues:The Environmental Protection Agency website says widespread use of LEDs could save 44 large electric power plants’ worth of energy, or up to $30 billion in electricity costs, by 2027. LEDs can last up to 25 times longer than regular incandescent bulbs, which typically burn for 1,000 hours.The Natural Resources Defense Council yesterday published a guide to swapping out incandescent bulbs for LED bulbs, and selecting the “most efficient bulbs for your home, which will cut your energy bill and help avoid climate-warming pollution.” You can read that guide here.(And guess what?

2020/01/01,"William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have started 2020 with the launch of a global environmental initiative to “inspire a decade of action to repair the planet.”The Earthshot Prize “will seek answers to the biggest issues currently facing the planet, including: climate and energy, nature and biodiversity, oceans, air pollution, and fresh water.”Prince William and Duchess Kate will award the Earthshot Prize to five winners every year between 2021 and 2030 in an annual awards ceremony in different cities around the world. The cash prize will be for organizations or individuals who provide solutions to environmental problems.The prize will launch later in 2020.The Earthshot Prize was announced on social media on New Year’s Eve in a video narrated by filmmaker and environmentalist Sir David Attenborough:The Earthshot Prize is inspired by US President John F. Kennedy’s “Moonshot,” when he set a goal in 1961 to land American astronauts on the Moon before 1970:Just as the moonshot that John F. Kennedy proposed in the 1960s catalyzed new technology such as the MRI scanner and satellite dishes, we want our Earthshot challenges to create a new wave of ambition and innovation around finding ways to help save the planet.The challenges will be a chance for everyone’s voice to be heard, we want to motivate and inspire a new generation of thinkers, leaders, and dreamers. Our prizes will reward progress across all sectors of industry and society, not just technology. The prizes could be awarded to a wide range of individuals, teams or collaborations — scientists, activists, economists, leaders, governments, banks, businesses, cities, and countries — anyone who is making a substantial development or outstanding contribution to solving our environmental challenges.Prince William said:The earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: Either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet, or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate, and problem-solve.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge consulted with and has the backing of more than 60 organizations before launching the Earthshot Prize, not to mention the highly respected Attenborough. (In Britain, Attenborough is known as a “national treasure.”)According to BBC correspondent Jonny Dymond, the Palace says “it’s the biggest commitment the Duke has ever made.”This initiative puts the Cambridges firmly in the camp of those who believe in climate change and are working to eradicate it. This is a very public stand. Prince Harry has also said that he is “troubled” by climate change deniers.This can only be a good thing: The prize encourages innovation, and raises the profile of the urgent need to protect the environment.Photo: James Veysey/Shutterstock",solar
2019/12/31,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.The new all-electric Vauxhall Corsa E was announced earlier in 2019, and it’s due to go on sale in January 2020. (Opel vehicles are sold in the UK under the Vauxhall brand.) So Vauxhall is getting ready with a spiffy new ad it’s just released. Watch it closely — the Vauxhall Corsa E ad has got a lot of clever messaging about green energy, fossil fuels, and the importance of “switching up” to electric vehicles.It starts with a large digital clock that displays “23:59” and then the word “plug.” This could be referring to New Year’s Eve and the car’s launch in 2020 — and it could also be referring to the Doomsday Clock that recognizes climate change as a major threat.The voice-over then says, “It’s time to play by new rules … to forget about the past” — and it shows an older man wearing a cowboy hat and holding flowers standing in a “graveyard” full of tombstones shaped like gas pumps. A man sporting a cowboy hat in a British ad? Hmmmm. Nothing in ad messages is accidental. Is it a dig at the US, who isn’t playing ball in the climate summits? And the ad couldn’t be clearer in its declaration that gas is dead.It then states, “It’s time for you to wake up to 100% electric.” The choice of the words “wake up” are provocative. Check out the ad below, and let us know down in the comments what you think:Kansas has reduced CO2 emissions for the last decade, putting emissions in the state at their lowest level in 40 years. How? By adopting wind energy and moving away from coal.Kansas News Service explains the context:According to the US Energy Information Agency, Kansas emitted 58.2 million metric tons of CO2 in 2017. That’s good enough to make Kansas only the 31st largest emitter in the U.S.While it’s below the national average, on a global scale: ‘Kansas, if it were its own country, would be one of the top 60 CO2 emitters,’ said Joe Daniel, an energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.So, when Kansas sees a reduction in emissions like it has in the past decade, it matters, he said.Why the move to green energy in this red state? Because wind is cheaper than coal. 36% of electricity is produced by wind in the midwestern state now. Four new wind farms came online in 2019 in Kansas. As we’ve pointed out before, green energy is bipartisan among the American public.But as Kansas News Service rightly points out, there’s still the nearly 20 million metric tons of transportation emissions that need to be reduced.When Queen Elizabeth II of Britain made her Christmas Day speech, she said, “It’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.”And that’s why the school district in Richmond, in British Columbia, Canada, is to be commended for reducing its emissions by 25% over the last five years. Initiatives have included LED lighting, solar, and energy conservation.As the Richmond News reports:In total, the district reduced its carbon emissions by 1,700 tonnes [metric tons], according to the school board — the equivalent of taking 350 cars off the road, and saving approximately [CAD] $60,000 worth of carbon taxes.The school board also approved CAD $200,000 for solar initiatives in 2019. For example, in the district:In September, Ferris Elementary was named the greenest school in Canada for its environmental initiatives, for example, reducing garbage by 80%, growing fruits and vegetables in school gardens, replacing vending machines with refillable water coolers, and encouraging students to walk and cycle to school.ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. They partnered with the Times-Picayune and the New Orleans Advocate, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network, to produce an excellent piece of investigative work on the lack of accountability in the oil industry.The article is headlined, “How Oil Companies Avoided Environmental Accountability After 10.8 Million Gallons Spilled.” It digs into the background of the fact that:Louisiana still hasn’t finished investigating 540 oil spills after Hurricane Katrina. The state is likely leaving millions of dollars in remediation fines on the table — money that environmental groups say they need as storms get stronger.It’s a thorough look at industrial pollution in Louisiana, and it’s relevant on a national scale in the US.

2019/12/30,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB), as the year comes to a close, here are your top 5 favorite EGEB stories of 2019. We start with the most popular.The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.July 15 — Researchers at Australia’s Curtin University are calling their new thermal battery a “renewable energy game-changer,” as it will be able to store energy and release it directly from a solar system at any time, including overnight. As Professor Craig Buckley explained:Storage has long been a stumbling point for renewable energy but our prototype thermal battery is able to store and, as required, release solar energy without reliance on sunlight at all times.The battery uses a high-temperature metal hydride or metal carbonate as the heat storage medium and a low temperature gas storage vessel for storing the hydrogen or carbon dioxide.“At night, and in times of cloud cover, hydrogen or carbon dioxide is released from the gas storage vessel and absorbed by the higher temperature metal to form a metal hydride/metal carbonate, which produces heat used to generate electricity.Another researcher, Chris Moran, said:While a lithium battery stores electrical energy that can be used to provide electricity when the sun is not shining, this thermal battery stores heat from concentrated solar thermal, which can be used when the sun is not shining to run a turbine to produce electricity.It’s another form of energy storage — check out the largest concentrated solar thermal farm in the world — and the system itself would technically be providing the electricity. But a “game-changer?”April 12 — Researchers have come up with a new design coupling perovskites with silicon that could be a breakthrough for solar power, Science Magazine reports.Attempts to pair perovskite solar cells with silicon — absorbing both high- and low-energy light in the process — have presented a number of challenges, holding back the obvious potential of using the two materials together. But the new method involves using thin layers of perovskites on top of a silicon cell, converting light instead of generating current. The silicon cell then converts the light into electricity.Chemist Daniel Gamelin and the team of researchers predict the tandem of “topping a high-end silicon cell with the ytterbium perovskite should enable it to convert 32.2% of the energy it absorbs as sunlight into electricity, up from 27% — a 19.2% boost.”The solar potential of perovskites is well-noted and requires further research. But an efficiency boost of 20% in silicon solar cells is “one of the most exciting results I’ve seen in a long time,” Stanford perovskite expert Michael McGehee told Science.October 24 — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) questions Martin Hoffert, a scientist consultant for Exxon Research and Engineering in the 1980s, in this video from the Guardian. Hoffert confirms that as far back as 1982, the oil giant knew that the burning of fossil fuels would cause CO2 levels to rise, and thus raise the temperature of the earth.House Democrats on Wednesday laid out evidence that the oil behemoth ExxonMobil had known since the 1970s about the potential for a climate crisis and intentionally sowed doubt about it.October 30 — Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter late yesterday afternoon that he’d donate 1 million trees to the #teamtrees project launched by YouTube star MrBeast. He then changed his Twitter name to “Treelon” Musk.YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, who posts videos of stunts on the platform, was challenged in May on Reddit to plant 20 million trees to celebrate reaching 20 million subscribers on his YouTube channel.So he got together with other YouTube stars and launched #teamtrees on October 25. The project has a target of raising $20 million to plant trees around the world. Each tree costs $1.Tesla CEO Elon Musk asked MrBeast about the project on Twitter, and then in response to YouTube star Marques Brownlee, committed to donating 1 million trees on the spot. He then changed his Twitter name to “Treelon.”Elon followed through on his promises today:He’s already done it ! pic.twitter.com/bR547be77Q— Jon Hast (@ElectricTempus) October 30, 2019April 26 — It sounds like a bad joke: Want to give your solar power a jolt? Add some caffeine! But that’s what a team of researchers has done in caffeinating perovskite solar cells.A team of researchers published an article in Joule titled “Caffeine Improves the Performance and Thermal Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells.” They found the interaction between caffeine and lead ions in the perovskites becomes a “molecular lock” that “increases the activation energy during film crystallization, delivering a perovskite film with preferred orientation, improved electronic properties, reduced ion migration, and greatly enhanced thermal stability.”The cells were stable and more efficient. UCLA researcher Rui Wang told Cosmos the team was surprised by the results, including highly efficient findings on their first attempt of incorporating caffeine. Wang said,Caffeine can help the perovskite achieve high crystallinity, low defects, and good stability. This means it can potentially play a role in the scalable production of perovskite solar cells.",solar
2019/12/30,"US utility companies are borrowing big because interest rates are so low. Investors are keen to buy utility bonds because they offer safe and strong returns.So the bond cash — a record $90 billion in 2019 — is resulting in utility companies making more green energy investments.Utility companies are investing in wind and solar, and also modernizing their grids with the cash from the bonds.Bloomberg reports [via the Los Angeles Times]:‘Financing costs are lower than we ever thought they would be,’ Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said in an interview. ‘The low-interest rate environment helps the deployment of renewables.’Capital spending by utilities is set to reach an all-time high of $136 billion in 2019, according to industry group Edison Electric Institute.While utility credit ratings remain strong, they could take a hit if current levels of spending and borrowing continue.Since many electric companies are regulated monopolies, investors see them as a safe bet.Utility bonds currently have an average yield of around 3%. A 10-year treasury note yield high, in comparison, is today at 1.93%.The College Investor website says utilities are good investments because they’re recession-proof, they’re easy to understand, cash flows regularly, and “my dog could be a utility CEO.”What they mean by the dog statement is that utility companies have guaranteed pricing, customers, and a necessary product, so they are more resilient in the face of any potential bad leadership.In June, the Energy Foundation (EF) reported that the electric industry could raise between $250 to $500 billion with green bonds. That assessment came from a report, “Assessing the Potential for US Utility Green Bonds,” from Boston University’s Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE).Green bonds were first issued by the European Development Bank in 2007. Since then, they have increased globally at 60% annually.EF and ISE highlight Southern Power using green bonds to fund wind and solar, and DTE Energy in Michigan using them as well for green energy.We at Electrek are obviously not in the investment advice business. But if people are investing in utility bonds and green bonds that result in utilities moving away from fossil fuels and building sources of clean energy, then we’re all for it.Investing in grid modernization is also vital in order to prepare for clean energy and the rising numbers of electric vehicles on the roads.",solar

The London Stock Exchange Group’s FTSE Russell subsidiary runs the FTSE4Good indices, which is marketed to investors interested in environmental, social, and governance issues.During its semi-annual review this month, Russell added oil giants Rosneft and ConocoPhillips to the FTSE4Good list, as well as more fossil-fuel companies. There were already 65 fossil-fuel companies on the FTSE4Good indices.The FTSE4Good index rules ban coal firms, but it only excludes firms whose main business is coal production. Conglomerates are allowed.The Guardian reports:The London Stock Exchange Group’s head of sustainable business, David Harris, has previously told the Guardian he would not exclude the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring shareholder pressure to bear.Rosie Rogers, head of Greenpeace UK’s climate campaign, said:Looking at the number of oil companies listed in this index, this looks more like FTSE4Crude than FTSE4Good. It takes some brass neck to argue that there’s anything ‘ethical’ about investing in the fossil fuel companies driving the climate emergency.YouTuber Mr. Beast, with support from other big YouTubers such as Mark Rober, launched a huge initiative to plant 20 million trees a couple of months ago.With the help of the Arbor Day Foundation, a dollar donated to #TeamTrees meant one tree would be planted somewhere in the world.And as my colleague Ben Schoon reports over at 9to5Google, “as of December 19, the goal of raising $20 million, and in turn, planting 20 million trees was met.”Schoon continues:The project’s website will stay live indefinitely and anyone can still donate a dollar to plant a tree. Since the $20 million goal was met, another $500,000 dollars have been donated, and they keep coming in.The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved 45 applications to participate in the first year of its Community Solar Energy Pilot Program. As NJBPU reports in a press release:While NJBPU reserved 40% of the pilot program’s capacity for projects in which at least 51% of the capacity serves low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities, 100% of the approved renewable energy projects will serve LMI households in the state.Community solar projects divide solar among multiple subscribers who do not have an array onsite.The approved projects will all be located on landfills, brownfields, rooftops, or parking canopies. Some of the approved applicants include community groups, government entities, and private developers. The projects represent 77.61 MW of solar energy capacity, enough to power an estimated 15,500 homes.The program is part of Governor Phil Murphy’s (D-NJ) goal of achieving 100% green energy in the state by 2050. Murphy said:The Community Solar Energy Pilot Program will not only provide clean energy to our state’s residents, but it will also expand access to renewable energy for low and moderate income communities who have been previously unable to enjoy the benefits of solar energy.",solar
2023/03/16,"Tesla is launching a new feature to help homeowners with rooftop solar to charge their Tesla vehicles with excess solar power.Over the last few years, Tesla has made it clear that it is more interested in controlling a power load rather than bidirectional charging, which has become popular in the EV industry.Earlier this month, the automaker made waves when it announced a plan to offer unlimited overnight charging for $30 per month. That’s all about controlling the load from electric vehicle charging.Now we have learned about Tesla going after controlling electric vehicle charging in another way: charging from excess solar power.A new update to the Tesla mobile app showed new code revealing a feature focused on allowing Tesla vehicles to charge from excess solar power:– String Changes pic.twitter.com/PpEhHtOl4JThe feature is not showing on the consumer-facing side of the app yet, but the code talks clearly about optimizing charging for owners with solar power:“Plug in your vehicle at home during the day to charge using the excess clean energy generated by your solar system.”It makes it sounds like you can link your car to a specific solar site, and when plugged in at the site, Tesla will monitor when the car can charge from excess solar – likely meaning that the car won’t be prioritized, but if there is excess solar, it will charge.This is a good move, long overdue.Here in Blighty we have been able to do this for ages - there is a company here called MyEnergi that makes the Zappi charger, this monitors your solar output and your consumption and permits you to charge your car with any excess, rather than exporting it to the grid, for which there is not a great payment available.  Far better to fill your car with free electricity than defer it to later and pay extra, at much higher prices than you usually get for export.Even if you charge cheaply overnight, cheap is still more than free.We can likely expect the new feature to be accessible in an upcoming Tesla mobile app update.There are not a lot of products that go better together than electric vehicles and solar power. Who wouldn’t want to be driving on sunshine?I think there’s still room to optimize the use of the two products together, and that’s a good example.Now is a great time to begin your solar journey so your system is installed in time for those sunny spring days.

2023/03/16,"The Moke, based on a post-war British jeep-like vehicle, has become an iconic and eye-catching little buggy over the years. Now the US-based MOKE America has opened up a rental option called WeMoke to make these weird little electric vehicles more accessible to anyone looking for a unique driving adventure.Mokes from MOKE America are street-legal four-seater vehicles with small wheels, a low floor height and an open jeep-like design. The airy setup makes them popular in sunny areas and beach communities, where they’re often used as local transportation.They may be fun, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Trying to buy a Moke in the US will set you back close to $22K before all the fancy options like bimini tops, wooden steering wheels, or other neat features. Plus there’s a nearly six-month lead time for them to make one for you. But if that price is a bit rich for your blood — especially for a glorified 25 mph buggy — then perhaps renting one is more your style?MOKE America’s sister company WeMoke is hoping that idea will catch on, and recently added several resort cities in Florida to its growing list of rental locations. The Sunshine State now joins Georgia, Tennessee, Hawaii, and New York as locations where you can hop in a Moke and cruise around to your heart’s content.The prices are a bit steeper than a typical rental car, starting at $125 per hour or $475 per day, but somehow I don’t think your homemade music video will look quite as good with a Hertz rental car rolling through it. Anyone renting a Moke is going for style points, not pure utilitarian transportation.The Moke vehicles obviously rely on their unique look and driving experience to command that high price, which is good because they can’t really rely on their performance.As minicars that fit into a legal designation known as low-speed vehicles (LSVs), these Mokes top out at 25 mph (45 km/h). They are allowed to operate on roads with speed limits posted up to 35 mph (56 km/h), but you won’t want to take them on the highway (nor are you even allowed to).For beach communities though, these small electric fun-mobiles might just be perfect. And with 40 miles (64 km) of range per charge, they’ve likely got enough battery for a whole day of fun in the city. They might not be fast, but they actually wound up at a race track in a surprising way. The company is providing a fleet of the little EVs in a partnership with South Florida Motorsports to serve as VIP transportation throughout the Miami International Autodrome, the location of the upcoming Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Last year there, 20 Mokes providing transportation around the race.As MOKE America founder Tod Rome explained:We were thrilled to be part of the inaugural big race weekend last year. And we’re even more excited to be back for future years. South Florida Motorsports, LLC has brought a first-class, luxury racing experience to South Florida and the attention of the world. Our open-air Mokes make people happy as they are driven around the campus, and we love putting smiles on people’s faces.Hmmm, I might just need to get myself into one of these Mokes soon to see what all the fuss is about.

2023/03/15,"Dallas-based infrastructure manufacturer Arcosa (NYSE: ACA) said today that it’s received $750 million worth of wind turbine tower orders, so it’s building a new factory where it can make them.The majority of the company’s wind turbine tower orders will support wind energy projects currently under way in the US Southwest, so that’s why it will build its new factory in Belen, New Mexico, southwest of Albuquerque.As of 2022, New Mexico had 4,235 megawatts of installed wind capacity, which powers 35% of its electric grid.Arcosa plans to invest $55-60 million to buy a property in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. It will modify the existing plant and procure the necessary equipment for the new factory, which is expected to create around 250 jobs.Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) said:The transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying, and skilled jobs. Arcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities – this is a win-win.The $750 million worth of new orders are expected to be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit included in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The state of New Mexico is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act job-creation fund to the fit-out of the new factory. The city of Belen is going to contribute to the project with Industrial Revenue Bonds.The project is expected to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years.Antonio Carrillo, Arcosa’s president and CEO, said:We look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust. Our new facility will strengthen our position in the wind tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest.The outlook for our wind business remains favorable, reflecting rising demand for access to clean energy. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we have received wind tower orders in excess of $1.1 billion.Production of Arcosa’s New Mexico factory is expected to begin in mid-2024, and current orders will provide Arcosa’s new factory with a healthy level of backlog through 2028.Read more: Wind, solar, batteries make up 82% of 2023 utility-scale US pipelinePhoto: ArcosaUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

2023/03/15,"VW introduced its much anticipated affordable EV Wednesday, deemed the ID 2all concept with up to 450 km range (279 miles). After doubling down on its electric vehicle strategy with a new close to $200 billion investment (€180 billion) to accelerate digitalization and EV development over the next five years, VW is plowing ahead with a new EV concept.VW delivered over 570,000 EVs last year, maintaining its position as BEV market leader in Europe, yet the automaker believes it’s well positioned for future growth with several new vehicle releases on deck.To fend off incoming competition from Tesla, and many others, Volkswagen has introduced its economical electric vehicle, the ID 2all concept, that costs under $27,000 (€25,000). The ID 2all is as spacious as its Golf model and as inexpensive as the Polo sitting below the recently upgraded ID. 3, with up to 279 miles range (450 km) and several new features. CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Shafer, explains:We are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally – with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand. The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design. We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.VW’s affordable EV will be based on its new modular electric drive (MEB) platform, dubbed the MEB Entry Platform, and will be the first vehicle with front-wheel drive based on it. Initial plans called for Volkswagen’s ID. LIFE concept to be the first affordable EV based on the new platform designed for the smaller car segment, but those plans have seemingly been tossed to the side.The exterior takes inspiration from Volkswagen classics like the Beetle and Golf, previewing a new design language from the automaker. On the outside, the ID 2all features a “clear and powerful” stance with strong fender flares covering a wide track, long wheelbase, and short overhangs alongside a cleaned-up front end.Volkswagen recently brought back former Bentley and Audi designer Andreas Mindt as head of design for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, who says the VW ID 2all concept is based on three pillars – stability, likability, and enthusiasm.One of the most prominent elements of the new interior design is the C-pillar design developed for the first Golf model. As such, the interior features a spacious, high-quality appearance.The 12.9 touch display has a new menu structure with a separate air condition control panel below it. In addition, the new multifunction steering wheel is minimalist, with two thumb wheels and buttons on either side.Powered by a “powerful electric drive motor,” the ID. 2all with an output of 222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS, achieving 0 to 60 mph (0-100 km/h) in under seven seconds.Volkswagen says its new electric car can be charged to 80% in less than 20 minutes, although specifics are not mentioned.Despite the ID 2all being deemed a concept vehicle, Volkswagen says it will unveil the production version of the ID 2all for all European markets in 2025 with a goal of starting it at less than 25,000 euros.The automaker now plans for at least one in every five vehicles sold globally to be electric by 2025, with the production version of the ID 2all being one of ten EVs launched by VW by 2026.This year VW will introduce the new ID. 3, the ID. Buzz, and the ID. 7, which will be followed up by a compact electric SUV in 2026.As always for german prices, 25.000€ is including 19% VAT (EU prices always include VAT, which range from 15..25%, 20% being most common), thus translated to USD sans VAT, that'd be ~22,200. And of course that's for the base model with guesstimated something like 300km range and stripped features, but hey.The magic is, that though it's 22 cm shorter than the ID.3 (and even a bit less high) it has ~100 liters more luggage space (490..1,330 vs 385..1,267, bigger number with folded seats), yet likely less space for the rear passengers. That's achieved via the front wheel drive rather than RWD for the ID.3, which might be a little of a downer to many, but to me it's a good trade - I love space efficiency! To save length, it doesn't have a frunk, but it does have a big space below the trunk plus a ~50 liters space below the rear seats. And they can, as from the pics, fold completely flat - and the right front seat can also be folded flat, giving way for cargo of up to 2,20 meters length 💪 This is definitely my car after my Ioniq EV I bought in 2018 when I plan to replace it in 2028 🤩 (and it'll have matured till then)Btw @Peter ""222 hp (166 kW) and 226 PS"" are all the same figure with different units, PS being ""Pferdestärken"" which is the same as horsepowers, only that (DIN) PS is measured differently and has a different factor to kW than (SAE) hp.Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Volkswagen has plans to bring the ID 2all concept to the US. The good news, however, is that VW is planning to bring it to production. The real question will be: Can they produce it for the price they are saying? Or perhaps, more importantly, can they produce it profitably at that price?An under $27k, a good-looking electric vehicle with nearly 300-miles range from the VW brand would, in my opinion, sell well.

2019/12/23,"More than 600 gallons of diesel were dumped into the water in the Galapagos Islands after a ship was capsized by a falling container and crane.The ship tipped over off the coast of San Cristobal Island, the easternmost Galapagos island. Here’s the moment the spill happened:A pendulum action in two phases occurred. The container holding an electric generator slid across the deck of the ship, because the ship appears to not have been tethered properly. The container then drags the crane over and pushes the boat halfway over. Finally, the boat flips completely after the crane falls on it.According to France 24, “The same barge, which is used to transport fuel and construction materials to the Galapagos, had sunk previously in February 2018 due to a weight imbalance, in a port on the Guayas River [in western Ecuador].”Six hundred gallons is not anywhere near the catastrophic level of, say, the Exxon Valdez disaster. That spill dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil into the Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989.But the Galapagos archipelago is a Unesco World Heritage Site. It is home to one of the most fragile and diverse ecosystems on the planet. It’s the only place where certain species of iguanas, giant turtles, and sea lions live.Ecuador’s presidential communications office said: “The situation is under control, and a series of actions have been deployed to mitigate the possible effects.”According to the BBC, the Galapagos National Park said the Ecuadorian Navy and environmentalists were “putting up containment barriers and absorbent cloths to reduce the environmental risk.”",solar
2019/12/23,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Stockholm-headquartered SSAB’s North American unit SSAB Americas intends to produce fossil-free steel in its US mills by 2026.And its Montpelier, Iowa, mill is on track to be run on 100% green energy by 2022, according to SSAB Americas.SSAB’s US mills use scrap-based mini-mills with electric arc furnace (EAF) technology, using almost 100% recycled materials in their production process. SAB Iowa and SSAB Alabama, near Mobile, will eventually use Sweden-produced, fossil-free sponge iron, a direct reduction of iron ore to iron, which will result in the eventual production of fossil-free steel.SSAB Iowa partners with MidAmerican Energy, which is powered primarily by wind farms in Iowa (pictured above).Chuck Schmitt, president of SSAB Americas, said:SSAB continues to innovate our products and manufacturing processes, and accordingly, we will transition toward fossil-free steelmaking and renewable energy. Ultimately, our goal is to create a completely fossil-free value chain, from the raw materials and through to the end products.US Steel will close the Great Lakes Works steel mill on Zug Island, downriver from Detroit. This will result in layoffs of up to around 1,500 jobs in April 2020. The mill services the auto industry.US Steel will shift some of the work to its vertically integrated plant in Gary, Indiana, and the Great Lakes Works mill’s division that rolls slabs into steel sheets will shut down by the end of 2020. The company is working to reverse forecast fourth-quarter operating losses.US Steel stated that it will be investing more in electric mini-mills, which are cleaner and more flexible.As the Detroit News explains:The planned reworking of US Steel’s mills in some ways mirror changes in the global auto industry that have Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV adjusting global footprints — and in some cases building new facilities — to replace outdated business practices and manufacturing processes.Without sooty smokestacks, electric-arc mini-mills can coexist in suburban areas without affecting the environment of its neighbors.‘For many years, that plant has been polluting the southwest area,’ said Sandra Turner-Handy, engagement director for the Michigan Environmental Council. ‘It’s good that the environmental impacts will lessen, but it’s a loss of jobs. It’s a relief for the residents who have suffered for so many years because of that plant.’The Windsor Star reported in June:US Steel Great Lakes Works has been listed as having “high-priority violations” every quarter annually for the last three years, according to enforcement and compliance records by the US Environmental Protection Agency.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday that the plant is closing because it is too expensive to run. And Peter Navarro, the White House’s director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy, told CNN on Friday that US Steel “did not adapt with the times. They are paying for it dearly.”In 2018, the Trump administration put a 25% tariff on steel imports. There was a short-term rise in steel prices, and then an industry slump followed due to an oversupply of US-made steel, a continued supply of tariff-exempt steel imports, and low demand.Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson published a study on Friday that says going 100% green will pay for itself in seven years. Jacobson’s research underpinned the Green New Deal, according to Bloomberg.Jacobson’s study, which is titled, “Impacts of Green New Deal Energy Plans on Grid Stability, Costs, Jobs, Health, and Climate in 143 Countries,” was published in the journal One Earth.It would cost $73 trillion to revamp power grids, transportation, manufacturing and other systems to run on wind, solar and hydro power, including enough storage capacity to keep the lights on overnight.But that would be offset by annual savings of almost $11 trillion, the report found.Jacobson claims in his paper:Studies among at least 11 independent research groups have found that transitioning to 100% renewable energy in one or all energy sectors, while keeping the electricity and/or heat grids stable at a reasonable cost, is possible.Photo: Rodney White/Des Moines Register",solar
2019/12/20,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.According to a Pew Research Center poll [via PV Magazine], 46% of U.S. homeowners have “given serious thought to adding solar panels at their home in the past year.” That’s grown by 6% from three years ago.The survey was conducted October 1-13, 2019, among 3,627 US adults.What are the reasons?Additionally, 92% of Americans favor expanding solar power overall. Further, according to Pew:About two-thirds of US adults (67%) say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, and similar shares say the same about government efforts to protect air (67%) and water quality (68%).Mainland Spain achieved its very first coal-free day as wind output hit a record high, according to grid operator REE. The coal-free day was on December 14. (Coal-fired output continued in the Balearic islands.)According to Argus Media:Spain registered periods of very low coal-fired generation last summer, but did not go coal free in any single hour because of technical constraints in the distribution network in the northern region of Asturias.Portuguese utility EDP’s 562 MW Abono 2 facility was the only one of 25 coal-fired power units in mainland Spain to operate on several days in the summer.Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis in Sydney, makes a case in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists about how India is moving away from coal and toward green energy. Buckley’s take is optimistic, in contrast to many of the opinions of the climate summit outcomes in Madrid. (The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists are the keepers of the Doomsday Clock.)The main reason? Solar prices have dropped massively, allowing India to shift away from the dirty fossil fuel. (Read his article for a more in-depth look at why this shift has occurred. A need for clean air and water is a big motivator, for one.)Buckley points out that Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is planning a fivefold expansion of the electricity generated from renewable energy sources by 2030. Buckley explains:This means that India is committed to more than meeting the goals of its national contributions in  the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement; it is going to ‘overdeliver,’ in the parlance of economists. This development is all the more astonishing, because just a few years ago India was a villain when it came to coal use; in 2015, Modi’s ruling party had wanted to more than double India’s mining of coal, to 1.5 billion metric tons by 2020, despite the risks this posed to the climate and the country.As India benefits from the shift to domestic renewable energy, other emerging market nations are watching, keen to leverage the same benefits for their own countries.And therein lies a key path to global decarbonization and a much-needed solution to limit global warming.And none too soon.Ebusco, the Dutch electric bus company whose slogan is “Zero emission is not a dream. It is a choice,” has delivered 60 e-buses to Qbuzz, a Dutch public transport company.This week, the 60 Ebusco 2.2 (12m) low-floor (LF) intercity buses with a range of up to 350 km (250 miles) hit the road in Dutch provinces Groningen and Drenthe. They will provide transport in Groningen and Drenthe for the next decade.Further, the buses will reduce carbon dioxide by more than 5 million kilos annually.E-bus convoy!

It’s expected to pass the Senate and get sign-off from Donald Trump.So what’s in there on the green energy front? Frankly, not a lot.Most House Democrats wanted tax breaks for offshore wind turbines, solar, electric vehicles, and big batteries. But Trump objected to them, so they were quashed to avoid a government shutdown.Auto companies had lobbied to save the tax credit for electric vehicles, but EVs were left out in the cold due to serious lobbying from the oil sector.As Electrek reported yesterday, an extension of the tax credit for EVs would have benefited US automakers GM and Tesla, who are the only automakers to have hit the 200,000 car limit for the $7,500 federal tax credit:Currently, several foreign automakers can still make full use of the tax credit, thus disadvantaging current offerings from two domestic automakers when compared to foreign competition.Electrek continues:Taxpayers will once again qualify for a 30% rebate (up to $1,000) on costs associated with the installation of an EV charging station, a 10% credit (up to $2,500) on 2- or 3-wheeled electric vehicles such as electric motorcycles, and a $4,000 credit for the purchase of a new fuel-cell vehicle. These credits previously expired at the end of 2017, but will now be available through the end of 2020.The package did include an increase in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by $208 million and increases funding for scientific research at the Department of Energy by $415 million.The bill extended tax credits for biodiesel fuel and some wind turbines. It also revived expired geothermal tax breaks.There are a lot of people that are unhappy about this watered-down green energy portion of the bill. The Washington Post reports:‘We’re missing a huge opportunity,’ said Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), chair of the House and Commerce subcommittee on climate change and the environment. ‘To say I’m disappointed is an understatement.’ Tonko had led more than 160 House Democrats urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in an open letter in October to ‘prioritize’ including the clean energy tax credits in the final spending deal with Republicans.Sierra Club’s executive director gave his assessment of the bill’s outcome on Twitter:.@HouseDemocrats were given a mandate to fight hard and secure policy victories on climate action, clean energy, and our children’s future.

Cold weather caused prices to spike in late October and early November — they had reached as high as $2.86 — but worries about oversupply have caused prices to slip again. Unless the market recovers, this will be the first November since 2015 when the price was lower at the end of the month than at the beginning.The New York Times also reported that there’s a glut of natural gas supply. In other words, supply is much greater than demand. On December 10, Chevron, the US’s second-largest oil company behind ExxonMobil, quietly mentioned at the end of a press release that it would be writing down $10 billion to $11 billion in assets, “more than half related to the Appalachia shale.”The number of gas rigs deployed nationwide has dropped to 132, from 184 last year. Further, the Times reports:In a recent report, Morgan Stanley estimated that demand for natural gas would grow for a few years but fall 13% between 2020 and 2030 as utilities increasingly switch to wind and solar power. Future regulations or a carbon tax put in place by lawmakers worried about climate change could accelerate the transition to renewables.And finally, some cities and towns are banning natural gas. Brookline, Massachusetts, recently became the first New England town to ban natural gas hookups in new construction, and Berkeley, California, outlawed it in July (it starts January 1, 2020) — the first city to do so. Many other California cities followed suit. An understanding of the damage that fracking does to the environment, as well as concern for pipeline safety, has driven this push to drop gas. However, Massachusetts bans will likely be challenged in court.Lawrence is the sixth-largest city in Kansas, with a population of nearly 97,000.

2019/12/18,"A new report revealed that the first satellite designed to monitor the earth with a new instrument called TROPOMI for methane leaks discovered that an accident at a fracking site in Belmont County, Ohio, in February 2018 resulted in one of the worst methane leaks ever recorded in the US.The methane released into the atmosphere from the Ohio fracking site exceeded the annual output of all but three European countries.The findings were published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by scientists from the EDF, SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, and Utrecht University.The article is titled, “Satellite observations reveal extreme methane leakage from a natural gas well blowout.”Methane is a potent human-made greenhouse gas that is responsible for more than 25% of global warming.

And bravo to the Dutch and American scientists for uncovering the truth about the extent of the Ohio leak’s damage.The bad news: This leak was incredibly damaging to the environment. Further, the fact that emissions from fossil fuels turned out to be much worse than we originally thought, in general, is extremely alarming.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) didn’t even know the full extent of the damage that oil and gas emissions do (although the EPA seems to be working more against than for the environment these days).Hopefully, this bad news can be turned into good if US regulatory bodies and legislation do something to, at the very least, contain these leaks, prevent them from happening, and ideally, eventually move away from fracking and natural gas use altogether.One more time: Natural gas is a fossil fuel.Photo: Ohio State Highway Patrol",solar

They will still be making fuel, it will just be fuel that didn’t come from digging. It will be fuel that came out of the air, from water and air.We’re picking the first customer now. It’s probably going to be a mining or minerals company in the Mojave Desert [in California] where I can show it at a big enough scale that Saudi Arabia can copy it.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote in a Financial Times op-ed that “to give us the best chance of combating climate change, governments must put a price on the cost of carbon, whether through a cap and trade system, a carbon tax, or other means.”The banking giant also announced that it’s overhauling its environmental policies, including “targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030″ and curbing the funding of fossil fuels.Goldman Sachs revised its Environmental Policy Framework for the first time since 2015.The bank will not finance any new upstream Arctic oil exploration or development or any new coal-fired power generation project unless it also includes carbon capture or emission cutting.It won’t finance new thermal coal mine developments and will phase out financing for thermal coal mining companies that don’t have transition plans.The bank will work with mining companies to cut emissions, and companies’ progress on cutting emissions will impact future financing. However, Solomon said, the bank will “continue to support clients in transactions that are important to economic activity.”Electrek firmly believes that the most effective way to promote green energy is with a carbon tax.Danielle Endres is a professor at the University of Utah who specializes in science and environmental communication research.Endres was an observer at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s 25th Conference of Parties (COP25). She wrote an op-ed for the Salt Lake Tribune about what she witnessed in Madrid during the summit. Following is an excerpt:As I witnessed a surge of youth-led activism in response to the COP25 negotiations in Madrid, I was alarmed and disheartened to see so little news coverage of the COP25 back home.I would have expected to see much more coverage of the negotiations, the alarming scientific evidence presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the pressing need for the largest emitters, including the US, to take swift and decisive measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions if we have any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.I am reminded of the old adage, ‘If you are not outraged, you are not paying attention.’One thing that became very clear while I was in Madrid is that there are people paying attention. In addition to the climate march in Madrid that drew an estimated 500,000 people calling for real government action on climate change, nearly every day inside the hallways of the COP25 convention activists, air protectors, and concerned youth staged events that called attention to the impending impacts of the continued climate crisis.Despite the best efforts of cities, states, and other sub-national government’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions… addressing the climate emergency requires national and international efforts. It requires working within the UNFCC framework to strengthen the Paris Agreement, and calling on the largest emitters to act with urgency and resolve.Photo: Heliogen",solar

Our firm’s long-term financial success, the stability of the global economy, and society’s overall well-being depend on it.In response to Goldman Sachs’ announcement, the Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club released an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the bank’s new environmental policies (click on the link to read it in full). They write:Goldman Sachs’ fossil finance policy is now the strongest among the big six US banks (the others being Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo). Goldman Sachs now has the strongest coal policy, and is the only bank in this group with any restrictions on any area of oil and gas financing.This policy revision does not, however, make Goldman Sachs a leader among major global banks; currently, the strongest policies among the bank’s global peers are from Crédit Agricole (France) on coal, and BNP Paribas (France), and UniCredit (Italy) on oil and gas.Overall, this policy revision from what its peers consider the most prestigious investment bank on Wall Street underlines that coal is an industry with no future. The policy also sets precedent on oil and gas, in that it is the first policy to preemptively restrict financing for any part of the oil and gas sector by a major US bank.This is a good precedent to set for a major US bank, but we at Electrek are in agreement with the Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club that Goldman Sachs needs to take their fossil finance policy further. The bank needs to stop funding fossil fuels entirely. Explicitly, that means oil and gas as well as coal.Hopefully, Goldman Sachs’ actions will encourage other major US banks to follow in its footsteps, but they all have some catching up to do with many global peers.Further, we couldn’t be more in agreement with Solomon: Electrek firmly believes that the most effective way to promote green energy is with a carbon tax.",solar

That’s because she has introduced the Affordable American-made Automobile Act.It’s a bill that would “stimulate demand for electric vehicles, make EVs more affordable for consumers, create incentives for charging infrastructure, and provide low-cost funding for manufacturing transformation.”Cars would only be eligible for a tax credit if the entire battery system is manufactured in the US.She explains what the bill would do:Speier says the bill has 29 Democratic original co-signers and support from the United Automobile Workers, the United Steelworkers, the Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.Bank OZK is investing in a new solar power plant to supply 100% of the electricity at its new corporate headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, and up to 40 other Arkansas banking locations. The headquarters will be occupied from the second quarter of 2020.The new power plant will have around 12,000 solar panels. It will be the third-largest commercial solar facility dedicated to a private-sector customer in Arkansas. The plant’s annual capacity will be 8.1 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which could power more than 1,000 homes for a year.The Moroccan community of Id Mjahdi, outside of Essaouira, is Africa’s first fully solar village. Moroccan solar power company Cleanergy installed a power station with 32 solar PV panels that generate 8.32 kilowatts of electricity for distribution via a mini-grid.(The village also didn’t have a water source, so a water tower was also built.)Cluster Solaire, a Moroccan nonprofit that supports green-tech companies, also helped set the project up, and it is seeking funding to build more solar villages.As CNN reports:The power station is connected to around 20 homes in the village, serving more than 50 people. Each house was provided with a fridge, water heater, television, oven, and an outlet to charge devices. The solar network has a battery that can supply up to five hours of electricity outside daylight hours.Morocco is leading efforts to fulfill that potential. It already meets 35% of its electricity needs from renewables and aims to increase its use of renewable energy to 52% by 2030, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).Morocco boasts the world’s largest solar farm.Mini-grids could be the most cost-effective solution for remote areas and could provide electricity for 500 million people by 2030.Photo: Jackie Speier",solar

The point of the study was to understand how fuel efficiency has changed in the US by looking at air and greenhouse gas pollution scores. It asks the question, “Have vehicles become more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly?”When it comes to comparing electric to gas:By calculating ‘the number of miles the vehicle can go using a quantity of fuel with the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline,’ manufacturers can find the miles per gallon of gasoline-equivalent or MPGe. Considering the average electric vehicle releases the same emissions as a vehicle that gets 80 mpg, electric cars impact average mpg levels significantly.In 2011, electric and hybrid cars only made up 2% of the US market, but now make up 10%.You can read the entire report here, but the main takeaways are:But here’s the good news: Electric vehicles are expected to make up more than half of the new cars sold in the next 20 years. If we’re lucky, maybe it’ll be even more than that.The European Commission (EC) released a new climate change action plan on Wednesday known as the European Green Deal, with the subtitle, “striving to be the first climate-neutral continent.” The plan aims to make the European Union “climate neutral” by 2050.The Hill explains:The EU is currently third, behind China and the United States, in global greenhouse gas emissions. The new plan contains even more ambitious emissions cuts than the EU’s Paris Climate Agreement commitments. The EU’s goal for 2030 has gone from a 40% reduction to a 50% reduction, with the added goal for 2050 of eliminating 100% of the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions.But the European Green Deal is light on the details of how this massive transition would actually proceed. For example, the plan doesn’t provide a detailed description of the energy sources that would power the EU to zero emissions by 2050, what technologies might help it get there, or any policy mechanisms that could help incentivize climate-friendly business practices. [EC president Ursula] von der Leyen acknowledged this, calling it a ‘broad road map,’ rather than a step-by-step action plan.However, the plan does recommend a carbon tax that would apply to emissions associated with imports from countries with weaker climate policies.Ester Asin, director of the European policy office at the World Wildlife Foundation, said of the new plan to the Guardian:The proposed package is comprehensive, identifying the right areas for action — from biodiversity and nature restoration to climate change and stopping deforestation.However, by emphasizing continued economic growth as a key objective, the commission has missed an opportunity to challenge the traditional growth paradigm in favor of an approach that would respect planetary boundaries.According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of September 2019, cumulative US-installed onshore wind capacity exceeded 100 gigawatts (GW) on a nameplate capacity basis.As of Q3 2019, 41 states had at least one installed wind turbine. Texas led the country with the most capacity at 26.9 GW, followed by Iowa (8.9 GW), Oklahoma (8.1 GW), Kansas (6.2 GW), and California (6.1 GW). The top four states make up 50% of the total US installed wind capacity.The EIA expects that an additional 7.2 GW of wind capacity will come online in December 2019 and that another 14.3 GW of wind capacity will come online next year. That would put the US at about 122 GW of wind capacity by the end of 2020.",solar

My remarks at the @GlobalCompact Caring for Climate event: https://t.co/ANumKCXmrl #COP25 pic.twitter.com/9UJ8JAouzH— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) December 11, 2019In his address on Wednesday (click on the link for Guterres’ full speech), he said:Earlier this year, before the G20 Summit, asset managers representing nearly half  of the world’s invested capital — some $34 trillion — wrote to the world leaders of the G20 demanding urgent climate action and calling on them to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide.As businesses back away from fossil fuels it helps send market signals to massively scale up innovative solutions.I am calling on you, leaders from the private sector and civil society, to challenge your governments to use this opportunity to make clear their economic development policies that will enable your companies to invest decisively in a net-zero future.We are still seeing too many bureaucratic and regulatory obstacles, including perverse fossil fuel subsidies and many other expressions of government action slowing down the private sector commitment to climate action.I’m meeting more and more business leaders that complain that they cannot do more because governments will not allow them to do so because of the environment that is still created in the bureaucratic, administrative, tax regulatory, and other frameworks that are under government control.Shifting taxes from income to carbon, ending subsidies for fossil fuels, and ending investments in and construction of coal plants by 2020 are all efforts that will benefit from bold and genuine business buy-in and support.The electrification of trucks and buses needs to be accelerated, says a new report released yesterday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).Electric trucks, on the other hand, emit 44% to 79% less emissions than diesel trucks, depending on the type of vehicle. They have zero tailpipe emissions. Further, the ownership costs can be cheaper.Electrifying US trucks would increase national electricity consumption by 13%, yet would reduce the total demand for energy by 71% due to the efficiency of electric vehicles.The UCS study says there are three policies that can accelerate the electrification of trucks and buses:The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has entered the first phase of replacing older diesel school buses with electric or alternative fuel school buses.Florida received a total of $166 million from Volkswagen after the 2015 Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal. Seventy percent, or approximately $116 million, of the $166 million will be spent to replace school, transit, and shuttle buses.School Transportation News writes:Florida will fund a minimum of five and a maximum of 10 school buses per each awarded district. For the first round of replacements… the department is covering 100% of the cost. This is to better understand the entire process of identifying, acquiring, and implementing electric vehicles and their infrastructure.Buses up for replacement must have a 2009 or older diesel engine, and the school district must permanently disable the diesel engine once it’s replaced.School districts will work with utility companies to install charging stations for the buses.Denmark will build one or more artificial islands surrounded by offshore wind turbines with a 10-gigawatt capacity. They will be able to supply power for up to 10 million households. The private-sector-financed park’s capacity would be five times higher than Denmark’s current wind power output, reports the Guardian.Denmark produced 41% of its energy from wind power in 2018, the highest in Europe.Last Friday, Denmark passed an act pledging to cut emissions to 70% of 1990 levels by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.After the act was passed, Danish Climate and Energy Minister Dan Jørgensen said:If we are to realize the the enormous potential of offshore wind, new technologies will have to be developed to convert green power into fuel for aircraft, ships, and industry.We have decided not to aim for what we know to be possible, but what we know to be necessary. Our task is now to make the necessary possible. With the target enshrined in a legally binding climate act, we hope Denmark can inspire other countries to follow suit.Photo: UN News",solar
2019/12/12,"The electrification of trucks and buses needs to be accelerated, says a new report released yesterday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).The UCS report, titled “Ready for Work: Now Is the Time for Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicles,” states that there are currently about 28 million trucks and buses in the US, or 10% of all vehicles. They are responsible for 28% of total carbon emissions in the transportation sector.Electric trucks, on the other hand, emit 44% to 79% less emissions than diesel trucks, depending on the type of vehicle. They have zero tailpipe emissions. Further, the ownership costs can be cheaper.Fuel and maintenance savings can offset the higher upfront costs of heavy-duty electric vehicles, making them cheaper than a diesel or natural gas vehicle over the life of a vehicle.Electrifying US trucks would increase national electricity consumption by 13%, yet would reduce the total demand for energy by 71% due to the efficiency of electric vehicles.Like FedEx and Amazon, UPS is in the process of electrifying their fleet, and in June 2018, Electrek reported that UPS bought 1,000 electric vans from Workhorse.For those who wonder about range, UCS has this to say:The analysis found there are many trucks whose operating characteristics are well-suited for electrification, including those that operate in defined areas and park at central depots where they can be recharged. Two-thirds of U.S. trucks travel 20,000 miles or less each year — an average of 80 miles per day if driven five days per week and 50 weeks per year — well within the operating range of battery electric trucks operating on a single charge.There are more than 70 models from 27 manufacturers of electric trucks and buses available now, or with production announced within the next two years.The UCS study says there are three policies that can accelerate the electrification of trucks and buses, which will improve air quality:Jimmy O’Dea, senior vehicles analyst at UCS and report author, says:Electrifying trucks will require commitment and planning, but it needs to be done because they contribute a large portion of the carbon emissions causing climate change and the diesel pollution that affects people’s health.The technology to electrify trucks exists. Policymakers and business should make commitments today that will enable widespread electrification of trucks tomorrow.This is a no-brainer. Everyone has driven behind heavy-duty trucks and buses on the road, with black diesel smoke spewing out of their tailpipes. That’s when you reach for the recycled air button in your car.And how about kids in school buses, which more often than not have their windows open, breathing in those toxic black clouds?There are a wide range of electric vehicles to choose from. It makes sense, financially and environmentally. So let’s use them, and quickly. The long-term benefits are worth it.Photo: UPS",solar

Cities from all 50 states are represented.Here’s an excerpt from the letter:Accelerating the growth of solar will reduce pollution while revitalizing our communities by creating jobs and keeping energy dollars in our local economies. Expanding solar power helps residents and businesses benefit from lower energy costs while providing more local control of energy and improving our communities’ resilience.With a concerted effort under way on the state and federal levels to limit the growth of solar by fossil fuel special interests, communities like ours across the country need to act quickly to continue our progress toward renewable energy.Mayor Jim Brainard of Carmel, Indiana, said:Renewable energy, such as solar, is a better energy source because we don’t have to pay other countries to get it. Even more importantly, it will help keep our air clean and reduce the cost and suffering of those with lung diseases. In May 2014, the satirical website the Onion published a story titled, “Scientists Politely Remind World That Clean Energy Technology Ready to Go Whenver.” It’s short, so here’s the story in full:CAMBRIDGE, MA — Stating that they just want to make sure it’s something everyone keeps in mind going forward, an international consortium of scientists gently reminded the world Wednesday that clean energy technologies are pretty much ready to go anytime. “We’ve got solar, wind, geothermal — we’re all set to move forward with this stuff whenever everyone else is,” said Dr. Sandra Eakins, adding that researchers are also doing a lot of pretty amazing things with biomass these days. “Again, we’re good to go on this end, so just let us know. You seriously should see these new hydrogen fuel cells we have. Anyway, just say the word, and we’ll start rolling it out.” At press time, representatives from the world’s leading economies had signaled that they would continue to heavily rely on fossil fuels until they had something more than an overwhelming scientific consensus to go on.So here we are, five and a half years later, and this is just as relevant as it was when the Onion published it.

Nucor is partnering with electric utility Evergy, who will power the plant after a 75-megawatt power purchase agreement. The mill will melt recycled scrap into steel rebar for construction.The $250 million plant is expected to open by the end of 2019. It will employ more than 250 people.A wind farm will offset 100% of the mill’s electricity supply. If the mill can’t draw enough power from wind, then it will draw from Southwest Power Pool‘s bulk power grid, which is a mix of green energy and fossil fuels.So, why wind? Simply put, it’s cheaper and cleaner. Evergy senior vice president Chuck Caisley told CNBC, referring to the US Midwest:We sit in the Saudi Arabia of wind.

In Kansas and midwest Missouri we have great wind to meet current and prospective customers with price competitiveness and sustainability. It reduces our environmental footprint in the area and creates jobs.A Philippines Commission on Human Rights panel concluded that fossil fuel firms may be held legally responsible for the impact of their emissions as a significant source of pollution and a cause of climate change.Commissioner Roberto Cadiz announced the panel’s findings during the COP25 international climate talks in Madrid yesterday.The Independent explains:The commission was tasked in 2016 by Greenpeace Southeast Asia and other local environmental groups [to investigate] whether 47 of the world’s biggest fossil fuel firms — including Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, and Total — were violating the rights of Filipino citizens. It held hearings in Manila, New York, and London, where it heard from scientists, lawyers, and people who had suffered from climate-related disasters.Its final report, which has yet to be published, will say that these companies have clear legal and moral responsibilities to act, which includes shifting away from fossil fuels and investing in cleaner energy sources.Meanwhile, New York Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager today rejected New York State’s claim that ExxonMobil misled investors for years by “lying about its use of a ‘proxy cost’ for carbon to account for future climate-change regulations.”Ostrager said that New York attorney general Letitia James “failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that ExxonMobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor.” Further, he said that the attorney general “produced no testimony either from any investor who claimed to have been misled by any disclosure.”Mona Hanna-Attisha is a Michigan State University pediatrician and professor. She is the founder and director of the Pediatric Public Health Initiative.The Washington Post adapted an op-ed from Hanna-Attisha’s House Science Subcommittee congressional testimony, in which she argues that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passing of a rule to limit the types of scientific studies that can be used to create new regulations would undermine its effectiveness.It’s worth reading the entire Post article in full. Hanna-Attisha gives an excellent account of the history of lead in gasoline as a source of pollution from the 1920s onwards, and its detrimental effect on public health.Here’s an excerpt from Hanna-Attisha’s objections to the current pending EPA rule:This rule is nothing less than an industry-driven and government-sanctioned straitjacket of science and scientists.As I know from my work in Flint, Michigan, when the EPA succeeds, people are protected. When the EPA fails, people get sick. When it comes to toxins in our environment or the bodies of children, we need the EPA to be strong, smart, and swift — to act quickly, decisively, and accurately — utilizing the best available science. However, when government regulations are captured by industries craving ever more profit, the cost is, as it always has been, our health and our children’s health.As Electrek has previously reported:Outdoor particulate pollution kills around 4.2 million people worldwide annually, according to the Lancet and the World Health Organization (WHO). Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions.And pollution in the US has gotten worse since 2016, after years of decline.But a new study published this month in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society looks at various continents and concludes that if pollution (particularly from fossil fuels) is reduced, then health improves quickly and significantly.The researchers give the amazing example of the Atlanta Olympics as evidence of their conclusion:In the summer of 1996, the City of Atlanta implemented a 17-day “alternative transportation strategy” involving 24-hour public transportation, additional bus services, telecommuting options, and closure of downtown Atlanta to private automobile traffic. Peak morning traffic decreased by 23%, and peak daily ozone concentrations decreased by 28%. In the next four weeks, there were reductions in children seeking medical care for asthma by 42% based on Medicaid claims and 44% based on health maintenance organization data. There was an 11% decrease in pediatric emergency department visits and a 19% decrease in hospitalizations for asthma.They rightfully assert: “Reducing factors causing air pollution and climate change have strong cobenefits.”Photo: Nucor steel mill, Mike Siegel/Seattle Times",solar
2019/12/09,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.Nevada’s NV Energy is going to add more than 1 GW in solar capacity and nearly half of that in storage in the next four years, according to PV Magazine.Three of NV Energy’s now-approved solar projects — Gemini, Bighorn, and Arrow Canyon — will provide 1,190 MW of solar and 590 MW of battery storage.NV Energy shares that the three projects are being added to meet two renewable generation goals: the recently passed 50% renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) by 2030…  and NV Energy’s own commitment to double its renewable energy.At the end of 2018, NV Energy achieved an overall 24.2% RPS (roughly 3,000 MW). PV Magazine estimates that these three new projects will bring NV Energy to 34% RPS — well on track to meet its 50% goal, “as the company has exceeded Nevada’s current renewable energy requirement for the nine straight years.”Nevada leads the US in solar power potential, according to the US Energy Information Administration.America’s Pledge was founded in July 2017 by US presidential candidate and former UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action Michael Bloomberg and former California governor Jerry Brown.The coalition consists of nearly 4,000 “US states, cities, businesses, communities of faith, universities, healthcare and cultural institutions, and other organizations [that are] are now acting to fulfill America’s climate pledge to the world.” The coalition is in support of the Paris Agreement.They now represent 68% of U.S. GDP, 65% of US population, and 51% of US emissions. If they were a country, these US coalitions would have the world’s second largest economy — second only to the entire United States itself.Today, America’s Pledge released a report at the UN COP25 in Madrid. Titled “Accelerating America’s Pledge: Going All-In to Build a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Economy for the United States,” the report assesses:What would be delivered from expanded actions by states, cities, businesses, and citizens and then layers on a robust, complementary, and ambitious federal policy program after 2020 to form an “All-In” comprehensive American climate strategy.This report illuminates a pathway to a comprehensive and ambitious American climate strategy for 2030, using expanded bottom-up leadership as the foundation of a comprehensive “All-In” climate strategy.You can read the executive summary here and the full report here that explains what America’s Pledge plan is.America’s Pledge is joined by We Are Still In, Beyond Carbon, and the World Wildlife Fund at the US Climate Action Center in Madrid, which is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies.This US coalition has picked up the ball that Trump’s US administration decisively dropped by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and not sending any high-level members of the administration to the UN COP25.Australia’s Econews reports that the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has forecast the price of residential electricity to start falling next year and continue to fall until 2022. The price falls are mostly driven by increasing supplies of green energy.The AEMC predicts further investment in batteries, wind, and solar as an “optimal mix.” No new investment in coal or gas is projected.AEMC chairman John Pierce said:More supply puts downward pressure on prices.But it’s important to note that over a decade of analysis we have seen trends change sharply in response to factors such as sudden generator closures and implementation of new policies.As such, all price projections should be seen as just that, projections.The forecast reflects the addition of nearly 5,000 megawatts (MW) of new green power supply across Australia the country until 2022.Photo: Michael Quine/Las Vegas Review-Journal",solar
2019/12/09,"Today, the America’s Pledge initiative released a report at the 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN COP25) in Madrid that spells out a plan for the US to reduce carbon emissions. America’s Pledge represents 68% of the US GDP and 65% of the US population.Titled, “Accelerating America’s Pledge: Going All-In to Build a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Economy for the United States,” the America’s Pledge report assesses:What would be delivered from expanded actions by states, cities, businesses, and citizens and then layers on a robust, complementary, and ambitious federal policy program after 2020 to form an “All-In” comprehensive American climate strategy.This report illuminates a pathway to a comprehensive and ambitious American climate strategy for 2030, using expanded bottom-up leadership as the foundation of a comprehensive “All-In” climate strategy.The America’s Pledge report has two “high-ambition scenarios for 2030”:The bottom-up scenario: This “projects how much a significant expansion of state, city, and business climate action could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even without federal interventions.”We find that significantly expanded bottom-up action alone could reduce U.S. emissions up to 37% below 2005 levels by 2030… This is in line with the Paris Agreement’s mid-century goals.The All-In scenario: This “projects how much a comprehensive national climate strategy could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, when layered on top of the expanded state, city, and business actions included in the Bottom-Up scenario. New executive branch and congressional actions after 2020 complement the continuing efforts of states, cities, and businesses and fill in the gaps where federal policy is needed or more effective.”We find that combining bottom-up efforts with aggressive federal engagement and legislation after 2020 in a comprehensive All-In strategy could reduce U.S. emissions by 49% below 2005 levels by 2030.The report consists of three principles:You can read the executive summary here and the full report here that details how they’d achieve these three principles.Released today at #COP25, the new #AmericasPledge report underscores the incredible potential of bottom-up action. What’s more: if non-federal action were supported by a climate-forward federal government, we could cut emissions nearly in half by 2030. https://t.co/08plHNdfOw pic.twitter.com/szM3yPZs2T— Bloomberg Philanthropies (@BloombergDotOrg) December 9, 2019America’s Pledge was founded in July 2017 by presidential candidate and former UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action Michael Bloomberg and former California governor Jerry Brown.As Bloomberg and Brown explain in the report:In the two years since President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, nearly 4,000 U.S. cities, states, businesses, and universities have reaffirmed their commitment to helping America drive down emissions and answer the call of the international community to continue leading the global fight against the climate crisis.The America’s Pledge coalition is in support of the Paris Agreement.They now represent 68% of US GDP, 65% of US population, and 51% of US emissions.

Environmental Protection Agency officials were not aware of the collapse until contacted by the Windsor Star on Wednesday.The Windsor Star’s story about the spill is dated Thursday December 5.The site contains nuclear materials because during the Manhattan Project, the plant was used to help construct the atomic bomb. After World War II, uranium rods were constructed there. It is rated high for residual contamination.Canadian member of parliament Brian Masse believes the incident should be investigated by the International Joint Commission and the US and Canadian governments. Masse said:An immediate study should be conducted on the dangers presented to the Detroit waterways and Great Lakes region. Forty million people use the Great Lakes for drinking water, and the ecosystem is already fragile. Any potential threat should be investigated immediately on both sides of the border.Photo: Nick Brancaccio/Windsor StarRenewable Independent Power Producers has officially opened a 1.2-megawatt solar facility near Willow, Alaska, which is north of Anchorage. It is the state’s largest solar farm and is expected to come online this month.The solar farm took two years to build and has more than 3,000 panels. “The farm will sell its energy to the Matanuska Electric Association at wholesale cost,” according to KTVA.The farm is expected to produce enough energy for 200 homes and offset 2 million pounds of carbon dioxide annually. (For perspective, in 2019, the estimated population of Alaska is 735,720.)According to the Associated Press, “The Alaska Energy Authority’s Power Project Fund loan program provided about half of the project’s $1.5 million funding, while the rest came from private capital.”The Wyoming Industrial Siting Council has approved a 277-turbine wind farm on the border of Albany and Carbon counties, according to the Associated Press. (Yes, I think it’s amusing that a wind farm is going into a county called Carbon.)The developer, Canada-headquartered BluEarth Renewables, is required to prioritize locals for jobs, and also provide bonding of $33.1 million for decommissioning and reclamation.The project is expected to employ 400 workers during peak construction in 2022. Construction is estimated to cost around $1 billion. It will take about 19 months to build the wind farm.Australia’s ABC reports that of the country’s more than 9 million homes:The majority rate below three stars for energy efficiency under the Nationwide House Energy Rating System (NatHERS). NatHERS data is not the most comprehensive but it does show that the energy performance of older Australian homes is well below that of newer properties.A zero-star rating means the ‘building shell does practically nothing to reduce the discomfort of hot or cold weather” while 10 stars indicate the “home may not need any artificial cooling or heating to keep you comfortable.’Those residents who suffer the most as a result of a poor NathHERS rating are renters — landlords simply don’t see the benefits. Rental properties are less likely to have insulation, window treatments, and solar panels.In November, 40 housing and charity organizations renewed calls for state and federal governments to require minimum energy efficiency standards for rental properties.In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree this year.Photo: Nadine Shaabana/Unsplash",solar
2019/12/05,"In today’s Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB):The Electrek Green Energy Brief (EGEB): A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy newsWe’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again. Natural gas may not be as toxic as coal, but it is still very much a fossil fuel. And it’s natural gas that’s driving up carbon emissions this year.Authors of the Global Carbon Project attributed this year’s rise in emissions to natural gas and oil growth, which offsets the falls in coal use.According to AFP:“We see clearly that global changes come from fluctuations in coal use,” said Corrine Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, an author on the Carbon [Project] report.“In contrast the use of oil and particularly natural gas is going up unabated. Natural gas is now the biggest contributor to the growth in emissions.”“Compared to coal, natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel, but unabated natural gas use merely cooks the planet more slowly than coal,” said Glen Peters, research director at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research.Yesterday, the Natural Gas Supply Association, a trade association that represents Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Cabot, and Southwestern Energy, unanimously announced that they are in favor of a carbon tax.The Houston Chronicle says the association “broadly supports putting a price on carbon while also eliminating existing regulations on carbon and delivering revenues not to government but directly to American consumers.”If you want an overview of how natural gas is extracted and used, watch this video from Student Energy:The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed to weaken regulations on mercury emissions and fine particulates from coal-fired plants.Six economists said that the EPA’s proposed rollback ignores healthcare costs. Weakening regulations could save coal plants a few billion dollars total, while costing the public tens of billions in healthcare costs.Reuters reports:“Instead of weighing all the costs against all the benefits, the EPA is cherry picking,” said Yale University’s Matthew Kotchen, who released a report on the agency’s proposal with the other economists. “They pulled the biggest public health benefit off the scale.”Several of the authors of the report, including Kotchen, were on the EPA’s Environmental Economics Advisory Committee that was part of the agency’s independent science advisory board for 25 years.The authors are now on the External Environmental Economics Advisory Committee, an independent group that says it provides nonpartisan advice on EPA programs.Germany will close all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2022. But where will the waste go? Or more specifically, where does one store 28,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste for 1 million years?France supports nuclear energy as green energy, but Germany opposes it. This very real quandary might have something to do with that stance. As we previously wrote in Electrek, “Nuclear has no scientific evidence for waste treatment, and that’s why it was not initially included.”Germany decided to close all of its plants after Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011.Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants are currently being stored in containers in temporary storage sites across the country, where they can cool down, which will take decades because they’re so hot.Germany wants to locate a permanent nuclear cemetery that would be at least 1 km underground. The location must be extremely stable geologically — no earthquakes or water flow.Once the storage location is chosen, it will be sealed sometime between 2130 and 2170.Here’s the mind-blower from CNN:Communications experts are already working on how to tell future generations thousands of years from now — when language will be completely different — not to disturb the site.Nate & Hila are, in their words, “a duo of emcees/writers/performers who create ecological, sociological, and philosophical songs, videos, and live shows.” Nate Oglesby’s day job is teaching Latin language and Greek civilization at City College of New York.

2019/12/05,"US and European insurers are now refusing to cover coal, yet the Independent reports that UK banks are still loaning money to finance new coal plants (in addition to many other global banks). Throw in new Energy of Secretary Dan Brouillette’s rather bizarre statement this week that “coal has a bright future,” and it’s apparent that the demise of coal isn’t going to be entirely straightforward.Further, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to weaken regulations on mercury emissions and fine particulates from coal-fired plants. But six economists say the EPA is ignoring the fact that weakening the regulation would cost billions in healthcare.Of the EPA’s proposal to weaken coal-plant regulations that would cut down harmful emissions, Reuters reports:“Instead of weighing all the costs against all the benefits, the EPA is cherry picking,” said Yale University’s Matthew Kotchen, who released a report on the agency’s proposal with the other economists. “They pulled the biggest public health benefit off the scale.”Several of the authors of the report, including Kotchen, were on the EPA’s Environmental Economics Advisory Committee that was part of the agency’s independent science advisory board for 25 years.The authors are now on the External Environmental Economics Advisory Committee, an independent group that says it provides nonpartisan advice on EPA programs.So the scientists feel it’s bad for both the environment and for health. And it looks like the insurance companies are getting the message. Whether it’s because they truly want to fight climate change, or recognize that it’s not good business to insure a dying industry remains unclear, but they’re pulling out.The number of insurers withdrawing cover for coal projects more than doubled in 2019. US companies have joined European companies, leaving Lloyd’s of London and Asian insurers as the holdouts.“Most coal projects cannot be financed, built or operated without insurance,” reports the Guardian.On Monday, the day the UN climate summit launched in Madrid, Insurance Enterprise Risk Management held a conference called Insurance & Climate Risk EMEA 2019 in London. One of the sessions was called, “2019 Scorecard Feedback on Insurance, Coal, and Climate Change.” It was due to cover:Meanwhile, the Independent (being a British paper) named and shamed UK banks who are still lending to coal, with almost £25 billion ($32 billion) going to coal plants. It reports that Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Royal Bank of Scotland provided funding after the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement was adopted.All four of those banks are on the Netherlands-headquartered NGO BankTrack’s 2018 list of private banks who are still lending to coal, and the UK leads in coal bank loans in Europe. The top 6 on that list are all in Asia, with the US’s Citigroup coming in at No. 7. (Click on the link above to see the entire list.) China dominates the underwriting, at 72.6% — although that went from $127.6 billion in 2016 to $66 billion in 2018.Let’s look at this from a purely financial perspective for a minute. Coal plants are shutting down like crazy in the US and Europe, insurance companies are quickly pulling away from insuring them, and scientists have declared that coal costs an absolute fortune in healthcare costs.On the US front, on September 17, Electrek reported that US coal shipments are at its lowest level in 36 years. And on October 29, Electrek reported that the US’s largest private coal company filed for bankruptcy.And yet the world’s private banks — even though the amounts are shrinking — are still lending to a dying industry. It’s a given that it’s terrible for the planet and its people. But how is that smart business?",solar
